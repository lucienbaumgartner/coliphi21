Moreover, the concept has historical\norigins in well known philosophical discussions, most notably\nAristotle’s distinction between the public sphere of political activity\nand the private sphere associated with family and domestic life. Yet\nhistorical use of the term is not uniform, and there remains confusion\nover the meaning, value and scope of the concept of privacy.\n\n\n\nEarly treatises on privacy appeared with the development of privacy\nprotection in American law from the 1890s onward, and privacy\nprotection was justified largely on moral grounds. This literature\nhelps distinguish descriptive accounts of privacy, describing\nwhat is in fact protected as private, from normative accounts\nof privacy defending its value and the extent to which it should be\nprotected. In these discussions some treat privacy as an\ninterest with moral value, while others refer to it as a moral\nor legal right that ought to be protected by society or the\nlaw. Clearly one can be insensitive to another’s privacy interests\nwithout violating any right to privacy, if there is one.\n\n\n\nThere are several skeptical and critical accounts of privacy.\nAccording to one well known argument there is no right to privacy and\nthere is nothing special about privacy, because any interest protected\nas private can be equally well explained and protected by other\ninterests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily\nsecurity (Thomson, 1975). Other critiques argue that privacy interests\nare not distinctive because the personal interests they protect are\neconomically inefficient (Posner, 1981) or that they are not grounded\nin any adequate legal doctrine (Bork, 1990). Finally, there is the\nfeminist critique of privacy, that granting special status to privacy\nis detrimental to women and others because it is used as a shield to\ndominate and control them, silence them, and cover up abuse (MacKinnon,\n1989).\n\n\n\nNevertheless, most theorists take the view that privacy is a\nmeaningful and valuable concept. Philosophical debates concerning\ndefinitions of privacy became prominent in the second half of the\ntwentieth century, and are deeply affected by the development of\nprivacy protection in the law. Some defend privacy as focusing on\ncontrol over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others\ndefend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein,\n1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other\ncommentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied\nand meaningful interpersonal relationships (Fried, 1970, Rachels,\n1975), or as the value that accords us the ability to control the\naccess others have to us (Gavison, 1980; Allen, 1988; Moore, 2003), or\nas a set of norms necessary not only to control access but also to\nenhance personal expression and choice (Schoeman, 1992), or some\ncombination of these (DeCew, 1997). Discussion of the concept is\ncomplicated by the fact that privacy appears to be something we value\nto provide a sphere within which we can be free from interference by\nothers, and yet it also appears to function negatively, as the cloak\nunder which one can hide domination, degradation, or physical harm to\nwomen and others.\n\n\n\nThis essay will discuss all of these topics, namely, (1) the\nhistorical roots of the concept of privacy, including the development\nof privacy protection in tort and constitutional law, and the\nphilosophical responses that privacy is merely reducible to other\ninterests or is a coherent concept with fundamental value, (2) the\ncritiques of privacy as a right, (3) the wide array of philosophical\ndefinitions or defenses of privacy as a concept, providing alternative\nviews on the meaning and value of privacy (and whether or not it is\nculturally relative), as well as (4) the challenges to privacy posed\nin an age of technological advance. Overall, most writers defend the\nvalue of privacy protection despite the difficulties inherent in its\ndefinition and its potential use to shield abuse. A contemporary\ncollection of essays on privacy provides strong evidence to support\nthis point (Paul et al., 2000). The contributing authors\nexamine various aspects of the right to privacy and its role in moral\nphilosophy, legal theory, and public policy. They also address\njustifications and foundational arguments for privacy rights.\n\n\n\nAristotle’s distinction between the public sphere of politics and\npolitical activity, the polis, and the private or domestic\nsphere of the family, the oikos, as two distinct spheres of\nlife, is a classic reference to a private domain. The public/private\ndistinction is also sometimes taken to refer to the appropriate realm\nof governmental authority as opposed to the realm reserved for\nself-regulation, along the lines described by John Stuart Mill in his\nessay, On Liberty. Furthermore, the distinction arises again\nin Locke’s discussion of property in his Second Treatise on\nGovernment. In the state of nature all the world’s bounty is held\nin common and is in that sense public. But one possesses oneself and\none’s own body, and one can also acquire property by mixing one’s labor\nwith it, and in these cases it is one’s private property. Margaret Mead\nand other anthropologists have demonstrated the ways various cultures\nprotect privacy through concealment, seclusion or by restricting access\nto secret ceremonies (Mead, 1949). Alan Westin (1967) has surveyed\nstudies of animals demonstrating that a desire for privacy is not\nrestricted to humans. However, what is termed private in these multiple\ncontexts varies. Privacy can refer to a sphere separate from\ngovernment, a domain inappropriate for governmental interference,\nforbidden views and knowledge, solitude, or restricted access, to list\njust a few. \n\nMore systematic written discussion of the concept of privacy is often\nsaid to begin with the famous essay by Samuel Warren and Louis\nBrandeis titled “The Right to Privacy” (Warren and\nBrandeis, 1890). Citing “political, social, and economic\nchanges” and a recognition of “the right to be let\nalone” they argued that existing law afforded a way to protect\nthe privacy of the individual, and they sought to explain the nature\nand extent of that protection. Focusing in large part on the press and\npublicity allowed by recent inventions such as photography and\nnewspapers, but referring as well to violations in other contexts,\nthey emphasized the invasion of privacy brought about by public\ndissemination of details relating to a person’s private life. Warren\nand Brandeis felt a variety of existing cases could be protected under\na more general right to privacy which would protect the extent to\nwhich one’s thoughts, sentiments, and emotions could be shared with\nothers.  Urging that they were not attempting to protect the items\nproduced, or intellectual property, but rather the peace of mind\nattained with such protection, they said the right to privacy was\nbased on a principle of “inviolate personality” which was\npart of a general right of immunity of the person, “the right to\none’s personality” (Warren and Brandeis 1890, 195, 215). The\nprivacy principle, they believed, was already part of common law and\nthe protection of one’s home as one’s castle, but new technology made\nit important to explicitly and separately recognize this protection\nunder the name of privacy. They suggested that limitations of the\nright could be determined by analogy with the law of slander and\nlibel, and would not prevent publication of information about public\nofficials running for office, for example. Warren and Brandeis thus\nlaid the foundation for a concept of privacy that has come to be known\nas control over information about oneself. \n\nAlthough the first cases after the publication of their paper did\nnot recognize a privacy right, soon the public and both state and\nfederal courts were endorsing and expanding the right to privacy. In an\nattempt to systematize and more clearly describe and define the new\nright of privacy being upheld in tort law, William Prosser wrote in\n1960 that what had emerged were four different interests in privacy.\nNot claiming to be providing an exact definition, and admitting that\nthere had been confusion and inconsistencies in the development of\nprivacy protection in the law, Prosser nevertheless described the four\n“rather definite” privacy rights as follows: \n\nProsser noted that the intrusion in the first privacy right had\nexpanded beyond physical intrusion, and pointed out that Warren and\nBrandeis had been concerned primarily with the second privacy right.\nNevertheless, Prosser felt that both real abuses and public demand had\nled to general acceptance of these four types of privacy invasions. On\nhis view, answers to three main questions were at the time as yet\nunclear: (i) whether appearance in public implied forfeiture of\nprivacy, (ii) whether facts part of a “public record”\ncould still be private, and (iii) whether a significant lapse of time\naffected the privacy of revelations. Note that Warren and Brandeis\nwere writing their normative views about what they felt should be\nprotected under the rubric of privacy, whereas Prosser was describing\nwhat courts had in fact protected in the 70 years following\npublication of the Warren and Brandeis paper. Thus it is not\nsurprising that their descriptions of privacy differ. Because the\nSupreme Court has been explicit in ruling that privacy is a central\nreason for Fourth Amendment protection, privacy as control over\ninformation about oneself has come to be viewed by many as also\nincluding protection against unwarranted searches, eavesdropping,\nsurveillance, and appropriation and misuses of one’s\ncommunications.  Thomas Nagel (2002) gives a more contemporary\ndiscussion of privacy, concealment, publicity and exposure. \n\nDespite the well-established protection of tort privacy to control\ninformation about oneself in the courts, and the almost universal\nacceptance of the value of informational privacy by philosophers and\nthe populace, Abraham L. Newman (2008) and others have persuasively\nargued that the United States (US), and multiple countries in Asia, has\ndeveloped a limited system of privacy protection that focuses on\nself-regulation within industry and government so that personal\ninformation is often readily available. In contrast, the European\nUnion (EU) and others have adopted an alternative vision highlighting\nconsumer protection and individual privacy against the economic\ninterests of firms and public officials. This latter model\ndeveloped from comprehensive rules about data privacy enacted in the\nEU’s Data Protection Directive in 1995, now adopted in some form\nby all 27 EU nations. European-style privacy protection\nregulations have spread rapidly across the industrial world, with the\nUnited States as a major exception, and have transformed and led the\nglobal privacy debate, while the US has relied on a more laissez-faire\nmentality about protection of personal information and a patchwork of\nprivacy guidelines. This patchwork includes privacy regulations\non student records, video rentals, the Children’s Online Privacy\nProtection Act (COPPA, 2000), the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPPA, 2006) and more.  \n\nThe European Union empowered individual privacy commissioners or\ngroup agencies that had technical expertise, were given governmental\nauthority, and were able to form political coalitions to lobby\nsuccessfully for enhanced individual privacy protection, requiring that\npersonal information not be collected or used for purposes other than\nthose initially intended without individual consent, and so on.\nThis contrasts sharply with the American approach allowing entities\nsuch as insurance companies and employers ample access to personal\ninformation not covered by the separate privacy guidelines, given a\nlack of governmental support for more comprehensive privacy legislation\nand a more fragmented political system. The US has generally\nstood behind efficiency arguments that business and government need\nunfettered access to personal data to guarantee economic growth and\nnational security, whereas the EU has sent a coherent signal that\nprivacy has critical value in a robust information society because\ncitizens will only participate in an online environment if they feel\ntheir privacy is guaranteed against ubiquitous business and government\nsurveillance. \n\nIn 1965 a quite different right to privacy, independent of\ninformational privacy and the Fourth Amendment, was recognized\nexplicitly by the Supreme Court. It is now commonly called the\nconstitutional right to privacy. The right was first announced in the\nGriswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479) case, which overturned\nconvictions of the Director of Planned Parenthood and a doctor at Yale\nMedical School for dispersing contraceptive related information,\ninstruction, and medical advice to married persons. The constitutional\nright to privacy was described by Justice William O. Douglas as\nprotecting a zone of privacy covering the social institution of\nmarriage and the sexual relations of married persons. Despite\ncontroversy over Douglas’ opinion, the constitutional privacy right\nwas soon cited to overturn a ban against interracial marriage, to\nallow individuals to possess obscene matter in their own homes, and to\nallow distribution of contraceptive devices to individuals, both\nmarried and single. The most famous application of this right to\nprivacy was as one justification of abortion rights defended in 1973\nin Roe v.  Wade (410 U.S. 113) and subsequent decisions on\nabortion. While Douglas vaguely called it a “penumbral”\nright “emanating” from the Constitution, and the Court has\nbeen unable to clearly define the right, it has generally been viewed\nas a right protecting one’s individual interest in independence in\nmaking certain important and personal decisions about one’s family,\nlife and lifestyle. Which personal decisions have been protected by\nthis privacy right has varied depending on the makeup of the Court. In\n1986 in\nBowers v. Hardwick (478 U.S. 186) privacy was not held to\ncover a ban on anti-sodomy laws in Georgia, despite the intimate sexual\nrelations involved. \n\nCriticism of the constitutional right to privacy has continued,\nparticularly in the popular press, Roe v. Wade may be in\njeopardy, and many viewed the Bowers decision as evidence of\nthe demise of the constitutional right to privacy.  Yet in 2003 in\nLawrence v. Texas (538 U.S. 918), the Supreme Court ruled\n5–4 that a Texas statute making it a crime for two people of the\nsame sex to engage in certain intimate behavior violated the guarantee\nof equal protection and vital interests in liberty and privacy\nprotected by the due process clause of the Constitution, thus\noverruling Bowers v. Hardwick.  Jean L. Cohen (2002) gives a\ntheoretical defense of this inclusive view of the constitutional right\nto privacy.  She defends a constructivist approach to privacy rights\nand intimacy, arguing that privacy rights protect personal autonomy\nand that a constitutionally protected right to privacy is\nindispensable for a modern conception of reason and her interpretation\nof autonomy.  Currently many non U.S. countries protect interests in\nwhat is now called constitutional privacy, without the controversy\nthat is somewhat more common in the U.S. For example, constitutional\nprivacy has been used in the U.S. to strike down anti-sodomy laws, and\nto protect individual choice of one’s marriage partner. In\nEurope many countries now protect same sex marriage, such as the\nNetherlands for over 10 years and more recently Germany since\n2017. \n\nOne way of understanding the growing literature on privacy is to\nview it as divided into two main categories, which we may call\nreductionism and coherentism. Reductionists are\ngenerally critical of privacy, while coherentists defend the coherent\nfundamental value of privacy interests. Ferdinand Schoeman (1984)\nintroduced somewhat different terminology which makes it easier to\nunderstand this distinction. According to Schoeman, a number of\nauthors have believed \n\nTheorists who deny both the coherence thesis and the distinctiveness\nthesis argue that in each category of privacy claims there are diverse\nvalues at stake of the sort common to many other social issues and that\nthese values exhaust privacy claims. The thrust of this complex\nposition is that we could do quite well if we eliminated all talk of\nprivacy and simply defended our concerns in terms of standard moral and\nlegal categories (Schoeman 1984, 5). \n\nThese latter theorists, who reject both Schoeman’s coherence thesis\nand distinctiveness thesis, may be referred to as\nreductionists, for they view what are called privacy concerns\nas analyzable or reducible to claims of other sorts, such as infliction\nof emotional distress or property interests. They deny that there is\nanything useful in considering privacy as a separate concept. They\nconclude, then, that there is nothing coherent, distinctive or\nilluminating about privacy interests. \n\nOn the other side, more theorists have argued that there is\nsomething fundamental and distinctive and coherent about the various\nclaims that have been called privacy interests. On this view, privacy\nhas value as a coherent and fundamental concept, and most individuals\nrecognize it as a useful concept as well. Those who endorse this view\nmay be called coherentists. Nevertheless, it is important to\nrecognize that coherentists have quite diverse, and sometimes\noverlapping, views on what it is that is distinctive about privacy and\nwhat links diverse privacy claims. \n\nProbably the most famous reductionist view of privacy is one from\nJudith Jarvis Thomson (1975). Noting that there is little agreement on\nwhat privacy is, Thomson examines a number of cases that have been\nthought to be violations of the right to privacy. On closer\ninspection, however, Thomson believes all those cases can be\nadequately and equally well explained in terms of violations of\nproperty rights or rights over the person, such as a right not to be\nlistened to. Ultimately the right to privacy, on Thomson’s view,\nis merely a cluster of rights. Those rights in the cluster are always\noverlapped by, and can be fully explained by, property rights or\nrights to bodily security. The right to privacy, on her view, is\n“derivative” in the sense that there is no need to find\nwhat is common in the cluster of privacy rights. Privacy is derivative\nin its importance and justification, according to Thomson, as any\nprivacy violation is better understood as the violation of a more\nbasic right. Numerous commentators provide strong arguments against\nThomson’s critique (Scanlon, 1975; Inness, 1992). \n\nRichard Posner (1981) also presents a critical account of privacy,\narguing that the kinds of interests protected under privacy are not\ndistinctive. Moreover, his account is unique because he argues that\nprivacy is protected in ways that are economically inefficient. With\nrespect to information, on Posner’s view privacy should only be\nprotected when access to the information would reduce its value (e.g.\nallowing students access to their letters of recommendation make those\nletters less reliable and thus less valuable, and hence they should\nremain confidential or private). Focusing on privacy as control over\ninformation about oneself, Posner argues that concealment or selective\ndisclosure of information is usually to mislead or manipulate others,\nor for private economic gain, and thus protection of individual privacy\nis less defensible than others have thought because it does not\nmaximize wealth. In sum, Posner defends organizational or corporate\nprivacy as more important than personal privacy, because the former is\nlikely to enhance the economy. \n\nAnother strong critic of privacy is Robert Bork (1990), whose\ncriticism is aimed at the constitutional right to privacy established\nby the Supreme Court in 1965. Bork views the Griswold v.\nConnecticut decision as an attempt by the Supreme Court to take a\nside on a social and cultural issue, and as an example of bad\nconstitutional law. Bork’s attack is focused on Justice William\nO.  Douglas and his majority opinion\nin Griswold. Bork’s major point is that Douglas did not\nderive the right to privacy from some pre-existing right or from\nnatural law, but merely created a new right to privacy with no\nfoundation in the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  Bork is correct\nthat the word “privacy” never appears in those\ndocuments. Douglas had argued, however, that the right to privacy\ncould be seen to be based on guarantees from the First, Third, Fourth,\nFifth, and Ninth Amendments. Taken together, the protections afforded\nby these Amendments showed that a basic zone of privacy was protected\nfor citizens, and that it covered their ability to make personal\ndecisions about their home and family life. In contrast, Bork argues\ni) that none of the Amendments cited covered the case before the\nCourt, ii) that the Supreme Court never articulated or clarified what\nthe right to privacy was or how far it extended, and he charges iii)\nthat the privacy right merely protected what a majority of justices\npersonally wanted it to cover. In sum, he accuses Douglas and the\nCourt majority of inventing a new right, and thus overstepping their\nbounds as judges by making new law, not interpreting the law.\nBork’s views continue to be defended by others, in politics and\nin the popular press. \n\nTheorists including William Parent (1983) and Judith Thomson (1975)\nargue that the constitutional right to privacy is not really a privacy\nright, but is more aptly described as a right to liberty. Other\ncommentators believe, to the contrary, that even if Douglas’ opinion is\nflawed in its defense, using vague language about a penumbral privacy\nright emanating from the Constitution and its Amendments, there is\nnevertheless a historically and conceptually coherent notion of\nprivacy, distinct from liberty, carved out by the constitutional\nprivacy cases (Inness, 1992; Schoeman, 1992; Johnson, 1994; DeCew,\n1997). \n\nIn response to Bork’s complaint that constitutional privacy\nprotection is not at all about privacy but only concerns liberty or\nautonomy, it has been successfully argued that while we have multiple\nindividual liberties such as freedom of expression, many do not seem to\nbe about anything particularly personal or related to the types of\nconcerns we might be willing and able to see as privacy issues.\nIf so, then liberty is a broader concept than privacy and privacy\nissues and claims are a subset of claims to liberty. In support\nof this view, philosophical and legal commentators have urged that\nprivacy protects liberty, and that privacy protection gains for us the\nfreedom to define ourselves and our relations to others (Allen, 2011;\nDeCew, 1997; Reiman, 1976, 2004; Schoeman, 1984, 1992). \n\nA moving account supporting this view—understanding privacy as a\nnecessary and an indispensable condition for freedom—comes from\nliterature, here a quotation from Milan Kundera. \n\nIt is not difficult to see the analogies between Kundera’s\nscenario and electronic surveillance and street cameras common in\nsociety today. There is more detailed evidence that privacy and\nliberty are distinct concepts, that liberty is a broader notion, and\nthat privacy is essential for protecting liberty. We have many\nforms of liberty that do not appear to have anything to do with what we\nmight value as private and inappropriate for government intervention\nfor personal reasons. The right to travel from state to state\nwithout a passport, for example, seems to be a freedom far different\nfrom freedom to make decisions about personal and intimate concerns\nabout one’s body – such as contraception use, abortion\nchoice, sterilization (Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 1927) and\nvasectomies (Skinner v, Oklahoma 316 U.S. 535, 1942, striking\ndown a statute mandating sterilizations for those who commit three\nfelonies). It is clear that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized\nthis by saying that the constitutional privacy cases are about a second\ninterest in privacy, namely an “individual interest in making\ncertain kinds of important decisions” (Whalen v. Roe,\n429 U.S. 589, 1977). \n\nThere is no single version of the feminist critique of privacy, yet it\ncan be said in general that many feminists worry about the darker side\nof privacy, and the use of privacy as a shield to cover up domination,\ndegradation and abuse of women and others. Many tend to focus on the\nprivate as opposed to the public, rather than merely informational or\nconstitutional privacy. If distinguishing public and private realms\nleaves the private domain free from any scrutiny, then these feminists\nsuch as Catharine MacKinnon (1989) are correct that privacy can be\ndangerous for women when it is used to cover up repression and\nphysical harm to them by perpetuating the subjection of women in the\ndomestic sphere and encouraging nonintervention by the state. Jean\nBethke Elshtain (1981, 1995) and others suggest that it appears\nfeminists such as MacKinnon are for this reason rejecting the\npublic/private split, and are, moreover, recommending that feminists\nand others jettison or abandon privacy altogether. But, Elshtain\npoints out, this alternative seems too extreme. \n\nA more reasonable view, according to Anita Allen (1988), is to\nrecognize that while privacy can be a shield for abuse, it is\nunacceptable to reject privacy completely based on harm done in\nprivate. A total rejection of privacy makes everything public, and\nleaves the domestic sphere open to complete scrutiny and intrusion by\nthe state. Yet women surely have an interest in privacy that can\nprotect them from state imposed sterilization programs or government\nimposed drug tests for pregnant women mandating results sent to police,\nfor instance, and that can provide reasonable regulations such as\ngranting rights against marital rape. Thus collapsing the\npublic/private dichotomy into a single public realm is inadequate. What\npuzzles feminists is how to make sense of an important and valuable\nnotion of privacy that provides them a realm free from scrutiny and\nintervention by the state, without reverting to the traditional\npublic/private dichotomy that has in the past relegated women to the\nprivate and domestic sphere where they are victims of abuse and\nsubjection. The challenge is to find a way for the state to take very\nseriously the domestic abuse that used to be allowed in the name of\nprivacy, while also preventing the state from insinuating itself into\nall the most intimate parts of women’s lives. This means drawing new\nboundaries for justified state intervention and thus understanding the\npublic/private distinction in new ways. \n\nNarrow views of privacy focusing on control over information about\noneself that were defended by Warren and Brandeis and by William\nProsser are also endorsed by more recent commentators including Fried\n(1970) and Parent (1983). In addition, Alan Westin describes privacy\nas the ability to determine for ourselves when, how, and to what\nextent information about us is communicated to others (Westin,\n1967). Perhaps the best example of a contemporary defense of this view\nis put forth by William Parent. Parent explains that he proposes to\ndefend a view of privacy that is consistent with ordinary language and\ndoes not overlap or confuse the basic meanings of other fundamental\nterms. He defines privacy as the condition of not having undocumented\npersonal information known or possessed by others. Parent stresses\nthat he is defining the condition of privacy, as a moral value for\npeople who prize individuality and freedom, and not a moral or legal\nright to privacy. Personal information is characterized by Parent as\nfactual (otherwise it would be covered by libel, slander or\ndefamation), and these are facts that most persons choose not to\nreveal about themselves, such as facts about health, salary, weight,\nsexual orientation, etc. Personal information is documented, on\nParent’s view, only when it belongs to the public record, that is, in\nnewspapers, court records, or other public documents. Thus, once\ninformation becomes part of a public record, there is no privacy\ninvasion in future releases of the information, even years later or to\na wide audience, nor does snooping or surveillance intrude on privacy\nif no undocumented information is gained. In cases where no new\ninformation is acquired, Parent views the intrusion as irrelevant to\nprivacy, and better understood as an abridgment of anonymity,\ntrespass, or harassment.  Furthermore, what has been described above\nas the constitutional right to privacy, is viewed by Parent as better\nunderstood as an interest in liberty, not privacy. In sum, there is a\nloss of privacy on Parent’s view, only when others acquire\nundocumented personal information about an individual. DeCew (1997)\ngives a detailed critique of Parent’s position. Although Parent’s\ndefinition is valuable because he does view privacy as a coherent\nconcept with unique and fundamental value, it is problematic for\nseveral reasons.  It is too narrow an account because he only allows\nfor a descriptive and not a normative use of the term. As another\nexample, if personal information is part of the public record, even\nthe most insidious snooping to attain it does not constitute a privacy\ninvasion. DeCew (1997) and Scanlon (1975, 317) discuss other\ndifficulties with Parent’s view as well. \n\nIn an article written mainly as a defense of Warren and Brandeis’\npaper and as a response to William Prosser, Edward J. Bloustein (1964)\nargues that there is a common thread in the diverse legal cases\nprotecting privacy. According to Bloustein, Warren and Brandeis failed\nto give a positive description of privacy, however they were correct\nthat there was a single value connecting the privacy interests, a\nvalue they called “inviolate personality.” On Bloustein’s\nview it is possible to give a general theory of individual privacy\nthat reconciles its divergent strands, and “inviolate\npersonality” is the social value protected by privacy. It\ndefines one’s essence as a human being and it includes individual\ndignity and integrity, personal autonomy and independence. Respect for\nthese values is what grounds and unifies the concept of\nprivacy. Discussing each of Prosser’s four types of privacy rights in\nturn, Bloustein defends the view that each of these privacy rights is\nimportant because it protects against intrusions demeaning to\npersonality and against affronts to human dignity. Using this\nanalysis, Bloustein explicitly links the privacy rights in tort law\ndescribed by Prosser with privacy protection under the Fourth\nAmendment. He urges that both leave an individual open to scrutiny in\na way that leaves one’s autonomy and sense of oneself as a person\nvulnerable, violating one’s human dignity and moral personality. The\ncommon conceptual thread linking diverse privacy cases prohibiting\ndissemination of confidential information, eavesdropping,\nsurveillance, and wiretapping, to name a few, is the value of\nprotection against injury to individual freedom and human dignity.\nInvasion of privacy is best understood, in sum, as affront to human\ndignity. Although Bloustein admits the terms are somewhat vague, he\ndefends this analysis as conceptually coherent and illuminating. \n\nA more common view has been to argue that privacy and intimacy are\ndeeply related. On one account, privacy is valuable because intimacy\nwould be impossible without it (Fried, 1970; Gerety 1977; Gerstein,\n1978; Cohen, 2002). Fried, for example, defines privacy narrowly as\ncontrol over information about oneself. He extends this definition,\nhowever, arguing that privacy has intrinsic value, and is necessarily\nrelated to and fundamental for one’s development as an individual with\na moral and social personality able to form intimate relationships\ninvolving respect, love, friendship and trust. Privacy is valuable\nbecause it allows one control over information about oneself, which\nallows one to maintain varying degrees of intimacy. Indeed, love,\nfriendship and trust are only possible if persons enjoy privacy and\naccord it to each other. Privacy is essential for such relationships\non Fried’s view, and this helps explain why a threat to privacy is a\nthreat to our very integrity as persons. By characterizing privacy as\na necessary context for love, friendship and trust, Fried is basing\nhis account on a moral conception of persons and their personalities,\non a Kantian notion of the person with basic rights and the need to\ndefine and pursue one’s own values free from the impingement of\nothers. Privacy allows one the freedom to define one’s relations with\nothers and to define oneself. In this way, privacy is also closely\nconnected with respect and self respect. \n\nGerstein (1978) argues as well that privacy is necessary for\nintimacy, and intimacy in communication and interpersonal relationships\nis required for us to fully experience our lives. Intimacy without\nintrusion or observation is required for us to have experiences with\nspontaneity and without shame. Shoeman (1984) endorses these views and\nstresses that privacy provides a way to control intimate information\nabout oneself and that has many other benefits, not only for\nrelationships with others, but also for the development of one’s\npersonality and inner self. Julie Inness (1992) has identified intimacy\nas the defining feature of intrusions properly called privacy\ninvasions. Inness argues that intimacy is based not on behavior, but on\nmotivation. She believes that intimate information or activity is\nthat which draws its meaning from love, liking, or care. It is privacy\nthat protects one’s ability to retain intimate information and activity\nso that one can fulfill one’s needs of loving and caring. \n\nA number of commentators defend views of privacy that link closely\nwith accounts stressing privacy as required for intimacy, emphasizing\nnot just intimacy but also more generally the importance of developing\ndiverse interpersonal relationships with others. Rachels (1975)\nacknowledges there is no single answer to the question why privacy is\nimportant to us, because it can be necessary to protect one’s assets\nor interests, or to protect one from embarrassment, or to protect one\nagainst the deleterious consequences of information leaks, to name\njust a few. Nevertheless, he explicitly criticizes Thomson’s\nreductionist view, and urges that privacy is a distinctive right. On\nhis view, privacy is necessary to maintain a variety of social\nrelationships, not just intimate ones. Privacy accords us the ability\nto control who knows what about us and who has access to us, and\nthereby allows us to vary our behavior with different people so that\nwe may maintain and control our various social relationships, many of\nwhich will not be intimate. An intriguing part of Rachels’ analysis of\nprivacy is that it emphasizes ways in which privacy is not merely\nlimited to control over information. Our ability to control both\ninformation and access to us allows us to control our relationships\nwith others. Hence privacy is also connected to our behavior and\nactivities. \n\nAnother group of theorists characterize privacy in terms of access.\nSome commentators describe privacy as exclusive access of a person to\na realm of his or her own, and Sissela Bok (1982) argues that privacy\nprotects us from unwanted access by others — either physical\naccess or personal information or attention. Ruth Gavison (1980)\ndefends this more expansive view of privacy in greater detail, arguing\nthat interests in privacy are related to concerns over accessibility\nto others, that is, what others know about us, the extent to which\nthey have physical access to us, and the extent to which we are the\nsubject of the attention of others. Thus the concept of privacy is\nbest understood as a concern for limited accessibility and one has\nperfect privacy when one is completely inaccessible to others. Privacy\ncan be gained in three independent but interrelated ways: through\nsecrecy, when no one has information about one, through anonymity,\nwhen no one pays attention to one, and through solitude, when no one\nhas physical access to one. Gavison’s view is that the concept of\nprivacy is this complex of concepts all part of the notion of\naccessibility.  Furthermore, the concept is also coherent because of\nthe related functions privacy has, namely “the promotion of\nliberty, autonomy, selfhood, human relations, and furthering the\nexistence of a free society” (Gavison 1980, 347). \n\nCarefully reviewing these various views, Anita Allen (1988) also\ncharacterizes privacy as denoting a degree of inaccessibility of\npersons, their mental states, and information about them to the senses\nand surveillance of others. She views seclusion, solitude, secrecy,\nconfidentiality, and anonymity as forms of privacy. She also urges that\nprivacy is required by the liberal ideals of personhood, and the\nparticipation of citizens as equals. While her view appears to be\nsimilar to Gavison’s, Allen suggests her restricted access view is\nbroader than Gavison’s. This is in part because Allen emphasizes that\nin public and private women experience privacy losses that are unique\nto their gender. Noting that privacy is neither a presumptive moral\nevil nor an unquestionable moral good, Allen nevertheless defends more\nextensive privacy protection for women in morality and the law. Using\nexamples such as sexual harassment, victim anonymity in rape cases, and\nreproductive freedom, Allen emphasizes the moral significance of\nextending privacy protection for women. In some ways her account can be\nviewed as one reply to the feminist critique of privacy, allowing that\nprivacy can be a shield for abuse, but can also be so valuable for\nwomen that privacy protection should be enhanced, not diminished. \n\nMost recently, Adam Moore (2003), building on the views of Gavison,\nAllen and others, offers a “control over access” account\nof privacy. According to Moore, privacy is a culturally and species\nrelative right to a level of control over access to bodies or places\nand information. While defending the view that privacy is relative to\nspecies and culture, Moore argues that privacy is objectively valuable\n— human beings that do not obtain a certain level of control\nover access will suffer in various ways.  Moore claims that privacy,\nlike education, health, and maintaining social relationships, is an\nessential part of human flourishing or well-being. \n\nThere is a further issue that has generated disagreement, even among\nthose theorists who believe privacy is a coherent concept. The\nquestion is whether or not the constitutional right to privacy, and\nthe constitutional privacy cases described involving personal\ndecisions about lifestyle and family including birth control,\ninterracial marriage, viewing pornography at home, abortion, and so\non, delineate a genuine category of privacy issues, or merely raise\nquestions about liberty of some sort. Parent (1983) explicitly\nexcludes concerns about one’s ability to make certain important\npersonal decisions about one’s family and lifestyle as genuine privacy\nissues, saying the constitutional right to privacy cases focus solely\non liberty. Among the others who take this view are Henkin (1974),\nThomson (1975), Gavison (1980), and Bork (1990). Allen (1988) defines\nprivacy in terms of access and excludes from her definition protection\nof individual autonomous choice from governmental interference, which\nshe terms a form of liberty. Yet she refers to this latter protection\nas “decisional privacy” and says determining its category\nis purely a definitional point and one of labels. Ultimately she\nbelieves interference with decisions involving procreation and\nsexuality raise the same moral concerns as other privacy intrusions,\noffending the values of personhood. The Supreme Court now claims\n(Whalen v.  Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 1977) that there are two\ndifferent dimensions to privacy: both control over information about\noneself and control over one’s ability to make certain important types\nof decisions. \n\nFollowing this sort of reasoning, a number of theorists defend the\nview that privacy has broad scope, inclusive of the multiple types of\nprivacy issues described by the Court, even though there is no simple\ndefinition of privacy. Most of these theorists explore the links\nbetween the types of privacy interests and the similarity of reasons\nfor valuing each. Some stress that privacy is necessary for one to\ndevelop a concept of self as a purposeful, self determining agent.\nPrivacy enables control over personal information as well as control\nover our bodies and personal choices for our concept of self (Kupfer,\n1987). Some emphasize the importance of intimacy for all privacy\nissues, noting the need for privacy to protect intimate information\nabout oneself, access to oneself, as well as intimate relationships\nand decisions about one’s actions (Inness, 1992). Some focus on the\nimportance of privacy norms that allow one to restrict others’ access\nto them as well as privacy norms that enable and enhance personal\nexpression and the development of relationships. Privacy provides\nprotection against overreaching social control by others through their\naccess to information or their control over decision making (Schoeman,\n1992). Some defend a “control over access” account of\nprivacy that includes control over access to bodies as part of the\nconcept of privacy along with access to places and information (Moore,\n2003). Others suggest that privacy is best understood as a cluster\nconcept covering interests in i) control over information about\noneself, ii) control over access to oneself, both physical and mental,\nand iii) control over one’s ability to make important decisions about\nfamily and lifestyle in order to be self expressive and to develop\nvaried relationships (DeCew, 1997). These three interests are related\nbecause in each of the three contexts threats of information leaks,\nthreats of control over our bodies, and threats to our power to make\nour own choices about our lifestyles and activities all make us\nvulnerable and fearful that we are being scrutinized, pressured or\ntaken advantage of by others. Privacy has moral value because it\nshields us in all three contexts by providing certain freedom and\nindependence — freedom from scrutiny, prejudice, pressure to\nconform, exploitation, and the judgment of others. \n\nYet it has been difficult for philosophers to provide clear\nguidelines on the positive side of understanding just what privacy\nprotects and why it is important. There has been consensus that\nthe significance of privacy is almost always justified for the\nindividual interests it protects: personal information, personal\nspaces, and personal choices, protection of freedom and autonomy in a\nliberal democratic society. (Allen, 2011; Moore, 2010; Reiman 2004;\nRoessler, 2005). Schoeman (1992) eloquently defended the\nimportance of privacy for protection of self-expression and social\nfreedom. More recent literature has extended this view and has\nfocused on the value of privacy not merely for the individual interests\nit protects, but also for its irreducibly social value. Concerns\nover the accessibility and retention of electronic communications and\nthe expansion of camera surveillance have led commentators to focus\nattention on loss of individual privacy as well as privacy protection\nwith respect to the state and society (Reiman, 2004; Solove, 2008;\nNissenbaum, 2010). \n\nPriscilla Regan writes, for example, “I argue that privacy is\nnot only of value to the individual, but also to society in\ngeneral…..Privacy is a common value in that all\nindividuals value some degree of privacy and have some common\nperceptions about privacy. Privacy is also a public value in\nthat it has value not just to the individual as an individual or to\nall individuals in common but also to the democratic political\nsystem. Privacy is rapidly becoming a collective value in\nthat technology and market forces are making it hard for any one\nperson to have privacy without all persons having a similar minimum\nlevel of privacy” (Regan, 1995, 213). According to Daniel\nSolove, “By understanding privacy as shaped by the norms of\nsociety, we can better see why privacy should not be understood solely\nas an individual right…. Instead, privacy protects the\nindividual because of the benefits it confers on society.”\nMoreover, “the value of privacy should be understood in terms of\nits contribution to society” (Solove, 2008, 98, 171fn.). Solove\nbelieves privacy fosters and encourages the moral autonomy of\ncitizens, a central requirement of governance in a democracy. One way\nof understanding these comments, that privacy not only has intrinsic\nand extrinsic value to individuals but also has instrumental value to\nsociety, is to recognize that these views develop from the earlier\nphilosophical writings (Fried 1970; Rachels, 1975; Schoeman; 1984,\n1992) on the value of privacy in that it heightens respect for\nindividual autonomy in decision-making for self-development and\nindividual integrity and human dignity, but also enhances the value of\nprivacy in various social roles and relationships that contribute to a\nfunctioning society. According to this contemporary scholarship,\nprivacy norms help regulate social relationships such as intimate\nrelations, family relationships, professional relationships including\nthose between a physician and a patient, a lawyer or accountant and a\nclient, a teacher and a student, and so on. Thus privacy enhances\nsocial interaction on a variety of levels. According to Solove, a\nsociety without respect for privacy for oneself and others becomes a\n“suffocating society” (Solove 2008; see also Kundera,\n1984). \n\nSchoeman (1984) points out that the question of whether or not privacy\nis culturally relative can be interpreted in two ways. One question is\nwhether privacy is deemed valuable to all peoples or whether its value\nis relative to cultural differences. A second question is whether or\nnot there are any aspects of life that are inherently private and not\njust conventionally so. Most writers have come to agree that while\nalmost all cultures appear to value privacy, cultures differ in their\nways of seeking and obtaining privacy, and probably do differ in the\nlevel they value privacy (Westin, 1967; Rachels, 1975). Allen (1988)\nand Moore (2003) are especially sensitive to the ways obligations from\ndifferent cultures affect perceptions of privacy.  There has been far\nless agreement on the second question. Some argue that matters\nrelating to one’s innermost self are inherently private, but\ncharacterizing this realm more succinctly and less vaguely has\nremained an elusive task. Thus it may well be that one of the\ndifficulties in defining the realm of the private is that privacy is a\nnotion that is strongly culturally relative, contingent on such\nfactors as economics as well as technology available in a given\ncultural domain. \n\nThe earliest arguments by Warren and Brandeis for explicit recognition\nof privacy protection in law were in large part motivated by expanding\ncommunication technology such as the development of widely distributed\nnewspapers and multiply printed reproductions of\nphotographs. Similarly Fourth Amendment protection against search and\nseizure was extended later in the twentieth century to cover telephone\nwiretaps and electronic surveillance. It is clear that many people\nstill view privacy is a valuable interest and realize it is now\nthreatened more than ever by technological advances. There are massive\ndatabases and Internet records of information about individual\nfinancial and credit history, medical records, purchases and telephone\ncalls, for example, and most people do not know what information is\nstored about them or who has access to it. The ability for others to\naccess and link the databases, with few controls on how they use,\nshare, or exploit the information, makes individual control over\ninformation about oneself more difficult than ever before. \n\nThere are numerous other cases of the clash between privacy and\ntechnology. Consider the following new technologies. Caller ID,\noriginally designed to protect people from unwanted calls from\nharassers, telemarketers, etc., involves privacy concerns for both the\ncaller and the called. There is widespread mandatory and random drug\ntesting of employees and others, and the Supreme Court has said\npolicies requiring all middle and high school students to consent to\ndrug testing in order to participate in extracurricular activities\ndoes not violate the Fourth Amendment, although the Court has\ndisallowed mandatory drug tests on pregnant women for use by police.\nIt had seemed that heat sensors aimed at and through walls to detect\nsuch things as growing marijuana would be acceptable.  However in 2001\nin Kyllo v. U.S. (533 U.S. 27), another close 5–4\ndecision, the Court decided that thermal imaging devices that reveal\ninformation previously unknowable without a warrant does constitute a\nviolation of privacy rights and the Fourth Amendment. Surveillance\nphotos are commonly taken of those using Fast Lane, resulting in\ntickets mailed to speeding offenders, and similar photos are now taken\nat red lights in San Diego and elsewhere, leading to surprise\ntickets. Face scanning in Tampa, at casinos, and at large sporting\nevents such as the Super Bowl, matches those photos with database\nrecords of felons, resulting in the capture of multiple offenders on\nthe loose but also posing privacy issues for other innocents\nphotographed without their knowledge. Some rental car drivers are now\ntracked by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, enabling car\nrental companies, not police, to levy stiff fines for\nspeeding. Immigration officials in Australia are considering proposals\nto tag asylum seekers with electronic trackers before sending them\ninto the community to await hearings. The media has recently uncovered\nan FBI Web surveillance system called Carnivore, that appears to\nsample the communications of as many Internet users as it chooses, not\njust suspects. Echelon is a covert global satellite network said to\nhave the ability to intercept all phone, fax, and e-mail messages in\nthe world, and may have up to 20 international listening\nposts. Airline passengers will soon be able to go through customs with\na two second biometric scan that confirms identity by mapping the iris\nof the eye, and U.S.  airlines are considering using “smart\ncards” which will identify passengers by their\nfingerprints. There is a proliferation of biometric identification\nusing faces, eyes, fingerprints, and other body parts for identifying\nspecific individuals, and the technology for matching the information\nwith other databases is advancing quickly. Anton Alterman (2003)\ndiscusses various privacy and ethical issues arising from expanding\nuse of biometric identification. For more on some of the other issues\nnoted above, see other articles in\nEthics and Information Technology 5, 3 (2003). \n \nFor some cases in the clash between privacy and advancing\ntechnologies, it is possible to make a compelling argument for\noverriding the privacy intrusions. Drug and alcohol tests for airline\npilots on the job seem completely justifiable in the name of public\nsafety, for example. With the development of new and more\nsophisticated technology, however, recent work on privacy is examining\nthe ways in which respect for privacy can be balanced with justifiable\nuses of emerging technology (Agre and Rotenberg, 1997; Austin, 2003;\nBrin, 1998; Etzioni, 1999, and Ethics and Information\nTechnology, 6, 1, 2004). Daniel Solove (2006) takes seriously the\ncriticism that privacy suffers from an embarrassment of meanings and\nthe concern that new technologies have given rise to a panoply of new\nprivacy harms. He then endeavors to guide the law toward a more\ncoherent understanding of privacy, by developing a taxonomy to\nidentify a wide range of privacy problems comprehensively and\ncompletely. Moore argues that privacy claims should carry more weight\nwhen in conflict with other social values and interests. For example,\nhe defends the view that employee agreements that undermine employee\nprivacy should be viewed with suspicion, and he argues that laws and\nlegislation prohibiting the genetic modification of humans will\nunjustifiably trample individual privacy rights (Moore, 2000). He also\ndefends the view that free speech and expression should not be viewed\nas more important than privacy (Moore, 1998). Clearly, in the wake of\nthe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the literature on privacy\nincreasingly focuses on how to balance privacy concerns with the need\nfor public safety in an age of terrorism. Moore (2000) argues that\nviews which trade privacy for security typically strike the wrong\nbalance and in many cases undermine both (Moore, 2000). Etzioni and\nMarsh (2003) provide a varied collection of essays on balancing rights\nand public safety after 9/11, highlighting views about where the\ngovernment will need to expand its authority in fighting the war\nagainst terrorism, and where it risks overreaching its\nauthority. Revisions to the U.S. Patriot Act and the extent to which\nthere have been increases in surreptitious electronic surveillance\nwithout court-issued warrants in violation of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act (FISA) will lead to further debates on the importance\nof privacy protection versus governmental power post 9/11. A more\nrecent example is Edward Snowden’s unauthorized acquisition of\nprivileged National Security Agency (NSA) information and his further\nbreach of sharing the information without permission. (Some view him\nas a hero, others as a traitor.) Although the government needs strong\npowers to protect its citizens, the executive branch also needs to\nprovide a strong voice on behalf of civil liberties and individual\nrights, including privacy. \n \nAs writers continue to be especially concerned with privacy and\ntechnology, and how it affects all citizens, there is increasing\nconcern with the social dimension of privacy which was first\nintroduced at the end of section 3.6 above.  For more contemporary\nessays on this topic, a new anthology edited by Beate Roessler and\nDorota Mokrosinska, Social Dimensions of Privacy:\nInterdisciplinary Perspectives (2015) is a follow up to\nSchoeman’s famous 1984 Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy:\nAn Anthology, but emphasizing topics on the social dimensions of\nprivacy. Roessler and Mokrosinska realize that technological\ndevelopments have inspired a lively debate on data and privacy,\nbecause privacy is a central lens through which to view protection of\nindividual liberty and autonomy in liberal democratic societies. What\nis new is the worrisome development of privacy-invasive technologies\nthat intrude on both individuals and society.  Regan (1995), Solove\n(2008) and Nissenbaum (2010) took the first steps in analyzing the\nsocial dimensions and value of privacy in a democratic society, but\nare now, along with others in this volume (2015), focusing on the role\nof privacy in political and social practice, in law, in media and\ncommunication, in health care, and in the marketplace. Privacy\nconcerns are also arising in new disciplines beyond philosophy, law\nand political science, reaching into the health sciences, engineering,\nmedia studies, sociology and information sciences. Thus Roessler and\nMokrosinska have encouraged further work on recent controversies in\nthese different domains of social life, exploring the ways in which\nthe emphasis on the social relevance of privacy helps try to resolve\nthem.  They also urged contributors to address challenges that arise\nfor the social dimension of privacy given the increasing regulation of\nprivacy. \n\nThus, for example, Gary Marx, Regan and Solove discuss the social\nmeaning and value of privacy, and DeCew and Moore assess the\npublic/private boundary in the family, given that family conventions\nare among the most crucial for this primary human socialization\nsetting (Roessler and Mokrosinska, 2015). As another example,\nRoessler and Mokrosinska themselves, along with Jeroen van den Hoven,\nAnnabelle Lever and others address genetic data, markets in personal\ndata, and privacy as a political value, especially given the tension\nbetween the right to privacy and freedom of expression. Other papers\nin this cluster look at Internet surveillance and the democratic role\nof privacy and social media. While posing many questions, these\nessays isolate the central dilemmas that arise when addressing privacy\nin social contexts and when groups, not merely individuals, have a\nstake in the regulation of privacy (Roessler and Mokrosinska, 2015).\nFinally, a third group of essays in this volume help readers\nunderstand privacy regulations in the European Union and Canada.\nAnita Allen emphasizes the limitations of privacy regulations in\nhealth care, and the discrimination and disadvantages these\nregulations lead to for people of color and women. Others discuss\nboth the combination and maze of privacy regulations at the federal\nlevel in the U.S., across states, and within different privacy\nlegislation bodies. For current privacy controversies in these new\ntechnical areas, there may be few concrete answers about the best way\nto answer particular questions arising from the clash between privacy\nand other important values. Nevertheless, “the authors have\ntaken privacy research an important step further and have demonstrated\nthat the recognition of the social dimensions of privacy should play a\ncentral role in the way we understand privacy and approach current\nprivacy controversies” (Roessler and Mokrosinska, 7). \n\nAs debate has expanded over privacy and advancing technology, another\nrecent anthology has made important contributions to the\nliterature.  Privacy, Security and Accountability: Ethics, Law and\nPolicy edited by Adam D. Moore (2016) ushers in a cogent\narticulation and defense of privacy even when privacy seems to\nconflict with other important values. For example, new technologies\nallowing increased data mining, re-identification of anonymized data\nsets, heat-sensing cameras, license-plate readers, predictive\nanalytics and facial recognition technology can all expose information\nwe thought was protected as private to become more public than we had\never imagined. These technologies and others can make us worry about\nthe moral, legal and social foundations and interrelationships between\nprivacy, security and accountability. Moore and his co-author for the\n“Introduction”, Michael Katell, use a control-based\ndefinition of privacy, that “A right to privacy is a right to\ncontrol access to, and uses of, places, bodies, and personal\ninformation” (Moore, 3), urging that “the ability to\ncontrol access to our bodies, capacities, and powers, and to sensitive\npersonal information, is an essential part of human flourishing or\nwell-being” (Moore, 5). Security basically provides individuals\nwith control over their lives, projects and property, and to be free\nfrom unjustified interference from other individuals, corporations and\ngovernments. At this level, privacy and security seem to go hand in\nhand, reinforcing each other.  However, it is important to ask when\nexternal interference is justified, leading to conflicts between\nprivacy and security. People may have different views about when an\nissue of national security, for example, is strong enough to override\nindividual or group privacy concerns.  Kenneth Einar Himma defends a\nstrong account, arguing that classical social contract theory implies\nthat citizens submit to state authority to gain security, a value the\nstate is morally obligated to protect. Thus armed services, police,\nintelligence agencies, public health institutions and legal systems\nprovide security for individuals and groups (Moore, ch. 8).  But few\nwould accept the extreme claim that security always overrides privacy,\nand in our “technologically enabled, fear-inspired environment,\nbalancing the legitimate needs with cherished rights and competing\nvalues is an ongoing struggle for a deliberative democracy and society\nin general” (Moore, 7). While we can appreciate somewhat\ndifferent categories of moral, social and legal accountability, just\nas we discuss moral, social and legal responsibility, we all\nunderstand it becomes clear that accountability can sometimes\nsupersede privacy rights, and yet privacy rights can on other\noccasions override accountability in its multiple forms. As the\nauthors in this volume note, there is good reason to conclude that\nprivacy, security and accountability are all morally valuable.  Yet we\nmay all wonder what the appropriate balance is between these different\nvalues when they conflict.  To describe just a few of the contributions in this volume, Anita\nAllen argues that individuals have an obligation to protect their own\nprivacy (Moore, ch. 1). While that may be true, it is not at all clear\nthat individuals can protect their own privacy in the face of national\nsecurity concerns or demands for accountability. Dorota Mokrosinska\nemphasizes privacy as a democratic value, thus strengthening\nprivacy’s value when it competes with freedom of expression and\nother political interests.  Privacy can facilitate setting aside deep\ndisagreements in order for political engagement in a democracy to\nproceed.  Thus Mokrosinska proposes a strategy for mediating between\nprivacy and free speech when they collide (Moore, ch. 4). As noted,\nKenneth Himma “argues that security is a more important right\nthat always ‘trumps’ privacy, which on his view is not an\nabsolute or fundamental right, but merely ‘instrumental’\nto other rights” (Moore, 12, and ch. 8). Himma’s defense\nis based on his view that security is fundamental to survival – our\nmost valuable duty and obligation. In contrast, responding to this\nview, Adam Moore defends privacy over security with multiple\narguments, perhaps the most powerful of which is demonstrating\n“the importance of privacy as a bulwark against the tyrannical\nexcesses of an unchecked security state” (Moore, 13, and ch. 9).\nAlan Rubel discusses data collection by the National Security Agency\n(NSA) in ch. 10, Bryce Clayton Powell focuses on surveillance\npractices in chapter 11, and echoes Rubel’s concerns about\naccountability and transparency in the processes of data collection\nand surveillance, thus focusing on the importance of privacy rights in\nthis new technological era. Their concerns about law enforcement and\nthe implementation of many practices taken to fall under the Patriot\nAct are also supported by Nadine Strossen’s discussion of such\nenforcement as often both illegal and ineffective (Moore,\nch. 12). These discussions in information technology draw readers into\ncurrent debates about the boundaries between and relative values of\nprivacy, security and accountability. \n\nAnother discussion of privacy as a concept and its role and associated\ntensions in discussions of advancing technology, is Privacy: What\nEveryone Needs to Know, (Francis & Francis, 2017). It\nprovides an excellent new overview of the literature and topics\ncovered in this article. It is both a thoughtful and expansive book,\ndiscussing privacy as it relates to concepts such as security and\nautonomy in decision-making. Also assessing the state of privacy in\nour changing technological era, the book addresses privacy questions\nfor individuals, families and other groups, with detailed attention to\npersonal information, health care, education, employment and other\nfinancial issues, law enforcement, the Internet and social media, and\nthe importance of privacy in a democracy. It gives a balanced\ntreatment of alternative views in each of these areas, emphasizing the\nmultiple ways protection of privacy can vary substantially in\ndifferent spheres of our lives. The authors have expertise in both\nphilosophy and law, which is particularly timely and increasingly\nnecessary in any discussion of the value of privacy in these multiple\ncontexts.","contact.mail":"JDeCew@clarku.edu","contact.domain":"clarku.edu"}]
