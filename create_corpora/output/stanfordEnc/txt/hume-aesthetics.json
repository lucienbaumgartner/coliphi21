His theory of taste and beauty is not entirely original, but\nhis arguments generally display the keen analysis typical of his best\nwork. Hume’s archaic terminology is occasionally an obstacle to\nappreciating his analysis, inviting conflicting readings of his\nposition. \n\nHume’s aesthetic theory received limited attention until the\nsecond half of the Twentieth Century, when interest in the full range\nof Hume’s thought was enlivened by the gradual recognition of\nhis importance among philosophers writing in English. Unfortunately,\nmany discussions of Hume’s aesthetics concentrate on a single\nlate essay, “Of the Standard of Taste” (1757). This\nemphasis misrepresents the degree to which Hume’s aesthetic\ntheory is integrated into his philosophical system. This\nmisrepresentation has been countered by recent monographs on\nHume’s general aesthetic theory by Dabney Townsend (2001) and\nTimothy Costelloe (2007). \nThe “Advertisement” to his first publication, A\nTreatise of Human Nature, promises that if the first two volumes\nfind suitable “approbation,” the project will conclude\nwith “the examination of morals, politics, and criticism; which\nwill compleat this Treatise of human nature” (T, Adv, xii).\nSadly, the Treatise was not a success and Hume limited the\nthird and final volume to the topic “Of Morals.” He never\nproduced his systematic treatment of politics and criticism and so\nnever completed his new “science” of human nature. Those\ntopics would be handled piecemeal in several collections of short\nessays, the “polite” writing that brought him the\npublishing success he desired. \nHume’s concept of criticism is not interchangeable with either\naesthetics or philosophy of art. These now-familiar labels were not\navailable to Hume when he published his Treatise in 1739 and\n1740. The Abbé Charles Batteux did not defend the idea of\ngrouping the arts together in an investigation of fine art until 1746.\nHowever, Hume knew and drew from the French tradition leading to\nBatteux’s work. Under this general influence, his essays\noccasionally refer to the “the finer arts” of painting,\nmusic, sculpture, and poetry (CL, 158; SOT 278; OT, 264; C, 289).\nThere is no direct evidence that Hume read Batteux, but they agree in\nidentifying the fine arts as mimetic “arts of luxury” that\nexist primarily for the sake of our enjoyment (C, 289). Although\ncontemporaries such as Alexander Gerard and Lord Kames (Henry Home)\nboth use the phrase “fine art,” Hume’s books and\nletters never use that expression. Hume was probably not aware of\nAlexander Baumgarten’s Reflections on Poetry of 1735,\nthe work that introduced the term “aesthetics.” The thesis\nthat aesthetic judgments are completely distinct from moral judgments\nwould not receive its modern formulation until Immanuel Kant’s\nCritique of Judgment (1790), after Hume’s death in\n1776. So Hume’s reflections on aesthetics occupy a pivotal niche\nbetween the appearance of fine art theory and Kant’s defense of\nan independent aesthetic judgment in the Critique of Judgment\n– a defense clearly influenced by Kant’s reading of\nHume’s essays and An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nMorals. \nHume’s theory is most firmly rooted in the work of Joseph\nAddison, Francis Hutcheson, and, to a lesser extent, Shaftesbury\n(Anthony Ashley Cooper). The specific connections are detailed in Kivy\n(2003), Townsend (2001), and Costelloe (2007). From the older\ntradition, elegantly expounded by Addison in numerous essays written\nbetween 1709 and 1715, Hume retains the idea that the values within\nthe scope of criticism are essentially pleasures of the human\nimagination. Although Hume acknowledges cases where beauty seems a\nmerely sensory pleasure, he emphasizes beauty’s status as a\ncognitive pleasure. Taking beauty as his paradigm case of such a\nvalue, Hume combines Addison’s theory of taste as an operation\nof imagination with Hutcheson’s proposal that emotions are the\nfoundation of moral judgment. Elaborating on the “inner\nsense” theory, Hume endorses Hutcheson’s stance on the\ngeneral question of the nature of both moral and aesthetic value.\nValue judgments are expressions of taste rather than reasoned\nanalysis. Values cannot be addressed except in the context of a\ngeneral theory about our shared human nature. Although recognition of\naesthetic and moral beauty is a manifestation of taste (and perhaps\nthey cannot ultimately be distinguished from one another), taste must\nnot be dismissed as subjective, idiosyncratic preference. \nGranted, Hume has many other influences. He drew on classical sources,\nincluding Cicero. His celebrated essay on taste draws heavily on\nFrench thought, particularly on that of the Abbé Jean-Baptiste\nDubos(1748). (See\n Section 4\n below.) So does the essay on tragedy. (See\n Section 5\n below.) Detailed accounts of Hume’s debt to Dubos are provided\nin Jones (2009) and Townsend (2011, pp. 76–85). \nWithin this framework of concerns and influences, Hume is neither\ninterested in working out a theory of art (in contributing to\nphilosophy of art) nor in analyzing aesthetic properties (in doing\naesthetics). Although he is aware of debates about the nature of the\nsublime and recognizes it as a category of artistic achievement (SOT,\n281), he offers no theory of the sublime. An attempt to pull together\na Humean account is made by Hipple (1967, pp. 42–44). Due to the\nseamless connection Hume posits between moral and aesthetic value,\nmuch of his technical discussion of aesthetics appears only as an\nillustration of his moral theory. Other details of Hume’s\naesthetics emerge in contexts where he expounds his theory of\nimaginative association (EHUa, 102–7), elaborates on the value\nof delicacy of taste (DOT), and denies that his appeal to sentiment\nleads to skepticism about value distinctions (S, 217–19).\nConsequently, a reading that emphasizes “Of the Standard of\nTaste” at the expense of the Treatise and\nEnquiries shortchanges the theory’s complexity. \nThus, the two essays that appear to summarize Hume’s aesthetics\nare best understood as applications of a larger philosophical account\nof human nature, including our social nature. The construction of each\nessay suggests a purpose of working out details of the larger project\nin the face of an obvious counterexample. Those counterexamples are\nthe relativity of taste (SOT) and the pleasure we take in tragic\nfiction (OT). Yet their limited purpose does not detract from their\ncontinuing importance. They provide insight into perennial problems\nand so serve as the historical foundation for subsequent attempts to\ndefend a subjectivist aesthetic theory. \nUnfortunately, numerous interpretative challenges arise from\nHume’s scattered presentation, his range of references, and his\neighteenth-century assumptions about art. Like many of his\ncontemporaries, Hume regards “poetry and the polite\nauthors” as the most important arts (PW 3, 19). Timothy\nCostelloe (2018, chap. 4) consequently constructs an excellent survey\nof Humean aesthetics by canvassing the full range of Hume’s\ncomments on poets and poetry. However, poetry differs from the more\npractical arts in being designed for the primary purpose of giving\npleasure (SOT, 277). When using the terms “art” and\n“artist,” Hume sometimes means any human artifice and any\nskilled designer (in one context, an “artist” is someone\nwho repairs a clock (EHU, 87)). In contexts where he can only be taken\nto be interested in the narrower category of fine art, Hume variously\nmentions painting, statuary, architecture, dance, poetry, and music.\nBut he places poetry among the arts of eloquent public discourse.\nEloquence includes sermons, essays, argumentative discourse, and other\ncategories that we today would regard as too overtly didactic to be\nfine art (E). \nHume assumes that every product of human labor has some definite\npurpose, with only a limited subset of art being produced for the sake\nof pleasure alone. (He is skeptical about appeals to teleological or\nfinal causes in nature.) Houses will be designed and built apart from\nany need to satisfy our taste for beauty, and representational art\nwill be produced in order to provide visual information. The\ninteresting questions are why houses and visual representations also\nappeal to taste, and what this appeal tells us about the relative\ncontributions of human nature and education as conditions for\nappropriate responses to our surroundings. \nSo what label best summarizes Hume’s theory of moral and\naesthetic taste? It may be easier to specify which labels do not fit\nhis theory than to attach one to it. He rejects normative realism.\n(There is considerable controversy on the question of whether Hume is\na realist regarding matters of fact. Putting that issue to one side,\nhe clearly denies that normative judgments have the same degree of\nobjectivity that holds for matters of fact.) Hume is equally at pains\nto deny that reason provides an adequate foundation for judgments of\ntaste. Is he therefore a subjectivist? Not if subjectivism implies\nthat such judgments are arbitrary. He is not a relativist, for the\nmain point of the essay on taste is that some judgments of taste are\nsuperior to others. Nor, in his own terms, is he a skeptic regarding\naesthetic properties and value judgments. Despite his philosophical\nview that beauty is not a real property of things, Hume never\nquestions the meaningfulness of general practice of making aesthetic\njudgments. Because the verdicts of taste are sentiments, devoid of\ntruth-value, there is no opportunity for the conflicts and failures of\nreason that give rise to philosophical skepticism. \nHume is an inner sense theorist who treats aesthetic pleasure as an\ninstinctive and natural human response. Successful art exploits our\nnatural sentiments by employing appropriate composition and design.\nOnly empirical inquiry can establish reliable ways to elicit the\napproval of taste. \nHume regards the natural capacity of taste as fundamental to the human\nability to make moral and aesthetic judgments. Like his predecessors,\nHume sees an analogy between an “inner sense” for beauty\nand the sense of taste for food and drink. Natural, general laws guide\nboth. Both permit of education and refinement and thus better and\nworse responses. Both produce sentiments or feelings of approval and\ndisapproval. But only the “mental” taste, the exercise of\nwhich is involved in moral and aesthetic judgment, admits of\nrefinement through “the interposition” of ideas (T, 275).\n \nHume’s eighteenth-century terminology includes a pair of terms\nno longer in general use. In his basic nomenclature, “taste in\nmorals, eloquence, or beauty” assigns either\n“approbation” or “disapprobation” (or some\ncombination of both) to objects of taste (T, 547n). Approbation is\n“a peculiar delight” (T, 298) and a\n“particular kind of pleasure” (T, 472). It feels\ndifferent from other pleasures. He variously characterizes approbation\nas a feeling of approval, liking, or affection. A beautiful object or\naction strikes us as amiable, agreeable, and desirable. Yet moral and\naesthetic responses are not identical, for “the satisfaction is\ndifferent, [which] keeps our sentiments concerning them from being\nconfounded” (T, 472). Hume describes the feeling of\ndisapprobation as one of disapproving, disliking, and contempt. An\nugly object or vicious action feels odious, disagreeable, and\nundesirable. \nIn the eighteenth-century context of moral theory,\n“sentiment” is a generic label for emotions. (Hume’s\ntheory is sometimes identified as “sentimentalism,” but\nthat term has unfortunate modern connotations—though see the\nentry on\n moral sentimentalism.)\n In Hume’s technical vocabulary, all emotions are impressions,\nnot ideas. The sentiments associated with beauty and ugliness are\nreflective impressions. They are not “impressions of the\nsenses.” Instead, they are responses to sensory impressions (T,\n276). \nBeauty is a feeling of approbation, and an original, simple impression\nof the mind. Impressions are contrasted with ideas, which he\nalternatively calls “thoughts.” Ideas are\n“copies” of impressions, and seldom have the force or\nclarity of the experiences they copy. For Hume, experiencing a\nparticular kind of approbation is a necessary condition for thinking\nabout the idea of beauty. An individual cannot construct the idea of\nbeauty out of other ideas, which is equivalent to saying that the idea\nderives from the proper sentiment of approbation (T, 469). In the\ncomplete absence of the operations of taste, thoughts about beauty\nwould not occur. \nTaste is the capacity to respond with approbation and disapprobation.\nBut how does taste relate to Hume’s various remarks about\n“perceptions” and “discernments” of beauty, of\nour “judging” a work, and of critics who “give\njudgment” and who “give” or “pronounce”\na “verdict” or “recommendation” (SOT, passim)?\nHume seems to equate perception of beauty with the experience of the\nsentiment. (This equation underlies the problem of whether all tastes\nare equal). Does he distinguish between the critic’s experience\nof the sentiment and the judgment or verdict? If a verbal\npronouncement that an object is beautiful is nothing more than an\nexpression or report of the speaker’s sentiment, then Hume faces\nthe difficulty that a critic’s verdict is not really a\nrecommendation of the object. If your pronouncement that a piece of\nmusic is beautiful means no more than that you have felt a certain\npleasure upon hearing it, then your verdict expresses your pleasure\nwithout saying anything about the music’s capacity to please\nothers. So although critics issue judgments of taste based on their\nown sentiments, a judgment of taste must involve something more than a\npleasing or displeasing sentiment.  \nHume observes that there is a difference between expressing\none’s own sentiments and making a moral distinction. When\nsomeone speaks of another’s behavior as “vicious\nor odious or depraved, he then speaks another\nlanguage, and expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his\naudience to concur with him” (EPM, 272). Moral and aesthetic\njudgment requires “steady and general points\nof view” (T, 581–82; see also SOT, 276), common to others\n(EPM, 272). Hume’s various descriptions of this point of view\ninvite conflicting interpretations. However, it clearly requires the\ncritic to reflect upon the relationship between the sentiment and its\nobject. \nWhether we call them “aesthetic judgments” or\n“judgments of taste,” aesthetic verdicts are unlike\nordinary judgments about matters of fact. Matters of fact are relevant\nstates of affairs, which render complex ideas either true or false.\nThe same cannot be said about verdicts arising from the operations of\ntaste. Sentiment, and sentiment alone, determines that a particular\nobject is or is not beautiful. \nWe do not infer that a sunset is beautiful and so deserving of\napprobation. We see the sunset, and the visual impressions please us.\nIf we have the proper point of view, we are justified in saying that\nthe sunset is beautiful. This verdict is more than a report or\nexpression of the sentiment, yet the sentiment is an irreplaceable\nelement of the judgment. A parallel claim is made of moral\ndiscrimination. “Pleasure and pain,” he insists, are the\n“essence” of beauty and deformity (T, 299). But how does a\nliterary work “give immediate pleasure”? \nOne of Hume’s most puzzling claims is that taste is an\n“immediate” response. In his extended treatment of the\npassions and emotions in the Treatise, Hume says that\n“immediate” feelings are ones that do not involve the\n“interposition” of ideas (T, 275). Some pleasures and\npains are “immediate” in the sense that they are\nimpressions that immediately accompany other impressions (e.g., the\nexperience of a very hot flame is accompanied by an experience of\npain). How does a literary work “give immediate pleasure”?\nTaken literally, the Treatise appears to commit Hume to the\nview that literary works are beautiful independent of the\naudience’s ability to assign ideas or meanings to the words. As\nnoted by James Grant (2014, p. 368), the Treatise sometimes\nposits a distinction between beauty, which is the quality of the\nobject that acts upon us, and the pleasure it arouses. But these\nproposals are not repeated in Hume’s later writings and a\ncommitment to observer-independent beauty is certainly not\nHume’s mature position. His official theory is that there is\n“mental, as well as bodily taste” (SOT, 274), and both\nmoral and aesthetic discrimination depend on mental taste. The\nrequisite sentiments are spontaneous products of the mind, but they\nare not uninformed responses. \nMental taste normally requires some intervening thought process. So\nthe pleasures and pains of aesthetic judgment are not immediate in\nbeing direct responses to other impressions. \nMental taste arises in response to ideas that arise in response to\nimpressions (e.g., viewing a photograph occasions thoughts about the\nplace pictured, leading to thoughts about experiences one had or might\nhave there, and the thoughts arising in this imaginative process are\npleasurable or painful). Hume regards this “immediacy” of\ntaste as entirely compatible with the influence of intellectual and\nimaginative faculties. \nTaste is immediate and spontaneous, yet the application of “good\nsense” and “reason” improves it (SOT, 277). Taste is\nnot improved by reasoning from a priori normative principles. Moral\nand aesthetic discriminations “are not conclusions of\nreason” (T, 457). Neither results from a mere “comparing\nof ideas” (T, 463). However, taste can be influenced by\nconsultation of “general rules of art” or\n“rules” that “are founded only on experience and\nobservation” (SOT, 270). For different views on the content of\nthese rules or principles, see Hester (1979), Dickie (1996, pp.\n126–131), Shelley (2002), Dickie (2003), and Shelley (2004).\nMental taste involves reason in the sense of “sound\nunderstanding,” which ultimately depends on imaginative\nassociations of ideas. So taste involves imaginative pleasure, as\nAddison proposed. This doctrine of imaginative pleasure has no special\nconnection with creativity or with the capacity to produce art. \nTo summarize Hume on taste, aesthetic and moral response is\n“immediate” in the sense that the feeling occurs\nspontaneously in anyone who makes customary imaginative associations.\nHume wants to emphasize that a critic does not infer the presence of\nbeauty. Yet he also acknowledges the relevance of sound understanding\nto taste. This combination of doctrines has implications for the\npractice of justifying judgments of taste, and becomes the focus of\nthe essay “Of the Standard of Taste.” Knowing that a\nsonnet has the same form as a second, beautiful sonnet will not offer\nany reason to think that they are equally fine poems. Only a reading\nof the sonnet can support claims about its beauty. However,\nHume’s theory should be interpreted with caution, against the\nbackdrop of his other claims about moral and aesthetic distinctions.\nThe general, natural principles of taste are supplemented by learned\nrules, so that knowledge of other sonnets contributes to a more\naccurate or refined evaluation of the merits and flaws of a particular\nsonnet. His subjectivism does not lead to relativism. Not every\nsentiment is equally good. \nHume proposes that feeling, not thought, informs us that an object is\nbeautiful or ugly, or that an action exhibits virtue or vice:\n“The very feeling constitutes our praise or\nadmiration” (T, 471). The feeling or sentiment is itself an\naesthetic or moral discrimination. It is prior to, and the basis of,\nany subsequent expression of praise or admiration. The sentiment\nis the beauty of the object and it is the virtue of\ndesirable human action. Sentiment is the sole source of values\ngoverning human activity. Taste is a “productive faculty, and\ngilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed\nfrom internal sentiment, raises, in a manner, a new creation.”\nThat new creation is “beauty and deformity, virtue and\nvice” (EPM, 294). However, the sentiment is calm rather than\nviolent, so an unphilosophical perspective treats it as a property\n“of the object” (S, 218).  \nThis moral and aesthetic subjectivism attracts Hume for the same\nreason that it attracts Hutcheson. The appeal to sentiment offers a\nmiddle position between the two prevailing theories within English\nletters, Hobbesian egoism and ethical rationalism. Hutcheson holds\nthat virtue and beauty are not qualities of the people and things to\nwhich they are attributed. We may speak as if objects and people have\nmoral and aesthetic properties, but the relevant property is merely an\n“idea raised in us.” Hume alters Hutcheson’s theory\nby imposing his own philosophical vocabulary, making beauty an\nimpression rather than an idea. But they agree that to describe a\nperson as virtuous or an object as beautiful is to make a claim about\ntheir tendency to cause a certain response. Is it imprudent and\n“too strong,” Hume asks Hutcheson, to summarize the thesis\nin the following terms (HL, I, 39–40)? “[W]hen you\npronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but\nthat from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or\nsentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue,\ntherefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which,\naccording to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but\nperceptions in the mind” (T, 469). Emphasizing Hume’s debt\nto Hutcheson, Kivy (2003, pp. 307–310), argues that Hume\nunderstands beauty very much on the model of colors. Although they are\nsecondary qualities and so do not directly reveal the properties of\nthe occasioning object, some color perception is “true and\nreal” (SOT, 272), and so it is for Hume likewise with beauty.\nHowever, virtue and beauty are not strictly analogous to secondary\nqualities, such as heat and cold, because a critic’s claim that\na work is beautiful involves an element of endorsement that does not\narise in the observation that ice is cold. The case against reading\nHumean beauty on the model of ideas of secondary qualities is provided\nby Shiner (1996) and Taylor (2011). \nHume defends the centrality of sentiment with the following reasoning.\nRecognitions of virtue and beauty require particular sentiments in\nhuman observers. If the discriminations of taste took place without\nthese sentiments, we would lack any motivation to do what we regard as\nmoral. Moral and aesthetic judgments have practical consequences that\nmere reason lacks. So taste differs from the assent that characterizes\nunderstanding or reason (T, 458; EPM, 172; S, 219). Although taste\nresponds to real qualities of objects, we cannot replace the exercise\nof taste with the assent of reason. In many cases, beauty and\ngracefulness (both aesthetic and moral) are inexplicable; they resist\nour efforts at explication, and we must trust the “sure\ntestimony of taste and sentiment” (EPM, 267). \nEpistemically, taste is nonetheless a fallible indicator of beauty and\ndeformity. The underlying sentiments never “refer” to\nanything in their cause (SOT, 268). Feelings do not represent any\naspect of their occasioning objects, and they are easily attached to\nobjects other than their cause (T, 280). (As with any causal\nrelationship, such as the causal link between smoke and fire, an\nisolated effect does not refer back to its cause, nor does it provide\nus with information about the nature of the object or event that\ncauses it. If we experience smoke but have never experienced fire, the\nsmoke will tell us nothing about the nature of fire.) As effects of\nour interaction with the world, sentiments cannot reliably inform us\nabout the nature of their causes. It will not always be clear, prior\nto careful attention and reflection, which features of a work of art\nare responsible for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation.\nOn Hume’s analysis, the chain running from cause to effect turns\nout to be extremely complex, for the relationship is indirect and\n“the human body is a mighty complicated machine” with many\n“secret powers” (EHU, 87; see also SOT, 270). Knowing\nthis, good critics pronounce their verdicts only after they clarify\nhow their own sentiments relate to the object that is being evaluated\n(SOT, 270–71). \nHowever, some of Hume’s critics see a fundamental contradiction\nbetween his subjectivism and his distinction between better and worse\ncritics or the possession of better and worse taste. The criticism is\nmost often formulated against Hume’s parallel discussion of\nethical evaluation. A particularly forceful statement of the objection\nis provided by Philippa Foot (1966). Hume was acutely aware of the\ngeneral problem and it is the starting point of the essay “Of\nthe Standard of Taste.” (See\n Section 4\n below.) \nOur sentiments obey general principles governing our species. Yet we\nmust be able to make judgments of taste immediately, without having to\nbe aware of the laws governing them.  \nHume’s acknowledgment of regular, predictable causes of the\nmoral and aesthetic sentiment is sometimes taken as an indication that\nHume is not a genuine subjectivist. On this reading, he equates beauty\nand virtue with dispositional properties of external objects.\nAttributions of moral and aesthetic properties to objects indicate a\nspeaker’s acknowledgment of the object’s tendency to\nproduce the sentiment. There are passages that suggest such a reading:\n“beauty is such an order and constitution of parts, as …\nis fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul” (T,\n299; see SOT, 273). The dispositional analysis of beauty is attributed\nto Hume by Savile (1982, p. 161), Mothersill (1984, pp.\n205–206), and Levinson (2002). Reasons to think it is mistaken\nare provided by Baxter (1990). The dispositional analysis should not\nbe confused with the position that features of objects cause the\nrequisite sentiment. The case for attributing a causal theory of taste\nto Hume is provided by Shiner (1996) \nDespite such passages, it is questionable whether Hume really offers a\ndispositional analysis. A dispositional analysis tells us which\nproperties would exist if certain conditions were satisfied. A\nsimplified dispositional analysis treats “Cork is buoyant”\nas equivalent in meaning to “If a piece of cork is placed in\nwater, it floats.” A simplified dispositional analysis of beauty\ntreats “This object is beautiful” as equivalent in meaning\nto “If anyone perceives this object under ideal conditions, a\nsentiment of approbation accompanies the perception.”  On\nthis account, beauty is distinct from the sentiment of approbation.\nThe sentiment is incorporated into the analysis, but the sentiment is\nnot itself a dispositional property. \nSuppose that Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property. Like the\ndispositional terms “buoyant” and “brittle,”\n“beauty” could be predicated of objects, generating\njudgments that are true or false for different objects. Statements\nattributing dispositional properties to objects are true even if the\nappropriate conditions are never satisfied (e.g., “This vase is\nbrittle” can be true despite the fact that the vase never gets\nbroken). Yet Hume clearly denies that judgments of taste are\ntruth-valued, and he denies that it makes sense to make inferences\nabout an object’s beauty in advance of the requisite sentiment\n(S, 219). \nHume famously argues that, in order to clarify any idea, “we\nneed but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea\nderived” (EHU, 22). If beauty is a dispositional property,\nthen one arrives at the idea of beauty by associating particular\ncauses with particular effects under specific conditions. In\nHume’s terminology, a dispositional idea of beauty would be the\nidea of a complex relation of cause and effect. It would be a causal\nprinciple, and we could not employ the idea prior to formulating such\na principle. Yet, once again, Hume denies an implication of the\ndispositional analysis. The sentiment of approbation is our only\nsource for our idea of beauty, and there are cases where we recognize\nbeauty in advance of any reasoning about the beautiful object (EPM,\n173). \nFurthermore, if Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property, he\nhas a model close at hand in Hutcheson’s analysis. But Hume\navoids offering any such account. Aside from a willingness to identify\nseveral ways that works of art must fail to please refined taste, Hume\ndoes very little to advance the traditional and familiar project of\ncriticism, the stipulation of rules for successful art. Granted, he\nendorses the existence of such rules (SOT, 269–273) and\nprovisionally suggests (SOT, 273) that they serve as our standard of\ntaste, a point explored by Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 2009), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3–17). However, he does not\nprovide an organized or dedicated presentation of the properties of\nobjects that regularly cause the sentiment of approbation. Costelloe\n(2018, pp. 161–170) has nonetheless extracted three such\nprinciples from Hume’s discussions of poetry. First, artistic\ndepictions must be grounded in what is familiar or, at the very least,\nplausible. Second, artworks must be constrained by coherence in their\nimaginative associations. Third, simplicity is preferable to\n“excessive ornamentation and artifice” (Costelloe 2018,\n167). At the same time, Hume recognizes that any established\ncorrelation between sentiment and objective properties might be\ndefeated by the next example that we encounter (SOT, 270). Despite the\nexistence of “general principles of approbation or blame,”\ntaste depends on too many variables (“incidents and\nsituations”) to offer a detailed dispositional analysis (SOT,\n271). \nPassages endorsing a dispositional account might be slips of the pen.\nOr, more likely, Hume does not believe that it is possible to define\nevaluative terms. They are indefinable, primitive terms. Hume\nemphasizes that “certain qualities in objects” are the\noccasions for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation (SOT,\n273). Formal design is one such quality (SOT 271; T, 299, 364). The\nexistence of occasioning qualities provides theoretical support for\nthe possibility of a convergence of refined taste. So our primitive\nevaluative terms are not arbitrarily applied. Nonetheless, it is\nirresponsible to endorse any particular thing or action in advance of\nthe verdict of unprejudiced taste. \nInformed understanding makes a vital contribution to most aesthetic\nand moral judgment (EPM, 173; SOT, 277). For Hume, taste is improved\nby practice in making “comparisons” among objects (SOT,\n275) and by the employment of “good sense” (SOT, 277).\n \nHume blurs traditional distinctions between thinking and imagining.\nThoughts would not extend beyond our actual experiences were it not\nfor the imaginative associations established by the force of\nrepetition or “custom” (T, 170; EHU, 43). Learned\nassociations encourage us to rearrange our ideas in intelligible\npatterns, permitting us to create ideas of things never actually\nexperienced (e.g., fictitious creatures or distant places).\nImagination also creates chains of associated ideas, encouraging\nthoughts to move rapidly from one idea to another. \nGood taste therefore presupposes an active imagination. Suppose one\nwakes in the morning and smells the distinctive aroma of coffee, and\nthe experience is pleasurable. This appreciation depends on a learned,\nimaginative association: the smell brings to mind its cause, the\nbrewing coffee, and its purpose, the consumption of the coffee. The\nagreeable sentiment is a response to this complex association of\nimpressions and ideas, not to the smell alone. Critical evaluation is\ntherefore highly contextual: “The passion, in pronouncing its\nverdict, considers not the object simply, as it is in itself, but\nsurveys it with all the circumstances, which attend it” (S,\n224). \nIt is important to recognize that Humean imagination is not a free and\nunrestrained activity. It is constrained by a relatively small set of\npermanent principles of imaginative association (T, 10, 225; EHU, 24).\nAlthough poets may “profess to follow implicitly the suggestions\nof their fancy” (T, 225), their poetry has little chance of\npleasing others if their “fancy” or imagination employs\nirregular associations. The universal principles of imaginative\nassociation allow artists to predict how their representational and\nnarrative designs will move audiences. With artworks, the intentions\nof the artist must be considered, a point emphasized by Jones (1976,\npp. 55–56), and Jones (2009). \nHume recognizes a very small class of cases for which imaginative\nassociation is not needed to recognize beauty. In these cases, initial\nimpressions of the mere “form” of a material object\ngenerate approbation (T, 364). Such cases are more typical of natural\nbeauty than art (EPM, 173). So imagination is not always necessary for\ndiscovering beauty. Pleasing form is sometimes sufficient. However,\n“’tis seldom we rest there” (T, 363). \nSo Hume does not advocate a simple causal relationship between form\nand sentiment. In most cases, our beliefs about the object alter our\nsentiments. Forms are generally most pleasing when “the order\nand construction of parts” (T, 299) suggests a corresponding\nutility for humans or expresses agreeable emotions. These suggestions\nneed not be accurate in order to trigger approbation and\ndisapprobation. A particular object might appear balanced, graceful,\nand beautiful despite our knowledge of its limited utility (T, 584).\nObjects may displease taste despite their genuine utility. \nHume’s views on the aesthetic relevance of form and utility are\nexplored by Carolyn Korsmeyer (1976), while utility is emphasized by\nTaylor (2011). Given Hume’s debt to Hutcheson, Korsmeyer notes\nthat it is tempting to read such passages as foreshadowing the\nsubsequent theory of aesthetic response as “disinterested”\npleasure. However, we should be careful here. Hume uses the term\n“disinterest” as the contrary of “self-love”\n(EPM, 296), but he does not use the term in relation to aesthetic\nsentiment. Hume’s “common,” “universal,”\nor “general view of things” is a simpler proposal. He\nwants to remind us that we cannot expect the agreement of others if we\njudge things from a limited and prejudiced perspective (EPM, 272). \nRelations of form and function can operate at an extremely abstract\nlevel: “A building, whose doors and windows were exact squares,\nwould hurt the eye by that very proportion: as ill adapted to the\nfigure of a human creature, for whose service the fabric was\nintended” (EPM, 212–13). Those who respond with sentiment\nare moved by “imaginary” and general consequences, not\nsimply utility for the person passing judgment (EPM, 217–18).\nFurthermore, formal design itself can convey emotions which influence\naesthetic response: “There is no rule in painting or statuary\nmore indispensable than that of balancing the figures, and placing\nthem with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity. A\nfigure, which is not justly balanced, is ugly; because it conveys the\ndisagreeable ideas of fall, harm, and pain” (EPM, 245). \nThus, Hume blocks the conclusion that all taste is equal by\ndistinguishing between two points of view that we can adopt toward any\nperson, object, or action. We can respond from the point of view of\nour own self-interest. But this response is prejudiced and often\nproduces “a false relish” (EPM, 173). Or we can respond\nfrom the general point of view, a reflective evaluation that is not\nmotivated by self-interest. The general point of view is influenced by\nmyriad beliefs about the object and its context. For example,\nbelieving that something is rare greatly magnifies our pleasure (S,\n224). Where self-interest might make me jealous of your new home and\nwill interfere with the sentiment of beauty, a reflective response\nwill allow me to appreciate its construction and design. \nFor Hume, normative conflicts can only be resolved by moving to a\nproperly informed general perspective, with “just conclusions\ndrawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and\ngeneral facts fixed and ascertained” (EPM, 173). The essay on\ntaste defends this position and outlines a theory of how critics can\nplace themselves in such a position: \nHume also invokes the operation of a sympathetic sentiment. Since\nsympathy plays an important role in his moral theory (T, 577; EPM,\n225), he must include it in his aesthetic theory if he is to sustain\nthe close ties he posits between morals and aesthetics. The general\npoint of view takes notice of pleasure that the object is fitted to\nbring to other people. The idea of their benefit generates sympathetic\npleasure, increasing the sentiment of approbation (T,\n364–65). \nHowever, Hume’s claim that most judgments of beauty require some\nelement of sympathy (T, 363) becomes harder to maintain in cases of\nfine art. It is not clear how the appreciation of a sonnet or melody\ninvolves an idea of the value it has for others. Hume occasionally\ntalks as if artistic beauty is entirely a question of formal design.\nAnd he seems to think that the utility and therefore value of some art\nis the pleasure it affords (e.g., with poetry), as if he advocates an\nearly art-for-art’s-sake position. This interpretation is an\nobvious consequence of any interpretation that takes Hume to say that\nan object’s capacity to provide pleasure exhausts its aesthetic\nvalue. (This reading is endorsed by Levinson (2002) and challenged by\nShelley (2011, 2013.) But the fact that a poem pleases someone else,\nor even large numbers of people, does not encourage sympathetic\napprobation for the poem. \nA careful reading suggests that Hume neither separates the fine arts\nfrom the other arts nor places sympathy at the center of aesthetic\nresponse. From the start, he recognizes multiple reasons for\napprobation. He hypothesizes a general but not universal connection\nbetween artificial and natural forms and the appearance of utility (T,\n195). He offers examples of basic design in painting (T, 364–65)\nand of “unharmonious” literature (EPM, 224). Poetry has an\nobvious formal element. Reading begins with impressions of dark shapes\narranged in lines on white pages. Readers silently associate the\nprinted text with aural ideas (the voice of a human speaker). Through\nimaginative association, literary forms have expressive human\ncharacters that elicit sympathetic pleasure and pain. Yet a reader who\nis not engaged by the subject matter may still find value in the\n“style and ingenuity of the composition” (T, 98). Because\nHume does not operate with assumptions about the uniqueness of fine\nart, his theory cuts across the distinction between fine art and\nrhetoric. Good design and eloquence are beautiful and desirable in all\nartifacts and speech, not merely in fine art (E). \nWhere appropriate, the refined taste of a good critic will weigh the\nrelative contributions of all aspects of the object of taste. Formal\ndesign is a contributing excellence and not the sole focus of\naesthetic discrimination. To arrive at a proper moral judgment,\n“all the circumstances and relations must be previously known;\nand the mind, from the contemplation of the whole, feels some new\nimpression of affection or disgust, esteem or contempt, approbation or\nblame” (EPM, 290). Aesthetic discrimination works in the same\nway (EPM, 291). In some situations, a single inharmonious element can\nupset the beauty of the whole. Hume discusses such cases in “Of\nthe Standard of Taste.” But then what of tragic literature, in\nwhich sympathy produces ongoing unease? How can there be an impression\nof approbation for a tragic play? Hume addresses this problem in\n“Of Tragedy.” \nIn the wake of reader-response criticism, Hume is frequently\nchallenged for not making enough allowances for the legitimate\ndifferences that readers bring to the same piece of writing. No two\nreaders will respond with the same associations of ideas. So how can\nHume hypothesize a convergence of critical response? As a criticism of\nHume, this reply backfires. Hume concedes, “each mind perceives\na different beauty” (SOT, 268). But he recognizes an even more\nradical problem. He admits that every stable object is really a\n“fiction” posited by the operations of imagination and\nsentiment. We always “bestow on the objects a greater regularity\nthan what is observed in our mere perceptions” (T, 197).\nHowever, this philosophical grasp of the situation has no practical\neffect in making anyone skeptical of the existence of houses, trees,\nand books. It does not detract from the truth and falsity of what we\nordinarily say about them. Novels and plays and paintings are not\nspecial cases. Admitting that they call for complex operations of\nimagination does not differentiate them from other objects and should\nnot count against the possibility of critical judgment. \nThe crux of the problem is the difference between saying that\nHamlet is a play by William Shakespeare and saying that\nHamlet is a flawed play. The former claim expresses a matter\nof fact; the latter expresses a normative judgment. Both judgements\nstem from complex imaginative associations. The presence of\nimaginative thought poses no special problem for the convergence of\nevaluative discrimination. Hume’s primary problem is to explain\nhow sentiment, as the essential source of value judgments, is subject\nto principled dispute. Hume directly confronts this problem in\n“Of the Standard of Taste.” \nHume tells us that “Of the Standard of Taste” was written\nin some haste and exists only to permit publication of other essays\n(HL 2, 253). On the advice of Philip Stanhope, Hume removed “Of\nthe Immortality of the Soul” and “Of Suicide” from a\nplanned volume of new essays. His publisher informed him that the\nresulting volume was too slim to print, bind, and sell. Hume then\nbrought the book to an acceptable length by penning a new essay,\n“Of the Standard of Taste.” Hume made nearly two hundred\neditorial corrections over the subsequent twenty years and multiple\neditions, the majority of which involve punctuation. He never altered\nhis argument. The essay is his last word on any topic in\n“criticism.” In addition to its importance as an\nelaboration of Hume’s views, Kant read the essay in translation\nand it stands to Kant’s mature aesthetic theory in much the way\nthat Hume’s account of cause and effect stands to the\nCritique of Pure Reason. Succinct analyses of their\ncontrasting positions are provided by Kulenkampff (1990), Savile\n(1993, pp. 81–84), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 45–52). \nHume reminds us of the radical difference in kind between matters of\nfact and the pronouncements of sentiment. Verdicts of sentiment lack a\ntruth-value. So it is surprising to find him endorsing the position\nthat many judgments of taste are “absurd and ridiculous”\n(SOT, 269). Small differences affect taste, yet most people notice\nonly “the grosser and more palpable qualities of the\nobject” (SOT, 278). Only judges with a more refined taste will\nrespond to the “universal” appeal of superior art. Because\nrefinement demands considerable practice, such critics are few in\nnumbers. \nIt is tempting to read Hume’s argument as a move away from his\nsignature subjectivism and toward some brand of normative realism. But\na careful reading of the text reveals that nothing is said to deny his\nearlier support for subjectivism and there are no direct endorsements\nof realism. The standard of taste should provide rules for\n“confirming one sentiment, and condemning another” (SOT,\n268). On this topic, see Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 1984), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3–17). However, the standard is\nnormative: it must explain why the sentiments of some critics are\nbetter and worse. It does not follow that sentiments are true and\nfalse in any absolute sense. These reflections lead Hume to postulate\nfive criteria for identifying good or “true” critics:\n“Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by\npractice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can\nalone entitle critics to this valuable character” (SOT,\n278). \nAfter several stabs at identifying the standard of taste, Hume\nidentifies it as the consensus or “joint verdict” of\n“true critics” (SOT, 278–79). However, such critics\nare “rare” (SOT, 280) and “few are qualified to give\njudgment on any work of art” (SOT, 278). Consequently, it is not\nthe verdict of contemporary critics that constitutes the standard, but\nrather the consensus of qualified judges over time and from multiple\ncultures (SOT, 271; SOT, 280). The importance of the so-called\n“test of time” is emphasized by Savile (1982) and Levinson\n(2002). Either way, the proposal has been criticized on the grounds\nthat it posits a viciously circular analysis of aesthetic value:\naesthetically superior artworks are those endorsed by true critics,\nbut true critics are identified by their endorsement of the best art.\nWhere earlier commentators tend to see circularity, as with Brown\n(1938) and Noxon (1961), more recent interpretations follow Kivy\n(1967) and see a regress problem. Circularity is avoided by\nidentifying good critics who satisfy the five criteria, but this\ngenerates new evaluative questions, for we must determine if their\nresponses are sufficiently delicate, grounded in the\nright comparisons, and so on. For further discussion, see\nCarroll (1984, pp. 189–191), Gracyk (1994, pp. 175–177),\nand Baceski (2013). Based on these problems, some readings of the\nessay reject the joint verdict of critics as Hume’s standard.\nFor example, Costelloe (2007, pp. 2–14) argues that the\n“general rules of art” are his actual standard. \nFurthermore, there is disagreement on the question of whether Hume\nholds that these true critics will be uniform in their verdicts.\nInterpretation of Hume’s position is complicated by the way that\nhe consistently affirms his motivating insight, borrowed from\nHutcheson, that sentiment is the essence of evaluation. Even the worst\ncritic says nothing false in foolishly saying that one work is better\nthan another, however misguided their sentiment. Passages where even\nthe best critics will diverge in their evaluations are emphasized by\nWieand (1984), Savile (1993, pp. 70–71), and Mothersill (1997).\nMost notably, all critics have “innocent and unavoidable”\npreferences (SOT, 281) and so they are better or worse at evaluating\ndifferent categories of art. Furthermore, these preferences change\nduring the lifetime of each critic. Consequently, the critical\njudgments of some critics will diverge from those of other highly\nqualified critics. But when critics’ differences arise from\nunavoidable and “blameless,” preferences, there is no\ninterference of prejudice (SOT, 280). In short, the problem of finding\na standard of taste leads Hume to the problem of deciding which\ndisagreements are blameless, in order to distinguish them from\nprejudices that disqualify a sentiment as a public recommendation. \nThis reading of Hume is challenged by an interpretation that\nidentifies the standard of taste with ideal critics. (The phrase does\nnot appear in Hume.) That is, instead of real people who can guide us\ndespite their unavoidable and intransigent biases, Hume’s true\ncritics are ideal or perfect evaluators. The case that Hume’s\ncritics are ideal critics who never disagree is made by Shelley (1994,\n2003) and Costelloe (2007, pp. 17–18), and disputed in various\nways by Guyer (2005), Ross (2008), Galgut (2012), and\nDurà-Vilà (2015). \nHume highlights only two sources that contribute to\n“blameless,” differences of sentiment among qualified\ncritics: basic dispositions of character, and moral differences\narising from cultural differences (SOT, 280). Today, we are more\nlikely to notice a third source of disagreement, Hume’s\nrecognition that different objects reflect distinct species of beauty.\nBecoming a qualified judge of epic poetry does not contribute to being\na qualified judge of architecture. Addison is a better writer than\nJohn Locke, but the comparison assumes that they are both writing\nphilosophy (EHU, 7). We can compare John Milton and John Ogilby, and\nonly a false critic would rank Ogilby above Milton (SOT, 269). But it\nmakes no sense to compare Milton and Addison, for Milton is a poet,\nnot a philosopher. \nFurthermore, different cultures employ different customs when handling\nthe same artistic medium. “You will never convince a man, who is\nnot accustomed to Italian music, and has not an ear to follow its\nintricacies, that a Scotch tune is not preferable” (S, 217). So\nthe good critic must overcome the challenge of cultural prejudice.\n“A critic of a different age or nation, who should peruse this\ndiscourse, must have all these circumstances in his eye, and must\nplace himself in the same situation as the audience, in order to form\na true judgment of the oration” (SOT, 276). Hume emphasizes the\ngreat difficulties involved in overcoming the prejudices of\none’s time and place (SOT, 281–82). \nIn the wake of a post-Kantian tradition that endorses art’s\nautonomy, many readers balk at Hume’s strong endorsement of the\nrelevance moral judgment upon aesthetic evaluation (SOT,\n283–84). Hume discusses the moral failing of several plays (SOT,\n284) and of the Koran, considered as a literary\n“performance” (SOT, 267). How can Hume reconcile this\nposition with his endorsement of Batteux’s influential thesis,\nin which the mechanical arts are distinguished from fine art by the\nfact that the latter exists only to provide pleasure? (“Of\nTragedy” proceeds as if literature exists solely to provide the\npleasure of the experience.) But there is also a side of Hume that\nrefuses to distinguish between literature and other,\n“practical” writing. Every work of art is evaluated\naccording to its distinctive purpose, with poetry alone singled out as\nhaving the purpose of “pleasing” the imagination (SOT,\n277). Ultimately, there is very little art that Hume might treat as\nart-for-art’s-sake. \nThere should be no great surprise that Hume insists that moral\njudgments must sometimes enter into our aesthetic evaluations. (Good\nintroductions to Hume’s view are provided by Mason (2001),\nDadlez (2002), and Winegar (2011).) Hume does not offer a sharp\ndistinction between moral and aesthetic taste. Evaluations that\nsubsequent aesthetic theories regard as a purely aesthetic are, for\nHume, concluding sentiments following numerous observations of\ncontributing strengths and weaknesses. When a work of art represents\nhuman activity, then Hume’s account of moral evaluation requires\nthat moral sentiment accompany apprehension of the action. The\nfictional status of the work weakens our sympathetic response, but the\nmere sequence of ideas will be sufficient to produce weaker versions\nof the sentiments that one would have if one were faced with the\nactual events. Given Hume’s moral theory, there is no\npossibility of suspending our moral response. Moral sentiments are\nnatural and immediate. At best, one can gain a better understanding of\nthe cultural context responsible for the work, so that one’s\nmoral sentiments will not be negative through mere prejudice.\nHume’s theory of sentiments requires that if we are going to\nhave an aesthetic evaluation of a play’s plotting and language,\nthen we are also going to have a moral response to its display of\nvirtue and vice. Both must enter into our final sentiment of\napprobation or disapprobation. \nAlthough Hume emphasizes the variety of responses that different\ngroups and individuals have with the same works, some sources of\npreference are “blameless” (SOT, 280) and\n“innocent” (SOT, 281). Despite myriad differences, there\nare two basic types of taste: vulgar taste and refined taste. Given\nhis thorough anti-realism about values, Hume cannot dismiss vulgar\ntaste as subjective and mistaken. Hume has a different strategy for\nrecommending refined taste as the more objective of the pair. Vulgar\ntaste is more idiosyncratic and capricious. Refined taste is more\nproperly rule-governed and stable. The two are equally subject to\n“rules,” but the person of refined taste is better\ninformed about the material. \nHume’s contrast of vulgar and refined taste parallels his\ngeneral treatment of the doxastic positions of the vulgar and the wise\n(T, 150; EHU, 110). Vulgar thinking is dominated by “the first\ninfluence of general rules” upon the mind. Such rules are\ninstinctively but “rashly formed” to regulate the\nimagination. If these rules are allowed to govern thought in the\nabsence of further reflection and refinement, the result is prejudice\ninstead of wisdom. (T, 146,150) The wise, in contrast, take care to\nsurvey the broadest possible range of experience, allowing a\n“second influence of general rules” to supplant the first.\nIn this manner, the “capricious and uncertain” ideas of\nthe vulgar give way to “the more general and authentic\noperations of the understanding” and the superior judgments of\nthe wise (T, 150). As for the normative question of why the refined\njudgments of the wise are preferable to the rash prejudices of the\nvulgar, Hume is content that moral sense assigns approbation to the\n“original instincts” underlying moral and aesthetic taste\n(T, 619). \nHaving argued that we can overcome prejudice and make superior\nassessments of ordinary matters of fact, Hume imports his contrast of\nvulgarity and wisdom into his aesthetic theory. Sound understanding\nmakes inferences and arrives at a belief. Beliefs influence taste.\nAlthough a judgment of taste terminates in a reflective passion,\nrather than in a belief with a truth-value, taste employs operations\nof the imagination subject to rules internalized by the judging\nsubject. Consequently, the contrast between first and second\ninfluences of general rules applies as much to taste as to\n“wisdom.” Vulgar taste should betray the same degree of\ncapriciousness and prejudice as vulgar reasoning. Good taste, in\ncontrast, should be more stable, for it will display “a certain\npoint of view” appropriate to its object (SOT, 276). Refined\ntaste reflects what Hume elsewhere calls the “more\ngeneral” view. As with moral response, good taste meets with\napprobation while a prejudiced taste “loses all credit and\nauthority” (SOT, 277). However, as a matter of interpretation,\nHume’s references to a requisite “delicacy of\nimagination” (SOT, 272) complicate and obscure the account, for\nit is not clear what this delicacy is, nor how it contributes to a\nmore settled, general view. Recent explorations of this problem\ninclude Townsend (2001, pp. 204–206), and Gracyk (2011). \nSo what are the rules of taste, over and above any rules or principles\ninvolved in sound judgment about the object of taste? Surprisingly,\nHume never offers a clear case of one. At least two proposals about\nsuch rules can be extracted from Hume’s example of\nSancho’s kin and the hogshead of wine, Hume’s\n“evidence” that there are general rules of taste (SOT,\n272–73). On the one hand, it is tempting to read the rules as\nstrictly parallel with the empirical laws discussed in the\nTreatise and first Enquiry. If so, they are causal\nlaws specifying which properties and combinations of properties cause\nwhat kind and degree of pleasure. An example might be, “An\naftertaste of iron or leather reduces the pleasure taken in an\notherwise good wine.” Unfortunately, such rules seem suitable\nonly for arriving at some probability about the likely effect of\ndrinking such wine. Applying such a rule may result in a belief about\nthe wine, but knowing the rule would not encourage the requisite\nsentiment. Where we can find them, rules of this sort are useful for\nseparating true from pretend critics, if only in allowing us to point\nout inconsistencies in critical response (SOT 273–74). \nBut general rules of taste have a second function. Even if rules\n“had never been methodized” (SOT, 273), their existence\nsupports the view that practice and comparison improves taste (SOT,\n275). Those with adequate experience of a particular art form will\nperceive cases with greater accuracy. The existence of rules gives\nreason to agree that practice heightens the subject’s awareness\nof disruptive impressions (the taste of iron) and missing impressions\n(no fruity bouquet), resulting in a more reflective adjudication of\nthe whole experience. They will also direct the imagination to expect\nvarious combinations of properties in light of one’s recognition\nthat it is a thing of a specific kind. Properly amended to reflect\nmental rather than bodily taste, the story of Sancho’s kinsmen\nunderlies the whole argument of “The Standard of Taste.”\nEven if the rule has not been formalized, the wine taster will operate\nas if reasoning from a rule (e.g., “since this is red wine, it\nwill have a fruity bouquet but no hint of leather or iron”). The\nexperienced reader or viewer will approach art with “the same\nexcellence of faculties which contributes to the improvement of\nreason” (SOT, 278), discovering the true character of the object\nwithin “the disorder, in which they are presented” (SOT,\n273). \n“Of Tragedy” grapples with a very different set of\nproblems than “Of the Standard of Taste.” The motivating\nissue in “Of Tragedy” is that of unpleasant emotion as a\npositive feature of a work. Hume proposes to explain how “a\nwell-written tragedy” is pleasing when that pleasure appears to\ndepend on “sorrow, terror, anxiety,” and other naturally\ndisagreeable emotions (OT, 258). Hume had visited this topic before,\nin the Treatise, where his account of the pleasure of tragedy\ninvokes pity and sympathy (T, 369). “Of Tragedy” replaces\nthis earlier account with a complex proposal about the mental workings\nof imagination in relation to our negative passions. \nOriginally published beside “Of the Standard of Taste” in\nFour Dissertations, “Of Tragedy” is a peculiar\nessay. Its direct engagement with Bernard de Fontenelle and the\nAbbé Jean-Baptiste Dubos confirms Hume’s acquaintance\nwith French aesthetics. Hume makes passing reference to catharsis in\nhis mention of spectator cries and sobs that “give vent to their\nsorrow” (OT, 258), but there is no evidence of familiarity with\nAristotle’s Poetics. On the whole, the essay says\nsurprisingly little about the nature of tragedy, and what it says is\ncombined with discussions of melodramas and historical writing. Its\nreal topic is the experience of conflicting emotions directed\nsimultaneously at a single object, a topic treated in the\nTreatise. Because the pleasure offered by tragedy and\nmelodrama depends on and is proportionate with their capacity to\narouse grief, fear, and other unpleasant passions, Hume uses\nliterature and theater as an occasion to elaborate on his theory of\nmixed emotions. As Hume formulates it, the problem is to explain the\nnature of the relationship between our approbation, which is\npleasurable, and the presence of “sorrow, terror,\nanxiety,” and other naturally disagreeable emotions (OT, 258).\nThe solution, Hume claims, is that any emotion “which attends a\npassion, is easily converted into it, though in their natures they be\noriginally different from, and even contrary to each other” (T,\n419). \nAlthough published side by side, “Of Tragedy” and\n“Of the Standard of Taste” may offer conflicting\ndoctrines. In the essay on taste, the unchallenged appearance of vice\nis treated as a flaw, and unpleasant emotion is a defect. But when\n“Of Tragedy” identifies a flaw in Nicholas Rowe’s\nThe Ambitious Stepmother, the play’s defect is not the\nendorsement of vice. Instead, its flaw is the staging of action that\nis “too bloody and atrocious” (OT, 264). But why is\n“shocking” spectacle a flaw that leads to general\ndisapprobation? Is it simply a question of the degree of shock? But\nwhy should that prevent the audiences from “converting”\nthe shock into a “contrary” and pleasurable experience, as\nHume claims happens with terror and anxiety? The obstacle does not\nseem to be moral in nature, of the sort explored in “Of the\nStandard of Taste” where Hume discusses a work’s failure\nto direct proper disapprobation at vicious manners. The essay on taste\nsuggests that the same content would not be a flaw if proper\nadjustments were made. But “Of Tragedy” does not call\nattention to the moral dimension of Rowe’s play. So “Of\nTragedy” is a discourse on an interesting puzzle about human\npsychology, namely the fact that unpleasant elements can be either\nstrengths or ruinous defects. “Of Tragedy” says nothing\nabout moralism and art. \nHume’s account of tragic pleasure has two components. First,\ndifferent features of the work must generate the viewer’s\nagreeable and disagreeable responses. Disagreeable aspects contribute\nto our general approbation because those properties are balanced by\nnaturally agreeable properties. Second, a general psychological\nprinciple explains how it is possible for competing emotions to\nproduce a complex, pleasing sentiment. Borrowed from the\nTreatise (T, 419), that principle holds that when the same\nobject produces different passions, even those “of a contrary\nnature,” then the subordinate passion can be\n“converted” into the predominant (OT, 262). “Of\nTragedy” combines these two ideas. Our natural delight in\n“imitation” provides a strong and predominant passion. The\nnaturally disagreeable emotions aroused by the plot provide a\nsubordinate and contrary emotion, the “movement” of which\n“fortifies” the predominant passion. Unless the negative\nemotion becomes predominant, the overall effect of a well-written\ntragedy will be an audience “pleased in proportion as they are\nafflicted” (OT 258). The details of Hume’s theory are\nexplored by Cohen (1962), Budd (1991), Neill (1992, 1999), and Dadlez\n(2004, 2016). \nAlthough Hume illustrates his general principle with numerous\nexamples, few of his contemporaries or modern interpreters endorse his\ntheory. A rare exception is Galgut (2001). Famously, the theory faces\nmultiple objections. It offers no working definition of tragedy and\nits examples are not, for the most part, genuine tragedies, points\nnoted by Neill (1999). The details of Hume’s examples raise\nfurther issues. For example, Hume thinks it is obvious that\nRowe’s play fails due to its gory and shocking spectacle, which\ntips the balance in the wrong direction. But the obvious reply is that\nmany viewers enjoy the spectacle of violence. Hume basically says so:\n“The English theatre abounds too much with such shocking\nimages” (OT, 265). How can Hume contend that the play is ruined\nwhen so many viewers enjoy it? For there is no appeal except to\nsentiment. \nPerhaps Hume thinks that shocking spectacle satisfies vulgar taste but\nnot refined taste. “Of the Standard of Taste” posits\ndifferences in audience members to account for different responses.\nHume’s sketchy theory in “Of Tragedy” is compatible\nwith most people enjoying aesthetically uninteresting works, for\nroutine design readily delights most people (SOT, 276). But a refined\ntaste is equally sensitive to all facets of the work, including formal\ndesign. Just as the wine tasted funny to Sancho’s kinsmen (SOT,\n272–73), a run-of-the-mill work “gives pain” to true\ncritics (SOT, 276). Only the best critics worry about the absence of\ngenius. \nThe rules of taste endorsed in “Of the Standard of Taste”\nfacilitate habituated expectations based on previous experiences with\nsimilar art. Aesthetic pleasure frequently depends on\n“custom” (T, 299) and on associations and expectations\ndeveloped by the life experiences of the intended audience. If\naudience expectations are violated by excessive violence, and if there\nis no compensating reward for its inclusion, then the work has been\nimproperly staged for its intended audience. But works that merely\nsatisfy expectations will please the less discerning critics. Hence\n“shocking images” that are routine in English theater will\nplease the audience. The same gory spectacle and “dismal”\nstories, insufficiently “softened” by genius and\neloquence, will displease a refined taste (OT, 265). \nUnfortunately, this interpretation merely heightens the problem. What\nis it that rewards vulgar taste? Why does violent spectacle attract\nanyone to routine, predictable potboilers? Natural sympathy should\narouse uneasiness at the gory spectacle, yet the vulgar have no\ncompensating reward. Brilliant language is surely an attraction of\nShakespeare’s Othello, but no such achievement is to be\nfound in most of the popular fiction that reliably delights its\naudience. Hume even implies that the vulgar do not attend to\n“eloquence” and similar formal achievement. However, the\nmere fact of “imitation” seems insufficient to explain the\npredominant pleasure in the face of this material. Is it the\nspectacle’s “exactness of imitation” (SOT, 276)? But\nthat would seem to be a compensating pleasure in all but the most\ninept production, and would lead us to expect that vulgar audiences\nwould respond with equal pleasure to almost any inferior work that\nmeets their expectations. But this is simply not the case. “Of\nTragedy” does not meet the standards of argument and insight set\nby Hume’s other contributions to aesthetics.","contact.mail":"gracyk@mnstate.edu","contact.domain":"mnstate.edu"}]
