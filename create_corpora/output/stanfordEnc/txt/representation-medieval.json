These notions\nhave a parallel history in medieval philosophy as well, but it has\nbeen intentionality that has attracted medieval scholars’\nattention (for example, in Knudsen 1982, Pasnau 1997, Perler 2001 and\nPerler 2002). There have only been a few studies on mental\nrepresentation (Tweedale 1990, Pasnau 1997, King 2007 and Lagerlund\n2007a).\n\n\n\nOne major reason for the interest in intentionality in medieval\nphilosophy is that it has been widely recognized that Franz Brentano\nwas reviving a scholastic notion when he introduced intentionality as\n“the mark of the mental” (Brentano 1874). But Brentano never used the\nterminology of representation to explicate intentionality. This was\ndone much later, in post-Wittgensteinian philosophy of mind. In later\nmedieval philosophy, it was, however, standard to explain the content\nof a thought by referring to its representational nature.\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of theories of mental representation in medieval\nphilosophy, which were intensely discussed from the twelfth century up\nto the time of Descartes. This article will briefly trace the history\nof the terminology and also give a brief outline of the main theories\ndeveloped during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\n\n\n\nThe English words ‘representation’ and ‘to\nrepresent’ derive via Old French from the Latin words\n‘repraesentatio’ and ‘repraesentare,’ but\nthese are by no means commonly used words in classical Latin. In late\nancient thought it is foremost Quintilian and Tertullian that uses\nthe terms in a philosophically interesting way. It was not until the\ntwelfth century Latin translation of Avicenna’s De anima that\nthese terms became frequently used in connection with cognition and\nthe mind or the intellective soul (see Lagerlund 2007b). \n\nThe Latin translators of Avicenna rendered several related terms in\nArabic all related to cognition and the internal senses with the Latin\n‘repraesentatio’. In doing so they, intentionally or not,\nformed the concept of representations in the soul. Representation in\nthe Latin translation of Avicenna is associated with all five\nfaculties. Forms received through the common sense and stored in the\nphantasia are called representations. The imaginative or cogitative\nfaculty combines and divides representations collected in the phantasia\nto make new representations, which might not have any real object\ncorresponding to them. The senses apprehend the sensible forms of the\nobjects perceived and the estimative faculty apprehends the\n‘intentio’ or ‘ma’na’ of the perceived\nobject. Representations in the imagination are also the basis for\nintellectual activity, according to this view of cognition: \n\nAvicenna here describes the process of abstraction, or how the\nrepresentation in the imagination of particular things becomes\nuniversal in the intellect. The universal forms are abstracted from\nrepresentations in the imagination and flow from the active intellect\ninto the passive. Note, however, that the terminology of\nrepresentation is never used in relation to the intellect. It is\nalways the internal senses that represent in Avicenna and not the\nintellect or the external senses (see Lagerlund 2007b, for a table of\nthe whole range of terms translated by ‘representation’ in\nAvicenna’s works.) \n\nOne of the reasons ‘representation’ is only used for the\ninternal senses is that representations are thought of as images. The\nnotion of linguistic representations or representations as signs is\nnot present in Avicenna’s work or any other work of the time. It seems\ninstead to derive from logic. Early logic works like Garlandus\nCompotista’s Dialectica (17) and\nAbelard’s Dialectica (II, 188) discussed a distinction\nbetween a word’s signification by imposition and representation. A\ndenominative term such as ‘white’ signifies by imposition\na substance that is white, but it signifies by representation the\nwhiteness inhering in the substance. The white thing stands in for or\nis an instantiation of whiteness; white is re-presented in the\nobject. Garlandus mentions the example of a traveler\n(‘viator’) who can be said to represent a road\n(‘via’). The term ‘traveler’ signifies by\nimposition the human being who is a traveler, but also represents the\nroad the traveler travels on. It is exactly this usage of\nrepresentation applied to mental signs that becomes important with\nOckham and Buridan. \n\nThe most influential theory of thought in the thirteenth century goes\nback to Aristotle and has its foremost medieval defender in Thomas\nAquinas. It rests on viewing mental representations or intelligible\nspecies, as Aquinas calls them, as sameness of form. The explanation\nfor why thoughts are about something, exhibit intentionality, or\nrepresent is that the form of the object thought about is in the mind\nof the thinker. According to a popular metaphor, thinking something, on this view, is being the object thought\nabout in the sense that the intellect becomes the object or takes on its form. \n\nFollowing Aristotle in De anima III.4, Aquinas argues, that\nthe mind or the intellective part of the soul has no nature or rather\nit is nothing before it thinks of something. The active intellect\nabstracts the intelligible species from the sensitive species in the\ninternal senses and places it in the potential intellect. Aquinas is\nhere very close to the view we saw Avicenna defend above. The species\nactualizes the potential intellect as a form actualizes a potency. The\nintelligible species in the potential intellect constitutes the\nthought. The intellect is immaterial, according to Aquinas, and since\nhe also famously thinks that matter is the principle of individuation,\nthe intelligible species in the potential intellect is not individual,\nbut universal. This is why Aquinas holds that a thought is always\nuniversal.  \n\nThere are many problems associated with this view of mental\nrepresentation. A famous problem is: why are the daffodils outside my\nsoul not about my thought of the daffodils? The forms inside and\noutside my mind are the same, suggesting that mental representation is\nsymmetrical. Aquinas has a famous answer to this problem, which is\nthat the daffodils in the garden are not about my thought because of\nthe mode of the form’s presence in them. The forms in the daffodils\nare really or naturally present whereas in my mind the universal form is\nspiritually or intentionally present. \n\nThe distinction between forms being really/naturally or spiritually/intentionally present is\ncentral to Aquinas’s theory of cognition. A form may be present\nsomewhere without literally making whatever substance it informs into\nsomething else. Colors in the air, for example, do not make the air\nreally colored: we see colors in the objects around us but not in the\nintervening air, although they must be there spiritually if sensation\nis to be a causal process. This means, of course, that the air must\nsomehow contain the color, which entails that intentionality is not a\nmark of the mental for Aquinas. The air is not in itself a mind (for\ndiscussion, see Pasnau 1997, Chap. 2). \n\nOne of the first to criticize the species theory of\ncognition, in the late thirteenth century, was Peter Olivi. He argued,\ncontrary to Aristotle and Aquinas, that the mind is active in its\ncognition of the world; it attends to the object, and it is this move\non his part that puts the species theory of cognition in a completely\ndifferent light. In fact, there seems little point in postulating a\nspecies through which the object is cognized. He argues: \n\nIn this passage, it seems clear that for Olivi the species is a thing\nin itself and that there really are three things involved in the\ncognition of an object: the object, the species, and the cognizer. The\nspecies is on his view a representation, namely a thing that stands in\nfor the object in the mind. The main problem he sees with the theory\nis hence epistemological. How can we be sure we are cognizing the\nobject and not the species (see Toivanen 2009, Chap. 4). Olivi hence\nargues that this third representing thing is not needed and that the\nmind can attend to the object directly. Ockham is later on in the\nearly fourteenth century to repeat a similar argument against the\nspecies theory. \n\nBoth Olivi and Ockham seem to take it for granted that species are\nrepresentations and hence a thing added to the object and the\ncognizer. There were, however, two versions of the species theory of\ncognition in the thirteenth century. The most influential one was\nforemost associated with Roger Bacon. According to him, species are\nrepresentations, that is, real extended images like objects\nrepresenting the thing cognized to the cognizer. The other version of\nthe theory was defended by Aquinas. According to him, species were not\nrepresentations but the forms themselves of the objects cognized under\na different mode of being. The species were not real but spiritual and\nas such there are no physical change of for example the eye in a\nvisual perception; only a spiritual one. \n\nOlivi’s objection mentioned above does not apply to Aquinas’ theory\nsince species are not real representations on that view. Olivi himself\nseems aware of this, however, and says that if the species has\nspiritual being, then they cannot: “truly and naturally flow from\na natural, corporeal form, [and] not really and truly inform a natural\nbody, e.g. the air or the eye.” (Sententiarum II, q. 73,\n87.) On Aquinas’ theory the species cannot affect the sense organ and\ncause a cognition, he seems to think. The species cannot hence fulfill\nthe role they are supposed to play in a theory of cognition or a\ntheory of vision. \n\nOlivi does not straight our reject all species, however, since he\nthinks memory utilizes species. These species are representations and\nthey are constructed by us. He explains it in the following\npassage: \n\nThis is the most common usage of species after Olivi, that is, that\nspecies are representative (see Adriaenssen 2017).  For various reasons, the late thirteenth century saw an increased\ninterest in epistemology. One reason for this was the development of\nnew theories of mental representations and intentionality. Some of\nthese developments were due to problematic features of, on the one\nhand, Aquinas’s view of mental representation and on the other,\nof Henry of Ghent’s interpretation of Augustine’s view of\ndivine cognition. Aquinas seems to have held that the intelligible\nspecies is supposed to play a dual role both as a universal common to\nall of us thinking it and as my individual thought. It is hard to see\nhow such a view can be maintained without the introduction of some\nkind of distinction. Henry on the other hand reinterprets\nAugustine’s doctrine of divine ideas and introduces a\ndistinction between the ideas and the divine nature. The ideas are\npossibilia or the natures of possible things to be created (de Rijk\n2005:81–84).  Both of these views contribute to the introduction of a\ndistinction between the vehicle and the content of a\nrepresentation. The distinction developed by Henry in relation to the\ndivine nature was almost immediately taken up into the debates about\nhuman cognition. It was applied to Aquinas’s theory of mental\nrepresentation, taking it a step further by introducing a distinction\nbetween the thing representing and the thing represented.   John Duns Scotus was instrumental in adapting this view to human\ncognition. Scotus’s implemented Henry’s distinction and\ntreated the thing that does the representing as a mental act or\nconcept, which ontologically speaking is an accident of the mind, and\nthe thing represented as the form of the object thought about. Scotus\nclaimed that the accident or mental act is subjectively in the soul,\nwhereas the object being represented is present objectively, or has\nobjective being in the mind. He also said that the object exists as\nrepresented to express the content side of the mental representation\n(Ord. I, d. 3, pars 3, q. 1, n. 382) Scouts can through this\ndistinction also maintain that all spiritual change supervenes on a\nreal change (see Cross 2014).   Scotus thus had a clear way of expressing what Brentano later\ncalled intentionality, that is, the way the object of thought exists\nin the mind. It has objective existence in the mind on his view, which\nlater came to be regarded as the mark of the mental (see Normore 1986;\nPasnau 2003; King 2007; Cross 2014). Although the advantages of this\napproach over Aquinas’s are clear, problems remains concerning\nthe ontological status of these mental contents. The medieval debate\nhere is famous and features a wide variety of opinions (for a survey,\nsee Tachau 1988). Scotus himself says that thought objects have a\ndiminished kind of being, which is supposed to be a state between real\nbeing and no being at all. Although first accepting a similar view,\nOckham would later subject this view to much criticism.  The theory of mental language in the fourteenth century was\nforemost developed by William Ockham. It rests on a theory of mental\nrepresentation that combined the notions of cause and signification. A\nconcept or a mental term on this view represents because it is caused\nefficiently by a thing in the world. It signifies that thing also\nbecause of the causal relation between them. On Ockham’s view, a\nmental representation or concept is caused by an intuitive\ncognition. He explains: \n\nAccording to Ockham’s metaphysics there are only individuals in the\nworld so that when an individual causes a concept to exist in the\nmind, it causes an individual concept and hence a singular conception\nof itself. Nothing else can cause that concept (except perhaps\nGod). The singular concept functions as the word of the object that\ncaused it in our language of thought. It is an atomic constituent that\ncan then be combined to form more complex concepts or sentences in the\nlanguage. \n\nOckham’s notion of concept acquisition and mental representation is\ndeveloped as part of a very sophisticated theory of thought involving\nnot only a theory of signification, but also a whole range of\nlogico-semantic properties such as connotation and supposition. It\nexplains how concepts, which in turn are the direct objects of belief\nand knowledge, are assembled into mental sentences describing the\nworld (for the details, see Panaccio 2004). \n\nOckham and John Buridan’s accounts of thought are on the one hand very\nsimilar, but on the other hand there are fundamental differences\nbetween them. This is particularly true about their view of mental\nrepresentation. A case in point is their views of singular\nthought. They both start out from the same idea, that is, that\nthinking something singular is having a singular concept in mind, but\nthey disagree fundamentally on what a singular concept looks like and\nforemost on how it manages to latch onto the world. On Ockham’s\naccount a concept is singular because its cause was proper, as he\ncalls it, and proper causes are necessarily tied to one object. But on\nBuridan’s account, a singular concept is singular because of its\ncomplexity. (Meaning pure semantic complexity, according to\nKlima 2001: xxxviii–xlii and 2009: 40–56) It has a descriptive content\nthat enables it to narrow down its signification to only one\nthing. (For the significance of this difference from Ockham, see Klima\n2009: 69–89) \n\nBuridan thinks that we always cognize or conceive of something first\nas singular, but this also means that we first conceive of it as this\nor that, that is, we conceive of it as something. For him, this means\nthat our concepts are from the very beginning loaded with some content\nand a fully singular concept picks out whatever it is of or represent\nin all circumstances. Such a concept is determinate and not vague,\nsince it applies to only one thing, but it is also not what we first\nacquire, Buridan thinks. The first singular concepts acquired are\nso-called vague singular concepts. A vague concept is singular because\nit is about only one thing, but it is not determined what thing that\nis; examples of such concepts are ‘this human,’\n‘this cup,’ hence the name ‘vague\nsingulars’. It is from these we arrive at determinate singular\nconcepts by adding content and at universal concepts by abstracting\naway from singularizing circumstances. \n\nTo explain how this process works, he uses an example that, after him,\nbecame a standard example used to explain singular cognition. In the\nexample, Socrates approaches from afar. At first, I cannot tell\nexactly what I see approaching; something (a substance) is coming\ncloser and closer to me. After a while, I see that it is an animal of\nsome sort, but I cannot tell exactly what kind of animal it is. As it\ncomes closer, I realize that it is a human being, and, finally, when\nhe is close enough, I recognize Socrates (see Normore 2007).  Although this example seems to have had a long tradition (Black\n2011), nowhere else did it play as important a role as it does for\nBuridan and some of his followers. Cognition, it shows, is always in\nthe first instance about ‘that thing,’ ‘that\nanimal,’ ‘that human being,’ and finally about\n‘Socrates.’ Hence, it is always about a singular thing in\nthe first instance. The example can be found in John Buridan, Nicholas\nOresme, Marsilius of Inghen, Peter of Ailly, Gabriel Biel, as well as\nThomas Hobbes, and all these authors used it in virtually the same\nway. The example can thus be said to reform the theory of thought\ndeveloped by Ockham (see Lagerlund 2006 and Lagerlund 2014).","contact.mail":"henrik.lagerlund@philosophy.su.se","contact.domain":"philosophy.su.se"}]
