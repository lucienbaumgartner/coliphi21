Every branch of science draws upon\nlarge and often diverse portions of mathematics, from the use of\nHilbert spaces in quantum mechanics to the use of differential\ngeometry in general relativity. It’s not just the physical sciences\nthat avail themselves of the services of mathematics either. Biology,\nfor instance, makes extensive use of difference equations and\nstatistics. The roles mathematics plays in these theories is also\nvaried. Not only does mathematics help with empirical predictions, it\nallows elegant and economical statement of many theories. Indeed, so\nimportant is the language of mathematics to science, that it is hard\nto imagine how theories such as quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity could even be stated without employing a substantial amount\nof mathematics.  \n\n\n\nFrom the rather remarkable but seemingly uncontroversial fact that\nmathematics is indispensable to science, some philosophers have drawn\nserious metaphysical conclusions. In particular, Quine (1976; 1980a;\n1980b; 1981a; 1981c) and Putnam (1979a; 1979b) have argued that the\nindispensability of mathematics to empirical science gives us good\nreason to believe in the existence of mathematical entities. According\nto this line of argument, reference to (or quantification over)\nmathematical entities such as sets, numbers, functions and such is\nindispensable to our best scientific theories, and so we ought to be\ncommitted to the existence of these mathematical entities. To do\notherwise is to be guilty of what Putnam has called\n“intellectual dishonesty” (Putnam 1979b,\np. 347). Moreover, mathematical entities are seen to be on an\nepistemic par with the other theoretical entities of science, since\nbelief in the existence of the former is justified by the same\nevidence that confirms the theory as a whole (and hence belief in the\nlatter). This argument is known as the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument for mathematical realism. There are other indispensability\narguments, but this one is by far the most influential, and so in what\nfollows, we’ll mostly focus on it. \n\n\n\nIn general, an indispensability argument is an argument that purports\nto establish the truth of some claim based on the indispensability of\nthe claim in question for certain purposes (to be specified by the\nparticular argument). For example, if explanation is\nspecified as the purpose, then we have an explanatory indispensability\nargument. Thus we see that inference to the best explanation is a\nspecial case of an indispensability argument. See the introduction of\nField (1989, pp.  14–20) for a nice discussion of\nindispensability arguments and inference to the best explanation. See\nalso Maddy (1992) and Resnik (1995a) for variations on the\nQuine-Putnam version of the argument.  We should add that although\nthe version of the argument presented here is generally attributed to\nQuine and Putnam, it differs in a number of ways from the arguments\nadvanced by either Quine or \nPutnam.[1]\n\n\n\nThe Quine-Putnam indispensability argument has attracted a great deal\nof attention, in part because many see it as the best argument for\nmathematical realism (or platonism). Thus anti-realists about\nmathematical entities (or nominalists) need to identify where the\nQuine-Putnam argument goes wrong. Many platonists, on the other hand,\nrely very heavily on this argument to justify their belief in\nmathematical entities. The argument places nominalists who wish to be\nrealist about other theoretical entities of science (quarks, electrons,\nblack holes and such) in a particularly difficult position. For\ntypically they accept something quite like the Quine-Putnam\n argument[2])\nas justification for realism about quarks and black holes. (This is\nwhat Quine (1980b, p. 45) calls holding a “double standard” with regard\nto ontology.)  \n\nFor future reference, we’ll state the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument in the following explicit form: \n\n(P2) Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific\ntheories. \n\n(C) We ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical\nentities. \n\nThus formulated, the argument is valid. This forces the focus onto the\ntwo premises. In particular, a couple of important questions naturally\narise. The first concerns how we are to understand the claim that\nmathematics is indispensable.  We address this in the next section. The\nsecond question concerns the first premise. It is nowhere near as\nself-evident as the second and it clearly needs some defense. We’ll\ndiscuss its defense in the following section. We’ll then present some of\nthe more important objections to the argument, before considering the\nQuine-Putnam argument’s role in the larger scheme of things - where it\nstands in relation to other influential arguments for and against\nmathematical realism.  \n\nThe question of how we should understand ‘indispensability’\nin the present context is crucial to the Quine-Putnam argument, and yet\nit has received surprisingly little attention. Quine actually speaks in\nterms of the entities quantified over in the canonical form of our best\nscientific theories rather than indispensability. Still, the debate\ncontinues in terms of indispensability, so we would be well served to\nclarify this term.  \n\nThe first thing to note is that ‘dispensability’ is not\nthe same as ‘eliminability’. If this were not so,\nevery entity would be dispensable (due to a theorem\n of\n Craig).[3]\n What we require for an entity to be\n‘dispensable’ is for it to be eliminable and that\nthe theory resulting from the entity’s elimination be an attractive\ntheory. (Perhaps, even stronger, we require that the resulting theory\nbe more attractive than the original.) We will need to spell\nout what counts as an attractive theory but for this we can appeal to\nthe standard desiderata for good scientific theories: empirical\nsuccess; unificatory power; simplicity; explanatory power; fertility\nand so on. Of course there will be debate over what desiderata are\nappropriate and over their relative weightings, but such issues need to\nbe addressed and resolved independently of issues of indispensability.\n(See Burgess (1983) and Colyvan (1999) for more on these issues.) \n\nThese issues naturally prompt the question of how much\nmathematics is indispensable (and hence how much mathematics carries\nontological commitment). It seems that the indispensability argument\nonly justifies belief in enough mathematics to serve the needs of\nscience. Thus we find Putnam speaking of “the set theoretic\n‘needs’ of physics” (Putnam 1979b, p. 346) and Quine\nclaiming that the higher reaches of set theory are “mathematical\nrecreation ... without ontological rights” (Quine 1986, p. 400) since\nthey do not find physical applications. One could take a less\nrestrictive line and claim that the higher reaches of set theory,\nalthough without physical applications, do carry ontological commitment\nby virtue of the fact that they have applications in other parts of\nmathematics. So long as the chain of applications eventually\n“bottoms out” in physical science, we could rightfully claim that the\nwhole chain carries ontological commitment. Quine himself justifies\nsome transfinite set theory along these lines (Quine 1984, p. 788), but\nhe sees no reason to go beyond the constructible sets (Quine 1986, p.\n400). His reasons for this restriction, however, have little to do with\nthe indispensability argument and so supporters of this argument need\nnot side with Quine on this issue. \n\nAlthough both premises of the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument\nhave been questioned, it’s the first premise that is most obviously in\nneed of support. This support comes from the doctrines of naturalism\nand holism.  \n\nFollowing Quine, naturalism is usually taken to be the philosophical\ndoctrine that there is no first philosophy and that the philosophical\nenterprise is continuous with the scientific enterprise (Quine 1981b).\nBy this Quine means that philosophy is neither prior to nor privileged\nover science. What is more, science, thus construed (i.e. with\nphilosophy as a continuous part) is taken to be the complete story of\nthe world. This doctrine arises out of a deep respect for scientific\nmethodology and an acknowledgment of the undeniable success of this\nmethodology as a way of answering fundamental questions about all\nnature of things. As Quine suggests, its source lies in “unregenerate\nrealism, the robust state of mind of the natural scientist who has\nnever felt any qualms beyond the negotiable uncertainties internal to\nscience” (Quine 1981b, p. 72). For the metaphysician this means looking\nto our best scientific theories to determine what exists, or, perhaps\nmore accurately, what we ought to believe to exist. In short,\nnaturalism rules out unscientific ways of determining what exists. For\nexample, naturalism rules out believing in the transmigration of souls\nfor mystical reasons. Naturalism would not, however, rule out the\ntransmigration of souls if our best scientific theories were to require\nthe truth of this\n doctrine.[4] \n\nNaturalism, then, gives us a reason for believing in the entities in\nour best scientific theories and no other entities. Depending on\nexactly how you conceive of naturalism, it may or may not tell you\nwhether to believe in all the entities of your best scientific\ntheories. We take it that naturalism does give us some reason\nto believe in all such entities, but that this is defeasible. This is\nwhere holism comes to the fore: in particular, confirmational\nholism. \n\nConfirmational holism is the view that theories are confirmed or\ndisconfirmed as wholes (Quine 1980b, p. 41). So, if a theory is\nconfirmed by empirical findings, the whole theory is\nconfirmed. In particular, whatever mathematics is made use of in the\ntheory is also confirmed (Quine 1976, pp. 120–122). Furthermore,\nit is the same evidence that is appealed\nto in justifying belief in the mathematical components of the theory\nthat is appealed to in justifying the empirical portion of the theory\n(if indeed the empirical can be separated from the mathematical at\nall). Naturalism and holism taken together then justify\n P1.\n Roughly, naturalism gives us the “only” and holism\ngives us the “all” in P1. \n\nIt is worth noting that in Quine’s writings there are at least two\nholist themes. The first is the confirmational holism discussed above\n(often called the Quine-Duhem thesis). The other is semantic holism\nwhich is the view that the unit of meaning is not the single sentence,\nbut systems of sentences (and in some extreme cases the whole of\nlanguage). This latter holism is closely related to Quine’s well-known\ndenial of the analytic-synthetic distinction (Quine 1980b) and his\nequally famous indeterminacy of translation thesis (Quine 1960).\nAlthough for Quine, semantic holism and confirmational holism are\nclosely related, there is good reason to distinguish them, since the\nformer is generally thought to be highly controversial while the latter\nis considered relatively uncontroversial. \n\nWhy this is important to the present debate is that Quine explicitly\ninvokes the controversial semantic holism in support of the\nindispensability argument (Quine 1980b, pp. 45–46). Most commentators,\nhowever, are of the view that only confirmational holism is required to\nmake the indispensability argument fly (see, for example, Colyvan\n(1998a); Field (1989, pp. 14–20); Hellman (1999); Resnik (1995a; 1997);\nMaddy (1992)) and my presentation here follows that accepted wisdom. It\nshould be kept in mind, however, that while the argument, thus\nconstrued, is Quinean in flavor it is not, strictly speaking, Quine’s\nargument. \n\nThere have been many objections to the indispensability argument,\nincluding Charles Parsons’ (1980) concern that the obviousness of basic\nmathematical statements is left unaccounted for by the Quinean picture\nand Philip Kitcher’s (1984, pp. 104–105) worry that the\nindispensability argument doesn’t explain why mathematics is\nindispensable to science. The objections that have received the most\nattention, however, are those due to Hartry Field, Penelope Maddy and\nElliott Sober. In particular, Field’s nominalisation program has\ndominated recent discussions of the ontology of mathematics.  \n\nField (1980) presents a case for denying the second premise of the\nQuine-Putnam argument. That is, he suggests that despite appearances\nmathematics is not indispensable to science. There are two parts to\nField’s project. The first is to argue that mathematical theories don’t\nhave to be true to be useful in applications, they need merely to be\nconservative. (This is, roughly, that if a mathematical theory\nis added to a nominalist scientific theory, no nominalist consequences\nfollow that wouldn’t follow from the nominalist scientific theory\nalone.) This explains why mathematics can be used in science\nbut it does not explain why it is used. The latter is due to\nthe fact that mathematics makes calculation and statement of various\ntheories much simpler. Thus, for Field, the utility of mathematics is\nmerely pragmatic — mathematics is not indispensable after all. \n\nThe second part of Field’s program is to demonstrate that our best\nscientific theories can be suitably nominalised. That is, he attempts\nto show that we could do without quantification over mathematical\nentities and that what we would be left with would be reasonably\nattractive theories. To this end he is content to nominalise a large\nfragment of Newtonian gravitational theory. Although this is a far cry\nfrom showing that all our current best scientific theories can\nbe nominalised, it is certainly not trivial. The hope is that once one\nsees how the elimination of reference to mathematical entities can be\nachieved for a typical physical theory, it will seem plausible that the\nproject could be completed for the rest of\n science.[5] \n\nThere has been a great deal of debate over the likelihood of the\nsuccess of Field’s program but few have doubted its significance.\nRecently, however, Penelope Maddy, has pointed out that if\n P1\n is false, Field’s project may turn out to be\nirrelevant to the realism/anti-realism debate in mathematics. \n\nMaddy presents some serious objections to the first premise of the\nindispensability argument (Maddy 1992; 1995; 1997). In particular, she\nsuggests that we ought not have ontological commitment to all\nthe entities indispensable to our best scientific theories. Her\nobjections draw attention to problems of reconciling naturalism with\nconfirmational holism. In particular, she points out how a holistic\nview of scientific theories has problems explaining the legitimacy of\ncertain aspects of scientific and mathematical practices. Practices\nwhich, presumably, ought to be legitimate given the high regard for\nscientific practice that naturalism recommends. It is important to\nappreciate that her objections, for the most part, are concerned with\nmethodological consequences of accepting the Quinean doctrines of\nnaturalism and holism — the doctrines used to support the first\npremise. The first premise is thus called into question by undermining\nits support. \n\nMaddy’s first objection to the indispensability argument is that the\nactual attitudes of working scientists towards the components of\nwell-confirmed theories vary from belief, through tolerance, to\noutright rejection (Maddy 1992, p. 280). The point is that naturalism\ncounsels us to respect the methods of working scientists, and yet\nholism is apparently telling us that working scientists ought not have\nsuch differential support to the entities in their theories. Maddy\nsuggests that we should side with naturalism and not holism here. Thus\nwe should endorse the attitudes of working scientists who apparently do\nnot believe in all the entities posited by our best theories.\nWe should thus reject\n P1. \n\nThe next problem follows from the first. Once one rejects the\npicture of scientific theories as homogeneous units, the question\narises whether the mathematical portions of theories fall within the\ntrue elements of the confirmed theories or within the idealized\nelements. Maddy suggests the latter. Her reason for this is that\nscientists themselves do not seem to take the indispensable application\nof a mathematical theory to be an indication of the truth of the\nmathematics in question. For example, the false assumption that water\nis infinitely deep is often invoked in the analysis of water waves, or\nthe assumption that matter is continuous is commonly made in fluid\ndynamics (Maddy 1992, pp. 281–282). Such cases indicate that scientists\nwill invoke whatever mathematics is required to get the job done,\nwithout regard to the truth of the mathematical theory in question\n(Maddy 1995, p. 255). Again it seems that confirmational holism is in\nconflict with actual scientific practice, and hence with naturalism.\nAnd again Maddy sides with naturalism. (See also Parsons (1983) for\nsome related worries about Quinean holism.) The point here is that if\nnaturalism counsels us to side with the attitudes of working scientists\non such matters, then it seems that we ought not take the\nindispensability of some mathematical theory in a physical application\nas an indication of the truth of the mathematical theory. Furthermore,\nsince we have no reason to believe that the mathematical theory in\nquestion is true, we have no reason to believe that the entities\nposited by the (mathematical) theory are real. So once again we ought\nto reject\n P1. \n\nMaddy’s third objection is that it is hard to make sense of what\nworking mathematicians are doing when they try to settle independent\nquestions. These are questions, that are independent of the standard\naxioms of set theory — the ZFC\n axioms.[6]\n In order to\nsettle some of these questions, new axiom candidates have been proposed\nto supplement ZFC, and arguments have been advanced in support of these\ncandidates. The problem is that the arguments advanced seem to have\nnothing to do with applications in physical science: they are typically\nintra-mathematical arguments. According to indispensability theory,\nhowever, the new axioms should be assessed on how well they cohere with\nour current best scientific theories. That is, set theorists should be\nassessing the new axiom candidates with one eye on the latest\ndevelopments in physics. Given that set theorists do not do this,\nconfirmational holism again seems to be advocating a revision of\nstandard mathematical practice, and this too, claims Maddy, is at odds\nwith naturalism (Maddy 1992, pp. 286–289). \n\nAlthough Maddy does not formulate this objection in a way that\ndirectly conflicts with\n P1\n it certainly illustrates a tension between naturalism and\nconfirmational\n holism.[7]\n And since both\nthese are required to support P1, the objection indirectly casts doubt\non P1. Maddy, however, endorses naturalism and so takes the objection\nto demonstrate that confirmational holism is false. We’ll leave the\ndiscussion of the impact the rejection of confirmational holism would\nhave on the indispensability argument until after we outline Sober’s\nobjection, because Sober arrives at much the same conclusion. \n\nElliott Sober’s objection is closely related to Maddy’s second and\nthird objections. Sober (1993) takes issue with the claim that\nmathematical theories share the empirical support accrued by our best\nscientific theories. In essence, he argues that mathematical theories\nare not being tested in the same way as the clearly empirical theories\nof science. He points out that hypotheses are confirmed relative to\ncompeting hypotheses. Thus if mathematics is confirmed along with our\nbest empirical hypotheses (as indispensability theory claims), there\nmust be mathematics-free competitors. But Sober points out that\nall scientific theories employ a common mathematical core.\nThus, since there are no competing hypotheses, it is a mistake to think\nthat mathematics receives confirmational support from empirical\nevidence in the way other scientific hypotheses do. \n\nThis in itself does not constitute an objection to\n P1\n of the indispensability argument, as Sober is quick\nto point out (Sober 1993, p. 53), although it does constitute an\nobjection to Quine’s overall view that mathematics is part of empirical\nscience. As with Maddy’s third objection, it gives us some cause to\nreject confirmational holism. The impact of these objections on P1\ndepends on how crucial you think confirmational holism is to that\npremise. Certainly much of the intuitive appeal of P1 is eroded if\nconfirmational holism is rejected. In any case, to subscribe to the\nconclusion of the indispensability argument in the face of Sober’s or\nMaddy’s objections is to hold the position that it’s permissible at\nleast to have ontological commitment to entities that receive no\nempirical support. This, if not outright untenable, is certainly not in\nthe spirit of the original Quine-Putnam argument. \n\nThe arguments against holism from Maddy and Sober resulted in a\nreevaluation of the indispensability argument. If, conta Quine,\nscientists do not accept all the entities of our best scientific\ntheories, where does this leave us? We need criteria for when to treat\nposits realistically. Here is where the debate over the\nindispensability argument took an interesting turn. Scientific\nrealists, at least, accept those posits of our best scientific\ntheories that contribute to scientific explanations. According to this\nline of thought, we ought to believe in electrons, say, not because\nthey are indispensable to our best scientific theories but because\nthey are indispensable in a very specific way: they are\nexplanatorily indispensable. If mathematics could be shown to\ncontribute to scientific explanations in this way, mathematical\nrealism would again be on par with scientific realism. Indeed, this is\nthe focus of most of the contemporary discussion on the\nindispensability argument. The central question is: does mathematics\ncontribute to scientific explanations and if so, does it do it in the\nright kind of way. \n\nOne example of how mathematics might be thought to be explanatory is\nfound in the periodic cicada case (Yoshimura 1997 and Baker\n2005). North American Magicicadas are found to have life cycles of 13\nor 17 years. It is proposed by some biologists that there is an\nevolutionary advantage in having such prime-numbered life\ncycles. Prime-numbered life cycles mean that the Magicicadas avoid\ncompetition, potential predators, and hybridisation. The idea is quite\nsimple: because prime numbers have no non-trivial factors, there are\nvery few other life cycles that can be synchronised with a\nprime-numbered life cycle. The Magicicadas thus have an effective\navoidance strategy that, under certain conditions, will be selected\nfor. While the explanation being advanced involves biology\n(e.g. evolutionary theory, theories of competition and predation), a\ncrucial part of the explanation comes from number theory, namely, the\nfundamental fact about prime numbers. Baker (2005) argues that this is\na genuinely mathematical explanation of a biological fact. There are\nother examples of alleged mathematical explanations in the literature\nbut this remains the most widely discussed and is something of a\nposter child for mathematical explanation. \n\nQuestions about this case focus on whether the mathematics is really\ncontributing to the explanation (or whether it is merely standing in\nfor the biological facts and it is these that really do the\nexplaining), whether the alleged explanation is an explanation at all,\nand whether the mathematics in question is involved in the explanation\nin the right kind of way. Finally, it is worth mentioning that\nalthough the recent interest in mathematical explanation arose out of\ndebates over the indispensability argument, the status of mathematical\nexplanations in the empirical sciences has also attracted interest in\nits own right. Moreover, such explanations (sometimes called\n“extra-mathematical explanations”) lead one very naturally to think\nabout explanations of mathematical facts by appeal to further\nmathematical facts (sometimes called “intra-mathematical\nexplanation”). These two kinds of mathematical explanation are\nrelated, of course. If, for example, some theorem of mathematics has\nits explanation rest in an explanatory proof, then any applications of\nthat theorem in the empirical realm would give rise to a prima facie\ncase that the full explanation of the empirical phenomenon in question\ninvolves the intra-mathematical explanation of the theorem. For these\nand other reasons, both kinds of mathematical explanation have\nattracted a great deal of interest from philosophers of mathematics\nand philosophers of science in recent years. \n\nIt is not clear how damaging the above criticisms are to the\nindispensability argument and whether the explanatory version of the argument survives. Indeed, the debate is very much alive, with\nmany recent articles devoted to the topic. (See bibliography notes\nbelow.) Closely related to this debate is the question of whether there\nare any other decent arguments for platonism. If, as some believe, the\nindispensability argument is the only argument for platonism\nworthy of consideration, then if it fails, platonism in the philosophy\nof mathematics seems bankrupt. Of relevance then is the status of other\narguments for and against mathematical realism. In any case, it is\nworth noting that the indispensability argument is one of a small\nnumber of arguments that have dominated discussions of the ontology of\nmathematics. It is therefore important that this argument not be viewed\nin isolation.  \n\nThe two most important arguments against mathematical\nrealism are the epistemological problem for platonism — how do we come\nby knowledge of causally inert mathematical entities? (Benacerraf\n1983b) — and the indeterminacy problem for the reduction of numbers to\nsets — if numbers are sets, which sets are they (Benacerraf 1983a)?\nApart from the indispensability argument, the other major argument\nfor mathematical realism appeals to a desire for a uniform\nsemantics for all discourse: mathematical and\nnon-mathematical alike (Benacerraf 1983b). Mathematical realism, of\ncourse, meets this challenge easily, since it explains the truth of\nmathematical statements in exactly the same way as in other\n domains.[8]\n It is not so clear, however, how nominalism can provide a uniform\nsemantics. \n\nFinally, it is worth stressing that even if the indispensability\nargument is the only good argument for platonism, the failure\nof this argument does not necessarily authorize nominalism, for the\nlatter too may be without support. It does seem fair to say, however,\nthat if the objections to the indispensability argument are sustained\nthen one of the most important arguments for platonism is undermined.\nThis would leave platonism on rather shaky ground.","contact.mail":"mark.colyvan@sydney.edu.au","contact.domain":"sydney.edu.au"}]
