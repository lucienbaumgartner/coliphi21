His thought combines a\ncommitment to a number of Cartesian metaphysical and epistemological\nprinciples with elements from ancient Stoicism, Hobbes, and medieval\nJewish rationalism into a nonetheless highly original system. His\nextremely naturalistic views on God, the world, the human being and\nknowledge serve to ground a moral philosophy centered on the control\nof the passions leading to virtue and happiness. They also lay the\nfoundations for a strongly democratic political thought and a deep\ncritique of the pretensions of Scripture and sectarian religion. Of\nall the philosophers of the seventeenth century, Spinoza is among\nthe most relevant today.\n\nBento (in Hebrew, Baruch; in Latin, Benedictus: all three names mean\n“blessed”) Spinoza was born in 1632 in Amsterdam. He was\nthe middle son in a prominent family of moderate means in\nAmsterdam’s Portuguese-Jewish community. As a boy he had\nundoubtedly been one of the star pupils in the congregation’s\nTalmud Torah school. He was intellectually gifted, and this could not\nhave gone unremarked by the congregation’s rabbis. It is\npossible that Spinoza, as he made progress through his studies, was\nbeing groomed for a career as a rabbi. But he never made it into the\nupper levels of the curriculum, those which included advanced study of\nTalmud. At the age of seventeen, he was forced to cut short his formal\nstudies to help run the family’s importing business. \nAnd then, on July 27, 1656, Spinoza was issued the harshest writ of\nherem, ban or excommunication, ever pronounced by the\nSephardic community of Amsterdam; it was never rescinded. We do not\nknow for certain what Spinoza’s “monstrous deeds”\nand “abominable heresies” were alleged to have been, but\nan educated guess comes quite easy. No doubt he was giving utterance\nto just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical\ntreatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul;\nstrongly rejects the notion of a transcendent, providential\nGod—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law\n(i.e., the commandments of the Torah and rabbinic legal principles)\nwas neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can\nthere be any mystery as to why one of history’s boldest and most\nradical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community? \nTo all appearances, Spinoza was content finally to have an excuse for\ndeparting from the community and leaving Judaism behind; his faith and\nreligious commitment were, by this point, gone. Within a few years, he\nleft Amsterdam altogether. By the time his extant correspondence\nbegins, in 1661, he is living in Rijnsburg, not far from Leiden. While\nin Rijnsburg, he worked on the Treatise on the Emendation of the\nIntellect, an essay on philosophical method, and the Short\nTreatise on God, Man and His Well-Being, an initial but aborted\neffort to lay out his metaphysical, epistemological and moral views.\nHis critical exposition of Descartes’s Principles of\nPhilosophy, the only work he published under his own name in his\nlifetime, was completed in 1663, after he had moved to Voorburg,\noutside The Hague. By this time, he was also working on what would\neventually be called the Ethics, his philosophical\nmasterpiece. However, when he saw the principles of toleration in\nHolland being threatened by reactionary forces, including political\nmeddling by the Dutch Reformed Church, he put it aside to complete his\n“scandalous” Theological-Political Treatise,\npublished anonymously and to great alarm in 1670 (one overwrought\ncritic called it “a book forged in hell by the devil\nhimself”). When Spinoza died in 1677, in The Hague, he was still\nat work on his Political Treatise; this was soon published by\nhis friends along with his other unpublished writings, including a\nCompendium of Hebrew Grammar. \nThe Ethics is an ambitious and multifaceted work. It is also\nbold to the point of audacity, as one would expect of a systematic and\nunforgiving critique of the traditional philosophical and theological\nconceptions of God, the human being and the universe, especially as\nthese serve as the foundation of the major organized religions and\ntheir moral and ceremonial rules. What Spinoza intends to demonstrate\n(in the strongest sense of that word) is the truth about God, nature\nand especially ourselves, and the most certain and useful principles\nof society, religion and the good life. Despite the great deal of\nmetaphysics, physics, anthropology and psychology that take up Parts\nOne through Three, Spinoza took the crucial message of the work to be\nethical in nature. It consists in showing that our happiness and\nwell-being lie not in a life enslaved to the passions and to the\ntransitory goods we ordinarily pursue, nor in the related unreflective\nattachment to the superstitions that pass as religion, but rather in\nthe life of reason. To clarify and support these broadly ethical\nconclusions, however, Spinoza must first demystify the universe and\nshow it for what it really is. This requires laying out some\nmetaphysical foundations, the project of Part One. \n“On God” begins with some deceptively simple definitions\nof terms that would be familiar to any seventeenth century\nphilosopher. “By substance I understand what is in itself and is\nconceived through itself”; “By attribute I understand what\nthe intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its\nessence”; “By God I understand a being absolutely\ninfinite, i.e., a substance consisting of an infinity of attributes,\nof which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.”\nThe definitions of Part One are, in effect, simply clear concepts that\nground the rest of his system. They are followed by a number of axioms\nthat, he assumes, will be regarded as obvious and unproblematic by the\nphilosophically informed (“Whatever is, is either in itself or\nin another”; “From a given determinate cause the effect\nfollows necessarily”). From these, the first proposition\nnecessarily follows, and every subsequent proposition can be\ndemonstrated using only what precedes it. (References to the\nEthics will be by part (I–V), proposition (p),\ndefinition (d), scholium (s) and corollary (c).) \nIn propositions one through fifteen of Part One, Spinoza presents the\nbasic elements of his picture of God. God is the infinite, necessarily\nexisting (that is, self-caused), unique substance of the universe.\nThere is only one substance in the universe; it is God; and everything\nelse that is, is in God. \nProposition 1: A substance is prior in nature\nto its affections. \nProposition 2: Two substances having different\nattributes have nothing in common with one another. (In other words,\nif two substances differ in nature, then they have nothing in\ncommon). \nProposition 3: If things have nothing in\ncommon with one another, one of them cannot be the cause of the\nother. \nProposition 4: Two or more distinct things are\ndistinguished from one another, either by a difference in the\nattributes [i.e., the natures or essences] of the substances or by a\ndifference in their affections [i.e., their accidental\nproperties]. \nProposition 5: In nature, there cannot be two\nor more substances of the same nature or attribute. \nProposition 6: One substance cannot be\nproduced by another substance. \nProposition 7: It pertains to the nature of a\nsubstance to exist. \nProposition 8: Every substance is necessarily\ninfinite. \nProposition 9: The more reality or being each\nthing has, the more attributes belong to it. \nProposition 10: Each attribute of a substance\nmust be conceived through itself. \nProposition 11: God, or a substance consisting\nof infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite\nessence, necessarily exists. (The proof of this proposition consists\nsimply in the classic “ontological proof for God’s\nexistence”. Spinoza writes that “if you deny this,\nconceive, if you can, that God does not exist. Therefore, by axiom 7\n[‘If a thing can be conceived as not existing, its essence does\nnot involve existence’], his essence does not involve existence.\nBut this, by proposition 7, is absurd. Therefore, God necessarily\nexists, q.e.d.”) \nProposition 12: No attribute of a substance\ncan be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be\ndivided. \nProposition 13: A substance which is\nabsolutely infinite is indivisible. \nProposition 14: Except God, no substance can\nbe or be conceived. \nThis proof that God—an infinite, eternal (necessary and\nself-caused), indivisible being—is the only substance of the\nuniverse proceeds in three simple steps. First, establish that no two\nsubstances can share an attribute or essence (Ip5). Then, prove that\nthere is a substance with infinite attributes (i.e., God) (Ip11). It\nfollows, in conclusion, that the existence of that infinite substance\nprecludes the existence of any other substance. For if there\nwere to be a second substance, it would have to have\nsome attribute or essence. But since God has all\npossible attributes, then the attribute to be possessed by this second\nsubstance would be one of the attributes already possessed by God. But\nit has already been established that no two substances can have the\nsame attribute. Therefore, there can be, besides God, no such second\nsubstance. \nIf God is the only substance, and (by axiom 1) whatever is, is either\na substance or in a substance, then everything else must be\nin God. “Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be\nconceived without God” (Ip15). Those things that are\n“in” God (or, more precisely, in God’s attributes)\nare what Spinoza calls ‘modes’ (or\n‘affections’). \nAs soon as this preliminary conclusion has been established, Spinoza\nimmediately reveals the objective of his attack. His definition of\nGod—condemned since his excommunication from the Jewish\ncommunity as a “God existing in only a philosophical\nsense”—is meant to preclude any anthropomorphizing of the\ndivine being. In the scholium to proposition fifteen, he writes\nagainst “those who feign a God, like man, consisting of a body\nand a mind, and subject to passions. But how far they wander from the\ntrue knowledge of God, is sufficiently established by what has already\nbeen demonstrated.” Besides being false, such an anthropomorphic\nconception of God standing as judge over us can have only deleterious\neffects on human freedom and activity, insofar as it fosters a life\nenslaved to hope and fear and the superstitions to which such emotions\ngive rise. \nMuch of the technical language of Part One is, to all appearances,\nright out of Descartes. But even the most devoted Cartesian would have\nhad a hard time understanding (and, certainly, accepting) the full\nimport of propositions one through fifteen. What does it mean to say\nthat God is substance and that everything else is “in”\nGod? Is Spinoza saying that rocks, tables, chairs, birds, mountains,\nrivers and human beings are all properties of God, and hence\ncan be predicated of God (just as one would say that the table\n“is red”)? It seems very odd to think that objects and\nindividuals—what we ordinarily think of as independent\n“things”—are, in fact, merely properties of a thing,\nitems that inhere in something else. Spinoza was sensitive to the\nstrangeness of this kind of talk, not to mention the philosophical\nproblems to which it gives rise. When a person feels pain, does it\nfollow that the pain is ultimately just a property of God,\nand thus that God feels pain? All of this has given rise to a great\ndeal of scholarly debate as to what Spinoza means by saying all things\nbeing modes of or “in” God. They may also explain why, as\nof Proposition Sixteen, there is a subtle but important shift in\nSpinoza’s language. God is now described not so much as the\nunderlying substance of all things, but as the universal, immanent and\nsustaining cause of all that exists: “From the necessity of the\ndivine nature there must follow infinitely many things in infinitely\nmany modes, (i.e., everything that can fall under an infinite\nintellect)”. \nAccording to the traditional Judeo-Christian conception of divinity,\nGod is a transcendent creator, a being who causes a world distinct\nfrom himself to come into being by creating it out of nothing. God\nproduces that world by a spontaneous act of free will, and could just\nas easily have not created anything outside himself. By contrast,\nSpinoza’s God is the cause of all things because all things\nfollow causally and necessarily from the divine nature. Or, as he puts\nit, from God’s infinite power or nature “all things have\nnecessarily flowed, or always followed, by the same necessity and in\nthe same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows, from\neternity and to eternity, that its three angles are equal to two right\nangles” (Ip17s1). The existence of the world is, thus,\nmathematically necessary. It is impossible that God should exist but\nnot the world. This does not mean that God does not cause the world to\ncome into being freely, since nothing outside of God\nconstrains him to bring it into existence. But Spinoza does deny that\nGod creates the world by some arbitrary and undetermined act of free\nwill. God could not have done otherwise. There are no alternatives to\nthe actual world—no other possible worlds—and there is no\ncontingency or spontaneity within the world. Nothing could possibly\nhave been otherwise. Everything is absolutely and necessarily\ndetermined. \n(Ip33): Things could have been produced by God in no other way, and in\nno other order than they have been produced. \nThere are, however, differences in the way things depend on God. As an\ninfinite being, God has infinite “attributes”. An\nattribute is best understood as a most basic way of being, a general\nnature that is expressed in determinate ways by particular things. We\nhave knowledge of only two of these attributes: thought and extension.\nSome features of the universe follow necessarily from God—or,\nmore precisely, from the absolute nature of one of God’s\nattributes—in a direct and unmediated manner. These are the\nuniversal and eternal aspects of the world, and they do not come into\nor go out of being; Spinoza calls them “infinite modes”.\nThey include the most general principles of the universe, together\ngoverning all things in all ways. From the attribute of extension\nthere follow the principles governing all extended objects (the truths\nof geometry) and laws governing the motion and rest of bodies (the\nlaws of physics); from the attribute of thought, there follow laws of\nthought (understood by commentators to be either the laws of logic or\nthe laws of psychology). Particular and individual things are causally\nmore remote from God. They are nothing but “affections of\nGod’s attributes, or modes by which God’s attributes are\nexpressed in a certain and determinate way” (Ip25c). More\nprecisely, they are finite modes. \nThere are two causal orders or dimensions governing the production and\nactions of particular things. On the one hand, they are determined by\nthe general laws of the universe that follow immediately from\nGod’s natures. On the other hand, each particular thing is\ndetermined to act and to be acted upon by other particular things.\nThus, the actual behavior of a body in motion is a function not just\nof the universal laws of motion, but also of the other bodies in\nmotion and rest surrounding it and with which it comes into\ncontact. \nSpinoza’s metaphysics of God is neatly summed up in a phrase\nthat occurs in the Latin (but not the original Dutch) edition of the\nEthics: “God, or Nature”, Deus, sive\nNatura: “That eternal and infinite being we call God, or\nNature, acts from the same necessity from which he exists” (Part\nIV, Preface). It is an ambiguous phrase, since Spinoza could be read\nas trying either to divinize nature or to naturalize God. But for the\ncareful reader there is no mistaking Spinoza’s intention. The\nfriends who, after his death, published his writings left out the\n“or Nature” clause from the more widely accessible Dutch\nversion, probably out of fear of the reaction that this identification\nwould, predictably, arouse among a vernacular audience. \nThere are, Spinoza insists, two sides of Nature. First, there is the\nactive, productive aspect of the universe—God and his\nattributes, from which all else follows. This is what Spinoza,\nemploying the same terms he used in the Short Treatise, calls\nNatura naturans, “naturing Nature”. Strictly\nspeaking, this is identical with God. The other aspect of the universe\nis that which is produced and sustained by the active aspect,\nNatura naturata, “natured Nature”. \nThere is some debate in the literature as to whether God is also to be\nidentified with Natura naturata. The more likely reading is\nthat God, as Nature, is both Natura naturans and Natura\nnaturata, and that the infinite and finite modes are not just\neffects of God or Nature’s power but actually inhere in and\nexpress that infinite substance. Be that as it may, Spinoza’s\nfundamental insight in Book One is that Nature is an indivisible,\neternal or self-caused, substantial whole—in fact, it is the\nonly substantial whole. Outside of Nature, there is nothing,\nand everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into\nbeing by Nature with a deterministic necessity. This unified, unique,\nproductive, necessary being just is what is meant by\n‘God’. Because of the necessity inherent in Nature, there\nis no teleology in the universe. God or Nature does not act for any\nends, and things do not exist for any set purposes. There are no\n“final causes” (to use the common Aristotelian phrase).\nGod does not “do” things for the sake of anything else.\nThe order of things just follows from God’s essences with an\ninviolable determinism. All talk of God’s purposes, intentions,\ngoals, preferences or aims is just an anthropomorphizing fiction. \nGod is not some goal-oriented planner who then judges things by how\nwell they conform to his purposes. Things happen only because of\nNature and its laws. “Nature has no end set before it …\nAll things proceed by a certain eternal necessity of nature.” To\nbelieve otherwise is to fall prey to the same superstitions that lie\nat the heart of the organized religions. \nPeople] find—both in themselves and outside\nthemselves—many means that are very helpful in seeking their own\nadvantage, e.g., eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, plants and\nanimals for food, the sun for light, the sea for supporting fish\n… Hence, they consider all natural things as means to their own\nadvantage. And knowing that they had found these means, not provided\nthem for themselves, they had reason to believe that there was someone\nelse who had prepared those means for their use. For after they\nconsidered things as means, they could not believe that the things had\nmade themselves; but from the means they were accustomed to prepare\nfor themselves, they had to infer that there was a ruler, or a number\nof rulers of nature, endowed with human freedom, who had taken care of\nall things for them, and made all things for their use. \nAnd since they had never heard anything about the temperament of these\nrulers, they had to judge it from their own. Hence, they maintained\nthat the Gods direct all things for the use of men in order to bind\nmen to them and be held by men in the highest honor. So it has\nhappened that each of them has thought up from his own temperament\ndifferent ways of worshipping God, so that God might love them above\nall the rest, and direct the whole of Nature according to the needs of\ntheir blind desire and insatiable greed. Thus this prejudice was\nchanged into superstition, and struck deep roots in their minds. (I,\nAppendix) \nA judging God who has plans and acts purposively is a God to be obeyed\nand placated. Opportunistic preachers are then able to play on our\nhopes and fears in the face of such a God. They prescribe ways of\nacting that are calculated to avoid being punished by that God and\nearn his rewards. But, Spinoza insists, to see God or Nature as acting\nfor the sake of ends—to find purpose in Nature—is to\nmisconstrue Nature and “turn it upside down” by putting\nthe effect (the end result) before the true cause. \nNor does God perform miracles, since there are no, and cannot be,\ndepartures whatsoever from the necessary course of nature. This would\nbe for God or Nature to act against itself, which is absurd. The\nbelief in miracles is due only to ignorance of the true causes of\nphenomena. \nThis is strong language, and Spinoza is clearly aware of the risks of\nhis position. The same preachers who take advantage of our credulity\nwill fulminate against anyone who tries to pull aside the curtain and\nreveal the truths of Nature. “One who seeks the true causes of\nmiracles, and is eager, like an educated man, to understand natural\nthings, not to wonder at them, like a fool, is generally considered\nand denounced as an impious heretic by those whom the people honor as\ninterpreters of nature and the Gods. For they know that if ignorance\nis taken away, then foolish wonder, the only means they have of\narguing and defending their authority is also taken away.” \nFor centuries, Spinoza has been regarded—by his enemies and his\npartisans, in the scholarly literature and the popular\nimagination—as a “pantheist”. It is not clear,\nhowever, that this is the proper way to look at his conception of God.\nOf course, Spinoza is not a traditional theist, for whom God is a\ntranscendent and providential being. But does Spinoza’s\nidentification of God with Nature mean that he is, as so many have\ninsisted for so long, from the early eighteenth century up through the\nmost recent edition of the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,\na pantheist? \nIn general, pantheism is the view that rejects the transcendence of\nGod. According to the pantheist, God is, in some way, identical with\nthe world. There may be aspects of God that are ontologically or\nepistemologically distinct from the world, but for pantheism this must\nnot imply that God is essentially separate from the world. The\npantheist is also likely to reject any kind of anthropomorphizing of\nGod, or attributing to the deity psychological and moral\ncharacteristics modeled on human nature. The pantheist’s God is\n(usually) not a personal God. \nWithin this general framework, it is possible to distinguish two\nvarieties of pantheism. First, pantheism can be understood as the\ndenial of any distinction whatsoever between God and the natural world\nand the assertion that God is in fact identical with everything that\nexists. “God is everything and everything is God.” On this\nview, God is the world and all its natural contents, and nothing\ndistinct from them. This is reductive pantheism. Second, pantheism can\nbe understood as asserting that God is distinct from the world and its\nnatural contents but nonetheless contained or immanent within them,\nperhaps in the way in which water is contained in a saturated sponge.\nGod is everything and everywhere, on this version, by virtue of being\nwithin everything. This is immanentist pantheism; it involves that\nclaim that nature contains within itself, in addition to its natural\nelements, an immanent supernatural and divine element. \nIs Spinoza, then, a pantheist? Any adequate analysis of\nSpinoza’s identification of God and Nature will show clearly\nthat Spinoza cannot be a pantheist in the second, immanentist sense.\nFor Spinoza, there is nothing but Nature and its attributes and modes.\nAnd within Nature there can certainly be nothing that is supernatural.\nIf Spinoza is seeking to eliminate anything, it is that which is above\nor beyond nature, which escapes the laws and processes of nature. But\nis he a pantheist in the first, reductive sense? \nThe issue of whether God is to be identified with the whole of Nature\n(i.e., Natura naturans and Natura naturata) or only a\npart of Nature (i.e., Natura naturans alone), which has\noccupied a good deal of the recent literature, might be seen as\ncrucial to the question of Spinoza’s alleged pantheism. After\nall, if pantheism is the view that God is everything, then Spinoza is\na pantheist only if he identifies God with all of Nature. Indeed, this\nis exactly how the issue is often framed. Both those who believe that\nSpinoza is a pantheist and those who believe that he is not a\npantheist focus on the question of whether God is to be identified\nwith the whole of Nature, including the infinite and finite modes of\nNatura naturata, or only with substance and its attributes\n(Natura naturans) but not the modes. Thus, it has been argued\nthat Spinoza is not a pantheist, because God is to be identified only\nwith substance and its attributes, the most universal, active causal\nprinciples of Nature, and not with any modes of substance. Other\nscholars have argued that Spinoza is a pantheist, just because he does\nidentify God with the whole of nature. \nHowever, this debate about the extent of Spinoza’s\nidentification of God with Nature is not really to the point when the\nquestion is about Spinoza’s alleged pantheism. To be sure, if by\n‘pantheism’ is meant the idea that God is everything, and\nif one reads Spinoza as saying that God is only Natura\nnaturans, then Spinoza’s God is not everything and\nconsequently Spinoza is not a pantheist, at least in the ordinary\nsense. Finite things, on this reading, while caused by the eternal,\nnecessary and active aspects of Nature, are not identical with God or\nsubstance, but rather are its effects. But this is not the interesting\nsense in which Spinoza is not a pantheist. For even if Spinoza does\nindeed identify God with the whole of Nature, it does not follow that\nSpinoza is a pantheist. The real issue is not what is the proper\nreading of the metaphysics of Spinoza’s conception of God and\nits relationship to finite modes. On either interpretation,\nSpinoza’s move is a naturalistic and reductive one. God is\nidentical either with all of Nature or with only a part of Nature; for\nthis reason, Spinoza shares something with the reductive pantheist.\nBut—and this is the important point—even the atheist can,\nwithout too much difficulty, admit that God is nothing but Nature.\nReductive pantheism and atheism maintain extensionally equivalent\nontologies. \nRather, the question of Spinoza’s pantheism is really going to\nbe answered on the psychological side of things, with regard to the\nproper attitude to take toward Deus sive Natura. And however\none reads the relationship between God and Nature in Spinoza, it is a\nmistake to call him a pantheist in so far as pantheism is still a kind\nof religious theism. What really distinguishes the pantheist from the\natheist is that the pantheist does not reject as inappropriate the\nreligious psychological attitudes demanded by theism. Rather, the\npantheist simply asserts that God—conceived as a being before\nwhich one is to adopt an attitude of worshipful awe—is or is in\nNature. And nothing could be further from the spirit of\nSpinoza’s philosophy. Spinoza does not believe that worshipful\nawe or religious reverence is an appropriate attitude to take before\nGod or Nature. There is nothing holy or sacred about Nature, and it is\ncertainly not the object of a religious experience. Instead, one\nshould strive to understand God or Nature, with the kind of adequate\nor clear and distinct intellectual knowledge that reveals\nNature’s most important truths and shows how everything depends\nessentially and existentially on higher natural causes. The key to\ndiscovering and experiencing God, for Spinoza, is philosophy and\nscience, not religious awe and worshipful submission. The latter give\nrise only to superstitious behavior and subservience to ecclesiastic\nauthorities; the former leads to enlightenment, freedom and true\nblessedness (i.e., peace of mind). \nIn Part Two, Spinoza turns to the nature of the human being. The two\nattributes of God of which we have knowledge are extension and\nthought. This, in itself, involves what would have been an astounding\nthesis in the eyes of his contemporaries, one that was usually\nmisunderstood and vilified. When Spinoza claims in Proposition Two\nthat “Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended\nthing”, he was almost universally—but\nerroneously—interpreted as saying that God is literally\ncorporeal. For just this reason, “Spinozism” became, for\nhis critics, synonymous with materialism. \nAccording to one interpretation, God is indeed material, even matter\nitself, but this does not imply that God is or has a body. Another\ninterpretation, however, one which will be adopted here, is that what\nis in God is not matter per se, but extension as an essence. And\nextension and thought are two distinct essences or natures that have\nabsolutely nothing in common. The modes or expressions of extension\nare physical bodies; the modes of thought are ideas. Because extension\nand thought have nothing in common, the two realms of matter and mind\nare causally closed systems. Everything that is extended follows from\nthe attribute of extension alone. Every bodily event is part of an\ninfinite causal series of bodily events and is determined only by the\nnature of extension and its laws, in conjunction with its relations to\nother extended bodies. Similarly, every idea or mental event follows\nonly from the attribute of thought. Any idea is an integral part of an\ninfinite series of ideas and is determined by the nature of thought\nand its laws, along with its relations to other ideas. There is, in\nother words, no causal interaction between bodies and ideas, between\nthe physical and the mental. There is, however, a thoroughgoing\ncorrelation and parallelism between the two series. For every mode in\nextension that is a relatively stable collection of matter (an\nindividual body), there is a corresponding mode in thought (an idea or\nmind). In fact, he insists, “a mode of extension and the idea of\nthat mode are one and the same thing, but expressed in two ways”\n(IIp7s). Because of the fundamental and underlying unity of Nature or\nSubstance and its attributes, thought and extension are just two\ndifferent ways in which one and the same Nature expresses itself.\nEvery material thing (every determinate expression of Nature through\nextension) thus has its own particular idea (a determinate expression\nof Nature through thought)—an eternal adequate idea—that\ncorresponds to and represents it. Since that idea is just a mode of\none of God’s attributes—thought—it is in God, and\nthe infinite series of ideas constitutes God’s mind or infinite\nintellect. As he explains, \nIt follows from this, Spinoza argues, that the causal relations\nbetween bodies is mirrored in the logical relations between\nGod’s ideas. Or, as Spinoza notes in Proposition Seven,\n“the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and\nconnection of things”. \nOne kind of extended body, however, is significantly more complex than\nany others in its composition and in its dispositions to act and be\nacted upon. That complexity is reflected in its corresponding idea.\nThe body in question is the human body; and its corresponding idea is\nthe human mind or soul. The human mind, then, like any other idea, is\nsimply one particular mode of God’s attribute, thought. Whatever\nhappens in the body is reflected or expressed in the mind. In this\nway, the mind perceives, more or less obscurely, what is taking place\nin its body. And through its body’s interactions with other\nbodies, the mind is aware of what is happening in the physical world\naround it. But the human mind no more interacts with its body than any\nmode of thought interacts with a mode of extension. \nOne of the pressing questions in seventeenth-century philosophy, and\nperhaps the most celebrated legacy of Descartes’s dualism, is\nthe problem of how two radically different substances such as mind and\nbody enter into a union in a human being and cause effects in each\nother. How can the extended body causally engage the unextended mind,\nwhich is incapable of contact or motion, and “move” it,\nthat is, cause mental effects such as pains, sensations and\nperceptions? And how can an immaterial thing like a mind or soul,\nwhich does not have motion, put a body (the human body) into motion?\nSpinoza, in effect, denies that the human being is a union of two\nsubstances. The human mind and the human body are two\ndifferent expressions—under thought and under extension—of\none and the same thing: the person. And because there is no causal\ninteraction between the mind and the body, the so-called mind-body\nproblem does not, technically speaking, arise. \nThe human mind, like God, contains ideas. Some of these\nideas—sensory images, qualitative “feels” (like\npains and pleasures), perceptual data—, and figments of the\nimagination are imprecise qualitative phenomena, being the expression\nin thought of states of the body as it is affected by the bodies\nsurrounding it. Such ideas do not convey adequate and true knowledge\nof the world, but only a relative, partial and subjective picture of\nhow things presently seem to be to the perceiver. There is no\nsystematic order to these perceptions, nor any critical oversight by\nreason. “As long as the human Mind perceives things from the\ncommon order of nature, it does not have an adequate, but only a\nconfused and mutilated knowledge of itself, of its own Body, and of\nexternal bodies” (IIp29c). Under such circumstances, we are\nsimply determined in our ideas by our fortuitous and haphazard\nencounter with things in the external world. This superficial\nacquaintance will never provide us with knowledge of the essences of\nthose things. In fact, it is an invariable source of falsehood and\nerror. This “knowledge from random experience” is also the\norigin of great delusions, since we—thinking ourselves\nfree—are, in our ignorance, unaware of just how we are\ndetermined by causes. \nAdequate ideas, on the other hand, are formed in a rational and\norderly manner, and are necessarily true and revelatory of the\nessences of things. “Reason”, the second kind of knowledge\n(after “random experience”), is the apprehension of the\nessence of a thing through a discursive, inferential procedure.\n“A true idea means nothing other than knowing a thing perfectly,\nor in the best way”(IIp43s). It involves grasping a\nthing’s causal and conceptual connections not just to other\nobjects but, more importantly, to the attributes of God, the infinite\nmodes (the laws of nature) that follow immediately from them, and the\n“common notions” that pick out features present in all\nmodes of an attribute. The adequate idea of a thing clearly and\ndistinctly situates its object in all of its causal nexuses and\nconceptual relations, and shows not just that it is, but\nwhat it is and how and why it is. The\nperson who truly knows a thing sees the reasons why the thing was\ndetermined to be and could not have been otherwise. “It is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary, not as\ncontingent” (IIp44). The belief that some thing is accidental or\nspontaneous can be based only on an inadequate grasp of the\nthing’s causal explanation, on a partial and\n“mutilated” familiarity with it. To perceive by way of\nadequate ideas is to perceive the necessity inherent in Nature. \nSense experience alone could never provide the information conveyed by\nan adequate idea. The senses present things only as they appear from a\ngiven perspective at a given moment in time. An adequate idea, on the\nother hand, by showing how a thing follows necessarily from one or\nanother of God’s attributes, presents it in its\n“eternal” aspects—sub specie aeternitatis,\nas Spinoza puts it—without any relation to time. “It is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary and not as\ncontingent. And Reason perceives this necessity of things truly, i.e.,\nas it is in itself. But this necessity of things is the very necessity\nof God’s eternal nature. Therefore, it is of the nature of\nReason to regard things under this species of eternity” (IIp44).\nThe third kind of knowledge, intuition, takes what is known by Reason\nand grasps it in a single, perspicacious act of the mind. \nSpinoza’s conception of adequate knowledge reveals an unrivaled\noptimism in the cognitive powers of the human being. Not even\nDescartes believed that we could know all of Nature and its innermost\nsecrets with the degree of depth and certainty that Spinoza thought\npossible. Most remarkably, because Spinoza thought that the adequate\nknowledge of any object, and of Nature as a whole, involves a\nknowledge of God’s essence and of how things relate to God and\nits attributes, he also had no scruples about claiming that we can, at\nleast in principle, know God perfectly and adequately. “The\nknowledge of God’s eternal and infinite essence that each idea\ninvolves is adequate and perfect” (IIp46). “The human Mind\nhas an adequate knowledge of God’s eternal and infinite\nessence” (IIp47). No other philosopher in history has been\nwilling to make this claim. But, then again, no other philosopher so\nforthrightly identified God with Nature. \nSpinoza engages in such a detailed analysis of the composition of the\nhuman being because it is essential to his goal of showing how the\nhuman being is a part of Nature, existing within the same\ndeterministic causal nexuses as other extended and mental beings. This\nhas serious ethical implications. First, it implies that a human being\nis not endowed with freedom, at least in the ordinary sense of that\nterm. Because our minds and the events in our minds are simply ideas\nthat exist within the causal series of ideas that follows from\nGod’s attribute of thought, our actions and volitions are as\nnecessarily determined as any other natural events. “In the Mind\nthere is no absolute, or free, will, but the Mind is determined to\nwill this or that by a cause that is also determined by another, and\nthis again by another, and so to infinity” (IIp48). \nWhat is true of the will (and, of course, of our bodies) is true of\nall the phenomena of our psychological lives. Spinoza believes that\nthis is something that has not been sufficiently understood by\nprevious thinkers, who seem to have wanted to place the human being on\na pedestal outside of (or above) nature. \nDescartes, for example, believed that if the freedom of the human\nbeing is to be preserved, the soul must be exempt from the kind of\ndeterministic laws that rule over the material universe. \nSpinoza’s aim in Parts Three and Four is, as he says in his\nPreface to Part Three, to restore the human being and his volitional\nand emotional life to their proper place in nature. For nothing stands\noutside of nature, not even the human mind. \nOur affects—our love, anger, hate, envy, pride, jealousy,\netc.—“follow from the same necessity and force of nature\nas the other singular things”. Spinoza, therefore, explains\nthese emotions—as determined in their occurrence as are a body\nin motion and the properties of a mathematical figure—just as he\nwould explain any other things in nature. “I shall treat the\nnature and power of the Affects, and the power of the Mind over them,\nby the same Method by which, in the preceding parts, I treated God and\nthe Mind, and I shall consider human actions and appetites just as if\nit were a Question of lines, planes, and bodies.” \nOur affects are divided into actions and passions. When the cause of\nan event lies wholly in our own nature—more particularly, our\nknowledge or adequate ideas— and we are the “adequate\ncause” of it, then it is a case of the mind acting. On the other\nhand, when something happens in us the cause of which lies outside of\nour nature, then we are passive and being acted upon. Usually what\ntakes place, both when we are acting and when we are being acted upon,\nis some change in our mental and physical capacities, what Spinoza\ncalls “an increase or decrease in our power of acting” or\nin our “power to persevere in being”. All beings are\nnaturally endowed with such a power or striving. This\nconatus, a kind of existential inertia, constitutes the\n“essence” of any being. “Each thing, as far as it\ncan by its own power, strives to persevere in its being.” An\naffect just is any change in this power, for better or for\nworse. Affects that are actions are changes in this power that have\ntheir source (or adequate cause) in our nature alone; affects that are\npassions are those changes in this power that originate at least\npartly outside of us. \nWhat we should strive for is to learn how to moderate and restrain the\npassions and become active, autonomous beings. If we can achieve this,\nthen we will be “free” to the extent that whatever happens\nto us will result not from our relations with things outside us, but\nfrom our own nature (as that follows from, and is ultimately and\nnecessarily determined by, the attributes of God of which our minds\nand bodies are modes). We will, consequently, be truly liberated from\nthe troublesome emotional ups and downs of this life. The way to bring\nthis about is to increase our knowledge, our store of adequate ideas,\nand reduce as far as possible the power or strength of our inadequate\nideas, which follow not from the nature of the mind alone but from its\nbeing an expression of how our body is affected by other bodies. In\nother words, we need to free ourselves from a reliance on the senses\nand the imagination, since a life guided by the senses and the\nimagination is a life being affected and led by the objects around us,\nand rely as much as we can only on our rational faculties. \nBecause of our innate striving to persevere—which, in the human\nbeing, is called “will” or “appetite”—we\nnaturally pursue those things that we believe will benefit us by\nincreasing our power of acting and shun or flee those things that we\nbelieve will harm us by decreasing our power of acting. This provides\nSpinoza with a foundation for cataloging the human passions. For the\npassions are all functions of the ways in which external things affect\nour powers or capacities. Joy (Laetitiae, sometimes\ntranslated as “pleasure”), for example, is simply the\nmovement or passage to a greater capacity for action. “By Joy\n… I shall understand that passion by which the Mind passes to a\ngreater perfection” (IIIp11s). When joy is a passion, it is\nalways brought about by some external object. Sadness\n(Tristitiae, or “pain”), on the other hand, is\nthe passage to a lesser state of perfection, also occasioned by a\nthing outside us. Love is simply Joy accompanied by an awareness of\nthe external cause that brings about the passage to a greater\nperfection. We love that object that benefits us and causes us joy.\nHate is nothing but “sadness with the accompanying idea of an\nexternal cause”. Hope is simply “an inconstant joy which\nhas arisen from the image of a future or past thing whose outcome we\ndoubt”. We hope for a thing whose presence, as yet uncertain,\nwill bring about joy. We fear, however, a thing whose presence,\nequally uncertain, will bring about sadness. When that whose outcome\nwas doubtful becomes certain, hope is changed into confidence, while\nfear is changed into despair. \nAll of the human emotions, in so far as they are passions, are\nconstantly directed outward, towards things and their capacities to\naffect us one way or another. Aroused by our passions and desires, we\nseek or flee those things that we believe cause joy or sadness.\n“We strive to further the occurrence of whatever we imagine will\nlead to Joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary to\nit, or will lead to Sadness.” Our hopes and fears fluctuate\ndepending on whether we regard the objects of our desires or aversions\nas remote, near, necessary, possible or unlikely. But the objects of\nour passions, being external to us, are completely beyond our control.\nThus, the more we allow ourselves to be controlled by them,\nthe more we are subject to passions and the less active and free we\nare. The upshot is a fairly pathetic picture of a life mired in the\npassions and pursuing and fleeing the changeable and fleeting objects\nthat occasion them: “We are driven about in many ways by\nexternal causes, and … like waves on the sea, driven by\ncontrary winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate”\n(IIIp59s). The title for Part Four of the Ethics reveals with\nperfect clarity Spinoza’s evaluation of such a life for a human\nbeing: “On Human Bondage, or the Powers of the Affects”.\nHe explains that the human being’s “lack of power to\nmoderate and restrain the affects I call Bondage. For the man who is\nsubject to affects is under the control, not of himself, but of\nfortune, in whose power he so greatly is that often, though he sees\nthe better for himself, he is still forced to follow the worse”.\nIt is, he says, a kind of “sickness of the mind” to suffer\ntoo much love for a thing “that is liable to many variations and\nthat we can never fully possess.” \nThe solution to this predicament is an ancient one. Since we cannot\ncontrol the objects that we tend to value and that we allow to\ninfluence our well-being, we ought instead to try to control our\nevaluations themselves and thereby minimize the sway that external\nobjects and the passions have over us. We can never eliminate the\npassive affects entirely. We are essentially a part of nature, and can\nnever fully remove ourselves from the causal series that link us to\nexternal things. But we can, ultimately, counteract the passions,\ncontrol them, and achieve a certain degree of relief from their\nturmoil.  \nThe path to restraining and moderating the affects is through virtue.\nSpinoza is a psychological and ethical egoist. All beings naturally\nseek their own advantage—to preserve their own being and\nincrease their power—and it is right for them do so. This is\nwhat virtue consists in. Since we are thinking beings, endowed with\nintelligence and reason, what is to our greatest advantage is\nknowledge. Our virtue, therefore, consists in the pursuit of knowledge\nand understanding, of adequate ideas. The best kind of knowledge is a\npurely intellectual intuition of the essences of things. This\n“third kind of knowledge”—beyond both random\nexperience and ratiocination—sees things not in their temporal\ndimension, not in their durational existence and in relation to other\nparticular things, but under the aspect of eternity (sub specie\naeternitatis), that is, abstracted from all considerations of time\nand place and situated in their relationship to God and its\nattributes. They are apprehended, that is, in their conceptual and\ncausal relationship to the universal essences (thought and extension)\nand the eternal laws of nature. \nBut this is just to say that, ultimately, we strive for a knowledge of\nGod. The concept of any body involves the concept of extension; and\nthe concept of any idea or mind involves the concept of thought. But\nthought and extension just are God’s attributes. So the proper\nand adequate conception of any body or mind necessarily involves the\nconcept or knowledge of God. “The third kind of knowledge\nproceeds from an adequate idea of certain attributes of God to an\nadequate knowledge of the essence of things, and the more we\nunderstand things in this way, the more we understand God”\n(Vp25d). Knowledge of God is, thus, the mind’s greatest good and\nits greatest virtue. \nWhat we see when we understand things through the third kind of\nknowledge, under the aspect of eternity and in relation to God, is the\ndeterministic necessity of all things. We see that all bodies and\ntheir states follow necessarily from the essence of matter and the\nuniversal laws of physics; and we see that all ideas, including all\nthe properties of minds, follow necessarily from the essence of\nthought and its universal laws. This insight can only weaken the power\nthat the passions have over us. We are no longer hopeful or fearful of\nwhat shall come to pass, and no longer anxious or despondent over our\npossessions. We regard all things with equanimity, and we are not\ninordinately and irrationally affected in different ways by past,\npresent or future events. The result is self-control and a calmness of\nmind. \nOur affects or emotions themselves can be understood in this way,\nwhich further diminishes their power over us. \nSpinoza’s ethical theory is, to a certain degree, Stoic, and\nrecalls the doctrines of thinkers such as Cicero and Seneca: \nWhat, in the end, replaces the passionate love for ephemeral\n“goods” is an intellectual love for an eternal, immutable\ngood that we can fully and stably possess, God. The third kind of\nknowledge generates a love for its object, and in this love consists\nnot a passionate joy but an active one, even blessedness itself.\nTaking his cue from Maimonides’s view of human\neudaimonia, Spinoza argues that the mind’s intellectual\nlove of God is our understanding of the universe, our virtue,\nour happiness, our well-being and our “salvation”. It is\nalso our freedom and autonomy, as we approach the condition wherein\nwhat happens to us follows from our nature (as a determinate and\ndetermined mode of one of God’s attributes) alone and not as a\nresult of the ways external things affect us. Spinoza’s\n“free person” is one who bears the gifts and losses of\nfortune with equanimity and does only those things that he believes to\nbe “the most important in life”. He also, despite the\nfundamental egoism, engages in behavior toward others that is\ntypically regarded as “ethical”, even altruistic. He takes\ncare for the well-being and virtuous flourishing of other human\nbeings. He does what he can through rational benevolence (as opposed\nto pity or some other passion) to insure that they, too, achieve\nrelief from the disturbances of the passions through understanding,\nand thus that they become more like him (and therefore most useful to\nhim). He does this not from altruistic motives but egoistic ones: he\nsees that it is in his own best interest to be in communion with other\nrationally virtuous individuals. Moreover, the free person is not\nanxious about death. The free person neither hopes for any eternal,\notherworldly rewards nor fears any eternal punishments. He knows that\nthe soul is not immortal in any personal sense, but is endowed only\nwith a certain kind of eternity. The more the mind consists of true\nand adequate ideas (which are eternal), the more of it\nremains—within God’s attribute of thought—after the\ndeath of the body and the disappearance of that part of the mind that\ncorresponds to the body’s duration. This understanding of his\nplace in the natural scheme of things brings to the free individual\ntrue peace of mind, even salvation. \nThere are a number of social and political ramifications that follow\nfrom Spinoza’s ethical doctrines of human action and well-being.\nBecause disagreement and discord between human beings is always the\nresult of our different and changeable passions, “free”\nindividuals—who all share the same nature and act on the same\nprinciples—will naturally and effortlessly form a harmonious\nsociety. “Insofar as men are torn by affects that are passions,\nthey can be contrary to one another …[But] insofar as men live\naccording to the guidance of reason, they must do only those things\nthat are good for human nature, and hence, for each man, i.e., those\nthings that agree with the nature of each man. Hence, insofar as men\nlive according to the guidance of reason, they must always agree among\nthemselves” (IVp34–35). Free human beings will be mutually\nbeneficial and useful, and will be tolerant of the opinions and even\nthe errors of others. However, human beings do not generally live\nunder the guidance of reason. The state or sovereign, therefore, is\nrequired in order to insure—not by reason, but by the threat of\nforce—that individuals are protected from the unrestrained\npursuit of self-interest on the part of other individuals. The\ntransition from a state of nature, where each seeks his own advantage\nwithout limitation, to a civil state involves the universal\nrenunciation of certain natural rights—such as “the right\neveryone has of avenging himself, and of judging good and\nevil”—and the investment of those prerogatives in a\ncentral authority. As long as human beings are guided by their\npassions, the state is necessary to bring it about that they\n“live harmoniously and be of assistance to one\nanother”. \nThe ostensive aim of the Theological-Political Treatise\n(TTP), widely vilified in its time, is, as its subtitle proclaims, to\nshow that “the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted\nwithout injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that\nthe peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the\nsuppression of this freedom.” But Spinoza’s ultimate\nintention is reveal the truth about Scripture and religion, and\nthereby to undercut the political power exercised in modern states by\nreligious authorities. He also defends, at least as a political ideal,\nthe tolerant, secular, and democratic polity.  \nSpinoza begins the TTP by alerting his readers, through a kind of\n“natural history of religion”, to just those superstitious\nbeliefs and behaviors that clergy, by playing on ordinary human\nemotions, encourage in their followers. A person guided by fear and\nhope, the main emotions in a life devoted to the pursuit of temporal\nadvantages, turns, in the face of the vagaries of fortune, to\nbehaviors calculated to secure the goods he desires. Thus, we pray,\nworship, make votive offerings, sacrifice and engage in all the\nvarious rituals of popular religion. But the emotions are as fleeting\nas the objects that occasion them, and thus the superstitions grounded\nin those emotions subject to fluctuations. Ambitious and self-serving\nclergy do their best to stabilize this situation and give some\npermanence to those beliefs and behaviors. “Immense efforts have\nbeen made to invest religion, true or false, with such pomp and\nceremony that it can sustain any shock and constantly evoke the\ndeepest reverence in all its worshippers” (TTP, Preface, G\nIII.6–7/S 2–3). Religious leaders are generally abetted in\ntheir purposes by the civil authority, which threatens to punish all\ndeviations from theological orthodoxy as “sedition”. The\nresult is a state religion that has no rational foundations, a mere\n“respect for ecclesiastics” that involves adulation and\nmysteries but no true worship of God. \nThe solution to this state of affairs, Spinoza believes, is to examine\nthe Bible anew and find the doctrines of the “true\nreligion”. Only then will we be able to delimit exactly what we\nneed to do to show proper respect for God and obtain blessedness. This\nwill reduce the sway that religious authorities have over our\nemotional, intellectual and physical lives, and reinstate a proper and\nhealthy relationship between the state and religion. A close analysis\nof the Bible is particularly important for any argument that the\nfreedom of philosophizing—essentially, freedom of thought and\nspeech—is not prejudicial to piety. If it can be demonstrated\nthat Scripture is not a source of “natural truth”, but the\nbearer of only a simple moral message (“Love your\nneighbor”), then people will see that “faith is something\nseparate from philosophy”. Spinoza intends to show that in that\nmoral message alone—and not in Scripture’s words, origin\nor history—lies the sacredness of what is otherwise merely a\nhuman document. The Bible teaches only “obedience [to\nGod]”, not knowledge. Thus, philosophy and religion, reason and\nfaith, inhabit two distinct and exclusive spheres, and neither should\ntread in the domain of the other. The freedom to philosophize and\nspeculate can therefore be granted without any harm to true religion.\nIn fact, such freedom is essential to public peace and piety, since\nmost civil disturbances arise from sectarian disputes. The real danger\nto a republic comes from those who would worship not God, but some\nwords on a page: “It will be said that, although God’s law\nis inscribed in our hearts, Scripture is nevertheless the Word of God,\nand it is no more permissible to say of Scripture that it is mutilated\nand contaminated than to say this of God’s Word. In reply, I\nhave to say that such objectors are carrying their piety too far, and\nare turning religion into superstition; indeed, instead of God’s\nWord they are beginning to worship likenesses and images, that is,\npaper and ink” (TTP, chap. 12, G III.159/S 145–6). \nFrom a proper and informed reading of Scripture, a number of things\nbecome clear. First, the prophets were not men of exceptional\nintellectual talents—they were not, that is, naturally gifted\nphilosophers—but simply very pious, even morally superior\nindividuals endowed with vivid imaginations. They were able to\nperceive God’s revelation through their imaginative faculties\nvia words or real or imaginary figures. This is what allowed them to\napprehend that which lies beyond the boundary of the intellect.\nMoreover, the content of a prophecy varied according to the physical\ntemperament, imaginative powers, and particular opinions or prejudices\nof the prophet. It follows that prophecy, while it has its origins in\nthe power of God—and in this respect it is, in Spinoza’s\nmetaphysical scheme, no different from any other natural\nevent—does not provide privileged knowledge of natural or\nspiritual phenomena. The prophets are not necessarily to be trusted\nwhen it comes to matters of the intellect, on questions of philosophy,\nhistory or science; and their pronouncements set no parameters on what\nshould or should not be believed about the natural world on the basis\nof our rational faculties. \nSpinoza provides an equally deflationary account of God’s\nelection, or the “vocation”, of the Hebrews. It is\n“childish”, he insists, for anyone to base their happiness\non the uniqueness of their gifts; in the case of the Jews, it would be\nthe uniqueness of their being chosen among all people. The ancient\nHebrews, in fact, did not surpass other nations in their wisdom or in\ntheir proximity to God. They were neither intellectually nor morally\nsuperior to other peoples. They were “chosen” only with\nrespect to their social organization and political good fortune. God\nor Nature gave them a set of laws (through a wise lawgiver, Moses),\nwhich they obeyed, and made their surrounding enemies weaker than\nthem. The natural result of this “internal” and\n“external” aid is that their society was well-ordered and\ntheir autonomous government persisted for a long time. Their election\nwas thus a temporal and conditional one, and their kingdom is now long\ngone. Thus, “at the present time there is nothing whatsoever\nthat the Jews can arrogate to themselves above other nations”\n(TTP, chap. 3, G III.56/S 45). Spinoza thereby rejects the\nparticularism that many—including Amsterdam’s Sephardic\nrabbis—insisted was essential to Judaism. True piety and\nblessedness are universal in their scope and accessible to anyone,\nregardless of their confessional creed. \nCentral to Spinoza’s analysis of the Jewish\nreligion—although it is applicable to any religion\nwhatsoever—is the distinction between the divine law and the\nceremonial law. The law of God commands only the knowledge and love of\nGod and the actions required for attaining that condition. Such love\nmust arise not from fear of possible penalties or hope for any\nrewards, but solely from the goodness of its object. The divine law\ndoes not demand any particular rites or ceremonies such as\nsacrifices or dietary restrictions or festival observances. The six\nhundred and thirteen precepts of the Torah have nothing to do with\nblessedness or virtue. They were directed only at the Hebrews so that\nthey might govern themselves in an autonomous state. The ceremonial\nlaws helped preserve their kingdom and insure its prosperity, but were\nvalid only as long as that political entity lasted. They are not\nbinding on all Jews under all circumstances. They were, in fact,\ninstituted by Moses for a purely practical reason: so that people\nmight do their duty and not go their own way. This is true not just of\nthe rites and practices of Judaism, but of the outer ceremonies of all\nreligions. None of these activities have anything to do with true\nhappiness or piety. They serve only to control people’s behavior\nand preserve a particular society. \nA similar practical function is served by stories of miracles.\nScripture speaks in a language suited to affect the imagination of\nordinary people and compel their obedience. Rather than appealing to\nthe natural and real causes of all events, its authors sometimes\nnarrate things in a way calculated to move people—particularly\nuneducated people—to devotion. “If Scripture were to\ndescribe the downfall of an empire in the style adopted by political\nhistorians, the common people would not be stirred …”\nStrictly speaking, however, miracles—understood as divinely\ncaused departures from the ordinary course of nature—are\nimpossible. Every event, no matter how extraordinary, has a natural\ncause and explanation. “Nothing happens in nature that does not\nfollow from her laws” (TTP, chap. 6, G III.83/S 73). This is\nsimply a consequence of Spinoza’s metaphysical doctrines.\nMiracles as traditionally conceived require a distinction between God\nand nature, something that Spinoza’s philosophy rules out in\nprinciple. Moreover, nature’s order is inviolable in so far as\nthe sequence of events in nature is a necessary consequence of\nGod’s attributes. There certainly are “miracles” in\nthe sense of events whose natural causes are unknown to us, and which\nwe therefore attribute to the powers of a supernatural God. But this\nis, once again, to retreat to superstition, “the bitter enemy of\nall true knowledge and true morality”. \nBy analyzing prophecy in terms of vividness of imagination, Jewish\nelection as political fortune, the ceremonial law as a kind of social\nand political expediency, and the belief in miracles as an ignorance\nof nature’s necessary causal operations, Spinoza naturalizes\n(and, consequently, demystifies) some of the fundamental elements of\nJudaism and other religions and undermines the foundations of their\nexternal, superstitious rites. At the same time, he thereby reduces\nthe fundamental doctrine of piety to a simple and universal formula,\nnaturalistic in itself, involving love and knowledge. This process of\nnaturalization achieves its stunning climax when Spinoza turns to\nconsider the authorship and interpretation of the Bible itself.\nSpinoza’s views on Scripture constitute, without question, the\nmost radical theses of the Treatise, and explain why he was\nattacked with such vitriol by his contemporaries. Others before\nSpinoza had suggested that Moses was not the author of the entire\nPentateuch (for example, Abraham ibn Ezra in the twelfth century and,\nin the seventeenth century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes).\nBut no one had taken that claim to the extreme limit that Spinoza did,\narguing for it with such boldness and at such length. Nor had anyone\nbefore Spinoza been willing to draw from it the conclusions about the\nstatus, meaning and interpretation of Scripture that Spinoza drew. \nSpinoza denied that Moses wrote all, or even most of the Torah. The\nreferences in the Pentateuch to Moses in the third person; the\nnarration of his death and, particularly, of events following his\ndeath; and the fact that some places are called by names that they did\nnot bear in the time of Moses all “make it clear beyond a shadow\nof doubt” that the writings commonly referred to as “the\nFive Books of Moses” were, in fact, written by someone who lived\nmany generations after Moses. Moses did, to be sure, compose some\nbooks of history and of law; and remnants of those long lost books can\nbe found in the Pentateuch. But the Torah as we have it, as well as as\nother books of the Hebrew Bible (such as Joshua, Judges, Samuel and\nKings) were written neither by the individuals whose names they bear\nnor by any person appearing in them. Spinoza believes that these were,\nin fact, all composed by a single historian living many generations\nafter the events narrated, and that this was most likely Ezra the\nScribe. It was the post-exilic leader who took the many writings that\nhad come down to him and began weaving them into a single (but not\nseamless) narrative. Ezra’s work was later completed and\nsupplemented by the editorial labors of others. What we now possess,\nthen, is nothing but a compilation, and a rather mismanaged, haphazard\nand “mutilated” one at that. \nAs for the books of the Prophets, they are of even later provenance,\ncompiled (or “heaped together”, in Spinoza’s view)\nby a chronicler or scribe perhaps as late as the Second Temple period.\nCanonization into Scripture occurred only in the second century BCE,\nwhen the Pharisees selected a number of texts from a multitude of\nothers. Because the process of transmission was a historical one,\ninvolving the conveyance of writings of human origin over a long\nperiod of time through numerous scribes, and because the decision to\ninclude some books but not others was made by fallible human beings,\nthere are good reasons for believing that a significant portion of the\ntext of the “Old Testament” is corrupt. \nWhile in 1670 there was nothing novel in claiming that Moses did not\nwrite all of the Torah, Spinoza’s remarkably innovative claim\nwas to argue that this holds great significance for how Scripture is\nto be read and interpreted. He was dismayed by the way in which\nScripture itself was worshipped, by the reverence accorded to the\nwords on the page rather than to the message they conveyed. If the\nBible is an historical (i.e., natural) document, then it should be\ntreated like any other work of nature. The study of Scripture, or\nBiblical hermeneutics, should therefore proceed as the study of\nnature, or natural science, proceeds: by gathering and evaluating\nempirical data, that is, by examining the “book”\nitself—along with the contextual conditions of its\ncomposition—for its general principles. \nJust as the knowledge of nature must be sought from nature alone, so\nmust the knowledge of Scripture—an apprehension of its intended\nmeaning—be sought from Scripture alone and through the\nappropriate exercise of rational and textual inquiry. \nWhen properly interpreted, the universal message conveyed by Scripture\nis a simple moral one: “To know and love God, and to love\none’s neighbor as oneself”. This is the real word\nof God and the foundation of true piety, and it lies uncorrupted in a\nfaulty, tampered and corrupt text. The lesson involves no metaphysical\ndoctrines about God or nature, and requires no sophisticated training\nin philosophy. In contrast with Maimonides’ account, Spinoza\ninsists that the object of Scripture is not to impart truth or\nknowledge, but to compel obedience and regulate our conduct.\n“Scriptural doctrine contains not abstruse speculation or\nphilosophic reasoning, but very simple matters able to be understood\nby the most sluggish mind” (TTP, chap. 13, G III.167/S 153). To\nthe extent (and only to the extent) that Scripture is successful in\nmorally edifying its readers and inspiring them to obey the word of\nGod and treat others with justice and charity, it is\n“divine”. Spinoza claims, in fact, that a familiarity with\nScripture is not even necessary for piety and blessedness, since its\nmessage can be known by our rational faculties alone, although with\ngreat difficulty for most people. “He who, while unacquainted\nwith these writings, nevertheless knows by the natural light that\nthere is a God having the attributes we have recounted, and who also\npursues a true way of life, is altogether blessed.”  \nIt follows that the only practical commandments that properly belong\nto religion are those that are necessary to carry out the moral\nprecept and “confirm in our hearts the love of our\nneighbor”. “A catholic faith should therefore contain only\nthose dogmas which obedience to God absolutely demands, and without\nwhich such obedience is absolutely impossible … these must all\nbe directed to this one end: that there is a Supreme Being who loves\njustice and charity, whom all must obey in order to be saved, and must\nworship by practicing justice and charity to their neighbor”\n(TTP, chap. 14, G III.177/S 161–2). As for other dogmas,\n“every person should embrace those that he, being the best judge\nof himself, feels will do most to strengthen in him love of\njustice”. \nThis is the heart of Spinoza’s case for toleration, for freedom\nof philosophizing and freedom of religious expression. By reducing the\ncentral message of Scripture—and the essential content of\npiety—to a simple moral maxim, one that is free of any\nsuperfluous speculative doctrines or ceremonial practices; and by\nfreeing Scripture of the burden of having to communicate specific\nphilosophical truths or of prescribing (or proscribing) a multitude of\nrequired behaviors, he has demonstrated both that philosophy is\nindependent from religion and that the liberty of each individual to\ninterpret religion as he wishes can be upheld without any detriment to\npiety. \nFaith and piety belong not to the person who has the most rational\nargument for the existence of God or the most thorough philosophical\nunderstanding of his attributes, but to the person “who best\ndisplays works of justice and charity”. \nSpinoza’s account of religion has clear political ramifications.\nThere had always been a quasi-political agenda behind his decision to\nwrite the TTP, since his attack was directed at political meddling by\nreligious authorities. But he also took the opportunity to give a more\ndetailed and thorough presentation of a general theory of the state\nthat is only sketchily present in the Ethics. Such an\nexamination of the true nature of political society is particularly\nimportant to his argument for intellectual and religious freedom,\nsince he must show that such freedom is not only compatible with\npolitical well-being, but essential to it.  \nThe individual egoism of the Ethics plays itself out in a\npre-political context—the so-called “state of\nnature”, a universal condition where there is no law or religion\nor justice and injustice—as the right of every individual to do\nwhatever he can to preserve himself. “Whatever every person,\nwhenever he is considered as solely under the dominion of Nature,\nbelieves to be to his advantage, whether under the guidance of sound\nreason or under passion’s sway, he may by sovereign natural\nright seek and get for himself by any means, by force, deceit,\nentreaty, or in any other way he best can, and he may consequently\nregard as his enemy anyone who tries to hinder him from getting what\nhe wants” (TTP, chap. 16, G III.190/S 174). Naturally, this is a\nrather insecure and dangerous condition under which to live. In\nHobbes’ celebrated phrase—and Spinoza was clearly\ninfluenced by his reading of that British thinker—life in the\nstate of nature is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort”. As rational creatures, we soon realize that we would be\nbetter off, still from a thoroughly egoistic perspective, coming to an\nagreement among ourselves to restrain our opposing desires and the\nunbounded pursuit of self-interest—in sum, that it would be in\nour greater self-interest to live under the law of reason rather than\nthe law of nature. We thus agree to hand over to a sovereign our\nnatural right and power to do whatever we can to satisfy our\ninterests. That sovereign—whether it be an individual (in which\ncase the resulting state is a monarchy), a small group of individuals\n(an oligarchy) or the body-politic as a whole (a democracy)—will\nbe absolute and unrestrained in the scope of its powers. It will be\ncharged with keeping all the members of society to the agreement,\nmostly by playing on their fear of the consequences of breaking the\n“social contract”. \nObedience to the sovereign does not infringe upon our autonomy, since\nin following the commands of the sovereign we are following an\nauthority whom we have freely authorized and whose commands have no\nother object than our own rational self- interest. The type of\ngovernment most likely to respect and preserve that autonomy, issue\nlaws based on sound reason and to serve the ends for which government\nis instituted is democracy. It is the “most natural” form\nof governing arising out of a social contract—since in a\ndemocracy the people obey only laws that issue from the general will\nof the body politic—and the least subject to various abuses of\npower. In a democracy, the rationality of the sovereign’s\ncommands is practically secured, since it is unlikely that a majority\nof a large number of people will agree to an irrational design.\nMonarchy, on the other hand, is the least stable form of government\nand the one most likely to degenerate into tyranny. \nSince the outward practices of religion impinge upon the comportment\nand relations of citizens, they fall under “state\nbusiness” and, thus, within the sphere of the sovereign’s\npower. The sovereign should have complete dominion in all public\nmatters secular and spiritual. There should be no church separate from\nthe religion instituted and regulated by the state. This will prevent\nsectarianism and the multiplication of religious disputes. All\nquestions concerning external religious rites and ceremonies are in\nthe hands of the sovereign. This is in the best interest of everyone,\nsince the sovereign will, ideally and in conformity with its\n“contractual” duty, insure that such practices are in\naccord with public peace and safety and social well-being. The\nsovereign should rule in such a way that his commands enforce\nGod’s law. Justice and charity thereby acquire the force of\ncivil law, backed by the power of the sovereign. (For this reason,\nit is misleading to proclaim Spinoza as a proponent of the separation\nof church and state.) \nOn the other hand, dominion over the “inward worship of\nGod” and the beliefs accompanying it—in other words, inner\npiety—belongs exclusively to the individual. This is a matter of\ninalienable, private right, and it cannot be legislated, not even by\nthe sovereign. No one can limit or control another person’s\nthoughts anyway, and it would be foolhardy and destructive to the\npolity for a sovereign to attempt to do so. Nor can speech ever truly\nand effectively be controlled, since people will always say want they\nwant, at least in private. “Everyone is by absolute natural\nright the master of his own thoughts, and thus utter failure will\nattend any attempt in a commonwealth to force men to speak only as\nprescribed by the sovereign despite their different and opposing\nopinions” (TTP, chap. 20, G III.240/S 223). There must, Spinoza\ngrants, be some limits to speech and teaching. Seditious\ndiscourse that encourages individuals to nullify the social contract\nshould not be tolerated. But the best government will err on the side\nof leniency and allow the freedom of philosophical speculation and the\nfreedom of religious belief. Certain “inconveniences”\nwill, no doubt, sometimes result from such an extensive liberty. But\nthe attempt to regulate everything by law is “more likely to\narouse vices than to reform them”. In a passage that foreshadows\nJohn Stuart Mill’s utilitarian defense of liberty nearly two\ncenturies later, Spinoza adds that “this freedom is of the first\nimportance in fostering the sciences and the arts, for only those\nwhose judgment is free and unbiased can attain success in these\nfields” (TTP, chap. 20, G III.243/S 226). \nIt is hard to imagine a more passionate and reasoned defense of\nfreedom and toleration than that offered by Spinoza.","contact.mail":"smnadler@facstaff.wisc.edu","contact.domain":"facstaff.wisc.edu"}]
