(For the\nmost part, this entry will assume male perpetrators and female\nvictims.)\n\n\nVirtually all feminists agree that rape is a grave wrong, one too\noften ignored, mischaracterized, and legitimized. Feminists differ,\nhowever, about how the crime of rape is best understood, and about how\nrape should be combated both legally and socially.\n\nVirtually all feminist thinking about rape shares several underlying\nthemes. First among these is feminists' emphasis on “breaking\nthe silence” around rape. Feminist thought and activism have\nchallenged the myth that rape is rare and exceptional, showing that it\nis in fact a common experience in the lives of girls and women. In\nrecent decades, this awareness emerged in feminist\n“speakouts” and consciousness-raising groups, where women\nshared their experiences of rape and other forms of abuse. It has now\nbeen amply confirmed by research: according to one study of over\n16,000 Americans, 18.3% of women report having been victims of rape or\nattempted rape at some time in their lives (Black et al., 2011). Of\nthese women, 42.2% were under age eighteen when they were first raped;\nan earlier study showed that these women were twice as likely to\nreport having been raped as adults (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).\nIndeed, many women suffer multiple rapes in their lives: in the same\nearlier study, among those who reported having been raped in the past\nyear, the average number of rapes per woman during that time period\nwas 2.9. \nAn accurate estimate of rape's frequency requires a clear\nunderstanding of rape itself and of the varied circumstances in which\nit occurs. Often contributing to the underestimation of rape's\nfrequency is a narrow and stereotypical conception of what rape is:\nfor instance, the image of a stranger jumping out from behind the\nbushes, brandishing a weapon at a woman he has never seen before.\nWhile such rapes do occur, the great majority of rapes are committed\nby a man or men known to the victim: dates, relatives, friends,\nbosses, husbands, neighbors, co-workers, and more. (For this reason,\nagain contrary to stereotype, most rapes are intraracial.) In the\nstudy of over 16,000 Americans mentioned above, 51.1% of female\nvictims were raped by an intimate partner, and 40.8% by an\nacquaintance (Black et al., 2011). Remarkably few assailants are\npunished: with estimated U.S. state conviction rates of two to nine\npercent of total rapes (Kim 2012, 264), “ninety-four to\nninety-eight percent of total rapists and approximately eighty-four\npercent of reported rapists go free” (Kim 2012, 272).  \nPerhaps the most basic challenge that feminists have posed to\ntraditional views of rape lies in the recognition of rape as a crime\nagainst the victim herself. For much of recorded history women were\nthe property of men, with their value as property measured largely by\ntheir sexual “purity.” In this context, rape was regarded\nas a property crime against a woman's husband or father\n(Burgess-Jackson 1996, 44-49). A raped woman or girl was less valuable\nas property, and penalties for rape often involved fines or other\ncompensation paid to her husband or father (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 68).\nThe marital rape exemption in law, which survived in the U.S. into the\n1990's, is clearly a remnant of this approach, assuming as it does\nthat no crime is committed when a man forces intercourse upon his\nwife, since she is his own property; the property status of enslaved\nAfrican-American women was also thought to entitle their owners to the\nwomen's unrestricted sexual use. A further corollary of this view was\nthat women who were not the private property of any\nindividual man—for instance, prostitutes—were unrapeable,\nor at least that no one important was harmed by their rape (Dworkin\n1997, 196–202, Burgess-Jackson 1996, 46-47, 69). Given this\nentrenched historical and cultural legacy, feminists' redefinition of\n‘rape’ as a crime against the woman herself is nothing\nshort of revolutionary. \nSadly, the rate of rape reporting remains low; studies using random\nsample surveys of large numbers of women find reporting rates ranging\nfrom 16% to 36% (Anderson 2003, 78). Rates of conviction, too, remain\nsubstantially lower than for other violent crimes; some studies\nestimate a conviction rate of 5% (Caringella 2008) in the U.S.\nFeminists' recognition of the severity and pervasiveness of rape's\nharms, and of how infrequently victims receive justice, has inspired\ndecades of activism for social and legal change. Feminists in many\nU.S. states have succeeded not only in changing legal definitions of\nrape (see below), but also in ending many damaging and sexist\npractices in rape trials. For instance, “rape shield” laws\nnow restrict the admissibility of evidence about a victim's sexual\nhistory, and most jurisdictions have eliminated the “prompt\nreporting” requirement, the corroboration requirement, and the\nreciting of the traditional “cautionary rule” (that rape\nis a charge easy to make and hard to disprove). All of these practices\nreflect sexist and false assumptions—for instance, that rape\nonly happens (or only matters when it happens) to sexually\n“pure” or “virtuous” women, and that women are\nlikely to lie about having been raped—while increasing the\ntrauma of rape trials for victims and decreasing the likelihood of\nconvictions. In addition to pressing for changes in law and in police\nand prosecutorial practices, feminists have founded and staffed rape\ncrisis centers and hotlines to support victims, whether or not they\nchoose to pursue charges against their attackers. \nFeminist views of rape can be understood as arrayed on a continuum\nfrom liberal to radical. Liberal views tend to regard rape as a\ngender-neutral assault on individual autonomy, likening it to other\nforms of assault and/or illegitimate appropriation, and focusing\nprimarily on the harm that rape does to individual victims. More\nradical views, in contrast, contend that rape must be recognized and\nunderstood as an important pillar of patriarchy. Johnson defines\npatriarchy as a social system in which men disproportionately occupy\npositions of power and authority, central norms and values are\nassociated with manhood and masculinity (which in turn are defined in\nterms of dominance and control), and men are the primary focus of\nattention in most cultural spaces (2005, 4-15). Radical feminists see\nrape as arising from patriarchal constructions of gender and sexuality\nwithin the context of broader systems of male power, and emphasize the\nharm that rape does to women as a group. \nIn addition, radical feminist approaches to rape often share one or\nmore of the following three features. First, they regard the\ndeprivation of women's bodily sovereignty—in particular, male\ncontrol over the sexual and reproductive uses of women's\nbodies—as a central defining element of patriarchy (Whisnant\n2007). As a result, they analyze rape as one of multiple forms of\nmen's sexual violence and exploitation, looking at their\ninterconnections and how they work in concert to maintain and\nreinforce women's oppression. Second, they expand the definition of\n‘rape’ to encompass more than just overt physical force\nand violence (or the explicit threat thereof). Recognizing the ways in\nwhich broad patterns of male power systematically compromise women's\nbodily and sexual freedom, and challenging the equation of female\nsubmission with meaningful consent, they tend to see a kind of\ncontinuum (rather than a bright dividing line) between rape and much\n“normal” heterosexual activity. Third, the focus on\ngroup-based oppression has also led many radical feminist thinkers to\nexamine the role of rape itself, and of ideologies about rape, in\ncreating and reproducing not only patriarchy but multiple systems of\ndomination, including racism and colonialism. \nFeminists are committed to ensuring that women's and girls'\nexperiences of sexual violation are taken seriously as such, that the\nharm they suffer therein is recognized, and that those who inflict\nthat harm are held accountable. Achieving these goals has often\ninvolved arguing that certain kinds of encounters that have previously\nnot been socially or legally recognized as rape should be so\nrecognized—thus, challenging overly restrictive ideas (often\nencoded in law) about what counts as rape (Burgess-Jackson 1996,\n77-86; Sanday 1996, 161-183; Bevacqua 2000). Obvious examples include\nthe abolition of marital-rape exemptions and the recognition of date\nand acquaintance rape. Feminists have also challenged the idea\n(derived from English common law) that, in order for an encounter to\ncount as rape, the victim must have displayed “utmost” (or\neven any) physical resistance, as well as the assumption that rape\nmust involve vaginal penetration by a penis (victims are raped orally,\nanally, and/or with fingers or objects). \nThere are varying feminist views about whether and how the concept of\nrape, and hence its framing in the law, requires further renegotiation\nor expansion. \nBoth social and legal understandings of rape are typically based at\nleast partly on the notion of consent. (Many laws also include a force\nrequirement, about which more below.) To consent to something is to\nreverse a prima facie supposition about what may and may not\nbe done. In most contexts, there is a standing presumption that one\ndoes not have access to and may not make use of another's body,\nproperty, personal information, or other elements of his or her\npersonal domain. This presumption is reversed, however, when (and for\nas long as) the other consents to such access. Consent thus alters the\nstructure of rights and obligations between two or more parties. \nAssuming for the moment that, in sexual encounters, rape exists where\nconsent is lacking, the question then becomes what counts as consent.\nWomen's sexual consent has in many instances been understood quite\nexpansively, as simply the absence of refusal or resistance; feminists\nhave criticized this approach on the grounds that, among its other\nuntoward implications, it regards even unconscious women as consenting\n(MacKinnon 1989b, 340; Archard 1998, 85). Furthermore, it has too\noften been assumed that a woman's appearance, attire, status,\nlocation, prior sexual history, or relationship to the man in question\neither function as stand-ins for consent (that is, as “asking\nfor it”) or render her consent irrelevant or unnecessary. A\nvital task on the feminist agenda has been to challenge and discredit\nsuch ideas—to deny that what a woman wears, where she goes and\nwith whom, or what sexual choices she has made in the past have any\nrelevance to whether she should be seen as having consented to sex on\na particular occasion. \nConsent in general may be understood as either attitudinal or\nperformative (Kazan 1998). Attitudinal accounts see consent as a\nmental state of affirmation or willingness, while performative\naccounts see it as a certain kind of action or utterance (for\ninstance, saying “yes” or nodding). Because the kinds of\nbehaviors mentioned above (such as wearing revealing clothes, going\nsomewhere alone with a man, or engaging in heavy petting) have often\nbeen claimed by perpetrators to constitute evidence that a woman was\nin a mental state of willingness to have intercourse, feminists have\noften rejected attitudinal accounts in favor of performative ones;\nwith a performative account, in contrast, a defendant can be\nchallenged to articulate exactly what the woman said or did that\nconstituted her consent to intercourse. An added advantage of a\nperformative account is that it suggests that sexual consent is not a\nwoman's implied default state, but rather must be actively and\naffirmatively granted. Again, this is in contrast to traditional\npatriarchal views, which often assumed that unless a woman physically\nresisted—again, even “to the utmost”—a man's\nattempt to have intercourse, she was consenting (or at least he was\njustified in proceeding on that assumption). \nOne limitation of a purely performative account of consent is that it\ndoes not take into account the context in which the relevant behavior\nor utterance occurs. For instance, if a woman says “yes”\nor even feigns sexual enthusiasm in order to keep a knife-wielding\nattacker from becoming angry and hurting or killing her, it would be\nabsurd to regard her behavior or utterance as consent (or at least as\nmeaningful consent). The question is what other contextual constraints\nand pressures may also undermine the validity of a woman's (apparent)\nconsent. To put the point another way, having granted that\n“no” always means no, we must recognize that, in some\ncases, “yes” also means no. There are many kinds of\nexplicit and implicit threats that render a woman's consent to sex\nless than meaningful: the man may threaten to sue for custody of their\nchildren, to derail her green card application, to evict her, or\nsimply to sulk and make her life miserable for days should she refuse\nto have sex. Which (if any) such nonviolent coercive pressures should\nbe regarded as rape, either morally or legally, is a matter of some\ncontroversy (Schulhofer 1998; Burgess-Jackson 1996, 91-106). \nThe question is especially important from a feminist point of view,\nsince it is to be expected that in a patriarchal society men\nfrequently hold positions of social, legal, and/or institutional power\nover women and are thus positioned to withhold important benefits from\nwomen who refuse them sexual access, in addition to threatening harms\nand penalties. Viewing at least certain kinds of nonviolent coercive\npressures as incompatible with meaningful consent may yield the\nconclusion that some quid pro quo sexual harassment is also\nrape (Falk 1998). Furthermore, some radical feminists' description of\nprostitution as “commercial sexual violence” (Jeffreys\n1997) reflects an expansive understanding of the economic and other\ncoercive pressures that often compel women's consent to sexual acts in\nprostitution (even where physical violence does not play a role). \nA further complicating question is whether the criminal law's usual\nrequirement of mens rea (or “guilty mind”) should\napply to rape and, if so, how that requirement should be interpreted.\nIn the most general terms, a mens rea requirement means that\nthe prosecution must show not only that nonconsensual sex occurred,\nbut also that the man was in a certain state of mind with regard to\nthe woman's lack of consent. Just what that state of mind\nis—what counts as mens rea in cases of rape—is a\nmatter of some dispute (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 137–161). \nThe most conservative position—defended most famously in the\n1976 DPP v Morgan decision (Baron 2001, 9-14)—holds\nthat a man has mens rea only if he believes the woman is not\nconsenting (or that she is at least probably not consenting). On this\nview, a man who sincerely believes that the woman is consenting is not\nguilty of rape, no matter how unreasonable his belief may be under the\ncircumstances. A more moderate view is that a man has mens\nrea if he either believes the woman is not consenting or believes\nunreasonably that she is consenting. Thus, in jurisdictions where this\nunderstanding of mens rea is in force, the question of\nwhether the woman actually consented often gives\nway—particularly in cases of date and acquaintance rape—to\nthe question of whether the man reasonably believed she consented. \nTheorists have different views about the conditions under which it is\nreasonable for a man to believe that a woman is consenting to sexual\nintercourse. Husak and Thomas (1992) argue that there are social and\nbehavioral conventions (or “courtship rituals”) by which\nwomen manifest their willingness to have sex, and that where a woman\nhas engaged in such conventions, it is reasonable for a man to believe\nshe is consenting to sexual intercourse. Archard (1997) argues\nforcefully against this view, however, pointing out that any such\nconventions are likely to be ambiguous and not universally understood\n(particularly since research shows that men routinely interpret\nwomen's behavior in more sexual terms than women mean or intend), that\na man risks doing serious harm by relying on his beliefs about such\nconventions, and that there is a ready alternative to risking such\nharm, namely, inquiring explicitly as to his partner's consent or lack\nthereof. \nOne influential interpretation of “reasonable belief” in\nsexual consent is that of Lois Pineau (1989), who points out that\njudgments of reasonableness in this area must be based on some\nnormative conception of healthy, normal sexual interaction. The\nprevailing conception, which she calls the\n“aggressive-contractual model,” holds that women's\nsexually provocative behavior generates enforceable agreements to have\nsex, that male sexuality is uncontrollable past a certain point, and\nthat women are not to be trusted in matters of sexuality. Pineau\nbelieves that this model is the backdrop against which many people\nbase their judgments about reasonable belief in rape cases. The\naggressive-contractual model should be replaced, she argues, with a\nmodel of “communicative sexuality,” one that emphasizes\n“an atmosphere of comfort and communication, a minimum of\npressure, and an on-going checkup on one's partner's state”\n(1989, 231). Communicative sexuality is most likely to be rewarding\nfor both parties, allows them to promote each other's sensual ends\nnon-manipulatively and non-paternalistically, and observes norms\nappropriate to friendship and trust. Because it is through\ncommunication that one gains knowledge of one's partner's desires or\nlack thereof, Pineau contends that “where communicative\nsexuality does not occur, we lack the main ground for believing that\nthe sex involved was consensual.” She continues: \nIn short, if a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, then he\ndoes not really know whether his partner is consenting; thus, if he\nnonetheless believes that she is consenting, then that belief is\nunreasonable. \nFinally, some feminists have argued that rape should be a strict\nliability offense, that is, one with no mens rea requirement\nat all. According to MacKinnon, a mens rea requirement means\nthat “the man's perceptions of the woman's desires determine\nwhether she is deemed violated,” and this approach is\nproblematic because “men are systematically conditioned not even\nto notice what women want” (1989, 180-81). Adopting a\n“reasonable belief” standard does not help, in her view,\nbecause the standard for “reasonableness” masquerades as\nobjectivity while almost inevitably relying on patriarchal and\npornographic assumptions; thus “measuring consent from the\nsocially reasonable, meaning objective man's, point of view reproduces\nthe same problem under a more elevated label” (181). \nHere MacKinnon speaks to a broader debate in feminist legal theory, in\nwhich some feminists have argued for the adoption of a\n“reasonable woman standard” in matters ranging from sexual\nharassment to stalking, battering, and rape. Proponents of this\napproach believe that a gender-neutral standard of reasonableness is\nimpossible given the differences between men's and women's social\npositioning. They point out, for instance, that men have greater\nsocial and (in most cases) physical power than women and, relatedly,\nthat women's beliefs and reactions are shaped by the constant threat\nof male violence with which women live (Kerns 2001). Because of these\ndifferences, women and men often have divergent perceptions of\ninterpersonal behavior (Scheppele 1991, 45): for instance, behavior\nthat men see as merely flirtatious may be experienced by women as\noffensive or even threatening, and women may see advances as\nphysically intimidating that men see as aggressively amorous.\nProponents thus contend, in the words of Hubin and Haely (who reject\nthis approach), that “when we seek to determine whether the\nactions and words of the victim constitute or indicate consent to\nsexual intercourse – it is the standard of the reasonable\nwoman we must employ” (1999, 119). Thus, for example,\nin assessing the reasonableness of an alleged victim‘s judgment\nthat it would be dangerous to resist a particular sexual advance, a\njury would ask whether a reasonable woman in that situation\nwould so judge. Opponents of the reasonable woman standard contend\nthat it is both possible and desirable to account for common\ndifferences between men's and women's physiologies, social\nexperiences, and perceptions without importing gender into the\ndefinition of reasonableness itself. For instance, while granting that\na reasonable person standard should often yield different conclusions\nfor men than for women, Hubin and Haely contend that “this is\nnot because the reasonable person standard fails to present a single\n(gender neutral) standard, but because the standard we are employing\nis sensitive to features of the agent and the situation that are\ncorrelated with gender” (1999, 133). \nIn many jurisdictions, the law defines the crime of rape as comprising\ntwo separate elements: force and lack of consent. As West observes, in\nsuch jurisdictions \nWest explains that, historically, rape law has seen two kinds of\nforced sex as consensual: first, the sex that a man forces on his wife\n(since she was thought to have “consented” permanently and\nirrevocably to sex by getting married); and second, submission or\nacquiescence in the face of a show of force and/or a threat of more\nviolence to come. Furthermore, she points out, women are often\nportrayed in both pornographic and mainstream media as enjoying, and\n(the assumption is) therefore consenting to, forceful and even violent\nsex; such assumptions often derail rape cases, as when a defendant\nclaims that the encounter was simply “rough sex” that was\nenjoyed by the victim. Underlying the inclusion of a nonconsent\nrequirement over and above the force requirement, according to West,\nis the view that “women consent to forced sex all the\ntime—so forced sex alone can't be rape” (239). Cases of\nnonconsensual but unforced sex, on the other hand, include those in\nwhich the victim is induced to have sex through fraudulent\nmisrepresentation (for instance, a doctor telling her that sex with\nhim is necessary for her cure), and those in which she is coerced\nthrough nonviolent means (for instance, a professor telling her that\nshe must have sex with him to pass the course). The tendency of the\nlaw to see such encounters as meaningfully consensual departs\nstrikingly from how consent is understood in other areas; as West\nobserves, “fraud or coercion that vitiates consent in\nnonsexual contexts constitutes either criminal or tortious\nactivity” (240). \nMost feminists see the dual requirement of force and nonconsent as\nredundant at best and, at worst, as defining many rapes out of\nexistence. Feminists differ, however, as to how rape laws should\nideally be structured. Perhaps the most common view is that the force\nrequirement should be eliminated, and rape defined simply as\nnonconsensual sex, with differing degrees of severity depending on\nwhether and how much force and violence are employed (Estrich 1987).\nWhile some state statutes are now written this way, they often build\nphysical force into the definition of non-consent; thus in practice\nthey function very much like the dual requirement of force and\nnon-consent (Anderson 2005a, 630). \nAnother alternative is to eliminate the nonconsent requirement,\ndefining rape simply as forced sex. MacKinnon defends a variant of\nthis strategy, contending that “Rape should be defined as sex by\ncompulsion, of which physical force is one form. Lack of consent is\nredundant and should not be a separate element of the crime”\n(1989, 245). This approach has the advantage of focusing on what the\nperpetrator did, rather than on how the victim responded (that is, on\nwhether her behavior constituted, or could reasonably have been seen\nby the perpetrator as constituting, consent). \nA third approach is to separate the two elements into two separate\ncrimes, one based on the use of force and the other on the lack of\nconsent. McGregor defends this idea, proposing that: \nSchulhofer (1998) argues, in a similar vein, that the law should\nrecognize two different offenses: sexual assault, which involves the\nuse of “physical force to compel another person to submit to an\nact of sexual penetration” (283); and sexual abuse, a lesser\n(though still felonious) crime, which involves sexual penetration\nwithout the other person's affirmative and freely given consent. Some\ncommentators have observed that developing such a lesser offense may\naid in winning convictions, as juries are reluctant to convict\nnonviolent offenders of rape. Anderson (2005a) criticizes this\napproach, however, pointing out that survivors of what she calls\n“all-American rape” (nonconsensual sex without extrinsic\nforce or violence, usually committed by an acquaintance) suffer trauma\nat least as severe as do survivors of forceful rape. She contends that\n“all-American rape” should retain the powerful label (and\npotentially severe penalty) of rape, while rapists who employ violence\nextrinsic to the rape itself should be charged with rape and\nother offenses (such as kidnapping or aggravated assault) as\nappropriate. \nRecent scholarship includes some novel approaches to the legal\ndefinition of rape. MacKinnon, for instance, has recommended that a\nbroadened understanding of force (as including hierarchies of power)\nshould be supplemented not by a nonconsent requirement, but by a\nstandard of “welcomeness.” A consent standard, she\nobserves, incorporates gender hierarchy by assuming that men initiate\nsexual contact which women then either accept or refuse, whereas a\nwelcomeness standard suggests the centrality of “choice,\nmutuality, and desire” (2005, 243). She explains her approach as\nfollows: \nMacKinnon also recommends the passage of new, sex-equality-based civil\nrights laws that sexual assault victims can use against their\nattackers. Such laws, in her view, would offer survivors a kind of\ndignity and control that criminal prosecutions often do not, while\nattaching the “stigma of bigotry” to perpetrators\n(248). \nAnderson (2005b) urges the elimination of both the force requirement\nand the nonconsent requirement, and the adoption in their place of\nwhat she calls the “negotiation model.” She contrasts her\napproach with the two most common “reform” positions,\nwhich she calls the No Model and the Yes Model. According to the No\nModel, a sexual act is consensual unless the victim says no or resists\nphysically. According to the Yes Model, a sexual act is rape unless\nconsent is affirmatively granted (by verbal or physical behavior).\nAgainst the No Model, Anderson points out that many victims suffer\nperitraumatic paralysis and/or dissociation—that is, conditions\nat the time of trauma that render them unable to protest or resist.\nFurthermore, both the No and Yes models rely heavily on men's ability\nto interpret women's nonverbal behavior, despite strong evidence\nshowing that men routinely fail in this endeavor: the No Model, for\ninstance, allows a man to infer consent from a woman's silence and\nlack of physical resistance. Finally, both models in practice tend to\nassume that a woman's willing participation in non-penetrative sexual\nactivity is a reliable indicator of her consent to penetration (for\ninstance, Anderson points out that according to Schulhofer, an\nadvocate of the Yes Model, a woman's engaging in heavy sexual petting\ntypically indicates her affirmative willingness to have intercourse).\nThis assumption, Anderson emphasizes, is not only often untrue but, in\nthe age of AIDS, especially dangerous. \nLike MacKinnon, Anderson sees a fundamental problem in the notion of\nsexual consent as “a woman's passive acquiescence to male sexual\ninitiative” (1406). Negotiation, in contrast, “suggests\nnot the granting of permission for the actions of another … but\nan active consultation with someone else to come to a mutual\nagreement” (1421). The negotiation model thus requires\n“consultation, reciprocal communication, and the exchange of\nviews before a person initiates sexual penetration” (1421).\n(This requirement of consultation before penetration distinguishes\nAnderson's approach from Pineau's, despite their shared emphasis on\ncommunication; in addition, Pineau's model retains an overall consent\nstandard whereas Anderson abandons that standard.) Unless and until a\nrelational context has been established that enables partners to\ninterpret reliably each other's nonverbal behavior, the negotiation\nmust be verbal. The negotiation model is gender-neutral, requiring\nthat any person who initiates sexual penetration consult verbally with\nhis or her partner (of either gender) to come to a mutual\nunderstanding of whether both parties want penetration to occur. Such\ncommunication, Anderson observes, “expresses an interest in the\nother person's perspective … [and] a willingness to consider\nthe other person's inclinations and humanity. It expresses that the\nother person matters” (1423). The negotiation model thus differs\nat least in spirit from even a version of the Yes Model that requires\nverbal consent, in that it emphasizes mutuality rather than a\none-sided permission-seeking. \nLegal theorist Jane Kim has argued that “rape tolerance”\nin the United States—evidenced by low rates of arrest,\nprosecution, and conviction of rapists at the state\nlevel—indicates a need for new legal approaches (2012, 273). In\nher view, “rape should be considered a form of slavery\nprohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, allowing\nfor the creation of a federal criminal regime to prosecute and\nprioritize rape in conjunction with state regimes” (266). She\nargues that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit slavery\nand involuntary servitude in all of its forms, and that neither the\nbrief duration of many rapes nor concerns about a “slippery\nslope” warrant excluding rape from its purview. “In order\nto construct and prosecute rape in a manner consistent with its\npurported gravity,” Kim contends, “rape must be\neffectively prosecuted, prohibited, protected against, and abolished\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment” (267). \nIt bears noting that successful rape prosecutions depend not only on\nhow rape is legally defined but, at least equally importantly, on the\ngeneral public's willingness to believe women's testimony (rather than\nseeing them as lying or confused) and to recognize particular\nencounters as instances of the applicable legal definition (that is,\nto see this behavior as force, or this utterance as\nexpressing nonconsent). Also posing a challenge to successful\nprosecution is what Estrich calls the “assumption of risk\napproach to culpability”: the common belief that, as she puts\nit, “women who put themselves in compromising positions\nshouldn't complain when they are compromised” (1992, 10). The\ncontinuing prevalence of such rape-supportive beliefs can render even\nwell-intentioned prosecutors unwilling to pursue legitimate cases,\ngiven the likelihood that juries will refuse to convict. \nAny legal definition of ‘rape’ implies some correlative\nidea of what is morally wrong with rape: its illegitimate use of\nforce, its disregard of the victim's nonconsent, and so on. Feminist\ntheorists have often sought to articulate a more richly textured sense\nof rape's wrongness, and of its distinctive harms, than the law alone\ncan provide. They have thus developed a number of interpretive\nframes—ideas about what rape is most closely akin to, and/or a\nform of—for understanding rape's wrongs and harms. No doubt both\nthe wrong and the harm of rape are complex and multifarious; these\ninterpretive frames suggest emphases that may be illuminating in\ndifferent contexts and for different purposes. \nThe view most commonly identified with feminism in popular discourse\nis that rape is a crime of “violence, not sex”—that\nis, a form of assault whose sexual nature is irrelevant, and which is\nanalogous to other violent crimes. While this view has rarely been\ndefended by feminist philosophers, it has been prominent in some\nfeminist anti-rape public education and activism. (One feminist\ntheorist often claimed to have held this view is Susan Brownmiller\n(1975); see Cahill 2001, 16-28.) Such efforts often seek to challenge\nviews of rape as a “crime of passion,” motivated by the\nperpetrator's overwhelming lust (presumably in response to the\nvictim's sexual attractiveness and/or provocation). Thus, in addition\nto challenging victim-blaming assumptions, feminists often emphasized\nrapists' non-sexual motivations, such as anger and the desire for\ndominance and control; on this view, the rapist is a violent criminal\nlike other violent criminals, not just a guy seeking sex a bit too\nvigorously. Similarly, this approach emphasizes that rape victims are\nreal crime victims, not vaguely titillating people who had some overly\nrough sex and might just have liked it. \nThe limitations of the “violence, not sex” approach,\nhowever, are fairly glaring. Rape's sexual nature is central to\nunderstanding both its perpetrators' motivations and its effects on\nvictims, not to mention the crime's broader social and ideological\nroots and consequences. While perpetrators differ in their strongest\noccurrent motivations, it is important to ask why so many men who wish\nto harm or violate women do so in a sexual manner. Furthermore, some\nrapes do occur because a man wants to have sex, and perhaps would even\nprefer it if his partner consented, but is prepared to proceed without\nher consent. Rape's sexual character is central from the perspective\nof both actual and potential victims; as Cahill observes, “few\nwomen would agree that being raped is essentially equivalent to being\nhit in the face” (2001, 3). Furthermore, many rape survivors are\ndamaged specifically in their sexuality, facing difficulties in their\nsexual relationships in the months and years following the rape.\nFinally, because many rapes do not involve overt extrinsic violence,\nthe “violence, not sex” slogan may make it more difficult\nfor people to recognize less obviously violent experiences of sexual\nforce as rape. In short, rape is forced, abusive, and/or violent\nsex; recognizing rape's sexual nature is crucial to\nunderstanding not only its wrongs and harms, but also the cultural and\npolitical meaning of sex in patriarchal cultures. As MacKinnon\nobserves, “so long as we say that [rape, sexual harassment, and\npornography] are abuses of violence, not sex, we fail to criticize\nwhat has been made of sex, what has been done to us through sex”\n(1987, 86-87). \nThe violation of bodily and sexual autonomy is no doubt among rape's\nmost central harms. In their classic discussion, Frye and Shafer\n(1977) employ the concept of “domain” to elaborate on such\nviolation. A person's domain—“the physical, emotional,\npsychological, and intellectual space it lives in”\n(338)—defines the range of matters over which the person has\nrightful power of consent. Because a person's body is at the very\ncenter of her domain and is the locus of the properties and capacities\nthat make her a person, the intentional invasion of the body is an\nespecially egregious attack: “to presume to wield an effective\npower of consent over the personal properties and/or the body of [a]\ncreature … is ipso facto to deny that there is a person there\nat all” (340). Thus, rape treats the victim not as a person but\nas an object, and one with a purely sexual function. Frye and Shafer\nemphasize that rape's communication of this message constitutes one\nsignificant element of its harm: “[rape] gives [the victim] a\npicture of herself as a being within someone's domain and not as a\nbeing which has domain …. Whether it is the rapist's intention\nor not, being raped conveys for the woman the message that she is a\nbeing without respect, that she is not a person” (341-42).\nHampton sounds a similar theme, contending that through its expressive\ncontent—“representing the rapist as master and the victim\nas inferior object”—rape does an objective “moral\ninjury” to its victim's value (1999, 135). It is not surprising,\nthen, that many rape survivors describe feeling not only worthless,\nbut also numb, absent, or deadened. The reaction is understandable\nsince, as Cahill observes, “Rape, in its total denial of the\nvictim's agency, will, and personhood, can be understood as a denial\nof intersubjectivity itself …. The self is at once denied and\n… stilled, silenced, overcome” (2001, 132). \nSome recent discussions emphasize that a full account of rape's harm\nmust incorporate both its denial of victims' personhood and its\nintimate, sexual and bodily nature. According to Cahill, “rape\nmust be understood fundamentally … as an affront to the\nembodied subject …. a sexually specific act that destroys (if\nonly temporarily) the intersubjective, embodied agency and therefore\npersonhood of a woman” (2001, 13). Anderson, seeking to define\nrape's harm based on the “lived experience” of those who\ngo through it, cites “dehumanization, objectification, and\ndomination” as prominent in the accounts of both rapists and\nrape victims (2005, 641). Rape, she concludes, is best understood not\nonly as the denial of sexual autonomy, but as “sexually invasive\ndehumanization” (643). \nThe humiliation and shame often experienced by rape victims are\npredictable results of experiencing total subjugation and the intimate\nloss of control of one's body. These reactions—not to mention\nvictims' feelings of contamination, of having been defiled or\ndesecrated—are often exacerbated by cultural judgments of raped\nwomen as dirty and impure, or as “damaged goods.” In some\ncultures, these ideas are so powerful that a woman who is raped (or\nwho has consensual illicit sex) is thought to bring shame on her\nentire family; such women sometimes become the victims of so-called\n“honor killings” at the hands of male relatives (Banerjee\n2003, Baxi et al. 2006, Ruggi 1998). \nA distinctive set of harms enters the picture when, as is increasingly\ncommon, women and girls are violated while unconscious, often with\npictures or videos taken and circulated. As Kelly Oliver points out,\n\"lack of consent is valorized within popular culture to the point that\nsexual assault has become a spectator sport and creepshot\nentertainment on social media … sex with unconscious girls,\nespecially accompanied by photographs as trophies, has become a goal\nof some boys and men\" (2016, 59-60). In such cases, Oliver observes,\n\"The trauma of victimization not only becomes public but also\ninfinitely repeatable. It can go viral. It doesn't go away\" (91).\nCressida Heyes (2016) provides a phenomenological account of the\ndevastating harms of raping an unconscious victim. Raping someone who\nis unconscious, Heyes contends, \nThe assumption that such rapes are less harmful than the rapes of\nconscious victims--since the rape itself is not directly\nexperienced--is therefore badly mistaken, Heyes argues. The victim of\nunconscious rape, she points out, \"struggles to feel safe lapsing into\nthe one form of anonymity that is biologically and existentially\nnecessary for human life, yet ultimately she will have no choice but\nto revisit this place over and over … no one can avoid going to\nsleep for very long\" (2016, 379). \nMany rapes lead to additional harms beyond those intrinsic to the rape\nitself. Some rapes cause pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases\n(including HIV infection), and some rapists physically injure their\nvictims. Victims who do not reveal their rapes to others, whether due\nto shame or to the expectation that they will not be believed,\nexperience profound isolation and lack of support; and indeed, many\nwho do report their rapes are disbelieved or blamed by friends,\nfamily, and/or police. Due to both low reporting levels and low\nconviction rates, relatively few victims see their rapists punished;\nmany of those raped by relatives, co-workers, friends, or other\nongoing acquaintances must then face continuing interaction with the\nrapist, while those raped by strangers often fear that the rapist will\nfind and re-victimize them. \nWith or without these additional harms (but especially with them),\nrape constitutes severe trauma. Undergoing trauma shatters the\nvictim's most basic assumptions about herself and her safety in the\nworld. According to Brison, who survived a violent rape and attempted\nmurder, trauma \nWith its profound effects on social connection, cognition, memory, and\nemotion, trauma disrupts the continuity of the self. It is strikingly\ncommon for a trauma survivor to feel that she is not the same person\nshe was prior to the trauma, and even that at least a part of her has\ndied; as Brison puts it, “I felt as if I was experiencing things\nposthumously … as though I'd somehow outlived myself”\n(8-9). To reconstitute the self in a new form, the survivor must\nconstruct a meaningful narrative that incorporates the trauma, but\nmany survivors face obstacles in this endeavor such as disordered\ncognition, memory gaps, feelings of despair and futility, and the lack\nof an audience willing to hear, believe, and understand their story.\nSuch isolation is exacerbated when the trauma was humanly inflicted\n(as with rape), since such assaults, as Brison puts it, “[sever]\nthe sustaining connection between the self and the rest of\nhumanity” (40). Brison's own account emphasizes the\n“extent to which the self is created and sustained by others\nand, thus, is able to be destroyed by them” (62); this\nrelational element is central both to trauma itself and to any\npossible recovery. Because “violent intrusions by others\n… severely impair our ability to be connected to humanity in\nways we value” (61), recovery requires slowly repairing\nconnections—both to others and to damaged parts of\noneself—and rebuilding a sense of trust (again, of both oneself\nand others). \nFor many women, rape is not a one-time event; rather sexual violence\nand exploitation are, for at least some period of time, routine\nconditions of their lives. Such women experience female sexual\nslavery, defined by Barry as any situation in which \nAs Barry observes, such situations include battering relationships,\nmost prostitution, and the sexual abuse of girl children, all of which\nare common around the world. It is thus important to consider the\ndistinctive effects of such repeated and routine sexual trauma. Herman\nhas recommended the adoption of a new diagnosis, complex\npost-traumatic stress disorder, to describe accurately the\npsychological impact of “prolonged, repeated trauma”\n(1997, 119). (This diagnosis is intended to encompass various forms of\nhumanly inflicted trauma, not only sexual trauma.) The damage of such\nprolonged trauma to a victim's personality may be so severe as to\nconstitute what Frye has called mayhem: a psychic\n“maiming” in which the exploiter instills in his victim\nsuch a grossly distorted perspective on herself, her function, and her\nworth that she becomes (whether temporarily or permanently) unable to\nidentify or pursue her own interests, assert her rights, or defend\nherself against further aggression (1983, 70). \nRape is unquestionably a gendered crime: 91% of rape victims are\nfemale, while almost 99% of perpetrators are male (Greenfield 1997).\nIn light both of these numbers and of rape's broader ideological\ndynamics and social consequences, feminists have long contended that\nrape harms not only its individual victims, but also women as a class.\nBrison, for instance, calls rape “gender-motivated violence\nagainst women, which is perpetrated against women collectively, albeit\nnot all at once and in the same place” (2002, 98). Understanding\nhow rape harms women as a group requires analyzing it not only as an\nindividual act but also as an institution—that is, a structured\nsocial practice with distinct positions and roles, and with (explicit\nor implicit) rules that define who may (or must) do what under what\ncircumstances (Card 1991). Feminists have highlighted the ways in\nwhich the institution of rape reinforces the group-based subordination\nof women to men: for instance, by making women fearful, and by\nenforcing patriarchal dictates both about proper female behavior and\nabout the conditions of male sexual entitlement to women's bodies. As\nBurgess-Jackson puts it, “Rape—the act and the\npractice—subjugates an entire class of individuals (women) to\nanother (men) …. every woman, qua woman, is wronged by\nit” (2000, 289). \nFeminists have long claimed that, in patriarchal cultures, rape is not\nanomalous but paradigmatic—that it enacts and reinforces, rather\nthan contradicting, widely shared cultural views about gender and\nsexuality. As Dworkin puts it, “rape is not committed by\npsychopaths or deviants from our social norms—rape is committed\nby exemplars of our social norms …. Rape is no excess,\nno aberration, no accident, no mistake—it embodies sexuality as\nthe culture defines it” (1976, 45–46). A core dynamic of\npatriarchal sexuality, on this view, is the normalizing and\nsexualizing of male (or masculine) control and dominance over females\n(or the feminine). This dynamic finds expression in a number of\nbeliefs about what is natural, acceptable, and even desirable in\nmale-female sexual interaction: that the male will be persistent and\naggressive, the female often reluctant and passive; that the male is\ninvulnerable, powerful, hard, and commanding, and that women desire\nsuch behavior from men; that “real men” are able to get\nsexual access to women when, where, and how they want it; that sexual\nintercourse is an act of male conquest; that women are men's sexual\nobjects or possessions; and that men “need” and are\nentitled to sex. \nOne study of undetected, self-reported acquaintance rapists found that\nthese individuals' propensity to rape was significantly related not\nonly to their acceptance of rape myths and of traditional ideas about\nmale and female sexuality, but also to their belief that male sexual\naggression is normal (Hinck and Thomas 1999, 816). Such beliefs have\nrepeatedly been shown to play a role not only in men's self-reported\nlikelihood of committing rape, but also in people's tendency to define\nrape more restrictively, and to attribute responsibility and blame to\nrape victims (1999, 816). (The influence of rape myths on people's\ndefinitions of rape explains why most men who report engaging in\n“sexually assaultive, abusive, or coercive behavior in order to\nprocure sexual intercourse” (1999, 816) do not define their own\nbehavior as rape.) Feminists have coined the term ‘rape\nculture’ to describe the pervasiveness and acceptability of\nrape-supportive messages in media and popular discourse. Some have\nfurther contended that many rapes, being at least partially motivated\nby group-based animus as expressed in rape-supportive beliefs, should\nbe categorized as hate crimes (Wellman 2006). \nOn this view, rape is a political practice by which spurious beliefs\nabout gender and sexuality are expressed, inscribed, and enforced via\nthe violation and control of women's bodies. Hampton thus claims that\n“rape as it occurs in our society … is a moral injury to\nall women … insofar as it is part of a pattern of response of\nmany men toward many women that aims to establish their mastery\nqua male over a woman qua female …. Rape\nconfirms that women are ‘for’ men: to be used, dominated,\ntreated as objects” (1999, 135). This underlying gender ideology\nhelps to explain why, when men and boys are raped (almost always by\nother males), they are often seen as having been feminized, treated\nlike women and thus rendered shamefully woman-like.  \nMany feminists have emphasized the role of rape in controlling women's\nbehavior through fear. Dworkin contends that, due to the threat of\nrape, “all women live in constant jeopardy, in a virtual state\nof siege” (1976, 37); and several feminists have drawn analogies\nbetween rape and lynching as forms of terrorizing, group-based social\ncontrol (Burgess-Jackson 2000, 286-88). Card argues that rape is a\nterrorist institution, one which—despite its admitted\ndifferences from acts more normally labeled terrorism, such as bombing\nand hijacking—advances its political purpose, the continued\nsubordination of women, by terrorizing a target population (1991).\nLike all terrorism, she contends, rape has two targets: the direct\nvictims, who are seen as expendable, and the broader population to\nwhom a message is sent, and who can then be manipulated by fear into\ncomplying with demands they would otherwise reject. In response to the\nthreat of rape, women scrutinize and restrict their own\nchoices—what they wear, where they go and with whom, whether\nthey drink, what “messages” they may be inadvertently\nsending men, and so on—to ensure that they are following the\nunwritten rules that govern female behavior and that (supposedly)\ndistinguish the bad girls who get raped from the good girls who do\nnot. Even women who, because of their conformity to these rules, do\nnot feel afraid of being raped have nonetheless, Card points out, been\nterrorized into compliance. \nA central element of rape as a terrorist institution, Card claims, is\na protection racket in which men, as the group both creating the\ndanger and proposing to deliver women from it, dole out\nprotection—sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent, often\nillusory—in exchange for women's service, loyalty, and\ncompliance. In this system, “good” men protect virtuous\nand deserving women from “bad” men, and part of what\ndefines a woman as deserving protection is her conformity to rules of\npatriarchal femininity. Women who are not offered protection, or who\ndecline it when offered, are then frequently blamed for being raped.\nFurthermore, as Card points out, the rules of the institution often\ngrant “protectors”—whether husbands, boyfriends, or\npimps—sexual access to the woman or women whom they protect, so\nthat nothing they do to those women is taken to count as rape. The\ninstitution thus requires a woman to give up her sexual autonomy in\nrelation to one man, in order to gain his (conditional and unreliable)\n“protection” from other men. \nThe threat of rape, with its false promise that by being\n“good” we can avoid disaster, plays an important role in\ntraining women in the requirements of femininity. Describing a\n“feminine bodily comportment that is marked by fear,”\nCahill observes that the female body well-trained in femininity\n“is that of a pre-victim” (2001, 157). The feminine body\nis marked by hesitancy, relative weakness, delicacy, and\nrestraint—qualities that in fact render women more vulnerable to\nviolence—and yet the woman or girl is taught to view her sexual\nbody as dangerously provocative because inherently\n“rapable” (159). Hence her duty to control, conceal, and\nmonitor her body and its movements, so as not to bring disaster upon\nherself. “The socially produced feminine body,” Cahill\nclaims, “is the body of the guilty pre-victim ….\nshe was somewhere she should not have been, moving her body in ways\nshe should not have, carrying on in a manner so free and easy as to\nconvey an utter abandonment of her responsibilities of self-protection\nand self-surveillance” (160). By molding women both to\nfemininity and to self-blame, the threat of rape thus systematically\nundermines women's capacity to resist not only rape itself, but\nvarious other elements of their oppression as well. The threat is so\npervasive in the cultural environment that, according to Brison, girls\n“enter womanhood freighted with postmemories of sexual\nviolence” (2002,\n 87)[1],\n and years of peremptory warnings and cautionary tales lead many\nvictims to experience rape as “a threat fulfilled” (Cahill\n2001, 164). \nMany feminists contend that even as the institution of rape\nsystematically disadvantages women, it benefits men as a class by\nunderwriting beliefs about the naturalness of male dominance, defining\nwomen of certain kinds or in certain circumstances as “fair\ngame,” rendering women dependent on and thus beholden to men for\nprotection, and giving men a competitive advantage by restricting\nwomen's freedom of action and movement. May and Strikwerda contend\nthat “just as the benefit to men distributes throughout the male\npopulation in a given society, so the responsibility (for rape) should\ndistribute as well” (1994, 148); in their view, men as a group\nbear collective responsibility for rape. Rape's role in increasing the\nburden of fear in women's and girls' lives leads Burgess-Jackson to\nhighlight it as an issue of distributive justice (1996, 181-205). He\ncontends that the state's obligation to advance justice requires that\nit take steps to redistribute fear so that women no longer bear it as\nan unfair and disproportionate burden; furthermore, he claims, since\nmen as a class are overwhelmingly the cause of women's fear, most or\nall of the costs of such redistribution should be borne by men. \nRape is a tool not only of patriarchy, but also of racism,\ncolonialism, nationalism, and other pernicious hierarchies. These and\nother power relationships in turn make women and girls even more\nvulnerable to rape. In virtually any situation where women and girls\nbelonging to especially desperate or powerless populations are at the\nmercy of men in authority—from female inmates and girls in\nfoster care, to undocumented immigrants, to refugees dependent on U.N.\npeacekeepers and/or humanitarian aid workers for survival—some\nof those men use their authority to force or extort sexual access. \nIn the United States, the racial dynamics of rape are shaped by a long\nhistory of white men raping their African-American female slaves.\nBecause the women were chattel property, the owners (and often\noverseers) could and did use them sexually at will, with complete\nlegal and social impunity. Because children born of slave mothers were\nslaves, regardless of their paternity, many slave owners benefited\nfrom rape by producing more slaves for themselves. Roberts emphasizes,\nhowever, that \nSlaves were frequently forced into undesired sexual liaisons with each\nother as well, based on the whims or the breeding plans of their\nowners. Ultimately, as Collins observes, “Black women as a class\nemerged from slavery as collective rape victims” (2005, 223),\nand the rape of black women, like the lynching of black men, was a\ncenterpiece of Klan activity post-Emancipation. Collins points out,\nhowever, that unlike lynching, black women's sexual abuse by white men\nduring and after slavery did not become a central or universally\nunderstood icon of American racism. The legacy of slavery and its\nattendant ideologies has meant that, both legally and socially,\n“for most of American history the crime of rape of a Black woman\ndid not exist” (Roberts 1997, 31). \nBlack women's unrapeability was not only written into law, but\nreinforced by a racial ideology that defined them as lascivious and\npromiscuous by nature. This same racial ideology stereotyped black men\nas savagely oversexed and thus sexually dangerous, especially to white\nwomen. The post-Civil War terror campaign of lynching, which continued\nthrough the 1930's, was frequently claimed to be punishment for black\nmen who had raped white women, although in fact only a minority of\nlynching victims were even accused of having done any such thing (Hall\n1983, 334; Davis 1981, 189), and of those, many had in fact had\nconsensual relationships with white women (Hall 1983, 340). The racist\nassociation of rape with black men rendered rape by white men\ncomparatively invisible, thus making white men as a group\nunaccountable for rape (Davis 1981, 199), a dynamic that continued\nwell into the 20th century (Dorr 2008). \nThese destructive racial stereotypes remain powerful today, exerting\ninfluence on people's judgments of whether a rape has occurred, how\nserious an offense it is, and who is to blame (Foley et al. 1995;\nDonovan and Williams 2002; George and Martinez 2002). Popular culture\nplays an important role in conveying and legitimizing these\nstereotypes. For instance, the image of sexually savage and\nanimalistic black masculinity is a central trope of the popular\n“interracial” genre of pornography, marketed to white men,\nin which black men are often depicted as damaging white women's bodies\nwith their unusually large penises (Dines 1998, 2006). As Collins\nobserves, “movies, films, music videos, and other mass media\nspectacles that depict Black men as violent and that punish them for\nit have replaced the historical spectacles provided by live, public\nlynchings” (2005, 242). \nThe stereotype of black women as sexually deviant and aggressive\n“Jezebels” finds one contemporary reflection in the\n“hoochie” image, which is increasingly prominent in black\nas well as white cultural and media venues (Collins 2000, 81-84). One\nstudy, designed in part to measure the influence of the Jezebel\nstereotype on young black women's perceptions of their own rapes,\nfound that the “stereotype of Black women as sexually loose\nappeared to be internalized by Black participants and identified as an\nimportant reason why they were raped” (Neville et al. 2004, 91).\nAnother researcher, having found that the African-American women in\nher study were less likely than white women to have disclosed their\nrapes (Wyatt 1992, 86), attributes this difference in part to the fact\nthat “African American women …. do not anticipate that\nthey will be protected by traditional authorities and\ninstitutions” (88). Meanwhile, both the stereotypes of black\nwomen and their structural vulnerabilities contribute to a situation\nin which, for too many, sexual abuse is a routine condition of life:\n“being routinely disbelieved by those who control the\ndefinitions of violence, encountering mass media representations that\ndepict Black women as ‘bitches,’ ‘hoes,’ and\nother controlling images, and/or experiencing daily assaults such as\nhaving their breasts and buttocks fondled by friends and perfect\nstrangers … may become so routine that African American women\ncannot perceive their own pain” (Collins 2005, 229). \nBlack women who have been raped by black men are sometimes silenced,\neither in order to maintain their own hard-won image as\n“respectable” or to avoid further tarnishing the public\nimage of black manhood. They may be penalized or shunned by their\nfamilies and communities for speaking out, and thus cut off from\nimportant sources of support (Collins 2005, 226-27). \nRacist ideologies about rape are also prominent in the history of\ncolonialism and genocide against Native Americans. Ideas about Native\nmen as savage rapists, Native women as downtrodden and raped squaws,\nand white men as heroic saviors of both white and Native women were\nessential to the “colonial imagination” that explained and\njustified the taking of Native lands (Smith 2005, 7-33). These ideas\nwere conveyed in widely read captivity narratives,\nstories—usually apocryphal, and often written by white\nmen—of the abduction and brutal treatment of a white woman by\nthe “savages” (Smith 2005, 21-22; Faludi 2007, 200-279).\nThe message was that white women desperately needed white men's\nprotection, not only in the usual form of restrictions on the women's\nbehavior and mobility, but also by the men's efforts to control and\nkill off dangerous natives. As for supposedly downtrodden Native\nwomen, white men proposed to deliver them from their oppression by\ncivilizing them, assimilating them to more enlightened European values\nand culture. In short, the ideology held that “Native women can\nonly be free while under the dominion of white men, and both Native\nand white women have to be protected from Indian men, rather than from\nwhite men” (Smith, 23). In fact, the reality was quite the\ncontrary. Smith argues that rape was a key method of forcibly\ninstituting patriarchal values in what had been relatively egalitarian\nNative cultures: \nHistory bears out Smith's claim, as white men routinely raped and\nbrutalized Native people—first as prisoners and in massacres\n(Smith 2005, 7-23), and later in epidemic levels of sexual abuse of\nNative children in white-run boarding schools (Smith 2006).  \nRape is a common, indeed arguably universal, form of abuse in war. It\ntakes many forms, including the mass rape of female civilians as\nrecreation and/or as a prize for military victory, the mass rape of\nfemale civilians as a strategy or weapon of war, and the enslavement\nof women and girls to provide sexual service for soldiers and\nofficers. The latter is frequently practiced both by official armies\n(as in the enslavement of mostly Korean and Chinese women and girls by\nJapanese forces during World War II) and by rebel militias (as in the\nabduction of women and girls as “bush wives” for rebels in\nSierra Leone). Additionally, as more women enter military forces, the\nrape of military women by their own male colleagues is an increasingly\nreported abuse (Jeffreys 2007). \nSeifert criticizes the common view of rape as simply a regrettable\nbyproduct of wartime social breakdown and lack of military discipline\n(as well as of naturally aggressive male sexuality), contending that,\nin fact, rape is a routine element of military strategy, aimed at\nundermining the will, morale, cohesion, and self-conception of the\nenemy population. She observes that, during wartime,  \nIt is thus not surprising that rape in war often involves heightened\nsadism, as well as additional abuses such as forcing men to watch the\nrape of their wives or daughters and forcing women to engage in sex\nwith their own sons, brothers, or other family members. In these and\nother cases, according to MacKinnon, the rape of female civilians is\noften “a humiliation rite for the men on the other side who\ncannot (in masculinity's terms) ‘protect’ their women.\nMany of these acts make women's bodies into a medium of men's\nexpression, the means through which one group of men says what it\nwants to say to another” (2006, 223).  \nBecause rape in war frequently seeks to undermine and destroy bonds of\nfamily, community, and culture, there are important points of\nconnection between rape in war and genocidal rape. Genocide is the\nattempt to destroy a racial, ethnic, religious, or national group as\nsuch, in whole or in part, by committing any of a number of acts\nagainst the group's members; the acts include not only killing, but\nalso causing serious bodily or mental harm, creating conditions of\nlife intended to destroy the group physically, and imposing\nrestrictions intended to prevent births within the group. When such\nacts are committed with genocidal intent, the victim is not only the\nindividual targeted, but the group itself. As Sarah Clark Miller\nobserves, rape is an extraordinarily effective genocidal strategy,\nsince it “corrupts women's roles as caretakers of relationships,\nconveyors of cultural practices, and sustainers of meaning … .\nIn these ways, genocidal rapists twist the way in which women are\npivotal to the life of a community, rendering them pivotal to its\ndestruction” (Miller 2009, 513-514).  \nGenocidal rape has been recognized and condemned by both the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)\n(Askin 2003). In both cases, rape was employed systematically against\nthe women of a certain group, as part of an organized campaign to\ndestroy that group. In Rwanda, the interahamwe raped hundreds\nof thousands of women and girls belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group,\nas part of an effort to exterminate the Tutsi people entirely.\nMacKinnon describes the genocidal rape of Muslim and Croatian women in\nBosnia-Herzegovina as  \nThe Serbian mass rape campaign was distinguished not only by its\nextraordinary brutality and notorious “rape camps,” but\nalso by the systematic forced impregnation of Muslim and Croatian\nwomen and girls. The aim was to claim and colonize the women's bodies\nreproductively as well as sexually, while increasing the population of\nchildren identified as Serb: “Croatian and Muslim women [were]\nbeing raped, and then denied abortions, to help make a Serbian state\nby making what the perpetrators imagine[d] as Serb babies”\n(MacKinnon 2006, 188). Goodhart points out that in such forced\nimpregnation, the soldiers' (and their commanders') hope is to\n“create a baby (a son) who will infiltrate, undermine, or\ndestroy the mother's group” (2007, 309). The resulting children\nare in fact seen by the maternal community as “children of the\nenemy … a sort of nascent fifth column within an already\nvictimized community” (310) and are thus often stigmatized,\nmistreated, or abandoned. Goodhart argues that the rapist-fathers have\nviolated the rights not only of the women they rape, but also of the\nchildren thereby produced. The rapists are guilty of wrongful\nprocreation, a “deliberate, malicious, and sadistic” use\nof procreative power with the intent of creating a child who is\nunlikely to be able to enjoy his or her human rights (317-18).  \nSome have puzzled over how war rape aimed at enforced pregnancy and\nbirth can be genocidal, since it aims to produce rather than prevent\nbirths within the targeted population. In the case of mass rapes in\nBosnia, some Serb perpetrators may have believed they were producing\n“little Chetniks [Serbs].” But Claudia Card points out\nthat such a belief, even if sincerely held, does not provide good\ngrounds for regarding these rapes as genocidal, since “in terms\nof biological parentage, the child will be as much non-Serb as Serb,\nand the child's culture will almost certainly not be Serbian”\n(2008, 184). Thus, she seeks to explain the genocidal nature of rape\naimed at enforced pregnancy without appealing to perpetrators' beliefs\nabout the ethnic identity of any resulting children. A better\nexplanation, in her view, emphasizes that the Serbian campaign of\nforced impregnation “imposed a social death on its victims\n… it turned them into living (and gestating) corpses. …\nWhether the perpetrators thought they were producing little Serbs is\nirrelevant. What counts is the attack on the social meanings of the\nlives of the women they tortured” (185). Card also develops and\nexpands Beverly Allen's proposal (1996) that military rape aimed at\nenforced pregnancy employs sperm as a weapon of biological warfare.\nSuch attacks meet the criteria for biological warfare found in\ninternational documents, she points out, since \nSchott takes a different approach to explaining the genocidal nature\nof military rape aimed at enforced pregnancy, drawing centrally on\nHannah Arendt's concept of natality. War rape aimed at forced\nimpregnation, Schott observes, “[transforms] birth into a weapon\nof death. This is so for women who are raped, who lose a sense of\nbeing at home in their own bodies and of having a future, and it is so\nfor the children born of forced maternity, who may suffer expulsion\nfrom the mother's community” (2011, 14). Thus such rape\nundermines natality, or the capacity for new beginnings, which Arendt\nregarded as fundamental to human political life. Thus, Schott\ncontends, “war rape can be understood not only as a tool for the\nunmaking of the social and cultural world, but also a tool for the\nunmaking of the political world” (2009, 86). \nRape is used as an instrument of genocide because it is extremely\neffective in doing what genocides do: destroying not only individual\ngroup members, but “that aspect of the group whole that is more\nthan the sum of its individual parts … the substance and glue\nof community that lives on when individual members die”\n(MacKinnon 2006, 225). This is especially true when the rapes leave\nchildren motherless, the victims with AIDS, other diseases,\ninfertility, fistulas, and/or other internal injuries, and families\nbroken as victims are abandoned and shunned by their husbands or other\nrelatives. Even absent these additional harms, however, sexual assault\nmay be especially well suited to creating a kind of self-annihilating\nshame in its victims, a shame that can focus on one's group identity.\nMacKinnon points out that  \nSmith underlines this point, and its special applicability to\ngenocidal contexts, observing that “in my experience as a rape\ncrisis counselor, every Native survivor I ever counseled said to me at\none point, ‘I wish I was no longer Indian’” (2005,\n8).  \nIn February 2001, the ICTY found three Serbian soldiers guilty of rape\nas a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are certain\nextraordinarily inhumane acts (including murder, torture, enslavement,\nand deportation) when those acts are systematically committed against\ncivilian populations in the course of armed conflict. The ICTY\njudgment marked international humanitarian law's first official\nrecognition of rape as a crime against humanity. According to\nCampbell, \nThe ICTY verdict thus conveyed a judgment that the Serbian\nperpetrators of mass rape, in addition to violating their individual\nvictims and damaging the cultural and religious groups to which those\nvictims belonged, also insulted and injured humanity as such. Debra\nBergoffen (2012) points out that, in addition, the ICTY verdict\ncreated a new human right to sexual self-determination--a right\ngrounded neither in the agency of an autonomous and inviolable subject\n(implicitly gendered male) nor in an assumed feminine weakness needing\nmale protection, but rather in the dignity of a humanly shared\nvulnerability. \nFeminist theorizing about rape draws on a rich tradition of feminist\nscholarship in many disciplines, as well as on women's insights into\ntheir own rape experiences and on the knowledge gained through decades\nof feminist anti-violence activism. As such theorizing continues to\ndevelop—growing both more radical in its challenges to\npatriarchal social and sexual assumptions, and more global and\n intersectional[2]\n in its analysis—it constitutes an essential support for\nfeminist movements against sexual violence.","contact.mail":"Rebecca.Whisnant@notes.udayton.edu","contact.domain":"notes.udayton.edu"}]
