For a long time it was thought that Henry was\na conservative theologian, engaged in the defence of the Augustinian\ntradition against the risks deriving from the spread of\nAristotelianism and Arabic philosophy — an impression that\nseemed to be confirmed by Henry's participation in the commission set\nup by Bishop Tempier in view of the famous condemnation of March\n1277. However, the progress of the new critical edition of the\nOpera Omnia of Henry — begun in Leuven by Raymond\nMacken nearly thirty years ago and now coordinated by G.A. Wilson,\nsupported by an international team — has already demonstrated\nthat this evaluation needs to be substantially revised. Indeed, Henry\nsought to reconcile traditional Augustinian theories with some of the\nbasic principles of Aristotelian epistemology and Avicennian ontology,\nthereby giving rise to a complex and original synthesis.\n\n\n\nIt is not known exactly when Henry was born; his date of birth is\nusually placed before 1240, perhaps between 1217 and 1223, though\nwithout any concrete evidence. Information about his career is also\nscarce. He was in Paris in 1265; from 1267 he begins to appear in the\ndocuments as magister, as well as canon of Tournai, though\nnothing is known of his presumed teaching activity at the Faculty of\nArts. From 1276, the year in which he disputed his first\nQuodlibet, until his death, Henry was Regent Master at the\nFaculty of Theology. Manuscript copies of his second\nQuodlibet, datable to 1277, indicate that he was archdeacon of\nBrugge (Bruges). From 1279 he was archdeacon of Tournai (Doornik). His name was recorded\nin the death register of Tournai cathedral on 23 June 1293. \n\nDuring his university career in Paris Henry was personally involved in\nalmost all of the most important events in university and\necclesiastical life. In 1277 he was a member of the commission of\ntheologians set up by Bishop Tempier in order to censure propositions\nconsidered erroneous that were being taught at the Faculty of Arts and\nthat would be condemned on 7 March of the same year (Wielockx\n2011). Nevertheless, not only did Henry affirm on several occasions\nthat he neither understood nor approved of the condemnation of certain\narticles, but he himself was pressured by Tempier and the papal legate\nSimone di Brion to distance himself from the theory of the unicity of\nsubstantial form in man (see below, §11). \n\nFrom 1281, the year of the publication of the papal bull Ad\nfructus uberes issued by Pope Martin IV, Henry represented the\nmain theological reference point for the faction of prelates (secular\nclergy) in the clash with the regulars of the Mendicant Orders over the\nquestion of the reiteration of confession; in other words, in the\nprelates’ interpretation, over the obligation for all believers\nto confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already\nconfessed to a friar. Henry would be engaged in this violent\ncontroversy for the rest of his life and it seems that he was even\ntemporarily suspended from teaching for not having heeded the papal\nlegates’ warning not to hold disputes on the interpretation of\nprivileges granted by the pope. \n\nThe last great secular master in Paris in the second half of the\n13th century (together with Godfrey of Fontaines), Henry is\nauthor of a monumental, though incomplete, Summa (the part\nDe creaturis is missing altogether, even though it was part\nof the work's overall plan), 15 Quodlibeta, disputed and\npublished while writing the Summa (Gómez Caffarena\n1957) a short commentary on the Book of Genesis (Lectura\nordinaria super sacram Scripturam), a lengthy treatise on the\nquestion of the privileges of Confession (Tractatus super factum\npraelatorum et fratrum), as well as sermons (on Hernry's written\nlegacy see Wilson 2011b). However, his not strictly theological\nproduction is of uncertain attribution: probably authentic are a\ntreatise on the Syncategoremata (ms.  Brugge, Stadsbibl.,\n510, ff. 227ra-237va) and a commentary in question form on\nthe Physics (ms. Erfurt, Amplon. F. 349), while there is more\ndoubt concerning an incomplete commentary, again in question form, on\nthe Metaphysics (ms. Escorial, h.II.1; different arguments\nare presented in Porro 2002a and Pickavé 2007). \n\nRather unusual in scholastic production, the Summa by Henry\ndoes not open with a direct treatment of God, but with a lengthy\nanalysis of the problem of human knowledge, beginning with the\nsceptic's question par excellence: can man know anything\nat all (art. 1, q. 1)? Henry refuses to pursue in depth\nAugustine's radical theory in q. 9 of De diversis\nquaestionibus 83 that we should not expect sincera\nveritas from the senses. As generally agreed after the rediscovery\nof Aristotle's works by the Latin West, since all knowledge\noriginates in the senses, denying any value whatsoever to sensation\nwould mean denying all possibility of knowledge in general. Taking\nknowledge (scire: to know) in its most generic sense, for\nHenry it is undeniable that man knows something; Augustine's\nreservations should be taken to refer to those who claim that judgment\nis co-extensive with sensation. If we distinguish sensorial\napprehension from the intellect's judgment of it, then it is\nperfectly legitimate to expect truth (or a certain kind of truth) from\nthe senses. \n\nThe next question of the same article (q. 2) poses the same initial\nproblem in a more round-about way: can man know anything without divine\nintervention? Along traditional Augustinian lines, the reply should be\nnegative, since all true knowledge can only come from divine\nillumination. But a unilateral solution of this type represents for\nHenry a serious attack on the dignity of the rational soul. The\nessential operation of the soul is constituted by knowledge; therefore\nif knowledge were not already included, at least partially, in its\nnatural possibilities, the soul would paradoxically find itself\nconstituted for an aim that it could never achieve. Moreover, since the\nsenses provide true material, the intellect is certainly able to search\nfor truth: “absolute ergo concedere oportet quod homo per suam\nanimam absque omni speciali divina illustratione potest aliqua\ncognoscere, et hoc ex puris naturalibus.” (“One must\ntherefore concede, in an absolute sense, that through his soul man can\nknow something without any special divine illumination, on the basis of\nwhat is purely natural”; Summa, art. 1, q. 2, ed.\nWilson, p. 35, ll. 118-120). \n\nHowever, the above concerns knowledge in general, scire in\nthe broadest sense. Moving on to knowledge in the strict sense,\nproprie scire or certitudinaliter scire, things get\nmore complicated. As in Augustine's Soliloquia, it is\nimportant to distinguish between what is true and truth itself.\nSensation only grasps id quod verum est (“what is\ntrue,” and something is true in that it is a being on the basis\nof the simple conversion of transcendentals). Knowledge of the truth\nimplies something more; it implies the knowledge of the nature —\nthe essence — of a thing, a knowledge that can only be obtained\nby comparing the res to its exemplar (“intentio\nenim veritatis in re apprehendi non potest nisi apprehendendo\nconformitatem eius ad suum exemplar” — “the intention\nof truth in a thing cannot be apprehended without apprehending its\nconformity to its exemplar”). \n\nHere it is important to distinguish further, since the\nexemplar is a double one. In the first place, the\nexemplar is the universal species of the object that\nthe mind obtains by abstraction, on the basis of sensible data. In this\ncase, the truth of the res is the conformity between the\nreally existing thing and its mental representation; this conformity\ncan only be grasped by the dividing and composing intellect, in the\nclassic Aristotelian and Thomist formula, and not by the simplex\nintelligentia. In the second place, the exemplar is the\nideal form present in the divine mind that acts as the formal cause of\ncreatural essences, and from this perspective the veritas of\nthe res is its ontological conformity (Anselm's\nrectitudo) to its eternal model. This double relation\n(res-mens, res-exemplar aeternum) thereby produces a\ndouble truth, or two different levels of truth: on the one hand, the\nveritas of Aristotelian science, deriving from the purely\nnatural faculties, through an abstracting process, and on the other,\nthe sincera veritas, obtained only through divine illumination\n— in other words, by an act of God, not as obiectum\ncognitum (known object) but as ratio cognoscendi (cause\nor reason of knowledge). \n\nThe first truth does not have the same infallibility, purity and\nabsolute certainty as the second; nevertheless, it is still a form of\nveritas, no matter how “imperfecta, obscura et\nnebulosa” (“imperfect, obscure and uncertain”).\nIndeed, it is a form that is absolutely necessary for the fulfilment of\nthe second: the action of the divine exemplar can only work on\na concept already obtained by the intellect through abstraction. For\nHenry, divine illumination does not directly provide the mind with any\ncontent, but rather certifies definitively (with the typical\nAugustinian image of the seal) the representation of a thing present in\nthe human intellect, as coinciding with the representation existing\nab aeterno in the divine intellect. \n\nIn this way, Henry creates a unique blend of Aristotle's\ntheory of abstraction and Augustine's doctrine of divine\nillumination. Truth is the result of the comparison between two\nexemplars: the Aristotelian universal obtained by abstraction from\nsensible data, and the archetype present in the divine mind, which is\nnot only the cause of the existence of things, but also their epistemic\nguarantee, so to speak. The action of divine illumination is therefore\nneither a direct donation of intelligible contents, independent of the\nconditions of sensible knowledge, nor is it a simple purification,\npreparation or refinement of the mind in order to predispose it to\nintellectual knowledge. Rather, it is the certification of our created\nexemplar by the uncreated one; in other words, by divine art\n(ars). \n\nOver the years, however, Henry seems gradually to abandon this\ntheory of the double exemplar in order to make room, on the\none hand, for a reworking of the defining process of essences through\ntheir progressive determination, as described by Aristotle in the\nPosterior Analytics (Marrone 1985, 2001 and 2011), and on the other,\nfor a reinterpretation of illumination as the constant presence in act,\nalbeit in a recess of the mind (abditum mentis), of the image\nof God (Quodl. IX, q. 15). Concerning the first aspect, it is\nworth noting that in the Summa articles dedicated to the\nknowableness of God, an exact epistemological process is described,\naccording to the scheme of the Posterior Analytics, that\nbegins with the pure acquisition of the name of a thing, proceeds to\nthe ascertainment of its essential being (the fact that a given thing\nis possible and not a mere figment), and arrives at knowledge of a\nres in itself through its definition and the successive\ndetermination of its other essential features and properties by means\nof an operation of the composing and dividing intellect. Concerning the\nsecond aspect, this theme would find an indirect echo in the doctrine\nof the ground of the soul elaborated by Dietrich of Freiberg and\nMeister Eckhart. This presence, to which the mind is constantly\ndirected without any mediation, albeit through an operation of which we\nare almost always unaware (intelligere abditum), is for Henry\nwhat directs the mind itself to all authentic knowledge (Emery\n2001). \n\nIn this evolution, particularly important is the partial rejection\nof the function of intelligible species (for example, in\nQuodl. III, q. 1 and Quodl. IV, q. 7), which\nanticipates the similar Nominalist solution by a couple of decades at\nleast. More precisely, for Henry, the phantasm itself is made\nimmaterial by the abstraction of the agent intellect and imprints\nitself on the possible intellect, without the mediation of the\nintelligible species. In other words, on the basis of the principle of\neconomy, there is no need to have an intelligible species that is\nnumerically distinct from the phantasm itself, as in Aquinas’\nstandard doctrine. The particular phantasm is made a universal\nphantasm by means of abstraction, and just as the universal cannot\nreally be distinguished from particular things, so the universal\nphantasm cannot really be distinguished from the particular. The\nphantasm is therefore the efficient cause of intellectual knowledge, or\nbetter, of the first operation of the intellect (that of simple\nunderstanding). \n\nHenry does not eliminate sensible species, however, nor does he\neliminate all types of representation in the sphere of intellectual\nactivity. Indeed, after the phantasms are impressed on the possible or\npotential intellect, making simple understanding possible, the\nintellect then forms complex judgments and produces its own species, or\nverbum (mental word), as a result of this activity. Even when\nHenry expounds the theory of the double exemplar, he always\nmaintains that the divine exemplar acts on the verbum\nalready formed by the intellect at the first level of knowledge,\nrefining and transforming it into a second, more perfect,\nverbum that can represent the truth at the level of\nsincera veritas (Goehring 2011). This clearly differentiates Henry from\nanti-representationalists like Olivi and Ockham in his later phase,\neven though Henry remains one of the first\nauthoritative masters to eliminate the mediation of intelligible\nspecies explicitly on the basis of the principle of economy (as is made\nfurther evident by the reactions of his contemporaries and the masters\nof the next generation). \n\nFor Henry (as for Avicenna) every res possesses its own\n“certitude” (certitudo) that makes it what it is.\nCertitudo here means stability, consistency, and ontological\nself-identity: a triangle is a triangle and nothing else, white is\nwhite and nothing else. Certitudo thus expresses the objective\ncontent by which every thing is identical to itself and is\ndistinguished from other things; in other words, certitudo\nexpresses the essence or quidditas of a thing\n(“unaquaeque res habet certitudinem propriam quae est eius\nquidditas” — “every thing possesses its own\ncertitude, which is its essence”). This content can be considered\nin itself, as independent from its physical or mental existence. In an\nabsolute sense, every essence possesses a double indifference: with\nregard to actual existence or non-existence (essence in itself is\nsimply possible), and with regard to universality and particularity.\nThese last two aspects are really conjoined. Essence is particular in\nthat it receives its subsistence in a given suppositum\n(concrete individual entity) from something-other-than-itself, while it\nis universal in that it is abstracted by the intellect from these\nsingular supposita, in which it exists as one in many, in\norder to become predicable by many. \n\nYet in itself essence is just essence: “essentia est essentia\ntantum”. Even though for both Avicenna and Henry thing\n(res) and being (ens) are primary notions (or rather\nintentions — intentiones — the sense of which we\nshall soon clarify), intentio de re seems to have a certain\nprecedence over intentio de esse, at least logically, in\nvirtue of its double indifference. Nevertheless, the latter is\nconcomitant with the former, since every res only exists in\nphysical reality or in the mind. Possessing an absolute concept\ndoesn’t mean possessing an absolute, separate existence. More\nsimply, through such a concept, a thing can be considered, leaving\naside all that does not form part of its essential content and that\ntherefore constitutes an additional determination. For instance,\nphysical or mental existence, particularity or universality, do not\nform part of “horseness” as such. Yet for this very reason\n“horseness” as such does not exist; instead what exists are\nhorses as individual supposita and the universal concept of\n“horse”, which the mind obtains by abstraction from them.\nThat which possesses an absolute concept can exist in act only through\none of its additional dispositions, with respect to which it is\nnevertheless indifferent (Porro 1996, 2002b). \n\nIndifference only concerns the way in which a thing can be\nconsidered. In reality, no essence is indifferent to the point of being\nequally disposed toward being and non-being. The effective indifference\nof essences must therefore be taken in a narrower sense (than in\nAvicenna too): every creatural essence tends naturally toward non-being\n(in Avicennian terms, no possible essence, in the absence of a cause\nfor its existence, could exist), though this inclination can be\nreversed by an external cause. No essence of a thing is so rigidly\noriented toward nothing that it cannot receive being-in-act through a\ndivine action. Similarly, even when placed, in act no thing ever\npossesses its being in an ultimate way: if God were to withdraw His\nsupport, it would fall into non-being. Indifference as absolute\nneutrality is therefore only the result of an intentional analysis. In\nreality, every thing is always either in non-being or in being, and not\nin the same way, since the first of these conditions is co-extensive\nwith the thing itself, the second depends on God. \n\nWe still need to clarify in what sense existence can be said to be\nconcomitant with essence. Being has access to essence from the outside,\nin the sense that it does not strictly belong to the essential nature\nof a res, except in the case of God. If this were not the\ncase, a thing (every thing) would not simply be possible in\nitself, but necesse esse (necessary being) on a par with God.\nInstead, being seems to be an accident, or rather it has almost the\nmode of an accident (Quodl. I, q. 9). Nevertheless, it is not\nan accident in the real sense, since it is not added to something\npre-existing, but is rather that by virtue of which a thing\nexists. In other words, we cannot refer here to the Aristotelian\ndefinition of accident (that which has its being in another thing or\ninheres in a subject), but once again to the broader definition given\nby Avicenna, according to which anything that belongs to a thing, being\nexternal to the intention of its essence, can be called an accident\n(“Sed intelligendum quod ‘accidens’ accipitur hic\nlargissime, secundum quod iuxta modum loquendi Avicennae\n‘accidens’ rei appellatur omne quod convenit ei et est\nextra intentionem suae essentiae”; Quodl. II, q. 8, ed.\nWielockx, p. 48, ll. 21-23). In this sense an accident is anything that\nis external to the intentio of a res as absolute\nessence, without ever being really distinct from it. With regard to\nessence, actual being (that is, ratio suppositi) represents an\naccident of this type. Being is therefore an intentio that\noccurs to essence without adding anything real, and so it differs from\nessence only intentionally. \n\nThe term intentio must not be taken in the narrow sense\nwith which, for example, one speaks of intentiones secundae as\nnomina nominum (individual, genus, species, difference,\nproperty, accident, etc.), but rather as a ‘note’ (feature,\ntrait) of the essential content of a res, which does not\ndiffer from it in any real sense, nor from its other identifiable\n‘notes’, yet can nevertheless be expressed by an\nindependent concept (“appellatur hic intentio aliquid pertinens\nrealiter ad simplicitatem essentiae alicuius, natum praecise concipi\nabsque aliquo alio a quo non differt re absoluta, quod similiter\npertinet ad eandem.”; Quodl. V, q. 6, ed. 1518, f.\n161rL). Intentio is thus the fruit of an operation of the\nintellect, which delves inside (for Henry intentio comes from\nintus tentio) the thing to which the intention itself belongs,\nby considering its constitutive ‘notes’ and giving rise to\ndifferent concepts. It can also be said that intentions really exist in\na res, but only potentially, whereas their distinction is an\noperation of the intellect alone. \n\nWhile two distinct things differ in a real sense, all that gives\nrise to different concepts, albeit founded in the same simple thing,\ndiffers intentionally (“diversa intentione sunt quae fundata in\nsimplicitate eisudem rei diversos de se formant conceptus.”;\nQuodl. V, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rT). In an intentional\ndistinction, in other words, the very same thing is expressed by\ndifferent concepts in different ways. From this perspective, an\nintentional distinction seems akin to a purely logical (or reasoned)\ndistinction, to the point that the two are often confused\n(“frequenter intentio ratio appellatur.”; Quodl.\nV, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rV). Nevertheless, in the first case, one of\nthe concepts excludes the other (one can be thought of separately, in\nthe absence of the other), whereas in the case of a distinction based\non reason the various concepts are perfectly compatible (“in\ndiversis secundum intentionem unus conceptus secundum unum modum\nexcludit alium secundum alium modum, non sic autem differentia sola\nratione.”; Quodl. V, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rV). As\nHenry explicitly states, this means that everything that differs in\nintention differs in reason too, but not vice versa. Unlike a purely\nlogical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a form\nof composition, even though this is minor with regard to that implied\nby a real difference. \n\nThe clearest examples of this are found in Quodl. X, q. 7,\nwhere Henry responds rather sharply to the perplexities raised by Giles\nof Rome over the concept itself of intentional distinction.\n“Man” and “rational animal” — the defined\nand the definition — differ only in terms of reason, whereas\n“white” and “rational” differ in a real sense,\nsince it is a matter of different natures and not of concepts or\nintentions founded in the same res. Yet how should we consider\nthe difference between “rational” and “animal”?\nThis is not a distinction of reason, since the two terms are not in a\nrelation of definition to defined, nor is it a real distinction, such\nas that between substance and accident, since, if this were the case,\nthe species formed by the conjunction of “animal” and\n“rational” would not be a single one in itself, but only\nper accidens. Therefore we can only appeal to an intermediate\ndistinction, which is precisely that which Henry defines as\nintentional. \n\nFor Henry there are two levels of intentional distinction: a major\nand a minor. In the major none of the intentions includes the other or\nothers, even though they are all part of the same thing, and it has two\nmodes: the distinction between the differences in man (rational,\nsensible, vegetative and so on) and the distinction between genus and\nspecific difference (animal and rational). In the minor the concept of\none intention includes the other but not vice versa. And here Henry\nlists four modes: the distinction between species and genus; the\ndistinction between living and being in creatures; the distinction\nbetween a suppositum and its nature or essence; and the\ndistinction between a respectus (relation) and the essence on\nwhich it is founded (Macken 1981). The distinction between being and\nessence belongs to the last mode. Since being is not a real accident\ninhering in a subject, it makes no sense to speak of a real\ndistinction. Instead, the distinction depends on the fact that the\nintellect uses different concepts to indicate the being of a thing, on\nthe one hand, and that which a thing is, on the other. Nevertheless,\nsince essence can be thought of independently from its being, and being\nis not part of its content, we cannot refer here to a distinction based\non reason alone. In other words, whereas the concept of actual\nexistence always includes the concept of essence, the contrary is not\ntrue, since essence can be thought of without its being (as affirmed by\nAvicenna). Being and essence are therefore different intentions, not\ndifferent things (as instead was maintained by Giles of Rome in his\nlong dispute with Henry). This intentional distinction is in itself\nsufficient to refute the conclusion that every essence is its\nbeing. \n\nHow does this conclusion accord with Avicenna's theory that\nintentio de re precedes intentio de esse? Essence\nexists in the measure in which it participates in divine being. There\nare nevertheless two possible interpretations of the concept of\nparticipation. In the first, essence is a kind of potential substratum\nthat is filled by existence at the moment of its actualization. In this\nsense, essence would be in potency to being as matter is to form.\nHowever, as Henry often stresses in his debate with Giles, this is a\n“far-fetched image” (phantastica imaginatio),\nsince likening physical generation to creation seriously compromises\nthe idea of creation from nothing. In generation, form is not educed\nfrom nothing, but from pre-existing matter. Similarly, if essence were\na potential substratum, being would not be created from nothing, but\nfrom essence itself. The second interpretation makes essence the object\n(that is, the term or result), not the subject of creation: essence is\nconstituted as such in virtue of its relation of participation with the\nCreator. \n\nHenry here adduces one of the most characteristic and original\naspects of his metaphysical system: the distinction between\npotentia subiective and potentia obiective (Hödl\n1963, Porro 1996). Something can be in potency with regard to a given\nact, either as the subject (subiectum) from which something\nelse can or must be produced (as in the case of matter with regard to\nform), or as the object (obiectum) that constitutes the result\nitself of production (as in the case of generation, the form, or more\nprecisely, the combination of matter and form). In the first case, the\nagent intervenes, impressing itself, or something else (as form), on\nthe already available potential substratum. In the second case, there\nis no effective potency with regard to the acquisition of another form,\nbut only with regard to the agent. Hence, essence is placed in act\nthrough creation, not because a form educed from its potency is\nimpressed on it, but because it constitutes the result itself of the\nagent's action. Essence is not in potency in relation to being,\nbut in relation to itself, as a totality constituted in being. \n\nNevertheless, this theory raises a problem. In every transmutation,\nwhat changes cannot strictly coincide with the terms themselves of the\nchange. If essence is possibile esse and non esse,\nand passes from non-being to being through creation, it must be\ndifferent both from non-being (the state before creation) as well as\nfrom being (the state after creation). If, on the other hand, essence\nwere identical to one of the two terms (being, in the case in\nquestion), then there would be no change, since essence would never be\nin non-being. To obviate this problem, Henry seeks to refine further,\nespecially in his later Quodlibeta, the distinction between\npossibile subiective and possibile obiective, so\nthat, within certain limits (that is, from a logical rather than from\nan ontological perspective), essence can figure as the\nsubiectum, and not just the terminus, of creation. Even\nthough the passage of essence from non-being to being happens in a\nsingle, indivisible instant, it can nevertheless be subdivided\nlogically (secundum rationem) into three different\n“signs” (signa); an ante litteram example\nof the theoretical model defined by Kretzmann and Spade as\n“Quasi-Aristotelianism”, especially in reference to\n14th century writers such as Landolph Caracciolo and John of\nBaconthorpe (Kretzmann 1982, Spade 1982). In the first signum,\nessence loses its non-being; in the second, essence occupies an\nintermediate position between the non-being it is abandoning and the\nbeing it is acquiring, and in this sense it is the subiectum\nof the transmutation; finally, in the third, essence has acquired its\nbeing, and as such it is the terminus of the change\n(Summa, art. 59, q. 2, ed. 1520, f. 138vR). \n\nThe above concerns the acquisition of existence, or actual being.\nYet independently of existence, and preceding it, essence is already\nconstituted as such in its specific being: the esse proprium\nthat Avicenna attributes to a res in virtue of its\ncertitudo. It is well-known that Henry refers to this being as\nesse essentiae. Despite the ultra-essentialist interpretation\nof Henry's metaphysics that began with Suárez, the\nsyntagma esse essentiae does not designate a separate being,\nbut only the fact that a res thus constituted has an objective\ncontent and so is objectively possible; that is, it can be placed in\nact by God. Indeed, not every res conceivable by the human\nintellect corresponds to a nature that can be actualized. The being of\nessence thus coincides with the possibility, or the ability, to receive\nactual existence that a purely imagined res does not have. In\nother words, esse essentiae is what separates a mere figment\nfrom a res proper, an essence, or to use Avicenna's\nterminology, a “nature”. \n\nHenry here introduces his well-known distinction between res a\nreor reris and res a ratitudine (cf. above all\nSumma, art. 21, q. 4; art. 24, q. 3; Porro 2011). In the first case, a\nthing is considered in its purely nominal conception, to which a\nreality, outside a purely mental one, need not correspond\n(reor is here synonymous with opinor — to\nimagine, to suppose). As such, a res a reor reris is in itself\nindifferent to both being (essentiae and existentiae)\nand non-being: to cite the most common example, a res a reor\nreris can be a mythical animal such as a hircocervus or\ntragelaphus (goat-stag). In the second case, a thing is\n“certified” (rata) by the fact that it possesses\nat least the being of an essence. If the nothing that stands in\nopposition to a res a reor reris cannot even be conceived, the\nnothing that stands in opposition to a res a ratitudine is not\nthe lack of actual being, hence non-existence in the physical world,\nbut rather the lack of formal constitution: the fact that a thing can\nbe conceived (for example, a chimera or a mountain of gold) without in\nreality being “certified” as a determined essence. But\nwhence does the being of an essence come? Every essence is what it is\nin reason of its nature (“Est autem id quod est essentia in\nunaquaque re communiter loquendo id quod ei convenit ratione naturae\nsuae secundum se.”; Quodl. X, q. 8, ed. Macken, p. 201,\nll. 85-87). A stone is a stone because of its own nature, and the same\nis true for a triangle. Formally, every essence is therefore what it\nis, in and of itself, albeit through participation\n(participative), since the very fact of being an essence,\ncontent aside, is dependent on God. \n\nEssence is therefore not strictly an “effect” or\n“product” of God, and yet it is constituted only through a\nrelation of participation in, or imitation of, the divine essence. More\nprecisely, esse essentiae belongs to essence because of its\neternal relation with God as formal cause. It is only in virtue of this\nrelation that essences can also come into actual existence, which\nsignals a new relation between a creature and God, the latter now as\nefficient cause. In the first case, essences depend on the divine\nintellect, in the second, on the divine will. Being therefore always\nindicates a relation in creatures, which is simple for essences in\nthemselves (esse essentiae), and twofold for actualized\nessences (esse essentiae plus esse existentiae).\nNevertheless the two types of relation are not perfectly symmetrical.\nIn the first place, while essence can be conceived independently of its\nexistence in the physical world, it cannot be conceived independently\nof its being-essence, otherwise it would be a mere figment.\nConsequently, the relation that forges esse existentiae is in\nsome way accidental, whereas that which forges esse essentiae\nis essential. In the second place, since God chooses, from all the\nessences eternally constituted as such by His intellect, those that He\nwill actualize over time, on the basis of His free will, one\nrespectus is such from eternity, while the other takes place\nin time. \n\nSince that which essence is depends on essence itself, while the\nfact of being an essence derives from a formal dependence\n(similitudo) on God, it follows that within essence itself\nthere is a composition prior to the one so far described between\nessence and existence. Even in essence, in other words, we can\ndistinguish between an id quod est and a quo est, in\nthe classic Boethian formulation. Quo est is obviously\nesse essentiae. It is not so easy, however, to identify id\nquod est. It is certainly not essence itself, since essence is the\nresult of the composition, not one of its component parts. Yet neither\nis it strictly speaking a res a reor reris, even though Henry\nhimself had entertained this possibility on one occasion at least\n(Summa, art. 28, q. 4). In the denomination res a reor\nreris are included all those essences effectively constituted as\nsuch and also figments devoid of any objective content. Consequently,\nres ratae are more a subcategory of res a reor reris,\nrather than the possible result of the composition between the latter\nand esse essentiae. The distinction between res a reor\nreris and res a ratitudine seems to have mainly an\nepistemological utility: it corresponds to the scientific progression\n(mentioned above, §2) from a purely nominal knowledge of a thing\n(res a reor reris as pure quid nominis) to the\nrecognition of its essential reality (the verification of esse\nessentiae, quaestio si est de incomplexo), and finally to\nthe determination of its objective content (quid rei, res a\nratitudine), according to Henry's essentialist\nreinterpretation of the scheme of the Posterior Analytics in\nhis Summa (art. 24, q. 3). \n\nBut what is this objective content? The most explicit answer is to\nbe found again in q. 7 of Quodl. X: “esse essentiae non\nproprie dicitur addi essentiae, quia non est essentia proprie nisi illo\nesse, sed potius dicitur addi aliquo quod est de propria ratione\ngeneris sui, quod cum ratione esse constituit essentiam compositam ex\nquod est et esse, quod est ipsum quo est” (“essential being\nis not said properly to be added to essence, since essence is none\nother than that being; rather it is said to be added to something\nbelonging to the ratio of its genus, and this, together with\nthe ratio of being, constitutes the essence composed of\nquod est and being, which is in itself the quo\nest,”; Quodl. X, q. 7, ed. Macken, p. 152, ll.\n59-63). To return to the earlier example, we must now say that the\nessence of a stone is constituted by its being an essence (esse\nessentiae) and by its being a stone (that which belongs to the\nnature itself of a thing in that the thing belongs to a given genus:\n“aliquod quod est de propria ratione generis sui”). Henry\nlikewise distinguishes between ratio praedicamenti and res\npraedicamenti (Quodl. V, q. 2). Ratio\npraedicamenti is being; it is the reason why every essence\ngenerally falls within the predicamental sphere. Res\npraedicamenti is instead the realitas of every essence;\nit is what makes essence belong to a given predicament. Without\nesse essentiae a thing (res) could never belong to\nthe categories, nor could it ever be the object of meaningful\nscientific statements; yet it is that which is proper to each essence\nthat places it within a given predicament. \n\nEsse essentiae is before every genus and outside every\ngenus: only in that it is composed does it belong to a given genus.\nFrom this perspective, it is not being that is added to what is proper\nto every thing, but the opposite: what determines being supervenes on\nthe latter. Consequently, it is not so much the objective content of an\nessence that is in potency to being, but rather it is being that is in\npotency to its subsequent objective determinations (Gómez\nCaffarena 1958; Porro 1996). This is Henry's theory in the later\nQuodlibeta, in concordance with the theory in De\ncausis according to which the first of created things is being (Porro 2014).\nThe being created first by God is clearly not esse\nexistentiae, but esse essentiae, called esse\nlatissimum, esse communissimum, and esse largissimo\nmodo acceptum in q. 3 of Quodl. XI. All that follows\n— that is, the determination of essence with regard to its\nobjective content or to its actualization in the physical or mental\nworld — is none other than a delimitation, or specification, of\nthat being. The radical conclusion of Henry's theory is that the\nonly real term of creation is esse latissimum; all the rest is\nnot created from nothing, but is constituted through an in-formation\nprocess of that essential being in a strict hierarchical order. Hence,\nesse essentiae is created first; next comes, through\ninformation, esse aliquid per essentiam; finally, the whole\nessence thus composed is placed in act. Esse existentiae is\nthe actualization of esse essentiae, just as esse aliquid\nper existentiam is the actualization of esse aliquid per\nessentiam, though this is not a matter of things, elements or\ndifferent parts, but only of different intentions. \n\nFor Henry even the distinction between esse essentiae and\nthe realitas of an essence is of an intentional type. Such a\ndistinction seems to differ from the distinction between essence and\nesse existentiae: one of the most salient features of the\nintentional distinction is that one of the intentions thus\ndistinguished can be conceived even when the other is removed or\nnegated. Essence can be considered in itself, without actuality, and\nyet it seems more difficult to conceive of it without its own being,\nsince, from a formal perspective, essence is always its being, and the\nrelation of participation in divine essence that constitutes every\nessence is eternal and indestructible. Therefore Henry was initially\ntempted to make a distinction based on reason alone between essence and\nits essential being; as, for example, in the solution adopted in\nQuodl. I, q. 9. Only later would he abandon this choice to\nadopt an intentional distinction for this case too. A spectacular\nexample of this change of position is the recasting of q. 4, art. 21 in\nthe Summa. In the final version, Henry rejects what he had\npreviously maintained: that essence is really its being in a strict\nsense. This inversion is probably due to the need to conserve the\ndistance between the absolute simplicity of the divine essence and the\nsimplicity of created essences, as well as to his new understanding of\nthe priority of essential being, as the first created thing, with\nregard to all subsequent determinations, beginning with the\ndetermination of the content of essences themselves. \n\nYet how are essences constituted in their being? As mentioned above,\nessences depend on the divine intellect, which is their exemplary\ncause. More precisely, essences correspond to divine ideas, which\nrepresent their eternal exemplars. This might seem to be the habitual\nscheme of Christian Platonism, though scholars (especially de Rijk\n1991) have pointed out that, beginning with Henry, the term\n“idea” loses its traditional meaning of “subsisting\nform” and moves closer to its meaning in Descartes and Locke of\n“instrument” or “term” of knowledge. According\nto Henry an idea is in God for the fact that divine essence is in some\nways imitable by creatural essences. God's knowledge of what is\ndifferent from Himself coincides with the knowledge of the different\nways in which He considers Himself imitable, since divine knowledge is\nnot determined by the presence of external objects, but rather is\nitself the formal (exemplary) cause of its own contents. Here, however,\nthe classic question of the relation between divine simplicity and\ncreatural multiplicity again arises. Were God to know immediately the\nplurality of creatable objects (essences), His simplicity and unity\n(divine knowledge is not really distinct from divine essence) would be\nirremediably compromised. \n\nOn the other hand, if God did not have access to the multiplicity of\nall that is distinct from His essence, He would not know anything. So,\naccording to Henry, divine knowledge has a primary object, which is\ndivine essence itself, absolutely simple and indivisible, and a\nsecondary object, which is in some way “other” than divine\nknowledge. To avoid any excessively brusque passage, the knowledge of\nthis secondary object is then subdivided into two distinct moments: in\nthe first, every creatural essence is coincident with divine essence\nitself, and expresses a simple respectus imitabilitatis with\nit; in the second, every such essence is taken as distinct, endowed\nwith a specific modus of being — esse essentiae\n— which nevertheless always derives from a relation of formal\nparticipation in the divine essence. In Henry's lexicon, these\ntwo moments indicate respectively the exemplar, which is the\ndivine idea, and the exemplatum (also called\nideatum), which is an essence fully constituted in its\nquidditative content and so able to be placed in act. \n\nExemplata, or essences, are thus secondary objects of\ndivine knowledge, indeed they are doubly so, and as such they seem to\nhave a purely mental being. In other words, they are diminished beings\n(entia diminuta), just like the contents of our mind. But the\ndivine intellect obviously does not have the same characteristics as\nours, since in order to know something our intellect needs to be\ninformed (per speciem) by its contents, and so is passive in a\nsense, whereas the divine intellect is itself the cause of its own\ncontents. Hence the level of existence that contents have in the divine\nintellect is not in any way comparable to that which they have in our\nintellect. Essences are therefore entia diminuta, though not\nso diminished that they cannot be something in themselves\n(Quodl. IX, q. 2). Their being is their quidditative\nconstitution, which also defines the effective possibility of access to\nactual existence: all essences, as thought of and therefore\n“ratified” by God, are possible in themselves; that is,\nthey can be placed in act on the basis of divine free will. \n\nOne might ask whether God possesses this same freedom in bestowing\nesse essentiae on possible essences, that is, on (doubly)\nsecondary objects of His knowledge. Unlike what happens for the being\nof existence, the reply would seem to be negative in this case. As\nmentioned above, there is an asymmetry between the relation of\nefficient causality and the relation of formal dependence that conjoin\ncreatures and Creator: while the former is in time, the latter is\neternal. This means that the distinction between what is possible and\nwhat is not possible is necessarily such from eternity. Moreover, since\nessences can never cease to be in their essential being (that is, in\ntheir being eternally thought by God), they are absolutely necessary.\nAs such, not only can they not be destroyed, but they cannot even be\nmodified. In actual existence, all essences are equally indifferent\nwith regard to the Creator's power, so that God can place in act\none res before another as He chooses, without any mediation,\nwhereas in their own being essences are arranged in a hierarchical\norder that God himself, on whom that order depends, cannot modify. \n\nIn order to grasp this difference, we need only consider the first\ntwo questions of Quodlibet VIII, in which Henry distinguishes\nbetween the purely speculative knowledge that God has of essences and\nHis practical consideration of their possible actualization. Obviously,\nthere is no real difference between these two forms of knowledge, since\nin God practical ideas exist only as “extensions” of\nspeculative ideas. In other words, the very same rationes\nideales that God constitutes in Himself, by considering Himself\nvariously imitable by creatures, can be considered in scientia\npratica as the possible effects of His actions (“quaedam\noperabilia”). The difference between these two forms of knowledge\ndoes not lie in the diversity of the object, but rather in the\ndiversity of the aim; that is, in the fact that God can consider a\nthing as the result of a possible operation of His will. In this sense,\nGod knows what will effectively be placed in act, not by considering an\nessence in itself (every essence is indeed indifferent to actual\nexistence), but by considering the determination of His will in this\nregard. \n\nGod's will is as immutable and eternal as His knowledge; yet\nit is not constrained by the essential relation that binds ideas\ntogether. God has always known the individual entities that he will\nactualize in the various species, as well as those that he will not,\nyet His decision in this regard is absolutely free and does not\ncorrespond to any essential order. The concrete,\n“practical” actualization of individual entities is not the\nsame as the formal, ontological possibility of essences. God constructs\nthe essential framework of the world through ideas and speculative\nknowledge, while it is through their practical extension that He freely\nbrings into being some of the creatures eternally constituted as\npossible. Yet there is no correspondence, strictly speaking, between\none order and another. \n\nTo illustrate this divergence Henry uses a particularly striking\nimage: possible existences are arranged in a circle around God, so that\nthey are all equidistant, while essences are arranged in a straight\nline, beginning with the noblest creature (the highest angel) and\nending with the lowest form of being (prime matter). Creatural essences\nare thus arranged as a hierarchical and essentially ordered whole; and\nthis is not a mere tautology, since “essentially ordered”\nrefers to those causal series in which the simultaneous presence of all\nterms is required for the production of an effect and in which,\nconsequently, a missing link in the chain is enough to invalidate any\nefficacy with regard to the effects. This means that while the second\nterm depends directly and exclusively on the first, the third depends\non the first and the second, the forth on the first three, and so on. A\nseries of this type is clearly neither open nor infinite, since if it\nwere there would no longer be an ordered relation between the\nterms. \n\nConcerning the case in question, this fact has at least two\nconsequences. In the first place, according to Henry, God cannot now\nintroduce ex novo a new essence in any part of the series\nwithout irremediably destroying the world order. Even if it were\npossible to add something at the beginning or at the end of the series\n— above the highest angel or below prime matter — then\nother infinite terms would be possible, too, and infinity in itself\ndestroys any ordered relation. From this perspective it is easy to\nunderstand Henry's reservation over the possibility of\ndistinguishing between potentia ordinata and potentia\nabsoluta in God, a distinction which he is more willing to accept\nin relation to papal authority (see below, §11). God can do\nnothing de potentia absoluta that He cannot also do de\npotentia ordinata, since He himself is bound by the order that He\nhas eternally established. Supernatural intervention is thus delegated\nonly to the potentia oboedentialis of creatures, though it is\nnever outside the established order and merely indicates the\ndifference, within this order, between what is possible for natural\nagents and what is possible for a supernatural agent. \n\nIn the second place, since there is a perfect correspondence between\ncreatural essences and divine ideas, the latter are numerically finite,\nlike the former (Porro 1993). This theory, which is highly unusual to\nsay the least, is explicitly put forward by Henry on at least two\noccasions in his Quodlibeta (Quodl. V, q. 3 and\nQuodl. VIII, q. 8), before being partially retracted, albeit\nreluctantly, in virtue of an unspecified article condemned in Paris\n(Quodl. XI, q. 11). \n\nIn describing the role of divine illumination in the cognitive\nprocess of the human intellect (see above, §2), Henry is always\ncareful to specify that God functions only as ratio\ncognoscendi and not as obiectum cognitum. From another\nperspective, however, God is also the first known object of the human\nintellect, according to one of Henry's most famous and\ncharacteristic doctrines (Summa, art. 24, q. 7). The apparent\ncontrast between these two theories is lessened when we recognize that\nfor Henry God is the primum cognitum of our intellect, not\nbecause of the evidence, but because of the absolute indeterminacy of\nour concept of God. \n\nFor Henry, the more indeterminate an intelligible, the more quickly\nit is grasped naturally by our intellect (“…et sic\nuniversaliter quanto intelligibile magis est indeterminatum, tanto\nnaturaliter prius ipsum intellectus noster intelligit”;\nSumma, art. 24, q. 7, ed. 1520, f. 144rG). While God is not\nthe first but the last concept in the order of rational knowledge,\nafter the knowledge of creatures, He is the first object of natural\nknowledge, which is had in the first intentions and in which our\nintellect always proceeds from what is most indeterminate. Concerning\nany thing, our intellect first grasps (by nature) the fact of its being\nan entity and then the fact of its being that determined\nentity, even though chronologically the opposite seems true. Actually,\nwe seem to grasp a thing first as a stone and then as a being in\ngeneral, though in the natural order we can only know something as a\nstone because we have implicitly recognized it as a being. \n\nThere are, however, two different kinds of indeterminacy: privative\nindeterminacy (the mere absence of determination, that is, the\nindeterminacy of what can be conceived regardless of its\ndeterminations, though being in itself fully determinable) and\nnegative indeterminacy (that is, the indeterminacy of what is so\nsimple and subsistent as not to allow any further determination). \n\nThe first kind of indeterminacy pertains to the concept of being in\ngeneral and to the other primary notions (one, true, good etc.); the\nsecond one pertains to subsistent Being and Good, that is, to\nGod. Since the latter indeterminacy is actual, whereas the first\nderives only from the ‘privation’ of any additional determination, the\nnegatively indeterminate Being (God) is clearly more indeterminate\n(and indeterminable) than what is only privatively indeterminate (the\nconcept of being), even though this does not imply that negative\nindeterminacy has a greater extension than privative indeterminacy\n(what is privatively indeterminate is always more universal). Yet this\nis enough to state that in conceiving any determinate being our\nintellect also conceives indeterminate being, and, together with it,\nin an even more primary way, negatively indeterminate being. \n\nWhat is valid for being may also be\napplied to the other first intentions, though the concept of\nens still remains the most indeterminate and hence\noriginal. \n\nThe last aspect is clarified particularly in q. 2, art. 21 of the\nSumma, in which Henry deals with the theme of the relation\nbetween the being of creatures and the being of the creator. \n\nAccording to Henry, there is no real community, within creatural\nbeing, between substantial being and accidental being; as a\nconsequence, given that the distance between God’s being and\ncreatures’ being is much greater than the difference between the being\nof substance and that of accidents, being cannot be something common\nto both God and creatures. When being is predicated of God and\ncreatures, this only happens on the basis of the community of the\nname, and not of a real community: we are not dealing therefore with a\nunivocal predication, nor we are dealing with a purely equivocal\npredication, but with an intermediate, that is analogical,\npredication, one in which the term ‘being’ primarily and directly\nrelates to God, and only in a secondary way to creatures, since the\nlatter derive their being from God. \n\nThe analogy between God and creatures must be distinguished from the\nanalogical relation between substance and accident within the same\ncreatural being: while other beings relate to substance as their\nsubject, all creatures relate to God as to their end, their form (that\nis, as to the cause of their esse essentiae), and their\nefficient principle (that is, as to the cause of their esse\nactualis existentiae). Consequently, according to Henry, every\nreal concept through which the being of something is conceived without\nany further qualification (simpliciter), always refers to\nGod’s being or to creatures’ being, and never to something common to\nboth. \n\nYet Henry adds in this regard that those who have not been able to\ndistinguish among the many meanings of being (as instead Aristotle\ncorrectly did), and have rather understood being as one genus (as\nPlato did), held that the name ‘being’ referred to a single and common\nconcept. Univocity is therefore, according to Henry, a mistake, the\norigin of which lies in the indeterminacy of the concept of being\nwhich is first known by the intellect. In actual fact, as mentioned\nabove, indeterminacy is twofold, and points to something completely\ndifferent in the case of God’s being (negative indeterminacy, which\nexcludes any possible determination in act and in potency) and in the\ncase of creatural being (privative indeterminacy, which excludes only\nany actual determination). Since, however, these two kinds may appear\nsimilar, those who are unable to perceive their difference conceive as\none and the same thing indeterminate being, whether it is taken in the\nfirst or in the second meaning, that is, whether it is proper to God\nor to the general concept of being. This univocal concept is therefore\na mistake, or an error, because nothing positive is really common to\nGod and creatures, but only something negative, as the ‘right’\nintellect subsequently acknowledges, when, going beyond the apparent\ninitial indistinctness, it conceives in a distinct, separate way\nnegatively indeterminate being and privatively indeterminate\nbeing. \n\nHenry’s latter precision remains nonetheless ambiguous: the fact that\nthe ‘right’ intellect (rectus intellectus) can make a\ndistinction between the two kinds of indeterminacy only ‘subsequently’\n(consequenter; f. 125rS) suggests that the initial confusion\nis not only a mistake of the upholders of the univocity of being, but\na kind of deviation or temptation of the human intellect, especially\nif we consider that, in conceiving any determinate being, our\nintellect always conceives, at a more general level, indeterminate\nbeing, and within the latter, in a more original way, negatively\nindeterminate being (see above, § 8). Thus, in other texts (such as in\nthe following q. 3 of the same art. 21 of the Summa, where\nHenry is in actual fact citing Avicenna), Henry speaks of a common,\nanalogous concept of being, giving the impression of bringing analogy\ncloser to univocity. The first concept of being (ens largissimo\nmodo acceptum) is “something analogous common to Creator and\ncreature, containing within itself being as principle and being as\nproduced” (“commune analogum ad creatorem et creaturam, continens sub\nse ens principium et ens principiatum”, Summa, art. 21, q. 3,\ned. 1520, I, f. 126rD; my interpretation here differs somewhat from\nthat of Pickavé, who separates the question of analogy from that of\nthe first object of knowing by suggesting that the distinction between\nwhat is negatively indeterminate and what is privatively indeterminate\nhas a different meaning and function in the two cases. Concerning the\nconfusion between the two kinds of indeterminacy, Pickavé prefers to\nspeak of ‘weakness’, instead of ‘mistake’ or ‘error’; see Pickavé\n2011a). This concept at first common to God and creatures (whether it\nis erroneously conceived as something positive, or correctly conceived\nas something negative) offers, at any rate, the only possible starting\npoint for a metaphysical demonstration of the existence of God, a\ndemonstration that, in appealing to Avicenna and to Augustine's De\nTrinitate, proceeds from the consideration of any determinate\nbeing or good to the distinct knowledge of God as pure, necessarily\nexisting Being (Summa, art. 22, q. 5; art. 24, q. 6).  Henry\ndoes not refrain, however, from presenting a posteriori\nproofs — in the order of efficient, formal and final causes\n— that nevertheless refer exclusively to the existence of\nGod de complexo; in other words, to the truth of the\nstatement “God exists” (Summa, art. 22,\nq. 4). \n\nIn his production Henry dedicates no less than 20 quodlibetal\nquestions to an analysis of will and intellect, considered both in\ngeneral and with particular reference to the human sphere (Macken 1975\nand 1977). In Quodl. I, q. 14, the eminence of the will over\nthe intellect is defended, taking into account the habitus,\nact and object of the two faculties. As in Pauline doctrine, the\nhabitus of the will, which is love (caritas), is\npreferable to the habitus of the intellect, which is\nknowledge. Its act, which consists in desiring and loving God, is\npreferable to the act of reason, which is represented only by knowing\nGod. The object of the will, the supreme Good, is more eminent than the\nobject of the intellect, which is the truth, i.e. the good, of a given\nthing and is thus a subordinate good. In the next quaestio\n(Quodl. I, q. 15), however, Henry clarifies that the primacy\nof one faculty over another can be understood in a double sense:\n“primacy of essence” should be attributed to\nvoluntas, whereas “primacy of action” should be\nattributed to ratio. \n\nWhile it is true that the will is the superior faculty, in order to\nact it always needs the intervention of reason. This is justified on\nthe basis of the human cognitive process itself: in man, as in other\nanimals, the first form of knowledge is received through the senses.\nNevertheless, sensible appetites alone cannot activate the will, which\nonly moves toward the universaliter and simpliciter\nGood, and not toward a particular good, such as that perceived by the\nsenses. So the intervention of the intellect, which is able to abstract\nthe universal from sensible particulars and thereby permits the motion\nof the will, is always needed. In this way, the intellect precedes the\nwill. So, in order to avoid the inconvenience of having the motion of\nthe will depend on sensible appetites (determinism of the passions),\nHenry always recognizes the importance of the role of reason. \n\nNevertheless, unlike the theory upheld by those intellectualists\ncloser to the Aristotelian tradition in this case, the intellect itself\nis only a condition, and not the absolute cause, of the motion of the\nwill. For Henry the will is characterized by the capacity for\nself-motion. After being alluded to in q. 22, Quodl. IV, this\ntheory becomes central to q. 5, Quodl. IX of the Lent Session,\n1285: “Utrum voluntas moveat seipsam” (“Whether the\nwill moves itself”). The date is here important, since this\nQuodlibet was disputed after the famous propositio\nmagistralis of 1285, i.e. the proposition conceded by the Parisian\nMasters of Theology on the occasion of Giles of Rome's\nrehabilitation: “si ratio recta, et voluntas recta”\n(“if reason is right, then the will is also right”). In\nthis question the superiority of the will is vindicated by Henry, since\nnot only does it move all the other faculties, and hence the intellect\ntoo, but it also, indeed above all, moves itself, at a level of\nperfection which is second only to that of God. To the objection based\non the well-known Aristotelian principle according to which “all\nthat moves, is moved by something else,” Henry replies that while\nthis principle is valid for the material faculties, it cannot be\napplied in the same way to the spiritual faculties, since the latter\npossess a higher degree of perfection. \n\nIt is the level of perfection that determines the strength and\ncapacity of that which actualizes something else. Therefore, as the\nlevels of perfection increase, from matter (which, as pure potency,\nmoves nothing) to God (pure act), the distinction between mover and\nmoved diminishes. The will is immediately below the highest level of\nperfection, represented by God, since it admits a purely\n“intentional” distinction (see above §4) between\nmover and moved. And since it is self-moving, it is also free. Thus, in\nvirtue of its nature, the will is induced to seek the good proposed by\nthe intellect, though it remains free in this quest even with regard to\nthe supreme Good. \n\nIn Quodlibet X of the Advent Session, 1286, Henry returns\nto the problem of the self-motion of the will, introducing the notion\nof virtus ad movendum, through which the spiritual faculties\n(such as human voluntas) can produce and specify their own\nacts without an external mover. More especially, through this\nvirtus ad movendum, which corresponds to the substantial form\nof the subject, the will is able to pass from the potency of desiring\nto the act of desiring, since it already “virtually”\ncontains this act within itself. Henry thus surprisingly concludes that\neven the above-mentioned propositio magistralis (“si\nratio recta, et voluntas recta”) does not undermine the\nsuperiority of the will. The proposition should be interpreted in the\nsense of simultaneity, and not causality, since the second faculty\n(ratio) does not necessarily determine the first\n(voluntas), but is only the conditio sine qua non of\nits operation. Finally, Henry concedes that the will cannot desire what\nit does not know, but denies that the will is determined in its choices\nby the intellect; in other words, that it cannot desire the opposite of\nwhat the intellect dictates. \n\nHenry can thus undoubtedly be considered a voluntarist (Müller\n2007), even though with regard to the more “radical”\nvoluntarists, such as Walter of Brugge, he does not confine himself to\ninterpreting the role of reason as that of a mere\n“advisor”, but instead as that of a cause (albeit a\ncausa sine qua non): without the prior knowledge of the\nintellect (characterized by the same kind of freedom as\nvoluntas), the will cannot desire anything. In other words,\nfor Henry the intellect and the good that it proposes are not the sole\nor necessary origin of the motion of the will, as is affirmed, on the\nother hand, by those interpreters closer to Aristotle. Nevertheless, by\npresenting the objects that this faculty can freely choose, reason is\nthe conditio sine qua non of the action of the will itself,\nwhich otherwise would be prey to sensible appetites and the determinism\nof the passions. Moral action is therefore performed both by the\nintellect, which presents the kinds of good to choose, and by the will,\nwhich freely chooses one of these, yet without being forced to opt for\nthat which is judged best by reason (Teske 2011; Leone 2014). \n\nHere, we can briefly refer to other characteristic elements of\nHenry's metaphysical and theological system: \n\nIndeed, one of the central concerns throughout Henry's career\nwas the vindication of the absolutely scientific nature of theology.\nMoreover, it is the Master of Theology's duty to give, on\nrequest, his authoritative opinion on any topic; hence the numerous\nquestions of a pastoral, social, political and even economic kind that\nmake Henry's Quodlibeta one of the richest and liveliest\ntheological works of the entire Scholastic production (Porro 2006;\nMarmursztejn 2007; König-Pralong 2011).","contact.mail":"pasquale.porro@uniba.it","contact.domain":"uniba.it"}]
