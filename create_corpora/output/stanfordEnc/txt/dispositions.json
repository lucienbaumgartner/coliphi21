But what is this disposition? It\nseems on the one hand to be a perfectly real property, a genuine\nrespect of similarity common to glasses, china cups, and anything else\nfragile. Yet on the other hand, the glass’s disposition seems\nmysterious, ‘ethereal’ (as Goodman (1954) put it) in a way\nthat, say, its size and shape are not. For its disposition, it seems,\nhas to do only with its possibly shattering in\ncertain conditions. In general, it seems that nothing about\nthe actual behaviour of an object is ever necessary\nfor it to have the dispositions it has. Many objects differ from one\nanother with respect to their dispositions in virtue of their merely\npossible behaviours, and this is a mysterious way for objects to\ndiffer.\n\n\nMuch of the recent work on the topic of dispositions has been focused\non attempts to dispel this mystery by explaining dispositions in\nother, more readily understandable terms. The topic of dispositions is\ninteresting in its own right. But it derives further interest from the\nfact that appeals to dispositions have been made in just about every\narea of philosophy. There are explicitly dispositional analyses, for\nexample, of mental states, of colours, of value, of properties, and of\nconditionals. Philosophers interested in just about anything should be\ninterested in dispositions.\n\nMany terms have been used to describe what we mean by dispositions:\n‘power’ (Locke’s term), ‘dunamis’ (Aristotle’s\nterm), ‘ability’, ‘potency’,\n‘capability’, ‘tendency’,\n‘potentiality’, ‘proclivity’,\n‘capacity’, and so forth. In a very general sense, they\nmean disposition, or otherwise something close by. To avoid confusion,\nhowever, we will stick to the term ‘disposition’ (for a\nsubtle difference between dispositions and powers, see Bird 2016). \nAs noted earlier, philosophical interests in dispositions principally\ncentre around the issue of how to explain them in more readily\nunderstandable terms. This issue came to the prominence in the early\n20th century when philosophers aspired to construct an\nempiricist language in which all meaningful sentences including\ndispositional sentences can be analyzed in observational and\nextensional-logical terms. One early attempt at analyzing disposition\nascriptions on the empiricist program is made by Carnap (1928,\n1936–7) who considers the so-called reduction sentences as a way\nof introducing dispositional expressions into our language: \nR. \nFor each object \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is put into water, it is\nsoluble iff it dissolves, \nwhere the conditional is understood as a material conditional. The\nidea behind \\(R\\) is that we can meaningfully tell whether or not a\ngiven item is soluble only if it is put into water. \\(R\\) thus provides\na rule for how to introduce the dispositional predicate\n‘soluble’ in application to items that have in fact been\nput into water. But \\(R\\) is silent about whether \\(x\\) is soluble\nwhen it is not put into water, and this means that we cannot use \\(R\\)\nto completely eliminate the predicate ‘soluble’ from the\nlanguage. Though this is what Carnap explicitly embraced, many\nphilosophers found it deeply problematic. And so philosophers of\nempiricist leanings continued the search for a definition schema of\ndispositional expressions in an extensional language (Kaila 1939,\n1942; Storer 1951). \nNotwithstanding these attempts, however, it came to be widely accepted\nthat disposition ascriptions cannot be analyzed in an extensional\nlanguage (Burks 1951, 1955; Pap 1958; Sellars 1958). This had the\neffect of turning philosophers’ attention to the connection\nbetween disposition ascriptions and counterfactual or subjunctive\nconditionals. In fact, it was generally recognised from the very\nbeginning of philosophical research about dispositions that\ndisposition ascriptions are closely linked with counterfactual\nconditionals: ‘\\(x\\) is soluble at \\(t\\)’ is\nassociated with ‘\\(x\\) would dissolve if put into water at\n\\(t\\)’. This idea, however, was overlooked for decades\npartly due to the then popular epistemology of radically empiricist\nkind and partly due to the lack of a proper semantic understanding of\ncounterfactual conditionals. But it later came to be brought into the\nspotlight largely due to the revival of the philosophy of modality\nfrom the early 1970s. (For a historical survey of the debate regarding\nconceptual analyses of dispositions, see Malzkorn 2001 and Bird\n2012.) \nAs is already clear, analyses of dispositions usually proceed on the\nassumption that, for any disposition, we can identify its stimulus\nconditions and manifestations. It is typically said that dispositions\nwould exhibit their ‘characteristic manifestations’ under\nsome ‘stimulus conditions’. However, most conventional\ndispositional predicates—‘fragile’,\n‘soluble’, ‘malleable’ and the like—make\nno explicit reference to the stimulus conditions and manifestations\nfor the properties they express and the assumption that we are\nnonetheless in a position to identify those stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations is controversial. The stimulus condition and\nmanifestation of (water-)solubility are typically assumed to be the\nevent of being put into water and the event of dissolving,\nrespectively, and perhaps uncontroversially so. But what are the\nmanifestations of fragility? Something like shattering or cracking, it\nseems. But what about splintering, or breaking cleanly in two, or, as\nwith a fragile house of cards, collapsing? It seems hard to say. And\nwhat exactly are the stimulus conditions of fragility? Striking, it\nseems. But what about twisting or shaking? We are at a loss. But do\nthese questions have to do with philosophical understanding of\ndispositions at all? \nPartly due to the difficulty of specifying precisely the stimulus\nconditions and manifestations of a disposition and partly due to the\ndoubt over its philosophical relevance, philosophers find it useful to\ndistinguish two sorts of disposition, or alternatively, two ways of\nreferring to dispositions. Conventional dispositions are typically\nexpressed by such simple predicates as ‘fragile’,\n‘soluble’, ‘flammable’, and so on, which\ninclude no explicit reference to their stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations. Canonical dispositions, on the other hand, are\nexplicit about their stimulus conditions and manifestations, couched\nin the overtly dispositional locution. Some examples of canonical\ndispositions are the disposition to break in response to being struck,\nthe disposition to cause death in response to being ingested, and so\non. Obviously, the two ways of expressing dispositional properties are\nrelated to one another. As noted earlier, (water-)solubility might be\nidentified with the disposition to dissolve in response to being put\ninto water although this kind of identification is not readily\navailable in many other cases of conventional disposition. This\ndistinction between conventional and canonical dispositions allows us\nto keep questions about the adequacy of different analyses of\ndispositions sharply distinct from questions about how to identify the\nstimulus conditions and manifestations of particular dispositions. \nHaving introduced this distinction, we can facilitate the quest for an\nanalysis of dispositions by separating two issues, the issue of\nproviding a conceptual analysis of canonical dispositions and the\nissue of explaining conventional dispositions in terms of canonical\ndispositions. What do we mean by saying that \\(x\\) is\npoisonous? The first step for answering this question is to transform\nthe conventional disposition of being poisonous into the corresponding\n(group of) canonical disposition(s) by specifying its stimulus\nconditions and manifestations. The second step is to seek a conceptual\nanalysis of the canonical disposition(s) at hand. On this\n‘two-step’ approach, first taken by Lewis (1997), the\nso-called conditional analyses of dispositions we will discuss below\nare designed to help with the second step, saying how to analyze\ncanonical dispositions in terms of counterfactual conditionals. This\napproach has the advantage of allowing us to clarify what it takes to\ngive an analysis of dispositions. \nThe simplest analysis of dispositions in terms of counterfactual\nconditionals is the Simple Conditional Analysis: \nSCA.\nAn object is disposed to \\(M\\) when \\(C\\) iff it\nwould \\(M\\) if it were the case that \\(C\\). \nNotice that the analysandum of SCA is an ascription\nof a\nschematic canonical disposition. SCA has\nbeen explicitly endorsed by Ryle (1949), Goodman (1954), and Quine\n(1960) and implicitly by countless others. \nCounterexamples to SCA first raised by Martin\n(1994) exploit the fact that some dispositions are\n‘finkish’ in the sense that the conditions for an object’s\nacquiring or losing disposition \\(D\\) might be the same\nas \\(D\\)’s stimulus conditions. Suppose that an electrical\nwire is live just in case it has the canonical disposition to conduct\nelectricity when touched by a conductor. (This is an artificial\ndefinition that might differ from a dictionary definition of\n‘live’.) SCA then entails that a wire\nis live iff it would conduct electricity if touched by a conductor.\nSuppose now that a dead wire is connected to an electro-fink, a device\nwhich senses when the wire is about to be touched by a conductor, and\nwhich makes the wire live in every such circumstance. If the wire were\ntouched by a conductor then, thanks to the work of the device, the\nwire would become live, and so would conduct electricity. Hence the\nwire would conduct electricity if touched by a conductor. Being dead,\nhowever, it is not disposed to conduct electricity when touched by a\nconductor. The device can also operate on a reverse cycle, attaching\nto a naturally live wire but removing its property of being live if\never it is touched by a conductor. In this case, although the wire is\ndisposed to conduct electricity when touched by a conductor, the\n‘reverse-cycle’ fink ensures that the associated\ncounterfactual conditional is false. Martin’s examples are special\ncases of what R. K. Shope (1978) calls ‘The Conditional Fallacy\nin Contemporary Philosophy’, roughly the fallacy of ignoring the\nfact that, in a purported conditional analysis, the truth or falsity\nof the analysandum might depend on the truth or falsity of the\nantecedent of the conditional analysans. \nAnother kind of counterexample to SCA, due to Johnston\n(1992) and Bird (1998), involves a fragile glass that is carefully\nprotected by packing material. It is claimed that the glass is\ndisposed to break when struck but, if struck, it wouldn’t break thanks\nto the work of the packing material. There is an important difference\nbetween this example and Martin’s: the packing material would prevent\nthe breaking of the glass not by removing its\ndisposition to break when struck but by blocking the process that\nwould otherwise lead from striking to breaking. This difference will\nbe important in the context of evaluating Lewis’s analysis of\ndispositions in\n section 1.4.\n The packing material is called a masker (Johnston) or antidote (Bird)\nto the glass’s disposition at issue (see Choi 2003 for a refinement of\nthe masking counterexample to SCA). \nStill another kind of counterexample to SCA, discussed\nby Smith (1977), Prior, Pargetter & Jackson (1982), Lewis (1997),\nand Armstrong (1997), involves an interfering factor in virtue of\nwhich \\(x\\) mimics the manifestation of\ndisposition \\(D\\) although it does not\npossess \\(D\\). When a styrofoam dish is struck, it makes a\ndistinctive sound. The Hater of Styrofoam is within earshot of it.\nWhat if it were struck? The Hater of Styrofoam would hear the\ndistinctive sound and tear the styrofoam dish apart. It seems evident\nthat the dish is not disposed to break when struck. If struck,\nhowever, it would break due to the interference of the Hater of\nStyrofoam, which goes against SCA. Here the Hater of\nStyrofoam is called a mimicker of the disposition to break when\nstruck, meaning that it makes it the case that the dish, which does\nnot have the disposition, mimics its manifestation. (This example is\ndue to Lewis 1997.) \nNotice that finking, masking and mimicking situations are ubiquitous\n(Fara 2005). Extremely fragile and valuable objects, for example,\nare routinely protected by various kinds of\npackaging material. See also Bird 1998. \nDespite the apparent force, however, it is not universally agreed that\nthese examples undermine SCA. Some philosophers insist\nthat SCA, when properly understood, is not susceptible\nat all to the alleged counterexamples, whilst some others maintain\nthat they do refute SCA but they can be avoided by\nsuitable sophistications of it. The first position is supported by\nChoi (2006, 2008) and Gundersen (2002), who challenge the assumption\nabout what dispositions an object possesses in each of the alleged\ncounterexamples. They emphasise that when the glass is protected by\nthe packing material it is no longer disposed to\nbreak when struck; rather, it is disposed to break when\nstruck in the absence of the packing material. This is\nin line with SCA since the glass would indeed break\nif struck in the absence of the packing material although it wouldn’t\nbreak if struck under its current conditions—mutatis\nmutandis for the example of reverse-cycle finks. Similarly,\nChoi suggests that when the styrofoam dish is in the neighborhood of\nthe Hater of Styrofoam, it is indeed disposed to break when struck; it\nis not disposed to break when struck in the absence of the\nHater of Styrofoam. This suggestion is consistent\nwith SCA since the dish wouldn’t break if struck in\nthe absence of the Hater of Styrofoam although it would break if\nstruck under its current conditions—mutatis\nmutandis for the example of finks. \nThis tactic can be readily generalised so as to distinguish two\ndispositions, the simple disposition whose stimulus condition and\nmanifestation are the event of being struck and the event of breaking,\nrespectively, on the one hand, and the complex disposition whose\nstimulus condition and manifestation are the event of being\nstruck in the absence of finks, reverse–cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers and the event of breaking,\nrespectively, on the other. The simple counterfactual conditional\nassociated with the first disposition (namely,\n‘if \\(x\\) were struck it would break’) is\nfalse in the examples of reverse-cycle finks and maskers and true in\nthe examples of finks and mimickers but the ascription of the first\ndisposition (namely, ‘\\(x\\) is disposed to break when\nstruck’) correspondingly has the same truth value in each\nexample; meanwhile, the ascription of the second disposition (namely,\n‘\\(x\\) is disposed to break when struck in the\nabsence of finks, reverse–cycle finks, maskers, and\nmimickers’) is true in the examples of reverse-cycle finks\nand maskers and false in the examples of finks and mimickers but the\nsimple counterfactual conditional associated with the second\ndisposition (namely, ‘if \\(x\\) were\nstruck in the absence of finks, reverse–cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers it would break’)\ncorrespondingly has the same truth value in each example. \nManley & Wasserman (2008) object that this defence\nof SCA falls prey to what they call the problem of\n‘Achilles’ heels’ (for more on Manley & Wasserman’s\nobjection, see Bonevac, Dever & Sosa 2011; Choi 2011b; Manley\n& Wasserman 2011). Hajek (forthcoming) agrees with Choi and\nGundersen that the alleged counterexamples to SCA fail but\ndisagrees with them, arguing that SCA is susceptible to what\nhe calls ‘minkish’ counterexamples. Another line of\ncriticism of Choi and Gundersen’s strategy is to appeal to the\nintrinsicness of dispositions, which we will discuss in the next\nsection. \nThe typical reaction to the counterexamples is to take them to\nmotivate a sophisticated conditional analysis. Versions of\nsophisticated analyses of dispositions have been offered by Prior\n(1985), Lewis (1997), Malzkorn (2000), Mellor (2000), Fara (2005),\nManley & Wasserman (2008), Vetter (2014, 2015), and Kroll (2017).\nHere we will focus on Lewis’s, Manley & Wasserman’s, and Vetter’s\nanalyses. \nLewis (1997) points out that if Martin’s examples are to succeed as\ncounterexamples to SCA then we must suppose\nthat \\(x\\)’s dispositions are intimately related to its\nintrinsic properties. For consider again Martin’s example of an\napparently dead wire attached to an electro-fink. Choi and Gundersen’s\ndefence of SCA rests on the insistence that the\nwire is not dead but live. But we can imagine its intrinsic duplicate\nunconnected to an electro-fink, which is unquestionably dead. Choi and\nGundersen’s defence therefore has the consequence that whether the\nwire is live or dead is an extrinsic matter. When\nMartin’s examples are supplemented with the assumption that\ndispositions involved in the examples are intrinsic to their bearers,\ntherefore, this will preclude Choi and Gundersen’s defence\nof SCA. And so, Lewis, subscribing to the Intrinsic\nDispositions Thesis (for short, IDT) that all dispositions are\nintrinsic to their bearers, concludes that Martin’s examples have left\nno hope for SCA. But is IDT true? We will discuss it\nlater in\n section 5. \nLewis’s proposal (with some simplifications) is: \nRCA. \nAn object \\(x\\) is disposed to \\(M\\) when \\(C\\) iff \\(x\\) has an\nintrinsic property \\(B\\) such that, if it were the case that \\(C\\),\nand if \\(x\\) were to retain \\(B\\) for a sufficient time, then \\(C\\)\nand \\(B\\) would jointly cause \\(x\\) to \\(M\\). \nLewis’s amendment enables us to circumvent the problem of finks and\nreverse-cycle finks. Martin’s live wire connected to the reverse-cycle\nfink, for example, is correctly predicted to be live. For the wire has\nan intrinsic property—the property of having free electrons,\nsay—such that, if it were touched by a conductor, and\nif it were to retain that property for a sufficient time,\nthen the wire would conduct electricity (because of being touched and\nhaving the property). \nIt seems, though, that Lewis’s amendment doesn’t help with the\nproblems of maskers and mimickers (Bird 1998; Fara 2005; Choi 2005a).\nRecall the fragile glass carefully protected with the packing\nmaterial. The glass, it is thought, is disposed to break when struck.\nWhat if it were struck? It would retain all of its molecular\nstructures for a sufficient time. But it would not break because of\nthe masking operation of the packing material.\nSo RCA seems to fail.\nSimilarly, RCA doesn’t avoid the problem of\nmimickers. The styrofoam dish, if struck, would break by the mimicking\noperation of the Hater of Styrofoam. Note that, if struck, the dish\nwould retain for a sufficient time an intrinsic property, say, the\nmicrostructure responsible for its distinctive sound and, further,\nthis intrinsic property would be a cause of the breaking. The\nprediction by RCA is therefore that the styrofoam\ndish is disposed to break when struck, which might be claimed to be\ncounterintuitive. \nIn an effort to deflect the problem of maskers, Lewis employs what\nManley & Wasserman (2008) name the strategy of getting\nspecific. He suggests that we have a choice. We might, on the one\nhand, say that the protected glass is disposed to break when struck\nwithout the packing material; or we might say, instead, that it is\ndisposed to break when struck but this disposition is masked by the\npacking material. Lewis insinuates that the first option is preferable\nto the second one. The first option being taken, however, one may well\ninsist that the glass is not disposed to break when struck, which\nneutralises the problem of maskers. (Note that the strategy of getting\nspecific is basically the same as the one Choi and Gundersen take to\ndeal with the problems of finks, reverse-finks, and mimickers as well\nas the problem of maskers.) \nLewis’s response to the problem of mimickers, on the other hand, is to\ninvoke the idea that the manifestation of fragility is not\nsimply \\(x\\)’s breaking but \\(x\\)’s\nbreaking through a certain direct and standard process.\nThe styrofoam dish, if struck, would break but not through a certain\ndirect and standard process for fragility, a process that does not\ninvolve the Hater of Styrofoam’s intervention. Then the dish is not\nfragile as it is not disposed to break through a certain direct and\nstandard process if struck. Having explained away the intuition that\nthe dish is not fragile, it opens the possibility of insisting that,\ngiven that the dish is situated within the earshot of the Hater of\nStyrofoam, it is indeed disposed to break when struck, which\nneutralises the problem of mimickers. (See Choi 2005a for a criticism\nof Lewis’s response.) \nWe have three comments to add on Lewis’s responses. The first comment\nis that Lewis denies that the problems of maskers and mimickers throw\nlight on the analysis of dispositionality that\nphilosophers intend to attain by the conditional analysis of\ndispositions. On his view, they touch upon merely the pragmatic issue\nof what specifications are built into the stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations corresponding to a given dispositional concept. This is\ndisputed by Choi (2008). Secondly, there is a\nnoticeable tension between Lewis’s criticism\nof SCA and his defence of RCA from\nthe problems of maskers and mimickers. We have seen earlier that Lewis\ntries to add force to the problem of finks by assuming IDT. But this\nassumption seems to undermine his own defence\nof RCA from the problems of maskers and mimickers.\nLewis’s response to the problem of maskers is that the protected glass\nis disposed to break when struck without the packing material, which\nexplains away the intuition that it is fragile; and that this opens\nthe door for insisting that it is in fact not disposed to break when\nstruck. But this move seems to be on a collision course with IDT\nbecause an unprotected intrinsic duplicate of the glass is undoubtedly\ndisposed to break when struck. This illustrates the tension between\nLewis’s treatments of the problems of finks and\nmaskers—and mutatis mutandis for the problems\nof mimickers (see Choi 2009 for discussion). \nTo introduce the third comment on Lewis’s approach, let us compare it\nwith Choi and Gundersen’s approach that rules out finks, reverse-cycle\nfinks, maskers, mimickers, etc., from the stimulus condition. A\nconspicuous difference between them is that, whilst, on Choi and\nGundersen’s approach, all of the problems of finks, reverse-cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers are handled in a\nuniform manner, this is not the case for Lewis’s\napproach. Lewis deals with them by\ninvoking diverse elements in RCA: the\ncondition that \\(x\\) retain an intrinsic property for a\nsufficient time, the condition that the intrinsic property causally\ncontribute to the occurrence of the manifestation, the condition that\nmaskers be absent from the stimulus condition, the condition that the\nmanifestation of fragility be \\(x\\)’s breaking through a\ncertain direct and standard process. Other things being equal, this\ndifference will favour Choi and Gundersen’s approach over Lewis’s as\nexplanatory unity is a theoretical virtue. (See Gundersen 2017 and\nSchlosser 2018 for an ongoing dispute about RCA’s\nviability.) \nHaving discussed Lewis’s analysis of dispositions in detail, let us\nturn to a more recent proposal by Manley & Wasserman (2007, 2008).\nThey take cues from, among other things, comparative\ndisposition ascriptions like ‘\\(x\\) is more\ndisposed to break when struck than \\(y\\)’. They stress\nthat the versions of the conditional analysis of dispositions\ndiscussed so far cannot accommodate these comparative ascriptions as\ncounterfactual conditionals invoked by conditional analyses do not\nadmit of degree. This consideration suggests the following account of\ndispositions, or so they argue. \nPROP. \n\\(x\\) is disposed to \\(M\\) in \\(C\\) iff some suitable proportion of\n\\(C\\)-cases are such that \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in them,\n \nwhere a \\(C\\)-case is a fully specific scenario that\nsettles everything causally relevant to the manifestation of the\ndisposition. The suitable proportion of \\(C\\)-cases is\nfixed partly by the stimulus condition \\(C\\) and partly\nby the context of ascription. \nOn PROP, ‘\\(x\\) is more disposed\nto \\(M\\) in \\(C\\) than \\(y\\)’\nmeans that \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in a\ngreater proportion of \\(C\\)-cases\nthan \\(y\\). PROP thus seems to provide an\naccount of comparative disposition ascriptions. Further, Manley &\nWasserman hold that PROP has no difficulty handling\nsome apparent counterexamples to the conditional analyses of\ndispositions on offer. A fragile glass wouldn’t break in the presence\nof finks or maskers. PROP, however, rules correctly that it\nis disposed to break when struck. That is because the glass would\nstill break in a suitable proportion of \\(C\\)-cases where it is\nstruck. On the other hand, a non-fragile steel bar would break in the\npresence of reverse-finks or mimicker. Yet again, PROP\nentails correctly that it is not disposed to break when struck. That\nis because the steel bar wouldn’t break in a suitable proportion of\n\\(C\\)-cases where it is struck. \nBut Manley & Wasserman’s analysis is not without difficulties. The\ntrouble is that it is extremely difficult to make\nsense of talk of proportions of \\(C\\)-cases,\nespecially given that very diverse factors are supposed to affect the\nweights of given \\(C\\)-cases: closeness of them to\nactuality, contextual variations of their weights, and so on. In\naddition, Manley & Wasserman’s account of comparative disposition\nascriptions requires a non-arbitrary standard for comparing the sizes\nof infinite sets of \\(C\\)-cases despite most of them\nbeing of the same cardinality. But it looks to be a\ntremendous task to set up such a standard, let alone, to do so in a\nway that is epistemically accessible to those of us who possess the\ndispositional concepts at issue. \nVetter (2014, 2015) challenges what she calls ‘the standard\nconception of dispositionality’, according to which a\ndisposition \\(D\\) is individuated by the pair of its stimulus\ncondition \\(S\\) and its manifestation \\(M\\), and its modal\nnature is at least approximately captured by a counterfactual\nconditional ‘If \\(x\\) were in \\(S, x\\) would\n\\(M\\rsquo\\). The alternative she proposes is the possibility\nconception of dispositionality according to which a disposition is\nindividuated by its manifestation \\(M\\) alone and its modal\nnature is that of possibility, best characterised by ‘\\(x\\)\ncan \\(M\\rsquo.\\) On this conception, the stimulus condition\nplays no role in individuating dispositions. Hence dispositional\nsentences are akin to ‘can’ sentences. With this in the\nbackground, Vetter first proposes an analysis of comparative\ndispositional ascriptions which says that \\(x\\) is more disposed\nto \\(M\\) than \\(y\\) iff \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in more\ncases than \\(y\\), where cases are triples of a world, a time, and\nan object. For instance, to say that \\(x\\) is more disposed to\nbreak than \\(y\\) is to say that \\(x\\) would break in more\ncases than \\(y\\). Vetter then proposes that \\(x\\) is\ndisposed to break simpliciter just in case it breaks in a\nsufficiently large proportion of the relevant cases, where context may\ndetermine what counts as sufficiently large. \nVetter’s proposal has much in common with Manley & Wasserman’s,\nwhich means that the former inherits many of the latter’s advantages\nand disadvantages. The key difference between them is that Manley\n& Wasserman, along with other defenders of conditional analyses of\ndispositions, hold on to the standard conception that the essential\ncharacterization of a disposition requires a reference to its stimulus\ncondition as well as its manifestation but Vetter opposes this\nconception. It remains to be seen how this difference will be\nsettled. \nWe have thus far surveyed a variety of conceptual analyses of\ncanonical dispositions that involve explicit references to their\nstimulus conditions and manifestations. This corresponds to the second\nstep in Lewis’s two-step approach (see\n section 1.1).\n But they by themselves do not tell us how to understand conceptually\nconventional dispositions like fragility, flammability, conductivity,\netc., that do not involve such explicit references. Here it might be\nsuggested that, given that conventional dispositions are the ones we\nare most familiar with and find most useful in everyday or scientific\ncontexts, our understanding of dispositions will remain incomplete\nunless we have obtained a full-blooded analysis of conventional\ndispositions. In fact, although the apparent counterexamples to\nSCA were presented in terms\nof canonical dispositions in the preceding\nsections, they are often presented in terms\nof conventional dispositions. On this construal,\nthe simple conditional analysis is thought of as an analysis of\nconventional dispositions. For instance, the simple conditional\nanalysis of fragility is understood as saying\nthat \\(x\\) is fragile at \\(t\\) iff\nit would break if struck at \\(t\\); and this analysis is\nclaimed to be toppled, for example, by a carefully packed glass that\nremains fragile but would not break if struck. Thus the alleged\ncounterexamples are often described as concerning the issue of how to\nlink conventional dispositions with counterfactual conditionals. We\nnoted earlier, though, that, to tackle this issue, we need define\nconventional dispositions into (groups of) canonical dispositions by\nspecifying their stimulus conditions and manifestations, which\ncorresponds to the first step in Lewis’s two-step approach. With this\nin mind, we will inquire into the issue of how to specify the stimulus\nconditions and manifestations of conventional dispositions and other\nrelated issues. \nLet us start by unraveling\nseveral different notions of stimulus condition.\nMary utters ‘Arsenic is poisonous’. What is the stimulus\ncondition of the disposition expressed by ‘poisonous’? An\nimpromptu answer would be the event of being ingested. In most normal\ncontexts of utterance, however, what she means is that arsenic is\npoisonous to humans. So, given this context of utterance, the\nstimulus condition can be said to be the event of being ingested\nby a human being (Prior 1985, chapter 1). This second\nstimulus condition can be identified by making explicit the context’s\ncontribution to the content of the stimulus condition. As we will see,\nfurthermore, it has been suggested that the stimulus condition is not\nthe simple event of being ingested but the event of being ingested\nwithout finks, maskers, and so forth. Here the condition of\nthe absence of finks, maskers, and so forth seems to come not from the\ncontext of utterance but from the context-independent meaning of being\npoisonous (Choi 2011a, 2011b). There are thus many different notions\nof stimulus condition although they are not miles away from each\nother. One says ‘My mobile phone set is fragile’. The\nstimulus condition could be any of its being struck, its being struck\nwith a soft blow, its being struck without finks, maskers, and so\nforth. \nThis disambiguation is of much value when we articulate the notion of\n‘multi-track’ disposition. There seems to be a general\nagreement that there are so-called ‘multi-track’\nconventional dispositions that correspond to more than one pair of\nstimulus condition and manifestation (Ryle 1949, pp. 43–45; Bird\n2005a, p. 367; Bird 2007a, pp. 21–24; Ellis & Lierse 1994,\np. 29; Williams 2011, pp. 85–7; Vetter 2013). The thought is that\nexactly the same conventional dispositions may be picked out by\nmultiple characterisations in terms of stimulus condition and\nmanifestation. However, caution is required when we decide if a given\ndisposition is multi-track or not. First of all, a single notion of\nstimulus condition must be in use: it is wrong to infer that the\nproperty of being poisonous is a multi-track disposition, from the\nfact that its stimulus condition could be being ingested, being\ningested by humans, being ingested without finks, maskers, and so on.\nFurther, we must hold the context of utterance fixed: it is wrong to\ninfer that the property of being poisonous is multi-track, from the\nfact that its stimulus condition could be being ingested by humans,\nbeing ingested by dogs, being ingested by birds, and so on. The\nexpression ‘poisonous’ is context-sensitive with respect\nto who \\(x\\) is poisonous to, referring to different dispositions\nrelative to different contexts of utterance. Hence stimulus conditions\nlike \\(x\\)’s being ingested by humans, \\(x\\)’s\nbeing ingested by dogs, etc., are not stimulus conditions of\nthe same disposition. And hence they don’t have to\ndo with the issue of whether or not a given disposition is\nmulti-track. \nIt is not universally agreed that dispositions are typically\nmulti-track. Lowe (2010, pp. 10–11) insists that dispositions can’t be\nmulti-track. A majority of metaphysicians, however, lean toward the\nmulti-track character of dispositions. Being electrically charged, an\nelectron is disposed to experience an electrostatic\nforce \\(F\\) in response to being placed at a\ndistance \\(d\\) away from an electric\ncharge \\(q\\) but it is also disposed to experience an\nelectrostatic force \\(F^*\\) in response to being placed\nat a distance \\(d^*\\) away from an electric\ncharge \\(q^*\\). Similarly, it might be plausibly claimed that\nfragility is a multi-track disposition with many different stimulus\nconditions: \\(x\\)’s being struck, \\(x\\)’s being\nstressed, \\(x\\)’s being twisted, \\(x\\)’s being\nshaken, and so on. Indeed, whilst Cartwright’s (1999, pp. 59, 64)\nnotion of capacity is akin to the notion of multi-track disposition\n(cf. Teller 2002, pp. 717–718), electric charge being a paradigm\nexample of capacity in Cartwright’s sense, she maintains that\ncapacities are real properties and that reference to capacities is\nessential in the operation of science: scientific laws are nothing but\nexpressions of what capacities exist and how they work together. On\nCartwright’s view, hence, not only do multi-track dispositions exist\nbut it is their nature that science aims to unveil. \nVetter (2013) goes a step further to argue that the extent of the\nmulti-track character of dispositions is severely underestimated,\nexploiting what she calls the problems of qualitative diversity and\nquantitative diversity. It is noteworthy that this consideration is\nused as a stepping stone for her possibility conception of\ndispositionality. The thought is that, given that there is an extreme\nvariety of stimulus conditions of \\(D\\) and that there is no\nprivileged subset of them with respect to the question of whether\n\\(x\\) instantiates \\(D\\) or not, we’d better embrace\ndispositions without stimulus conditions (Vetter 2014, p. 132). \nBe that as it may, however, we will leave behind multi-track\ndispositions, for, seeking a conceptual analysis of them raises many\ndifficult questions that would take us far afield. In what follows, we\nwill instead focus on single-track conventional dispositions that\ncorrespond to a unique pair of stimulus condition and manifestation,\nor alternatively we will simply assume that all conventional\ndispositions are single-track. We hope, though, the subsequent\ndiscussion will shed light on the issue of how to analyze multi-track\ndispositions. \nWhat are the stimulus condition and manifestation of a given\nconventional disposition? It is generally held that any specification\nof the stimulus condition of a conventional disposition must include\ncovert reference to a ceteris paribus clause (Prior\n1985; Lewis 1997; Bird 1998; Mumford 1998; Mellor 2000; Malzkorn 2000;\nCross 2005; Choi 2006, 2008; Hauska 2008b; Steinberg 2010): fragility,\nfor example, is defined not as the canonical disposition to break when\nstruck but rather as the canonical disposition to break when\nstruck under certain standard conditions. For the sake\nof simplicity, let us combine this definition with SCA. Then it follows that\n‘\\(x\\) is fragile’ is to be analyzed into\n‘If \\(x\\) were struck under certain standard\nconditions it would break’ or\n‘If \\(x\\) were struck then, ceteris\nparibus, it would break’. Recall that, in each of the\nalleged counterexamples to SCA, a fragile thing but not\na non-fragile thing would break if struck in the absence of finks,\nreverse-cycle finks, maskers, mimickers, and so on. To the extent to\nwhich cases of finks, reverse-cycle finks, etc., are non-standard,\ntherefore, the ceteris paribus clause ensures that\n‘\\(x\\) is fragile’ has the same truth value as\nthe associated counterfactual conditional in every case, thereby\nblocking the counterexamples. \nBut serious doubts have been raised as to how to spell out\nthe ceteris paribus clause in a way that fits the\nbill. It is even claimed that the only way to spell it out in such a\nway is to render the proposed analysis vacuous. For, on\nthe intended reading of the ceteris paribus clause,\nto say that if \\(x\\) were struck, then ceteris\nparibus it would break seems to be simply to say that if it\nwere struck then, unless it didn’t break, it would break, which is\nvacuously true (Martin 1994; Bird 1998; Mumford 1998, 2001; Fara 2005\nand Hauska 2008b) See Mellor 2000 and Steinberg 2010 for the view that\nthe risk of vacuity is unproblematic. See also Choi 2008 and Steinberg\n& Steinberg 2017 for an attempt to spell out the ceteris\nparibus clauses in a way that does not render the resulting\nconditionals vacuous. \nThe task of analyzing conventional dispositions poses no additional\nchallenge to Manley & Wasserman’s approach or Vetter’s approach,\nadditional to those challenges posed by the task of analyzing\ncanonical dispositions. They handle the problems of finks, maskers,\nmimickers, etc., not by ruling them out from the stimulus condition\nbut by exploiting the ‘suitable proportion’ requirement.\nThey can thereby stick to the simple definition of fragility as the\ndisposition to break when struck (Manley & Wasserman) or as the\ndisposition to break (Vetter). From their respective analysis of\ncanonical dispositions, then, they can readily derive an analysis of\nconventional dispositions like fragility that does away with\nceteris paribus clauses. \nThe previous section was devoted to the issue of how to devise a\nconceptual analysis of dispositions in an attempt to improve our\nunderstanding of dispositions. Another way of improving it is to\nidentify characteristics that distinguish dispositions from\nnon-dispositional properties, especially, ‘categorical\nproperties’. What are categorical properties? With respect to\nthis question we are in no better position than we are with respect to\ndispositional properties. There are some clear cases like\nroundness and having two arms. But it is not clear\nwhat characteristics they have in common. See Mumford 1998, pp,\n20–22; Bird 2007a, pp. 66–67, 2013; Ellis 2010; Yates\nforthcoming for some attempts to characterise categorical properties.\n(Note that hybrid properties—like the property of being\nsoluble and round—are possible (McKitrick 2003b, footnote\n9). We’ll ignore them.)  \nWhat is it about dispositions that sets them apart from categorical\nproperties? Traditionally it is suggested that ascriptions of\ndispositions do, whilst ascriptions of categorical properties do not,\nentail certain counterfactual conditionals: \nEntailment. \n\\(F\\) is a disposition iff there are an associated stimulus\ncondition and manifestation such that, necessarily, \\(x\\)\nhas \\(F\\) only if \\(x\\) would produce the manifestation if\nit were in the stimulus condition.\n \nAmong the philosophers who have supported Entailment, or\nsomething like it, are Carnap (1936–7), Ryle (1949), Goodman\n(1954), Quine (1960), Mackie (1973), Prior (1985), and Armstrong,\nMartin & Place (1996), Mumford (1998), Choi (2005b, 2008,\n2012). \nIf disposition ascriptions do not entail corresponding counterfactual\nconditionals, then Entailment is hopeless. Note\nthat the apparent counterexamples to SCA may seem\nto show just that. But let’s leave this claim aside for the sake of\nargument. Still Entailment might be disputed on the\nground that ascriptions of dispositions are not unique in this regard.\nMellor (1974) takes an allegedly paradigmatic categorical property,\ntriangularity, and claimed that if \\(x\\) is triangular,\nthen if its corners were correctly counted, the result would be\nthree. Entailment therefore seems to predict that\n‘triangular’ expresses a disposition. And as for\n‘triangular’ so, presumably, for any predicate that might\nbe thought to express a categorical property. \nMellor’s suggestion, though, is liable to the problems of\nreverse-finks and maskers. One can easily set up an analogous case to\nan example of reverse-finks or maskers that shows that Mellor’s\nconditional is not entailed by ‘\\(x\\) is\ntriangular’: \\(x\\) is triangular but if its\ncorners were about to be counted a sorcerer would change its shape so\nthat the result of counting would not be three. Further, Prior (1982,\n1985) argues that if we are to understand ‘correctly’ in\nthe antecedent of Mellor’s conditional as referring to\nthe method of counting, as opposed to the result of\ncounting, then his claim is false. For there are possible worlds in\nwhich quirky laws of nature ensure that counting always gives the\nwrong result. (Bird (2003, 2009) gives a useful discussion of the\ngeneral lessons that should be drawn from the debate between Prior and\nMellor.) \nBut it might be suggested that these problems for Mellor’s claim can\nbe handled by introducing a ceteris paribus clause\nin much the same fashion as, as we have seen in\n section 1.5,\n some philosophers do with respect to conventional dispositions. The\nsuggestion is that the stimulus condition of triangularity is not\nsimply \\(x\\)’s corners being correctly counted\nbut \\(x\\)’s corners being correctly counted under certain\nstandard conditions. Although ‘\\(x\\) is\ntriangular’ may not entail Mellor’s conditional as it stands, it\ndoes entail that if \\(x\\)’s corners were correctly\ncounted under certain standard conditions, it would give\nthe result of three, where the standard conditions are understood to\nrule out cases where reverse-finks or maskers operate or quirky laws\nof nature obtain. Notwithstanding this defence of Mellor’s claim,\nhowever, Choi argues that it is still hopeless, to which we will turn\nbelow. \nChoi (2005b) imagines a tricky\ntriangle \\(T_t\\) which has the same intrinsic\nproperties as an ordinary triangle except that it has\nan intrinsic property that would cause it to become\nrectangular if someone starts to count its corners. What\nif \\(T_t\\)’s corners were correctly counted under\nstandard conditions? Given that standard conditions are generally\nthought to\ninvolve \\(T_t\\)’s extrinsic properties\nonly, \\(T_t\\) would become rectangular in virtue\nof one of its own intrinsic properties; as a result, it would not\nelicit the result of three but the result of four. It is therefore not\ntrue that if \\(T_t\\rsquo\\text{s}\\) corners were correctly\ncounted under standard conditions the result would be three. But it is\nintuitively evident that \\(T_t\\) is\ntriangular. From this Choi concludes that ‘\\(x\\) is\ntriangular’ does not even entail the ceteris\nparibus version of Mellor’s conditional. \nOne might suspect, however, that Choi’s thought experiment will\nbackfire on the ground that we can envision an analogous case for\ndispositions: an object \\(S_t\\) only differs from a fragile glass in\nthat the first, not the second, has an intrinsic property\nthat would cause it to lose \\(M\\) if it were struck, where \\(M\\) is\nthe type of microstructure \\(S_t\\) has in common with the fragile\nglass. \\(S_t\\) does not satisfy the counterfactual conditional that it\nwould break if struck under the standard conditions. But is \\(S_t\\)\nnot supposed to have almost all intrinsic properties in common with a\nfragile glass, most importantly, the microstructure \\(M\\)? This might\nlead one to think that \\(S_t\\) is fragile, from which it follows that\neven the ascription of fragility does not entail the\ncorresponding counterfactual conditional. In response, though, Choi\n(2005b, pp. 499–502, 2012) urges that \\(S_t\\) is not\nfragile.  He has thus defended (a ceteris paribus version of)\nEntailment from Mellor’s objections by\ninvoking intrinsically finkish properties. \nHandfield (2008b) gives an insightful angle to Choi’s thought\nexperiment. Let’s say that a property putatively considered to be\ndispositional is intrinsically finkable or not depending on whether or\nnot an object can co-instantiate it along with\nan intrinsic property that would remove it should\nthe stimulus condition be present. Then Handfield suggests that the\ncore idea of Choi’s thought experiment is that dispositional\nproperties are not intrinsically finkable but categorical properties\nare. \nAt least some dispositions\nare extrinsically finkable. Martin’s examples can\nbe understood to show that the dispositional property of being live is\nextrinsically finkable. We can readily get a similar result for\ncategorical properties. Handfield urges, though, that there is a\nglaring contrast between dispositional and categorical properties when\nwe look at intrinsic finks, which is illustrated by Choi’s thought\nexperiment. \\(T_t\\) is triangular but it also\nhas an intrinsic property that would remove its triangularity if its\ncorners were counted. This property serves as an intrinsic fink to\ntriangularity. The case of \\(S_t\\), however, is\nclaimed to show that we cannot devise an analogous case for\ndispositions, which permits the conclusion that fragility is not\nintrinsically finkable—and mutatis\nmutandis for the possibility of intrinsic reverse-finks,\nmaskers, and mimickers. This view has been criticised by Clarke (2008,\n2010), Fara (2008), Everett (2009), Ashwell (2010), Kittle (2015),\nTugby (2016), and Bird (manuscript), though. \nChoi (2012, 2017a, 2017b) addresses some of their criticisms. This\nissue is importantly relevant to many other issues such as\nKripke-Wittgenstein rule-following puzzle (Martin & Heil 1998;\nHandfield & Bird 2008; Cheng 2010; Schlosser 2011), the principle\nof alternate possibilities (Cohen & Handfield 2007), the nature of\ndesires (Ashwell 2014, 2017), and so on. \nIn contemporary metaphysics, a surging number of philosophers express\ntheir allegiance to dispositional essentialism, the position that at\nleast some properties have dispositional essences.\nSome of them go beyond this to take a stronger position,\nthat all suitably qualified properties are\nessentially dispositional (Popper 1959; Harré 1970;\nHarré & Madden 1975; Shoemaker 1980; Mumford 2004; Bird\n2005b, 2007a; Chakravartty 2007; Whittle 2008; Tugby 2013, 2014; Yates\nforthcoming; For the most up-to-date exposition of this view, see Bird\n2016). This position is known as dispositional monism or causal theory\nof properties. Alternatively it is simply named\n‘dispositionalism’. The strongest version of\ndispositionalism is pan-dispositionalism which says that all\nproperties in the broadest sense of ‘property’ have\ndispositional essences. But many philosophers hold a more nuanced\nposition like Bird’s pure power theory which says that all sparse\nproperties in Lewis (1986)’s sense—or, in Bird’s own terms, all\nfundamental ontic properties—have dispositional essences. \nThe dispositionalist holds that the essence of a property \\(P\\) is\nwholly constituted by the nomic or causal roles \\(P\\) plays—for\nshort, theoretical roles. Here the nomic role of \\(P\\) is given in\nterms of the Ramsey sentence that we can get from a true and complete\nfinal theory, a sentence that represents the totality of the factual\ncontent of the theory. The causal role of \\(P\\), on the other hand, is\ngiven in terms of its potential causes and effects.  Dispositionalism\nthus implies the following transworld identity condition for\nproperties: properties \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are identical iff they play the\nsame theoretical roles. (This identity condition smacks of circularity\nsince theoretical roles can be plausibly considered as high-order\ndispositional properties. This issue is discussed in detail in \n Appendix.)\nNote that the theoretical roles played by a property \\(P\\) determine\nhow its instances are disposed to act or react under various\ncircumstances. On dispositionalism, therefore, \\(P\\) invariably endows\nits instances with the same dispositions, in which sense\ndispositionalism implies that properties have dispositional\nessences—and only dispositional essences. \nThe main impetus behind dispositionalism is the discontent\nphilosophers have with the categoricalist’s doctrine that the essence\nof a property doesn’t have to do with what its instances are disposed\nto do under various circumstances. Categoricalism—also known as\ncategorical monism—is the position that all properties, or at\nleast all sparse properties are categorical properties, which serves\nto underpin the traditional Humean metaphysic that asserts that worlds\ncan be characterised in terms of their complete histories of\ninstantiations of categorical properties (Lewis\n1986, p. 162; Mumford 2006, p. 471; Williams 2011). \nA famous argument for categoricalism due to Armstrong (1997, p. 79) is\nthat dispositions are Meinongian—or, in\nHandfield’s (2005) terms, dispositions are modally inverted. Suppose\nthat a fragile glass \\(x\\) doesn’t break.\nBut \\(x\\) is fragile inasmuch as it would break in\nresponse to being struck under suitable conditions. If\nso, \\(x\\)’s being fragile has within itself, essentially, an\nimplicit reference to the manifestation, namely, the event of\nbreaking, that didn’t occur. That is, it points to an entirely\ncounterfactual state of affair, in which sense the\nproperty of fragility is at least partly ‘hypothetical’.\nArmstrong takes it that this consequence is a version of\nMeinongianism, a metaphysical position that accepts an overly generous\nontology including non-existent entities, which he finds obnoxious\n(see Handfield 2008a for an attempt to get around this objection).\nArmstrong goes on to offer what he calls an irenic or soft\ndeflationist doctrine of dispositional properties. On this view, we\ncan account for the truth-makers of disposition ascriptions in terms\nof categorical properties and laws of nature. Thus understood, to say\nthat \\(x\\) is fragile is not to ascribe a real property\nto \\(x\\). Rather, it is an abbreviated way of saying that,\ngiven laws of nature, from \\(x\\)’s being struck, we can\ninfer that \\(x\\) would break. On Armstrong’s view, we do not\nuse dispositional terms to describe irreducibly dispositional states\nof affairs. Rather, they are merely convenient ways of talking\nabout categorical properties. \nArmstrong implicitly assumes that categorical properties are\nnon-Meinongian. This brings under the spotlight the question of how to\ncharacterise the essences of categorical properties in a way that\nrenders them non-Meinongian. Towards this end, most categoricalists\nincluding Armstrong subscribe to quidditism, according\nto which the essence of a property is constituted by its internal or\nself-contained nature, that is, what is called quiddity,\nthat is only contingently related to the specific theoretical roles it\nplays (Armstrong 1989, 1997; Lewis 2009). (Despite this move,\nHandfield (2005) criticises, Armstrong is still susceptible to the\n‘Meinongianism objection’ as his nomic necessitation\nrelation \\(N\\) is constituted by a relation\nto counterfactual states of affairs.) Armstrong\n(1997, p. 80) thus says, ‘properties are self-contained things,\nkeeping themselves to themselves, not pointing beyond themselves to\nfurther effects brought about in virtue of such properties’.\nThen what exactly is this internal or self-contained nature? Given\nthat theoretical roles are ruled out as being merely contingently\nrelated to it, there seems to be very little to be said about it. Thus\nBlack (2000, p. 91) says that, according to Lewis who accepts\nquidditism, ‘Just about all there is to a Humean fundamental\nquality is its identity with itself and its distinctness from other\nqualities’. On quidditism, the essence of a property\nputs no constraint whatsoever on how its instances\nare disposed to act or react under various circumstances. This is why\nquidditism goes along with categoricalism which asserts that\nproperties have no dispositional essences. \nQuidditism is to properties what haecceitism is to individuals.\nHaecceitism famously implies a theory\nof primitive identity of individuals across\npossible worlds. Likewise, quidditism implies a theory\nof primitive transworld identity of properties\nwhich asserts that two properties are identical iff they are\nquiddistically the same, regardless of their theoretical roles (Black\n2000; Whittle 2006; Lewis 2009). This being the case, a property could\nconfer upon its instances completely different causal or nomic powers\nthan it actually does but nonetheless continue to be the same property\nas it actually is so long as it remains quiddistically the same. The\ncausal or nomic profile of a property is thus a merely contingent\nmatter. (Schaffer (2005) points out that this\n‘contingentism’ is not necessarily paired with quidditism:\n‘anti-quiddistic contingentism’ is a respectable\nposition.) \nQuidditism therefore implies that laws of nature\nare metaphysically contingent, for, for any class of\nproperties, there seems to be nothing standing in the way of either\nthe possibility that they are bound up with each other by laws of\nnature or the possibility that they are not related at all to each\nother by any laws of nature. A consequence of quidditism is therefore\nthat although, for instance, colour properties and mass properties are\nnot actually linked with each other by any laws, they could have been\nso linked. Laws of nature are therefore a contingent matter. Some\nquidditists may go further to say that laws of nature are a type of\nregularity among property instances (Ramsey 1978; Lewis 1973; Earman\n1984). Others may suggest that laws of nature are nomic necessitation\nrelations between universals (Armstrong 1983; Dretske 1977; Tooley\n1977). \nDispositionalism is a stark contrast to categoricalism, maintaining\nthat all properties have dispositional essences. The dispositionalist\ncharges that the categoricalist’s appeal to the internal or\nself-contained nature of a property as its essence\nis unintelligible unless it is somehow related to\nthe causal or nomic powers of its instances. On dispositionalism, as\nnoted earlier, a given property endows all of its instances with the\nsame dispositions, no matter what circumstances they are situated in.\nDispositionalism then necessitates a diametrically opposing view of\nlaws of nature to the one necessitated by categoricalism—more\nto the point, the one necessitated by quidditism. Because the property\nof being negatively charged has the essence characterised in terms of\nthe disposition to attract positively charged particles and repel\nnegatively charged particles, on dispositionalism, all negatively\ncharged particles are necessarily so disposed. This entails that\nCoulomb’s law, which describes how charged particles interact with one\nanother, is metaphysically necessary (see Corry 2011 for\na criticism of this reasoning). In general, the dispositionalist\ntypically maintains what Hildebrand (2014) calls ‘Descriptive\nNon-Humeanism’, the view that laws of nature are just universal\ndescriptions of dispositional essences of properties; and they are\nmetaphysically necessary because their truth is ensured by the\ndispositional essences of relevant properties in all the possible\nworlds where those relevant properties exist. (This point is made by\nSwoyer (1982), Ellis (2001), Kistler (2002), and Bird (2005a, 2007a);\nsee Mumford 2004 for the claim that dispositionalism obviates the need\nfor laws and see Bird 2007a, chapter 9 for a criticism of this claim;\nsee Chalmers 1999 and Fine 2002 for the claim that some of natural\nnecessities, e.g., conservation laws, cannot be accounted for by\ndispositionalism.) Dispositionalism is hoped to provide a\ncomprehensive and unified metaphysical grounding for natural\nmodalities in general that may serve as an alternative to Humeanism.\nFor some attempts at it, see Williams & Borghini 2008, Martin\n2008, Jacobs 2010. Handfield (2008a) does not take dispositionalism\nand Humeanism as incompatible and explores the possibility of\ncombining them to construct what he calls ‘Humean\ndispositionalism’. Simpson (2017), however, criticises this combination as being half-baked. \nCategoricalism and dispositionalism are two extremes of a large\nspectrum of possible positions on the essences of properties. For\ninstance, philosophers like Swoyer (1982), Ellis & Lierse (1994),\nEllis (1999, 2001, 2010), and Molnar (2003) maintain that some\nproperties are essentially dispositional but others, most notably\nspatio-temporal properties, are not, in which sense they are\ndispositional essentialists but not dispositionalists. Another\nalternative that has lately gained considerable ground is what is\ncalled the ‘powerful qualities view’. The view is that\nevery property is in some sense both dispositional and qualitative\n(Here ‘qualitative’ is used interchangeably with\n‘categorical’). It was pioneered by Martin and Heil\n(Armstrong, Martin & Place 1996; Martin 1997; Martin & Heil\n1999; Heil 2003, 2005) and further developed by Engelhard (2010),\nJacobs (2011), Ingthorsson (2013), Carruth (2016), and Taylor\n(2018a, 2018b). A big challenge for this view is to\ngive a satisfactory account of exactly how one and the same property\nis both dispositional and qualitative (Armstrong 2005). A popular\nresponse to this challenge is that “the qualitative and\ndispositional are identical with one another and with the unitary\nintrinsic property itself” (Martin 2008, p. 65). However, given\nthat there is a strong inclination to think that the dispositional\nnature of a property is distinct from, if not incompatible with, its\nqualitative nature, there is no doubt that more details are needed in\norder to render this view a fully respectable competitor. Some\nattempts at it have been made by Jacobs (2011), Ingthorsson (2013),\nand Taylor (2018b). \nNotwithstanding this profusion of possible positions to be taken,\nhowever, categoricalism and dispositionalism have been the focus of\ndiscussion in the literature. For some of the criticisms and arguments\ndispositionalists and categoricalists have traded, see the  \n Appendix on Quiddistically Different Worlds, Irremediable Ignorance, and Regress of Powers.\n  \nThe causal basis for \\(x\\)’s disposition is something\nlike \\(x\\)’s microstructural property that is or would be\ncausally responsible for the manifestation of that disposition. It\nwill be helpful to have in hand a characterisation of ‘causal\nbasis’ that is more perspicuous than this. In their seminal\npaper on dispositions, Prior, Pargetter & Jackson (1982) offer the\nfollowing definition (p. 251): \nPPJ. \nA causal basis for disposition \\(D\\) is the property or\nproperty-complex that, together with the characteristic stimulus\nof \\(D\\), is a causally operative sufficient condition for the\ncharacteristic manifestation of \\(D\\) in the case of\n“surefire” dispositions, and in the case of probabilistic\ndispositions is causally sufficient for the relevant chance of the\nmanifestation. \nWe will not here consider cases of probabilistic dispositions; the\n‘surefire’ or deterministic cases are difficult enough. A\nclarification is needed of the concept of causally operative\nsufficient condition. One thing we can say for sure about it is that a\ncondition is causally operative sufficient for some\neffect only if, given the laws of nature, whenever the condition is\npresent it is causally necessary that the effect\noccurs. PPJ then entails the following account\nof causal basis: a causal basis for \\(D\\) is a property\nor property-complex \\(P\\) such that, given the laws of\nnature, whenever an\nobject \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) and undergoes the\ncharacteristic stimulus of \\(D\\), it is causally necessary\nthat \\(x\\) exhibits the characteristic manifestation\nof \\(D\\). Nolan (2015) suggests that a link between the\ncharacteristic stimulus and manifestation of \\(D\\) doesn’t need\nto be a causal one, and then criticises PPJ on the ground\nthat it presupposes such a causal link. (For another criticism\nof PPJ, see Contessa 2012.) \nPPJ is not the only way to characterise the notion of\ncausal basis. Lewis (1997), for example, derives an alternative\ncharacterisation of causal basis from RCA, as pointed\nout by Hauska (2008a). The causal basis for \\(D\\) is\nthen approximately defined as an intrinsic\nproperty \\(P\\) that would cause \\(x\\) to\nmanifest \\(D\\) if \\(x\\) were to be\nexposed to the stimulus condition and, at the same\ntime, \\(x\\) were to retain \\(P\\) for a\nsufficient time. (For still alternative characterisations of causal\nbasis, see Mackie 1977, Johnston 1992, McKitrick 2003b, and Molnar\n2003.) \nNote that PPJ and Lewis’s characterisation both\nleave it an open question whether the causal bases for a disposition\nneed be categorical properties, or instead a disposition might have a\ndisposition as a causal basis. Also it leaves it an open question\nwhether a disposition could serve as a causal basis for itself or not.\nThese open questions are the topic of the upcoming sections. \nBased dispositions are dispositions with causal bases that\nare distinct from the dispositions themselves.\nAssuming that the glass’s microstructural property is a causal basis\nfor and is distinct from its fragility, its fragility is a based\ndisposition. As noted earlier, the possibility that a disposition\nserves as a causal basis for itself is not ruled\nout by the definitions of causal basis like PPJ or\nLewis’s, in which case, the disposition is not a based disposition as\nit is not distinct from its causal basis. The\nrequirement that a disposition be distinct from its causal basis\nshould be carefully understood: it should not be interpreted to rule\nout causal bases that are only contingently identical to\nthe corresponding dispositions. Based dispositions are dispositions\nwith causal bases that are\nnot necessarily identical to the dispositions\nthemselves, in which sense they have distinct causal bases. When a\ndisposition serves as a causal basis for itself, it is necessarily\nidentical to its causal basis, which entails that it is not a based\ndisposition. It might be thought, though, that a based disposition is\ncontingently identical to its causal basis. In fact, Armstrong\n(Armstrong, Martin & Place 1996) is well known for his claim that\nall based dispositions are contingently identical to their bases (cf.\nsee\n section 4.2\n below). Bare dispositions\nare baseless dispositions, which means that they\nare dispositions with no distinct causal bases (McKitrick 2003b). See\nJohnston 1992, Smith & Stoljar 1998, and Williams 2011 for\ndifferent definitions of bare disposition. \nThe categoricalist maintains it is categorical properties that we\ntruly attribute to \\(x\\) when we apparently talk\nabout \\(x\\)’s dispositions. What are those categorical\nproperties? To this question, the categoricalist typically suggests\nthat they are categorical causal bases, which rests on\nthe assumption that all dispositions (more precisely, all of what we\napparently consider as dispositions) must have categorical properties\nas causal bases. This is why the categoricalist is typically inclined\nto deny the possibility of bare dispositions. Conversely, the\ndispositionalist is not similarly pressed to say that dispositions\nmust have causal bases, or at least, that all dispositions must have\ndistinct causal bases. For this reason, some dispositionalists leave\nit an open question whether bare dispositions are possible or not but\nmost of them, finding unattractive the idea of dispositions all the\nway down, go further to affirm the possibility of bare dispositions\n(McKitrick 2003b; Mumford 2006; Ellis 2001, 2002; Molnar 1999, 2003).\nInvestigating the possibility of bare dispositions thus bears major\nsignificance for the debate between dispositionalism and\ncategoricalism. \nPrior et al. provide one important argument for the thesis that,\nnecessarily, every disposition has a causal basis—a thesis they\nlabel the ‘Causal Thesis’. Putting the case of\nprobabilistic dispositions aside, they consider an\nobject \\(A\\) that is subject to knocking in a\ndeterministic world. They argue (pp. 251–252): \n[I]t will be either determined that \\(A\\) breaks, or\nthat \\(A\\) does not break. In the latter case\nclearly \\(A\\) is not fragile. In the former there will be a\ncausally sufficient antecedent condition operative in producing the\nbreaking—that follows from Determinism. Hence\nif \\(A\\) is fragile and Determinism is true, there must\nbe a causal basis. \nThis argument itself, if successful, doesn’t show that dispositions\nmust have distinct causal bases. It is consistent\nwith the causal basis for a disposition being identical with the\ndisposition itself. As we will see in\n section 4.2,\n however, Prior et al. do have at hand separate arguments for the\nthesis that dispositions are distinct from their causal bases. Taken\ntogether, these arguments will show the impossibility of bare\ndispositions. (See Hauska 2008a and Nolan 2015 for a criticism of\nPrior et al.’s argument.) \nSmith and Stoljar (1998) argue that the proponent of the possibility\nof bare dispositions is committed to there being relations of\n‘bare similarity’ holding between possible worlds, which\nthey take as unacceptable. McKitrick (2003b) argues in response,\nfirst, that Smith and Stoljar do not succeed in showing that the\ncommitment to bare similarity follows from the possibility of bare\ndispositions, and, second, that even if it did then this would not be\nnearly as problematic as they take it to be. If one has already\naccepted that there might be bare dispositions then, McKitrick\nsuggests, one should not be uncomfortable with the idea that there\ncould be ‘barely similar’ possible worlds. \nSo much for arguments in favour of the impossibility of bare\ndispositions. A strong argument for the possibility\nof bare dispositions begins with the thought that fundamental\nproperties like spin, electric charge, etc., are all dispositional.\nThis observation is put together with the assumption that, to the\nextent to which subatomic particles like leptons and quarks are\nfundamental, they cannot have any constituting parts. This assumption\nseems to be supported by experimental results in physics, showing that\nfundamental particles behave like point-like, structureless particles\n(Molnar 1999, 2003). But it entails that their dispositions cannot be\ngrounded by the properties of their constituting parts. This seems to\nlead to the conclusion that dispositional properties of fundamental\nparticles are bare dispositions, lacking any distinct causal bases\n(Harré & Madden 1975; Blackburn 1990; Ellis & Lierse\n1994; Ellis 2001, 2002; Molnar 1999, 2003; McKitrick 2003b; the most\npowerful elaboration of this argument is given by Mumford 2006). \nThis argument is meant to prove more than needed\nfor the refutation of categoricalism. Given that categoricalism\nentails the impossibility of bare dispositions, establishing the mere\npossibility of bare dispositions will suffice for refuting\ncategoricalism. But the argument at hand, if successful, would\ndemonstrate that fundamental properties are bare dispositions,\nentailing that bare dispositions do actually exist. \nWhat should we make of this argument? Williams (2009, 2011) conducts\nan instructive discussion of it, where he, following Ellis and Lierse,\nlabels it the ‘argument from science’—Mumford (2006)\nnames it the ‘ungrounded argument’. He points out that it\nis ‘not just one argument, but a small, close-knit family of\narguments’. The specific argument we presented earlier is most\nsimilar to what he calls the indirect ‘structureless’\nversion, which he takes as the most common among versions of the\nargument from science. Williams’s worry about it is that what follows\nfrom the reasonable assumption that fundamental particles do not have\nconstituting parts is not that their dispositions are in no way\ngrounded but that their dispositions are not grounded via\ncompositional structure. On his view, it is still an open possibility\nto the categoricalist that their dispositions are grounded via\nsupervenient structure, meaning that dispositions of a\nsubatomic particle supervene upon categorical properties of the\nparticle itself. \nIn response, it might be thought that subatomic particles\nare entirely characterised in terms of dispositions\nlike spin and electric charge, and therefore that they possess no\ncategorical properties on which their dispositions would supervene, in\nwhich case the possibility of grounding via supervenient structure is\nblocked. Williams (2009, p. 13) retorts, though, that the reason why\nphysicists speak only in terms of dispositions when they describe\nsubatomic particles is merely that the only means\nthey have to investigate subatomic particles is to ‘poke and\nprod at them with bombardments, and see how they react’ (For a\nsimilar point, see Strawson 1980; Blackburn 1990; Jackson 1998;\nLangton 1998; Hawthorne 2002; Lewis 2009). But this is not to say that\nthey, as a matter of fact, have no categorical properties at all. In\nfact, we have, Williams continues to argue, good metaphysical reasons\nfor attributing categorical properties to subatomic particles. \nWe have thus far seen that there is an ongoing debate regarding the\nthesis that all dispositions have distinct causal\nbases. But philosophers are in wide agreement with respect to a weaker\nthesis that at least some dispositions have\ndistinct causal bases. This weak thesis, however, already raises an\ninteresting question concerning\nthe relation between dispositions and their causal\nbases, to which we turn in the next section. \nViews about the relation between dispositions and their causal bases\nmirror views about the relation between mental and physical\nproperties. Armstrong, Martin & Place (1996) and Mackie (1973,\n1977) defend a ‘type-identity theory’ according to which\nany disposition is identical with its causal basis. Mumford (1998)\ndefends a ‘token-identity theory’ according to which any\ninstance of a disposition is identical with an instance of its causal\nbasis. Prior—together with Pargetter and Jackson—defends a\n‘functionalist theory’ according to which a disposition is\na second-order property of having some causal basis or other. There\nare other views too, but we will confine discussion here to the three\nmentioned above. \nArmstrong (Armstrong, Martin & Place 1996, chapter 3) puts forward\none argument for the identity of dispositions with their causal bases\nthat basically goes as follows: since dispositions are by definition\nproperties that play certain causal roles, and since in fact their\ncausal bases are what play those roles, it follows that dispositions\nare in fact identical with their causal bases. Armstrong claims that\nhis identification of dispositions with their causal bases is a\n‘contingent identification’ (Armstrong et al. 1996, p. 39): As a matter of fact the property that\nplays the brittleness role is such-and-such, but it might have been a\ndifferent property that played that role; if so, brittleness would\nhave been identical with that different property. This feature of\nArmstrong’s view exposes it to Prior et al.’s (1982) argument from\nrigid designation. Following Kripke, Prior et al. take names of\nproperties to be ‘rigid designators’, referring to the\nsame property in every possible world (in which that property exists).\nAs Kripke (1972) demonstrates,\nif \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rigid designators\nthen the identity\nstatement \\(a = b\\) is necessarily true\nif it is true at all. So on the assumption that, for example,\n‘brittleness’ and ‘microstructural property\nso-and-so’ are rigid designators, the possibility that the\ncausal basis for brittleness might have been something other than\nmicrostructural property so-and-so shows that brittleness is not\nidentical with microstructural property so-and-so. (See McKitrick\n2003b for a reply to this argument. For additional arguments against\nArmstrong’s view, see Prior et al. 1982 and Prior 1985; for\ndiscussions on them, see Mumford 1998, chapter 5 and McKitrick\n2003b.) \nOpposing the identity of dispositions with their causal bases, Prior\net al. present arguments for what they call the ‘Distinctness\nThesis’. One of them is the argument from rigid designation,\nwhich we have just discussed. Another springs from the possibility of\nmultiple realization of dispositions. Different fragile objects, for\nexample, have different causal bases—some are fragile in virtue\nof their irregular atomic structure, some are fragile in virtue of\ntheir weak intermolecular bonding. This seems to serve as evidence for\nthe Distinctness Thesis. Why? If dispositions were identified with\ntheir causal bases, we will end up having to say that diverse causal\nbases of fragility are identical to each other. But they\nare, ex hypothesi, distinct from each other. And so\nPrior et al. argue that the multiple realizability of dispositions\nprovides a reductio basis for the Distinctness\nThesis. \nMumford (1998, chapter 7) endorses this argument when it is construed\nas an argument against the ‘type-type’ identification of\ndispositions with their bases that Armstrong defends. But Mumford\ntakes a strategy familiar from the philosophy of mind and maintains\nthat Prior et al.’s argument does not defeat his own\n‘token-token’ identification. According to Mumford,\nalthough in general dispositions are not identical with their bases,\neach instance of a disposition is identical with an\ninstance of its causal basis. Anticipating Mumford’s\nresponse, Prior (1985) complains that it is not at all clear what can\nbe meant by ‘property instance’ if, as Mumford maintains,\nan object’s instance of property \\(A\\) can be the very\nsame thing as its instance of property \\(B\\), even though\nproperty \\(A\\) is not the same as\nproperty \\(B\\). Even if we grant the intelligibility of such\na notion of property instance, however, might not the very same\nargument from rigid designation show that instances of dispositions\ncannot be identical with instances of their bases, any more than\ndispositions themselves can be identical with their bases? Such would\nseem to be the appropriate lesson to draw from the fact that Kripke’s\noriginal version of the argument, aimed against identity theories in\nphilosophy of mind, applies as much to token-token as to type-type\nversions of the identity theory. Mumford disagrees (p. 157), although\nhe says little to substantiate his disagreement. (See Rives 2005 for\nanother objection to Mumford.) \nIn the preceding paragraphs, we have canvassed Prior et al.’s\narguments for their Distinctness Thesis. Using these arguments as a\nstepping stone, Prior (1985, chapter 7) and Jackson (1998) advance the\nfunctionalist view that disposition \\(D\\) is a\nsecond-order property, the property of having some first-order\nproperty or other that plays the causal role corresponding\nto \\(D\\). It seems to be a consequence of this view that\ndispositions do no causal work (see\n section 6\n below). For if having, say, the property of fragility is a matter of\nhaving a first-order property that plays the causal role\nassociated with fragility, then it would seem that it is this\nfirst-order property, not the second-order property, that does all\ncausal work. It would seem, then, that the functionalist view is open\nto the objection that it predicts dispositions to be ‘causally\nsuperfluous’ in a way that, intuitively, they are not. (See\nMumford 1998; Martin & Heil 1999; Heil 2003, 2005 for this\nobjection, and see\n section 6\n below for further discussion.) \nThe Intrinsic Dispositions Thesis (for short, IDT), the thesis that\ndispositions are intrinsic properties of their bearers, has been\nroutinely accepted by many philosophers like Harré (1970),\nArmstrong (1973), Mellor (1974), Mackie (1977), Bird (1998), Molnar\n(2003), Choi (2005b), and Menzies (2009). Accepting it, Lewis (1997)\nsays, ‘if two things (actual or merely possible) are exact\nintrinsic duplicates (and if they are subject to the same laws of\nnature) then they are disposed alike’ (p. 147). Lewis’s\nqualification about the laws of nature is important, at least for\nthose who take the laws to be contingent, for without it IDT is\nscarcely plausible. If the laws are contingent then a fragile glass\nhas intrinsic duplicates that are not disposed to break when struck.\nSome of them will inhabit possible worlds whose laws of nature\ndetermine that, if struck, they would experience a gentle deformation\ntemporarily and then regain its original shape. IDT, therefore, should\nbe understood as the thesis that within any sphere of worlds with the\nsame laws of nature, any pair of objects with the same intrinsic\nproperties will have the same dispositions. (For discussion of the\nprecise meaning of the intrinsicness of dispositions, see Langton\n& Lewis 1998; Choi 2009; and Handfield 2009.) \nWidely accepted as it is, however, IDT is not obviously true.\nShoemaker (1980) considers a key’s disposition to open his front door\nand points out that it could lose this disposition without undergoing\nany intrinsic change, for example, by the lock on his door being\nreplaced by one of a different kind. It would seem, then, that the\ndisposition to open Shoemaker’s front door is not an intrinsic\nproperty of the key, and so IDT is false. \nThis apparent counterexample can be resisted, however. The only\nrelevant disposition possessed by Shoemaker’s key, it might be\ninsisted, is the disposition to open locks of a\ncertain type—the type of lock that is currently on\nShoemaker’s front door. Since a change in the lock will not cause the\nkey to lose this disposition, it is an intrinsic disposition—or\nat least the present example does not show that it is not intrinsic.\nAccording to this response, the predicate ‘disposed to open\nShoemaker’s front door’ either fails to express a genuine\nproperty at all—this is Shoemaker’s view—or else it\nsomehow manages to express the intrinsic disposition to open locks of\na certain type (Molnar 2003). McKitrick (2003a), however, argues that\nthis response fails. She goes further to argue that there are indeed\nmany cases of extrinsic dispositions, listing as\nexamples weight (a case borrowed from Yablo\n1999), vulnerability, visibility and recognizability.\nIn light of these examples, it seems hard to dismiss the\ncounterexamples to IDT as concerning spurious dispositions. \nIt is worth recalling that Lewis (1997) assumed IDT with a view to\nbolstering Martin’s counterexamples to SCA. But it has\ncome to light that IDT is false. Does this necessitate that Lewis\nfails to bolster Martin’s counterexamples? Choi (2009) answers this\nquestion in the affirmative. \nSome philosophers have said that dispositions\nare not causes of, or causally explanatory of,\ntheir manifestations. Why? Their thought can be encapsulated by\nMolière famous quip, in Le Malade Imaginaire,\nthat a philosopher might explain why opium puts people to sleep by\nmentioning the fact that it has a ‘dormitive virtue’. The\npoint, of course, is that this is no explanation or, if it is, it is\nnot a good explanation. To have a dormitive virtue, it seems, is just\nto have a property that puts people to sleep, and that fact tells us\nonly a little, if anything, about why substances\nwith that property put people to sleep. In general, \\(x\\)’s\npossession of a disposition \\(D\\)\nconceptually necessitates \\(x\\)’s manifesting\n\\(D\\) under a suitable condition, and conceptual necessitation is\nnot a kind of causal or explanatory connection. This is what McKitrick\n(2004, 2005) names the ‘analyticity argument’ for the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions. Arguments of this kind have been\nbrought forth by Mackie (1973, 1977), Armstrong (1968), Block (1990),\nand Jackson (1995, 1996). \nThere is another type of argument. Prior et al. (1982) argue that the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions is a consequence of the Causal\nThesis and the Distinctness Thesis combined (see\n section 4\n above): \nBy the Causal Thesis, any disposition (and thus fragility) must have a\ncausal basis. This causal basis is a sufficient causal explanation of\nthe breaking as far as the properties of the object are\nconcerned. But then there is nothing left for any other\nproperties of the object to do. By the Distinctness Thesis the\ndisposition is one of these other properties, ergo\nthe disposition does nothing. (p. 255) \nThis argument is akin to ‘exclusion arguments’ advanced\nby, for instance, Block (1990) and Kim (1990, 1998) to deny the causal\nefficacy of mental properties. See Yablo 1992 for an objection to the\nexclusion argument, to the effect that a mental event is ‘better\nqualified than its physical basis for the role of cause’ (p.\n279). \nPrior et al. point out that their argument assumes that a disposition\ncannot be an overdetermining cause of its manifestation,\nmore generally, that no event can have two ‘operative’\nsufficient conditions (see also Jackson 1998, p. 202).\nSince, ex hypothesi, it is the causal basis for the\ndisposition that is the operative sufficient\ncondition for its manifestation, the disposition itself, even though\nits possession is sufficient in the circumstances for the\nmanifestation, is an inoperative sufficient condition,\nand so is not a cause. Schaffer (2003), however, argues that cases of\noverdetermining causes in Prior et al.’s sense are not just possible\nbut, as a matter of fact, routine. In his view, they must be modeled\nafter ubiquitous cases of quantitative overdetermination where\n‘the cause is decomposable into distinct and independently\nsufficient parts’: when one big round rock hits a window, it has\ntwo hemispheres that quantitatively overdetermine the breaking of the\nwindow. If Schaffer is right, then Prior et al.’s argument for the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions is defused. (See Rives 2005 for a\ndifferent formulation of the argument that doesn’t assume that a\ndisposition cannot be an overdetermining cause of\nits manifestation.) \nWe have surveyed two salient arguments for the causal inefficacy of\ndispositions. Note that they, to be successful, would have to be\naccompanied by an account of what causal efficacy is,\nand the large literature on causal efficacy attests to the difficulty\nof complying with this demand. McKitrick (2005) surveys several of the\nexisting accounts of causal efficacy—or, in her terms, causal\nrelevance—and argues that the most plausible of these give us no\nclear reason for thinking that dispositions are causally irrelevant to\ntheir manifestations.","contact.mail":"plxsc506@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
