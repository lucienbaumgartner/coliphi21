While he is in some respects a very\northodox Cartesian, Cordemoy was the only Cartesian to embrace\natomism, and one of the first to argue for occasionalism. Though a\nlawyer by profession, Cordemoy was a prominent figure in Parisian\nphilosophical circles. His two most important works are Le\nDiscernement du corps et de l’âme (1666) and\nhis Discours physique de la parole (1668). In the former he\ndefends atomism, mechanism, occasionalism, and dualism; the latter is\na study of the nature of speech.\n\n\n\nGéraud (or Gerauld) de Cordemoy was born in October of 1626,\nthe son of a University of Paris professor. He was the third of four\nchildren born to Géraud and Nicole de Cordemoy, and the only\nson. His father died when he was nine years old, and other than this,\nalmost nothing is known of Cordemoy’s early years. While there is not a\nrecord of the date of his marriage (to Marie de Chazelles), the first\nof his five children is known to have been born on December 7, 1651,\nwhen Cordemoy was twenty-five. \n\nCordemoy earned a living as a lawyer, but was very active in\nParisian philosophical circles. He attended various philosophy salons,\nand was acquainted with the Minim Emmanuel Maignan and the physicist\nJacques Rohault, both organizers of philosophical conferences. In 1664,\nCordemoy’s essay Discours de l’áction des corps (A Discourse\non the action of bodies) was included, along with a discourse by\nRohault, in the posthumous publication of Descartes’ Le Monde (The\nWorld) by Claude Clerselier. That essay would later become the\nsecond of the six discourses which make up one of Cordemoy’s two most\nimportant works, Le Discernement du corps et de l’âme en six\ndiscours pour servir à l’éclaircissement de la physique\n(The Distinction of the body and the soul in six discourses, in order\nto be useful for the clarification of physics) (1666). In this\nwork, Cordemoy presents his atomism, his arguments for occasionalism,\nand his accounts of the distinction of and the interaction between the\nmind and the body. \n\nCordemoy’s other important work, the Discours physique de la\nparole (A Physical discourse on speech), appeared in 1668, as did\nhis Copie d’une lettre ecrite à un sçavant religieux de la\nCompagnie de Jésus (A Copy of a letter written to a learned\nreligious of the Company of Jesus). The latter is Cordemoy’s\nattempt to reconcile Cartesian philosophy with the story of creation as\nfound in the Book of Genesis. The former is an account of speech\nproduction, and its popularity led to Cordemoy’s being recognized as\none of the more important French philosophers of his time. He was even\nthe model for the character of the Master of Philosophy in\nMolière’s play Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. \n\nOther, shorter works by Cordemoy include his Traitez de\nMetaphysique (Treatise on Metaphysics) and his Traitez sur\nl’Histoire et la Politique (Treatise on History and Politics). At\nthe time of his death, Cordemoy was working on a history of France,\nwhich would be completed by his eldest son Louis-Géraud and\nwhich appeared in two volumes, in 1685 and 1689. In addition to his\nphilosophical and historical publications, Cordemoy served briefly as\nthe director of l’Academie Français (having been\nelected a member in 1675) and was for a time the tutor to the Dauphin,\nthe future King Louis XV. Shortly after his 58th birthday,\nCordemoy suffered a brief illness and died, on October 15, 1684. \n\nDescartes had held that the essence of body is extension, and that as\na result matter can be divided without end. If it is the nature of a\nbody to take up space in three dimensions, that is, to have width,\nlength, and height, then we can always conceive of that width, length,\nor height being divided. Further, according to Cartesian metaphysics,\nextension is the principle attribute of body, and as such cannot exist\nindependently of body (nor can body exist independently of it). Thus\naccording to Descartes, anywhere there is extended space, there is\nbody occupying that space, making the existence of a void\nimpossible. And so it is surprising to find Cordemoy, whose\nmetaphysics is in most other respects quite Cartesian, arguing at the\nbeginning of the Discernement for the existence of both\nindivisible atoms and empty space. \n\nThe First Discourse of the Discernement opens with five\nclaims about bodies which lay the ground for Cordemoy’s physics (which\nhe goes on to discuss in Discourses Two and Three). He tells us that\nbodies are: (1) limited in their extension, and this limit is called\nthe ‘figure’ of the body; (2) inasmuch as each body is a\nsubstance, bodies are not divisible into smaller bodies, nor are bodies\npenetrable by other bodies; (3) the relation a body has to other bodies\nis called its ‘place’; (4) a change in this relation is the\nmotion of the body; and (5) when the relation continues unchanged, the\nbody is at rest. Cordemoy then declares that matter is clearly and\ndistinctly understood as an assembly of bodies. Properly considered,\nbodies are parts of matter, and depending how these bodies are related\nto each other determines what sort of portion of matter the collection\nis: if they are very near each other, it is a heap (un tas);\nif they are “changing their position incessantly” (1968,\n96), it is a fluid (une liqueur); and if the bodies are not\nmoving and cannot be separated from each other, it is a mass (une\nmasse). \n\nWhile not stated explicitly, Cordemoy’s reason for accepting atomism\nseems to be based on his understanding of the concept of substance.\nFollowing Descartes, Cordemoy takes substance to be that which requires\nnothing else for its existence. Strictly speaking, this would make God\nthe only substance, but in the created world, Descartes held that we\nmay consider minds and body to be substances in a qualified sense. Each\nof these substances has a principle attribute distinguishable from it\nonly by reason. It is this attribute through which we conceive the\nsubstance, and it is that to which all of the substance’s other\nproperties are referred. For minds this attribute is thought, and for\nbody it is, as mentioned above, extension. \n\nWith regard to body, Cordemoy warns that we must be careful to avoid\nthe mistake made by other Cartesians, who have conflated what are in\nfact two distinct things, namely, ‘bodies’ and\n‘matter’. The former are, according to Cordemoy, the true\nextended substances, while the latter are assemblages, or\ncollections, of the former. The key point is that as substances,\nbodies must be simple: if bodies had parts, they would depend on those\nparts to be what they are, and in this way the parts would threaten a\nbody’s very status as a substance. Thus we are led to atomism on\nstrictly a priori grounds: in positing bodies as substances, we are\nprecluded from attributing parts to them, for if we did, they would no\nlonger be substances. Matter on this account is divisible not because\nits nature is extension and any extension can always be divided, but\nrather because it is composed of bodies which can be separated from\neach other, though each one is itself indivisible. \n\nThe reason for this confusion between body and matter is due, says\nCordemoy, to an over-reliance on the senses: “we have a very\nclear idea of body, and as we know that they are extended substances,\nwithout thinking clearly we join this notion which we have of body to\nthat which we have of matter. Taking a mass for a body, we consider it\nas a substance, believing that all that we see is only the same\nextension. And because all that we see as extended is divisible, we\nthus join the notion of that which is extended to the notion of that\nwhich is divisible, such that we believe divisible all that is\nextended” (1968, 97). The bodies being too small to be perceived,\nwe can be misled into thinking that a collection of bodies, that is,\nmatter, is the true extended substance, and from matter’s divisibility\nwrongly conclude that material substance can therefore be divided. \n\nCordemoy also maintains the possibility of a void, that is, space\nwhich is truly empty, and as before, his argument is based on his\nunderstanding of the concept of substance. If we have three contiguous\nbodies and the one in the middle is destroyed in an instant, we will,\nCordemoy claims, be left with an empty space between the two remaining\nbodies (that is, the two would not instantaneously rush together).\nThese two bodies, being substances, possess a metaphysical\nindependence from what happens to other bodies. For Cordemoy, to hold\notherwise would disqualify bodies (atoms) from being substances, on\nhis understanding of the concept of substance. Likewise, if one could\nremove all of the matter filling a vase, the sides of the vase,\npace Descartes and others, would not collapse, according to\nCordemoy. The bodies that compose the sides are each themselves\nsubstances, and as such are ontologically independent of what happens\nto other bodies (for again, if they were not, they would not qualify\nas a substance). \n\nCordemoy concludes the First Discourse with a discussion of three\ninconveniens, problems with which Descartes’ plenum theory\nmust deal but which Cordemoy’s atomism escapes. The first involves a\ndistinction between two concepts, ‘indefinite’ and\n‘infinite’, which Cordemoy claims amount to the same\nthing: “When I ask [the Cartesians] if this substance, which\nthey believe to be divisible, is divisible to infinity, as it seems to\nme their supposition would give them to understand, they respond that\nit is not, but that it is divisible indefinitely. When I begged them\nto explain this indefinite division to me, I was led to understand it\nin the same way that the whole world understands the infinite”\n(1968, 99). Descartes was (usually) careful to distinguish between\nthat to which we cannot see or comprehend an end, which he termed\n‘indefinite’, and that which we know in a positive way to\nbe without limit, which he termed ‘infinite’. The\ndivisibility of matter is for Descartes indefinite, while only God can\nproperly be said to be infinite. Cordemoy’s complaint is that if\n‘indefinite’ and ‘infinite’ really amount to\nthe same thing—and he thinks according to the Cartesians’ own\naccount they do—then “there is something\ninconceivable” (ibid.) in claiming that bodies are\ndivisible ad infinitum, since this would threaten their\nstatus as substances. (Clearly, though, this objection goes through\nonly given a prior acceptance of Cordemoy’s atomism.) \n\nThe second and third inconveniens both deal with Descartes\ntheory of the individuation of physical bodies. For Descartes, bodies\nare individuated in terms of motion: an individual body is that portion\nof matter which moves together, that is, which changes place with\nrespect to the bodies which are its neighbors. Cordemoy’s first\nquestion is how, on this account, can we individuate a body at rest:\n“According to their doctrine, we cannot conceive of a body at\nrest between other bodies, because supposing that it is touching them,\nthis doctrine teaches that together with them it makes only one body.\nYet it seems to me that we have a very clear and very natural idea of a\nbody perfectly at rest between other bodies, where nothing is in\nmotion, and what I say of each body accords perfectly well with this\nidea” (1968, 99). It is, then, our clear conception of a body at\nrest between other bodies but at the same time distinct from them which\nsignals trouble for the Cartesians theory. Cordemoy, on the other hand,\nfaces no such problem, since for him the only true physical\nindividuals are bodies/atoms; all other ‘bodies’ are rightly\ncalled matter, and are individuals only in a loose sense of the\nword. \n\nThe third problem raised by Cordemoy concerns a body which has its\ndifferent parts in motion in different directions, such as a tree and\nits branches being blown in the wind. According to Descartes’ own\ndefinition of a physical individual, we would seem to have a problem,\nsince the different parts are changing differently with respect to the\nother individuals which would be considered its neighbors. In such\ncases, it would seem to “follow that when neighboring bodies push\nit in different spots along opposing lines, they will divide it in as\nmany ways as it is pushed” (ibid.). As with the second\ncomplaint, this violates the clear idea we have of the object as one\nthing. And as before, Cordemoy notes that no such problem arises for\nhis atomism. \n\nCordemoy was, as mentioned previously, alone among Descartes’\nfollowers in his acceptance of atomism. One of his harshest critics was\nhis fellow Cartesian Dom Robert Desgabets, who accused Cordemoy of\ngiving ammunition to the enemies of Descartes, namely the Gassendists,\nthemselves atomists. Desgabets had been sent a copy of the\nDiscernement by Clerselier, and quickly responded to it with\nhis Lettre écrite a M. Clerselier touchant les nouveaux\nraisonnements pour les atomes et le vide contenus dans le livre du\ndiscernement du corps et de l’âme (A Letter written to M.\nClerselier concerning the new arguments for atoms and the void\ncontained in the book on the distinction of the body and the\nsoul). In addition to his accusation of betraying the true\nphilosophy, Desgabets defends the intelligibility of the\nindefinite/infinite distinction and offers several criticisms of\nCordemoy’s position. He notes that in Cartesian terms, as distance is a\nmode, it can only exist as a mode of a substance. Thus wherever we have\na distance, it must be a distance of something, and as\ndistance is expressed quantitatively, that something can always be\ndivided, even if only by God. The same line of thinking shows the\nimpossibility of the void: if it is claimed that between two points\nthere is only empty space, there is nothing there which could posses\nany properties, including length. So of what is the length between the\ntwo points a property? Cordemoy did not respond to Desgabets in print,\nbut the Benedictine would seem to have raised some important questions\nfor anyone holding atomism grounded upon a Cartesian metaphysics. \n\nCordemoy was one of the first, if not the first, to argue that\nCartesian metaphysics leads to occasionalism, the doctrine that God is\nthe one true cause active in the world. (Louis de La Forge’s\nTraité de l’esprit de l’homme et de ses facultez et\nfonctions, et de son union avec le corps (Treatise on the mind of man\nand its faculties and functions, and on its union with the body),\nwhich also argued for occasionalism on Cartesian grounds, appeared just\nmonths before the Discernement, though Cordemoy claims to have\naccepted occasionalism as early as 1658 (1968, 145). It is unlikely\nthat either Cordemoy or de La Forge influenced the other.) \n\nCordemoy’s argument for occasionalism with regard to body-body\ninteraction appears in the Fourth Discourse of the\nDiscernement (he will later expand his occasionalism to cover\nall ‘interaction’ in the created world). There we are given\na series of definitions and axioms, and conclusions derived from these.\nCordemoy begins by asserting as axioms (1) a thing does not have of\nitself (de soy) that which can be lost without ceasing to be\nwhat it is, and (2) bodies are able to lose their motion without\nceasing to be bodies. The conclusion drawn is that bodies do not have\nmotion of themselves (that is, they do not possess the property of\nmotion essentially), since they continue to be bodies when not in\nmotion. Nor can one body give motion to another. This is not stated as\none of Cordemoy’s axioms, but rather follows from Cartesian\nmetaphysics, which holds motion to be a mode or state of a body, and\nnot a quality distinct from the body. As such, a mode—that is,\nthe very same mode—cannot be transferred from one body to\nanother. \n\nAs for the first mover, it could not itself be a body, since if it\nwere, it would have to have motion of itself (for as first mover, where\nelse would it get it?), and this has been shown to be impossible for\nbodies. Thus we may also conclude that the first mover is not a body.\nBut there being only two kinds of substances (Cordemoy’s third axiom),\nbodies and minds, only a mind remains as a candidate for the first\nmover. Further, it is clear that our (finite) minds are not the source of motion\nin bodies. In the first place, our minds cannot effect our bodies in\ncertain ways, either because they are immune to such influence (e.g., I\ncannot will the cells in my liver to cease dividing) or because of old\nage or injury (e.g., a crippled man cannot will himself to walk).\nSecond—and noteworthy in that it anticipates both Malebranche and\nHume—if we restrict ourselves to what we observe, we never\nexperience a causal connection but only temporal succession between our\nvolitions at one moment and our body’s actions the next. Third, if we\ncould produce motion in bodies at will, it would, says Cordemoy, upset\nGod’s plan for the quantity of motion which God conserves in the world.\nThus he concludes that an infinite will must be the first mover.  It is Cordemoy’s fourth and fifth axioms which, together with this\nconclusion, get us occasionalism. The fourth axiom states that to move\nis an action, and the fifth claims that an action can only be\ncontinued by the agent which initiated it. Therefore, the mind which\ninitiates the motion of bodies, God, is the same agent who continues\ntheir motion in the present. As with those who fail to distinguish\nbodies from matter, the fault of those who posit finite causes are\nguilty of making an unsupported inference from their sense\nexperience. Making a point that Malebranche and Hume would later echo,\nCordemoy says: “When we say, for example, that body B drives\nbody A away from its place, if we examine well what is acknowledged\nfor certain in this case, we will only see that body B was moved, that\nit encountered C, which was at rest, and that since this encounter,\nthe first ceased to be moved [and] the second commenced to be\nmoved. But if we recognize that B gave some of its motion to C, that\nis truly only a prejudice which comes from what we do not see.”\nIn good Cartesian spirit, Cordemoy is claiming that it is reason which\npoints out the way the world must be, and that uncritical acceptance\nof the deliverances of the senses will only lead to error. \n\nLike Descartes’ Meditations, the Discernement\ncontains six sections, and also like the Meditations, it\nconcludes with discussions of the union of and the distinction between\nthe mind and the body (though while Cordemoy addresses them in this\norder, Descartes, in the 6th Meditation, first tackles the\ndistinction, and later the nature of the union). But unlike Descartes,\nwho had gone to some length to argue that the nature of the mind is to\nthink, Cordemoy’s Fifth Discourse accepts this as a given. Further,\nCordemoy does not provide an argument that the mind and body form a\nsubstantial union, but gives an example to show that they are united,\nthat of the body moving when the mind wills that it do so. In fact,\nthe union is defined in terms of this sort of interaction: to say that\nthe mind and body are united simply is to say that they\ninteract. (Thus the question of whether the problem of the mind-body\nunion is distinct from that of mind-body interaction, which has been\nmuch discussed in Descartes scholarship, does not arise for Cordemoy.)\nThe Fifth Discourse also contains Cordemoy’s expansion of his\noccasionalism to cover interaction between the mind and the\nbody. God’s activity is required here on the grounds that as the union\nis defined in terms of the interaction of essentially distinct\nsubstances with mutually exclusive essences, we must go outside that\nunion to account for the ability of one substance to effect change in\nthe other. \n\nThe final of the six discourses which make up the\nDiscernement addresses the question of the distinction between\nthe mind and the body, as well as an argument that the existence of the\nmind is better known than the existence of the body (but note: not that\nthe nature of the former is better known than the\nnature of the latter, as Descartes had claimed) and a glossary\nof the affects of the mind, the body, and the mind-body union.\nCordemoy’s first argument for the distinction begins by listing a\nnumber of features of bodies, and contrasts this with a list of\nfeatures of minds. Seeing that what is most fundamental to body is\nabsent from the list of properties of the mind, and vice versa, he\nconcludes that we thus “have reason to judge that they are two\ncompletely different things” (1968, 153). \n\nCordemoy employs a second argument for the distinction, one which,\nwhile much less rigorous than Descartes’, follows in spirit the\nargument from the Discourse on Method by appealing to doubt:\n“I even see that when I wish to doubt everything that I know\nwhen I think of bodies, I am not able at the same time to doubt my\nthought.  For let it be false, if you will, that there are any bodies\nin the world; it cannot be that there are no thoughts, inasmuch as I\nwould be thinking. How could I believe that my thought might be the\nsame thing that I call ‘body’? I can suppose that there\naren’t any bodies, and I cannot suppose that I do not think, the\nsupposition itself being a thought. Thus I know firstly that the soul,\nor that which thinks, is different from the body” (1968,\n153). Cordemoy goes on to argue along similar lines that he can be\nassured of the existence of his mind, but that the existence of his\nbody, and all other bodies, must be taken as an article of faith. \n\nThough it is in the Discernement that we find the basics of\nCordemoy’s philosophy, it was his Discours physique de la\nparole which was most identified with him. (Unlike the\nDiscernement, the Discours was translated into\nEnglish during Cordemoy’s lifetime.) The Discours opens with\nthe question of other minds: while I know that I am a thinking thing,\nhow can I be certain that other humans are—might not they be\nmindless automata who only behave as if there were clever\nthoughts behind their behavior?  Following Descartes, Cordemoy claims\nthat it is other humans’ use of language—both in its complexity\nand its creativity—which assures me that they have minds, in\nthat such communication cannot be explained on mechanical principles\nalone. Cordemoy then concludes this discussion, saying: “Now\nthat it is no longer possible for me to doubt that the bodies which\nresemble mine are united to souls, and since I am sure that there are\nother men than me, I think that I ought to look with care at what\nremains to be known about speech” (1968, 209). The remainder of\nthe Discours is taken up with this investigation.  ‘True’ language use, as opposed to the mere production\nof sound, is according to Cordemoy a matter of “giving signs to\none’s thoughts” (1968 196). Language is on his account an\nartificial system of signs, the purpose of which is to communicate our\nthoughts, the words standing as their representatives, to one another.\nIt is the creative aspect of language which demands the presence of a\nrational soul. True speech requires two things, says Cordemoy:\n“the formation of the voice, which can only come from the body,\nand the signification or idea that is joined with it, which can only\ncome from the soul” (1968, 198). Yet while there is a need for a\nsoul in order to engage in what would rightly be called genuine\nlanguage use, the ability to make sounds can be explained on entirely\nmechanistic grounds (the explanation being for Cordemoy very similar\nto how musical instruments produce sound). In this way sound\nproduction is like nutrition, circulation, and respiration, none of\nwhich, as Descartes had also believed, require a soul, but which\nresult instead from a proper disposition of one’s organs. As for\nanimals such as parrots which not only make sounds, but utter words,\nCordemoy claims that ‘returning words’ is not a sign of a\nsoul in such creatures, any more than a canyon’s echo requires rocks\nto have souls.  As a testament to the significance of Cordemoy’s study\nof language, one scholar has written that Cordemoy “picked up\none of Descartes’ arguments—based on the lack of true speech\namong animals—and developed it fully; so fully, in fact, that\nafter Cordemoy the point was given very little attention, as if\nsubsequent authors considered this the last word on the subject”\n(Rosenfield 1968, 40).","contact.mail":"ablondi@mercury.hendrix.edu","contact.domain":"mercury.hendrix.edu"}]
