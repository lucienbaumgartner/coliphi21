The term “multicultural” is often used as a descriptive term to\ncharacterize the fact of diversity in a society, but in what follows,\nthe focus is on multiculturalism as a normative ideal in the context of Western liberal\ndemocratic societies. While the term has come to encompass a variety\nof normative claims and goals, it is fair to say that proponents of\nmulticulturalism find common ground in rejecting the ideal of the “melting pot” in\nwhich members of minority groups are expected to assimilate into the\ndominant culture. Instead, proponents of multiculturalism endorse an ideal in which members of minority groups can maintain their distinctive collective identities and\npractices. In the case of immigrants, proponents emphasize that\nmulticulturalism is compatible with, not opposed to, the integration\nof immigrants into society; multiculturalism policies provide fairer\nterms of integration for immigrants.\n\n\nModern states are organized around the language and culture of\nthe dominant groups that have historically constituted them. As a result, members\nof minority cultural groups face barriers in pursuing their social\npractices in ways that members of dominant groups do not. Some\ntheorists argue for tolerating minority groups by leaving them free of\nstate interference (Kukathas 1995, 2003). Others argue that mere\ntoleration of group differences falls short of treating members of\nminority groups as equals; what is required is recognition and\npositive accommodation of minority group practices through what the\nleading theorist of multiculturalism Will Kymlicka has called\n“group-differentiated rights” (1995). Some\ngroup-differentiated rights are held by individual members of minority\ngroups, as in the case of individuals who are granted exemptions from\ngenerally applicable laws in virtue of their religious beliefs or\nindividuals who seek language accommodations in education and in\nvoting. Other group-differentiated rights are held by the group qua\ngroup rather by its members severally; such rights are properly called\n“group rights,” as in the case of indigenous groups and\nminority nations, who claim the right of self-determination. In the\nlatter respect, multiculturalism is closely allied with\nnationalism.\n\n\nMulticulturalism is part of a broader political movement for greater inclusion of marginalized groups, including African Americans, women, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities (Glazer 1997, Hollinger 1995, Taylor 1992). This broader political movement is reflected in the “multiculturalism” debates in the 1980s over whether and how to diversify school curricula to recognize the achievements of historically marginalized groups. But the more specific focus of contemporary theories of multiculturalism is the recognition and inclusion of minority groups defined primarily in terms of ethnicity, nationality, and religion. The main concern of contemporary multiculturalism are immigrants who are ethnic and religious minorities (e.g. Latinx people in the U.S., Muslims in Western Europe), minority nations (e.g. the Basque, Catalans, Québécois, Welsh) and indigenous peoples (e.g. Native peoples and indigenous groups in Canada, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand).\n\nMulticulturalism is closely associated with “identity\npolitics,” “the politics of difference,” and\n“the politics of recognition,” all of which share a\ncommitment to revaluing disrespected identities and changing dominant\npatterns of representation and communication that marginalize certain\ngroups (Gutmann 2003, Taylor 1992, Young 1990). Multiculturalism\ninvolves not only claims of identity and culture as some critics of\nmulticulturalism suggest. It is also a matter of economic interests\nand political power: it includes demands for remedying economic and\npolitical disadvantages that people suffer as a result of their\nmarginalized group identities. \nMulticulturalists take for granted that it is “culture”\nand “cultural groups” that are to be recognized and\naccommodated. Yet multicultural claims include a wide range of claims\ninvolving religion, language, ethnicity, nationality, and race.\nCulture is a contested, open-ended concept, and all of these\ncategories have been subsumed by or equated with the concept of\nculture. Disaggregating and distinguishing among different types of\nclaims can clarify what is at stake (Song 2008). Language and religion\nare at the heart of many claims for cultural accommodation by\nimmigrants. The key claim made by minority nations is for\nself-government rights. Race has a more limited role in multicultural\ndiscourse. Antiracism and multiculturalism are distinct but related\nideas: the former highlights “victimization and\nresistance” whereas the latter highlights “cultural life,\ncultural expression, achievements, and the like” (Blum 1992,\n14). Claims for recognition in the context of multicultural education\nare demands not just for recognition of aspects of a group’s actual\nculture (e.g. African American art and literature) but also for\nacknowledgment of the history of group subordination and its\nconcomitant experience (Gooding-Williams 1998). \nExamples of cultural accommodations or “group-differentiated\nrights” include exemptions from generally applicable law (e.g.\nreligious exemptions), assistance to do things that members of the majority culture are already enabled to do (e.g. multilingual ballots, funding for minority\nlanguage schools and ethnic associations, affirmative action),\nrepresentation of minorities in government bodies (e.g. ethnic quotas\nfor party lists or legislative seats, minority-majority Congressional\ndistricts), recognition of traditional legal codes by the dominant\nlegal system (e.g. granting jurisdiction over family law to religious\ncourts), or limited self-government rights (e.g. qualified recognition\nof tribal sovereignty, federal arrangements recognizing the political\nautonomy of Québec) (for a helpful classification of cultural\nrights, see Levy 1997). \nTypically, a group-differentiated right is a right of a minority group\n(or a member of such a group) to act or not act in a certain way in\naccordance with their religious obligations and/or cultural\ncommitments. In some cases, it is a right that directly restricts the\nfreedom of non-members in order to protect the minority group’s\nculture, as in the case of restrictions on the use of the English\nlanguage in Québec. When the right-holder is the group, the\nright may protect group rules that restrict the freedom of individual\nmembers, as in the case of the Pueblo membership rule that excludes\nthe children of women who marry outside the group. Now that you have a\nsense of the kinds of claims that have been made in the name of\nmulticulturalism, we can now turn to consider different normative\njustifications for these claims. \nOne justification for multiculturalism arises out of the communitarian\ncritique of liberalism. Liberals tend to be ethical individualists;\nthey insist that individuals should be free to choose and pursue their\nown conceptions of the good life. They give primacy to individual\nrights and liberties over community life and collective goods. Some\nliberals are also individualists when it comes to social ontology\n(what some call methodological individualism or atomism).\nMethodological individualists believe that you can and should account\nfor social actions and social goods in terms of the properties of the\nconstituent individuals and individual goods. The target of the\ncommunitarian critique of liberalism is not so much liberal ethics as\nliberal social ontology. Communitarians reject the idea that the\nindividual is prior to the community and that the value of social\ngoods can be reduced to their contribution to individual well-being.\nThey instead embrace ontological holism, which acknowledges collective\ngoods as, in Charles Taylor’s words, “irreducibly\nsocial”and intrinsically valuable (Taylor 1995). \nAn ontologically holist view of collective identities and cultures\nunderlies Taylor’s argument for a “politics of\nrecognition.” Drawing on Rousseau, Herder, and Hegel, among\nothers, Taylor argues that we do not become full human agents and\ndefine our identity in isolation from others; rather, “we define\nour identity always in dialogue with, sometimes in struggle against,\nthe things our significant others want to see in us” (1994, 33).\nBecause our identities are formed dialogically, we are dependent on\nthe recognition of others. The absence of recognition or\nmis-recognition can cause serious injury: “A person or a group\nof people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people or\nsociety around them mirror back to them a confining or demeaning or\ncontemptible picture of themselves” (25). The struggle for\nrecognition can only be satisfactorily resolved through “a\nregime of reciprocal recognition among equals” (50). Taylor\ndistinguishes the politics of recognition from the traditional liberal\n“politics of equal respect” that is “inhospitable to\ndifference, because (a) it insists on uniform application of the rules\ndefining these rights, without exception, and (b) it is suspicious of\ncollective goals” (60). By contrast, the politics of recognition\nis grounded on “judgments about what makes a good\nlife—judgments in which the integrity of cultures has an\nimportant place” (61). He discusses the example of the survival\nof French culture in Quebec. The French language is not merely a\ncollective resource that individuals might want to make use of and\nthereby seek to preserve, as suggested by a politics of equal respect.\nInstead, the French language is an irreducibly collective good that\nitself deserves to be preserved: language policies aimed at preserving\nthe French language in Québec “actively seek to create\nmembers of the community” by assuring that future generations\ncontinue to identify as French-speakers (58). Because of the\nindispensable role of cultures in the development human agency and\nidentity, Taylor argues, we should adopt the presumption of the equal\nworth of all cultures (66).  \nA second justification for multiculturalism comes from within\nliberalism but a liberalism that has been revised through critical\nengagement with the communitarian critique of liberalism. Will\nKymlicka has developed the most influential liberal theory of\nmulticulturalism by marrying the liberal values of autonomy and\nequality with an argument about the value of cultural membership\n(1989, 1995, 2001). Rather than beginning with intrinsically valuable\ncollective goals and goods as Taylor does, Kymlicka views cultures as\ninstrumentally valuable to individuals, for two main reasons. First,\ncultural membership is an important condition of personal autonomy. In\nhis first book, Liberalism, Community, and Culture (1989),\nKymlicka develops his case for multiculturalism within a Rawlsian\nframework of justice, viewing cultural membership as a “primary\ngood,” things that every rational person is presumed to want and\nwhich are necessary for the pursuit of one’s goals (Rawls 1971, 62).\nIn his later book, Multicultural Citizenship (1995), Kymlicka\ndrops the Rawlsian scaffolding, relying instead on the work of Avishai\nMargalit and Joseph Raz on national self-determination (1990). One\nimportant condition of autonomy is having an adequate range of options\nfrom which to choose (Raz 1986). Cultures serve as “contexts of\nchoice,” which provide meaningful options and scripts with which\npeople can frame, revise, and pursue their goals (Kymlicka 1995, 89).\nSecond, cultural membership plays an important role in people’s\nself-identity. Citing Margalit and Raz as well as Taylor, Kymlicka\nviews cultural identity as providing people with an “anchor for\ntheir self-identification and the safety of effortless secure\nbelonging” (1995, 89, quoting Margalit and Raz 1990, 448 and\nalso citing Taylor 1992). This means there is a deep and general\nconnection between a person’s self-respect and the respect accorded to\nthe cultural group of which she is a part. It is not simply membership\nin any culture but one’s own culture that must be secured in\norder for cultural membership to serve as a meaningful context of\nchoice and a basis of self-respect. \nKymlicka moves from these premises about the instrumental value of\ncultural membership to the egalitarian claim that because members of\nminority groups are disadvantaged in terms of access to their own\ncultures (in contrast to members of the majority culture), they are\nentitled to special protections. It is important to note that\nKymlicka’s egalitarian argument for multiculturalism rests on a theory\nof equality that critics have dubbed “luck egalitarianism”\n(Anderson 1999, Scheffler 2003). According to luck egalitarians,\nindividuals should be held responsible for inequalities resulting from\ntheir own choices, but not for inequalities deriving from unchosen\ncircumstances (Dworkin 1981; Rakowski 1993). The latter inequalities\nare the collective responsibility of citizens to address. For example,\ninequalities stemming from one’s social starting position in life are\nunchosen yet so strongly determine our prospects in life. Luck\negalitarians argue that those born into poor families are entitled to\ncollective support and assistance via a redistributive tax scheme.\nKymlicka adds cultural membership to this list of unchosen\ninequalities. If one is born into the dominant culture of society, one\nenjoys good brute luck, whereas those who belong to minority cultures\nsuffer disadvantages in virtue of the bad brute luck of their minority\nstatus. Insofar as inequality in access to cultural membership stems\nfrom luck (as opposed to individual choices) and one suffers\ndisadvantages as a result of it, members of minority groups can\nreasonably demand that members of the majority culture must share in\nbearing the costs of accommodation. Minority group rights are\njustified, as Kymlicka argues, “within a liberal egalitarian\ntheory…which emphasizes the importance of rectifying unchosen\ninequalities” (Kymlicka 1995, 109). \nOne might question whether cultural minority groups really are\n“disadvantaged” and thereby, owed positive accommodations.\nWhy not just enforce antidiscrimination laws, stopping short of any\npositive accommodations for minority groups? Kymlicka and other\nliberal theorists of multiculturalism contend that antidiscrimination\nlaws fall short of treating members of minority groups as equals; this\nis because states cannot be neutral with respect to culture. In\nculturally diverse societies, we can easily find patterns of state\nsupport for some cultural groups over others. While states\nmay prohibit racial discrimination and avoid official establishment of\nany religion, they cannot avoid establishing one language for public\nschooling and other state services (language being a paradigmatic\nmarker of culture) (Kymlicka 1995, 111; Carens 2000, 77–78;\nPatten 2001, 693). Linguistic advantage translates into economic and\npolitical advantage since members of the dominant cultural community\nhave a leg up in schools, the workplace, and politics. Linguistic\nadvantage also takes a symbolic form. When state action extends\nsymbolic affirmation to some groups and not others by adopting a\nparticular language or by organizing the work week and public holidays\naround the calendar of particular religions, it has a normalizing\neffect, suggesting that one group’s language and customs are more\nvalued than those of other groups. \nIn addition to state support of certain cultures over others, state\nlaws may place constraints on some cultural groups over\nothers. Consider the case of dress code regulations in public schools\nor the workplace. A ban on religious dress burdens religious\nindividuals, as in the case of Simcha Goldman, a U.S. Air Force\nofficer, who was also an ordained rabbi and wished to wear a yarmulke\nout of respect to an omnipresent God (Goldman v. Weinberger,\n475 US 503 (1986)). The case of the French state’s ban on religious\ndress in public schools, which burdens Muslim girls who wish to wear\nheadscarves to school, is another example (Bowen 2007, Laborde 2008).\nReligion may command that believers dress in a certain way (what Peter\nJones calls an “intrinsic burden”), not that believers\nrefrain from attending school or going to work (Jones 1994). Yet,\nburdens on believers do not stem from the dictates of religion alone;\nthey also arise from the intersection of the demands of religion and\nthe demands of the state (“extrinsic burden”). Individuals\nmust bear intrinsic burdens themselves; bearing the burdens of the\ndictates of one’s faith, such as prayer, worship, and fasting, just is\npart of meeting one’s religious obligations. When it comes to\nextrinsic burdens, however, liberal multiculturalists argue that\njustice requires assisting cultural minorities bear the burdens of\nthese unchosen disadvantages. \nIt is important to note that liberal multiculturalists distinguish\namong different types of groups. For instance, Kymlicka’s theory\ndevelops a typology of different groups and different types of rights\nfor each. It offers the strongest form of group-differentiated\nrights—self-government rights—to indigenous peoples and\nnational minorities for the luck egalitarian reason that their\nminority status is unchosen: they were coercively incorporated into\nthe larger state. By contrast, immigrants are viewed as\nvoluntary migrants: by choosing to migrate, they relinquished\naccess to their native culture. Immigrant multiculturalism, what\nKymlicka calls “polyethnic rights”, is understood as a\ndemand for fairer terms of integration into the broader society\nthrough the granting of exemptions and accommodations, not a rejection\nof integration or a demand for collective self-determination (1995,\n113–115). \nAnother set of arguments for multiculturalism rests on the value of freedom. Some theorists such as Phillip Pettit (1997) and Quentin Skinner (1998) have developed the idea of freedom from domination by drawing on the civic republican tradition. Building on this line of argument to argue for recognition, Frank Lovett (2009) maintains that domination presents a serious obstacle to human flourishing. In contrast to the conception of freedom as non-interference dominant in liberal theory, freedom as non-domination, drawn from the civic republic tradition, focuses on a person’s “capacity to interfere, on an arbitrary basis, in certain choices that the other is in a position to make” (Pettit 1997, 52). On this view of freedom, we can be unfree even when we are not experiencing any interference as in the case of a slave of a\nbenevolent master. We are subject to domination to the extent that we are dependent on another person or group who can arbitrarily exercise power over us (Pettit 1997, ch. 2). \nFrank Lovett has explored the implications of the value of freedom\nfrom domination for questions of multicultural accommodation (2010).\nHe begins from the premise that freedom from domination is an\nimportant human good and that we have a prima facie obligation to\nreduce domination. He argues that the state should not accommodate\nsocial practices that directly involve domination. Indeed, if freedom\nfrom domination is a priority, then one should “aim to bring\nsuch practices to an end as quickly as possible, despite any\nsubjective value they happen to have for their participants”\n(2010, 256). As for practices that do not involve subjecting\nindividuals to domination, accommodation is permissible but not\nnecessarily required. Accommodation is only required if accommodation\nwould advance the goal of reducing domination. He discusses one\nstylized example based on a familiar real-world case: the practice\namong Muslim women and girls of wearing headscarves. Suppose, Lovett\nsuggests, a detailed study of a particular Muslim community in a\nliberal democratic society is undertaken and it reveals that women’s\neducational and employment opportunities are discouraged, generating\n“severe patriarchal domination,” but the study also shows\nthat the practice of wearing headscarves does not (2010, 258). Lovett\nargues that the practice of wearing headscarves should be accommodated\nbecause failure to do so might strengthen the community’s commitment\nto other shared practices that reinforce patriarchal domination. \n\nA key empirical assumption here is that combating patriarchal\npractices within minority communities would be easier if the burdens\non more benign practices, such as wearing headscarves, are\nlessened. Cecile Laborde’s analysis of the headscarf controversy in\nFrance provides support for this assumption: the effect of preventing\nMuslim girls from wearing headscarves is to encourage their parents to\nwithdraw their daughters from civic education and send them to\nreligious schools where they would not be exposed to the diversity of\nworld views found in public schools. Formal restrictions on Muslim\nreligious expression in the public sphere may make, in Laborde’s\nwords, “members of dominated groups close ranks around the\ndenigrated practice, precipitating a defensive retreat into\nconservative cultural forms and identities” (2008, 164). \nAnother situation in which accommodation is warranted on Lovett’s\naccount is when individuals’ subjective attachment to particular\npractices makes them vulnerable to exploitation. He discusses the case\nof Mexican immigrant laborers with limited English language skills and\nlimited knowledge of American laws and policies. Lovett argues that\nextending “special public measures,” such as exceptions to\ngeneral rules and regulations and public legal assistance, is required\ninsofar as such measures would reduce the domination of these workers\n(2010, 260). In contrast to the communitarian or liberal egalitarian\narguments considered above, the basis for the special accommodations\nis not a desire to protect intrinsically valuable cultures or\nconsiderations of fairness or equality but the desire to reduce\ndomination. \nMira Bachvarova has also argued for the merits of a\nnon-domination-based multiculturalism as compared to liberal\negalitarian approaches. Because of its focus on the arbitrary use of\npower and the broader structural inequalities within which groups\ninteract, a non-domination approach may be more sensitive to power\ndynamics in both inter-group and intra-group relations. Also, in\ncontrast to approaches developed out of egalitarian theories of\ndistributive justice that focus on distributing different types of\nrights, a non-domination approach focuses on the “moral quality\nof the relationship between the central actors” and insists on\ncontinuity of treatment between and within groups (2014, 671). \nOther theorists sympathetic to multiculturalism look beyond liberalism\nand republicanism, emphasizing instead the importance of grappling\nwith historical injustice and listening to minority groups themselves.\nThis is especially true of theorists writing from a postcolonial\nperspective. For example, in contemporary discussions of aboriginal\nsovereignty, rather than making claims based on premises about the\nvalue of Native cultures and their connection to individual members’\nsense of self-worth as liberal multiculturalists have, the focus is on\nreckoning with history. Such proponents of indigenous sovereignty\nemphasize the importance of understanding indigenous claims against\nthe historical background of the denial of equal sovereign status of\nindigenous groups, the dispossession of their lands, and the\ndestruction of their cultural practices (Ivison 2006, Ivison et al.\n2000, Moore 2005, Simpson 2000). This background calls into question\nthe legitimacy of the state’s authority over aboriginal peoples and\nprovides a prima facie case for special rights and protections for\nindigenous groups, including the right of self-government. Jeff\nSpinner-Halev has argued that the history of state oppression of a\ngroup should be a key factor in determining not only whether group\nrights should be extended but also whether the state should intervene\nin the internal affairs of the group when it discriminates against\nparticular members of the group. For example, “when an oppressed\ngroup uses its autonomy in a discriminatory way against women it\ncannot simply be forced to stop this discrimination” (2001, 97).\nOppressed groups that lack autonomy should be “provisionally\nprivileged” over non-oppressed groups; this means that\n“barring cases of serious physical harm in the name of a group’s\nculture, it is important to consider some form of autonomy for the\ngroup” (2001, 97; see also Spinner-Halev 2012). \nTheorists adopting a postcolonial perspective go beyond liberal\nmulticulturalism toward the goal of developing models of\nconstitutional and political dialogue that recognize culturally\ndistinct ways of speaking and acting. Multicultural societies consist\nof diverse religious and moral outlooks, and if liberal societies are\nto take such diversity seriously, they must recognize that liberalism\nis just one of many substantive outlooks based on a specific view of\nman and society. Liberalism is not free of culture but expresses a\ndistinctive culture of its own. This observation applies not only\nacross territorial boundaries between liberal and nonliberal states,\nbut also within liberal states and its relations with nonliteral\nminorities. James Tully has surveyed the language of historical and\ncontemporary constitutionalism with a focus on Western state’s\nrelations with Native peoples to uncover more inclusive bases for\nintercultural dialogue (1995). Bhikhu Parekh contends that liberal\ntheory cannot provide an impartial framework governing relations\nbetween different cultural communities (2000). He argues instead for a\nmore open model of intercultural dialogue in which a liberal society’s\nconstitutional and legal values serve as the initial starting point\nfor cross-cultural dialogue while also being open to contestation.\n \nMore recent work has emphasized the importance of developing more contextual approaches that engage with actual political struggles for recognition and give greater voice to minority groups. Through detailed examination of how national museums in Canada and the U.S. have sought to represent and recognize indigenous groups, Caitlin Tom identifies three principles for the practice of recognition: self-definition, responsiveness, and internal contestation. Whether it be museum officials seeking to exhibit the history and culture of minority groups or government officials deciding whether official apologies for historical injustices are in order, they should respect individual and collective self-definition, respond to demands for recognition on terms that align with the terms of those being recognized, and accommodate internal contestation of group meanings. As Tom argues, practices of recognition guided by these principles come closer to fostering freedom and equality of minority groups than existing approaches (2018). \nSome critics contend that theories of multiculturalism are premised on\nan essentialist view of culture. Cultures are not distinct,\nself-contained wholes; they have long interacted and influenced one\nanother through war, imperialism, trade, and migration. People in many\nparts of the world live within cultures that are already cosmopolitan,\ncharacterized by cultural hybridity. As Jeremy Waldron argues,\n“We live in a world formed by technology and trade; by economic,\nreligious, and political imperialism and their offspring; by mass\nmigration and the dispersion of cultural influences. In this context,\nto immerse oneself in the traditional practices of, say, an aboriginal\nculture might be a fascinating anthropological experiment, but it\ninvolves an artificial dislocation from what actually is going on in\nthe world” (1995, 100). To aim at preserving or protecting a\nculture runs the risk of privileging one allegedly pure version of\nthat culture, thereby crippling its ability to adapt to changes in\ncircumstances (Waldron 1995, 110; see also Appiah 2005, Benhabib 2002,\nScheffler 2007). Waldron also rejects the premise that the options\navailable to an individual must come from a particular culture;\nmeaningful options may come from a variety of cultural sources. What\npeople need are cultural materials, not access to a particular\ncultural structure. For example, the Bible, Roman mythology, and the\nGrimms’ fairy tales have all influenced American culture, but these\ncultural sources cannot be seen as part of a single cultural structure\nthat multiculturalists like Kymlicka aim to protect. \nIn response, multicultural theorists agree that cultures are\noverlapping and interactive, but they nonetheless maintain that\nindividuals belong to separate societal cultures. In particular,\nKymlicka has argued that while options available to people in any\nmodern society come from a variety of ethnic and historical sources,\nthese options become meaningful to us only if “they become part\nof the shared vocabulary of social life—i.e. embodied in the\nsocial practices, based on a shared language, that we are exposed\nto... That we learn...from other cultures, or that we borrow words\nfrom other languages, does not mean that we do not still belong to\nseparate societal cultures, or speak different languages” (1995,\n103). Liberal egalitarian defenders of multiculturalism like Kymlicka\nmaintain that special protections for minority cultural groups still\nhold, even after we adopt a more cosmopolitan view of cultures,\nbecause the aim of group-differentiated rights is not to freeze\ncultures in place but to empower members of minority groups to\ncontinue their distinctive cultural practices so long as they wish\nto. \nA second major criticism is aimed at liberal multicultural theories of\naccommodation in particular and stems from the value of freedom of\nassociation and conscience. If we take these ideas seriously and\naccept both ontological and ethical individualism as discussed above,\nthen we are led to defend not special protections for groups but the\nindividual’s right to form and leave associations. As\nChandran Kukathas (1995, 2003) argues, there are no group rights, only\nindividual rights. By granting cultural groups special protections and\nrights, the state oversteps its role, which is to secure civility, and\nrisks undermining individual rights of association. States should not\npursue “cultural integration” or “cultural\nengineering” but rather a “politics of indifference”\ntoward minority groups (2003, 15). \nOne limitation of such a laissez-faire approach is that\ngroups that do not themselves value toleration and freedom of\nassociation, including the right to dissociate or exit a group, may\npractice internal discrimination against group members, and the state\nwould have little authority to interfere in such associations. A\npolitics of indifference would permit the abuse of vulnerable members\nof groups (discussed below in 3.6), tolerating, in Kukathas’s words,\n“communities which bring up children unschooled and illiterate;\nwhich enforce arranged marriages; which deny conventional medical care\nto their members (including children); and which inflict cruel and\n‘unusual’ punishment” (Kukathas 2003, 134). To\nembrace such a state of affairs would be to abandon the values of\nautonomy and equality, values that many liberals take to be\nfundamental to any liberalism worth its name. \nA third challenge to multiculturalism views it as a form of a\n“politics of recognition” that diverts attention from a\n“politics of redistribution.” We can distinguish\nanalytically between these modes of politics: a politics of\nrecognition challenges status inequality and the remedy it seeks is\ncultural and symbolic change, whereas a politics of redistribution\nchallenges economic inequality and exploitation and the remedy it\nseeks is economic restructuring (Fraser 1997, Fraser and Honneth\n2003). Working class mobilization tilts toward the redistribution end\nof the spectrum, and claims for exemption from generally applicable\nlaws and the movement for same-sex marriage are on the recognition\nend. In the U.S. critics who view themselves as part of the\n“progressive left” worry that the rise of the\n“cultural left” with its emphasis on multiculturalism and\ndifference turns the focus away from struggles for economic justice\n(Gitlin 1995, Rorty 1999). Critics in the United Kingdom and Europe\nhave also expressed concern about the effects of multiculturalism on\nsocial trust and public support for economic redistribution (Barry\n2001, Miller 2006, van Parijs 2004). Phillipe van Parijs\ninvited scholars to consider the proposition, “Other things\nbeing equal, the more cultural... homogeneity within the population of\na defined territory, the better the prospects in terms of economic\nsolidarity” (2004, 8). \nThere are two distinct concerns here. The first is that the existence\nof racial and ethnic diversity reduces social trust and solidarity,\nwhich in turn undermines public support for policies that involve\neconomic redistribution. For example, Robert Putnam argues that the\ndecline in social trust and civic participation in the U.S. is\nstrongly correlated with racial and ethnic diversity (2007). Rodney\nHero has shown that the greater the racial and ethnic heterogeneity in\na state, the more restrictive state-level welfare programs are (Hero\n1998, Hero and Preuhs 2007). Cross-national analyses suggest that\ndifferences in racial diversity explain a significant part of the\nreason why the U.S. has not developed a European-style welfare state\n(Alesina and Glaeser 2004). The second concern is that multiculturalism\npolicies themselves undermine the welfare-state by heightening the\nsalience of racial and ethnic differences among groups and undermining\na sense of common national identity that is viewed as necessary for a\nrobust welfare state (Barry 2001, Gitlin 1995, Rorty 1999). \nIn response, theorists of multiculturalism have called for and\ncollaborated on more empirical research of these purported trade-offs.\nWith respect to the first concern about the tension between diversity\nand redistribution, Kymlicka and Banting question the generalizability\nof the empirical evidence that is largely drawn from research either\non Africa, where the weakness of state institutions has meant no\nusable traditions or institutional capacity for dealing with\ndiversity, or on the U.S., where racial inequality has been shaped by\ncenturies of slavery and segregation. Where many minority groups are\nnewcomers and where state institutions are strong, the impact of\nincreasing diversity may be quite different (Kymlicka and Banting\n2006, 287). Barbara Arneil has also challenged Putnam’s social capital\nthesis, arguing that participation in civil society has changed, not\ndeclined, largely as a result of mobilization among cultural\nminorities and women seeking greater inclusion and equality (Arneil\n2006a). She argues that it is not diversity itself that leads to\nchanges in trust and civic engagement but the politics of diversity,\ni.e. how different groups respond to and challenge the norms governing\ntheir society. The central issue, then, is not to reduce diversity but\nto determine principles and procedures by which differences are\nrenegotiated in the name of justice (Arneil and MacDonald 2010). \nAs for the second concern about the tradeoff between recognition and\nredistribution, the evidence upon which early redistributionist\ncritics such as Barry and Rorty relied was speculative and\nconjectural. Recent cross-national research suggests that there is no\nevidence of a systematic tendency for multiculturalism policies to\nweaken the welfare state (Banting et al. 2006). Irene Bloemraad’s\ncomparative study of immigrant integration in Canada and the U.S.\noffers support for the view that not only is there no trade-off\nbetween multiculturalism and the welfare-state but multiculturalism\npolicies can actually increase attention and resources devoted to\nredistributive policies. She finds that Canada’s multiculturalism\npolicies, which provide immigrants with a variety of services in their\nnative languages and encourage them to preserve their cultural\ntraditions even as they become Canadian citizens, are the main reason\nwhy the naturalization rate among permanent residents in Canada is\ntwice that of permanent residents in the U.S. Multiculturalists agree\nmore empirical research is needed, but they nonetheless maintain that\nredistribution and recognition are not either/or propositions. Both\nare important dimensions in the pursuit of equality for minority\ngroups. In practice, both redistribution and\nrecognition—responding to material disadvantages and\nmarginalized identities and statuses—are required to achieve\ngreater equality across lines of race, ethnicity, nationality,\nreligion, sexuality, and class, not least because many individuals\nstand at the intersection of these different categories and suffer\nmultiple forms of marginalization. A politics of recognition is\nimportant not only on account of its effects on socioeconomic status\nand political participation but also for the sake of full inclusion of\nmembers of marginalized groups as equal citizens. \nA fourth objection takes issue with liberal multiculturalist’s\nunderstanding of what equality requires. Brian Barry defends a\nuniversalist ideal of equality, in contrast to the\ngroup-differentiated ideal of equality defended by Kymlicka. Barry\nargues that religious and cultural minorities should be held\nresponsible for bearing the consequences of their own beliefs and\npractices, just as members of the dominant culture are held\nresponsible for bearing the consequences of their beliefs. He does\nthink that special accommodations are owed to people with\ndisabilities, but he believes religious and cultural affiliations are\ndifferent from physical disabilities: the former do not constrain\npeople in the way that physical disabilities do. A physical disability\nsupports a strong prima facie claim to compensation because it limits\na person’s opportunities to engage in activities that others are able\nto engage in. In contrast, religion and culture may shape one’s\nwillingness to seize an opportunity, but they do not affect whether\none has an opportunity. Barry argues that egalitarian justice is only\nconcerned with ensuring a reasonable range of equal opportunities, not\nwith ensuring equal access to any particular choices or outcomes\n(2001, 37). When it comes to cultural and religious affiliations, they\ndo not limit the range of opportunities one enjoys but rather the\nchoices one can make within the set of opportunities available to\nall. \nIn reply, one might agree that opportunities are not objective in the\nstrong physicalist sense suggested by Barry. But the opportunity to do\nX is not just having the possibility to do X without facing physical\nencumbrances; it is also the possibility of doing X without incurring\nexcessive costs or the risk of such costs (Miller 2002, 51). State law\nand cultural commitments can conflict in ways such that the costs for\ncultural minorities of taking advantage of the opportunity are\nprohibitively high. In contrast to Barry, liberal multiculturalists\nargue that many cases where a law or policy disparately impacts a\nreligious or cultural practice constitute injustice. For instance,\nKymlicka points to the Goldman case (discussed above) and other\nreligion cases, as well as to claims for language rights, as examples\nin which group-differentiated rights are required in light of the\ndifferential impact of state action (1995, 108–115). His\nargument is that since the state cannot achieve complete\ndisestablishment of culture or be neutral with respect to culture, it\nmust somehow make it up to citizens who are bearers of minority\nreligious beliefs and native speakers of other languages. Because\ncomplete state disestablishment of culture is not possible, one way to\nensure fair background conditions is to provide roughly comparable\nforms of assistance or recognition to each of the various languages\nand religions of citizens. To do nothing would be to permit\ninjustice. \nSome postcolonial theorists are critical of multiculturalism and the\ncontemporary politics of recognition for reinforcing, rather than\ntransforming, structures of colonial domination in relations between\nsettler states and indigenous communities. Focusing on Taylor’s theory\nof the politics of recognition, Glen Coulthard has argued that\n“instead of ushering in an era of peaceful coexistence grounded\non the Hegelian idea of reciprocity, the politics of\nrecognition in its contemporary form promises to reproduce the very\nconfigurations of colonial power that indigenous peoples’ demands for\nrecognition have historically sought to transcend” (2007, 438–9;\nsee also Coulthard 2014). There are several elements to Coulthard’s\ncritique. First, he argues that the politics of recognition, through\nits focus on reformist state redistributionist schemes like granting\ncultural rights and concessions to aboriginal communities, affirms\nrather than challenges the political economy of colonialism. In this\nregard, the politics of recognition reveals itself to be a variant of\nliberalism, which “fails to confront the structural/economic\naspects of colonialism at its generative roots” (2007, 446).\nSecond, the contemporary politics of recognition toward indigenous\ncommunities rests on a flawed sociological assumption: that both\nparties engaged in the struggle for recognition are mutually dependent\non one another’s acknowledgement for their freedom and self-worth.\nYet, no such mutual dependency exists in actual relations between\nnation-states and indigenous communities: “the master—that\nis, the colonial state and state society—does not require\nrecognition from the previously self-determining communities upon\nwhich its territorial, economic, and social infrastructure is\nconstituted” (451). Third, Coulthard argues that true\nemancipation for the colonized cannot occur without struggle and\nconflict that “serves as the mediating force through which the\ncolonized come to shed their colonial identities” (449). He\nemploys Frantz Fanon to argue that the road to true self-determination\nfor the oppressed lies in self-affirmation: rather than depending on\ntheir oppressors for their freedom and self-worth, “the\ncolonized must initiate the process of decolonization by recognizing\nthemselves as free, dignified and distinct contributors to\nhumanity” (454). This means that indigenous peoples should\n“collectively redirect our struggles away from a politics that\nseeks to attain a conciliatory form of settler-state recognition for\nIndigenous nations toward a resurgent politics of recognition premised\non self-actualization, direct action, and the resurgence of cultural\npractices that are attentive to the subjective and structural\ncomposition of settler-colonial power” (2014, 24). \nTaylor, Kymlicka, and other proponents of the contemporary politics of\nrecognition might agree with Coulthard that self-affirmation by\noppressed groups is critical for true self-determination and freedom\nof indigenous communities, but such self-affirmation need not be\nviewed as mutually exclusive from state efforts to extend\ninstitutional accommodations. State recognition of self-government\nrights and other forms of accommodation are important steps toward\nrectifying historical injustices and transforming structural\ninequalities between the state and indigenous communities. Coulthard’s\nanalysis redirects attention to the importance of evaluating and\nchallenging the structural and psycho-affective dimensions of colonial\ndomination, but by arguing that indigenous peoples should “turn\naway” (2007, 456) from settler-states and settler societies may\nplay into the neoliberal turn toward the privatization of dependency\nand to risk reinforcing the marginalization of indigenous communities\nat a time when economic and other forms of state support may be\ncritical to the survival of indigenous communities. \nThe set of critiques that has ignited perhaps the most intense debate\nabout multiculturalism argues that extending protections to minority\ngroups may come at the price of reinforcing oppression of vulnerable\nmembers of those groups—what some have called the problem of\n“internal minorities” or “minorities within\nminorities” (Green 1994, Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005).\nMulticultural theorists have tended to focus on inequalities\nbetween groups in arguing for special protections for\nminority groups, but group-based protections can exacerbate\ninequalities within minority groups. This is because some\nways of protecting minority groups from oppression by the majority may\nmake it more likely that more powerful members of those groups are\nable to undermine the basic liberties and opportunities of vulnerable\nmembers. Vulnerable subgroups within minority groups include religious\ndissenters, sexual minorities, women, and children. A group’s leaders\nmay exaggerate the degree of consensus and solidarity within their\ngroup to present a united front to the wider society and strengthen\ntheir case for accommodation. \nSome of the most oppressive group norms and practices revolve around\nissues of gender and sexuality, and it is feminist critics who first\ncalled attention to potential tensions between multiculturalism and\nfeminism (Coleman 1996, Okin 1999, Shachar 2000). These tensions\nconstitute a genuine dilemma if one accepts both that\ngroup-differentiated rights for minority cultural groups are\njustifiable, as multicultural theorists do, and that gender equality\nis an important value, as feminists have emphasized. Extending special\nprotections and accommodations to minority groups engaged in\npatriarchal practices may help reinforce gender inequality within\nthese communities. Examples that have been analyzed in the scholarly\nliterature include conflicts over arranged marriage, the ban on\nheadscarves, the use of “cultural defenses” in criminal\nlaw, accommodating religious law or customary law within dominant\nlegal systems, and self-government rights for indigenous communities\nthat reinforce the inequality of women. \nThese feminist objections are especially troublesome for liberal\negalitarian defenders of multiculturalism who wish to promote not only\ninter-group equality but also intra-group equality, including gender\nequality. In response, Kymlicka (1999) has emphasized the similarities\nbetween multiculturalism and feminism: both aim at a more inclusive\nconception of justice, and both challenge the traditional liberal\nassumption that equality requires identical treatment. To address the\nconcern about multicultural accommodations exacerbating intra-group\ninequality, Kymlicka distinguishes between two kinds of group rights:\n“external protections” are rights that a minority group\nclaims against non-members in order to reduce its vulnerability to the\neconomic and political power of the larger society, whereas\n“internal restrictions” are rights that a minority group\nclaims against its own members. He argues that a liberal theory of\nminority group rights defends external protections while rejecting\ninternal restrictions (1995, 35–44;1999, 31). \nBut many feminist critics have emphasized, granting external\nprotections to minority groups may sometimes come at the price of\ninternal restrictions. They may be different sides of the same coin:\nfor example, respecting the self-government rights of Native\ncommunities may entail permitting sexually discriminatory membership\nrules enacted by the leaders of those communities. Whether\nmulticulturalism and feminism can be reconciled within liberal theory\ndepends in part on the empirical premise that groups that seek\ngroup-differentiated rights do not support patriarchal norms and\npractices. If they do, liberal multiculturalists would in principle\nhave to argue against extending the group right or extending it with\ncertain qualifications, such as conditioning the extension of\nself-government rights to Native peoples on the acceptance of a\nconstitutional bill of rights. \nThere has been a wave of feminist responses to the problem of\nvulnerable internal minorities that is sympathetic to both\nmulticulturalism and feminism (see, e.g., Arneil 2006b, Deveaux 2006,\nEisenberg 2003, Lépinard 2011, Phillips 2007, Shachar 2001, Song 2007, Volpp 2000).\nSome feminists have emphasized the importance of moving away from essentialist\nnotions of culture and reductive views of members of minority groups\nas incapable of meaningful agency (Phillips 2007, Volpp 2000). Other feminists\nhave sought to shift the emphasis from liberal rights towards more democratic approaches. Liberal theorists\nhave tended to start from the question of whether and how minority\ncultural practices should be tolerated or accommodated in accordance\nwith liberal principles, whereas democratic theorists foreground the\nrole of democratic deliberation and ask how affected parties\nunderstand the contested practice. By drawing on the voices of\naffected parties and giving special weight to the voice of women at\nthe center of gendered cultural conflicts, deliberation can clarify\nthe interests at stake and enhance the legitimacy of responses to\ncultural conflicts (Benhabib 2002, Deveaux 2006, Song 2007).\nDeliberation also provides opportunities for minority group members to\nexpose instances of cross-cultural hypocrisy and to consider whether\nand how the norms and institutions of the larger society, whose own\nstruggles for gender equality are incomplete and ongoing, may\nreinforce rather than challenge sexist practices within minority\ngroups (Song 2005). There is contestation over what constitutes\nsubordination and how best to address it, and intervention into\nminority cultural groups without the participation of minority women\nthemselves fails to respect their freedom and is not likely to serve\ntheir interests. \nThe biggest challenge to multiculturalism today may not be philosophical but\npolitical: a political retreat or backlash against immigrant\nmulticulturalism in particular. Some scholars have diagnosed a\n“retreat” from multiculturalism in Europe and Australia,\nwhich they attribute to a lack of public support based partly on the\nlimited success of such policies to foster the integration of\nminorities (Joppke 2004, McGhee 2008). But other scholars argue there\nis lack of evidence of any such retreat. Based on their analysis of\nBritish policies, Varun Uberoi and Tariq Modood find that legal\nexemptions for minority religious practices, anti-discrimination\nmeasures, and multicultural education policies remain in place, and\nthere is no country-wide evidence suggesting that public services are\nno longer delivered in different languages (2013, 134). Further\nresearch is needed on whether and why there has been a retreat from\nmulticulturalism policies. \nPerhaps the claim about a “retreat” from multiculturalism\nhas less to do with any actual changes in state policies and more with\nconcerns about lack of social unity and increasing tensions among\ndiverse groups in liberal democratic societies and the sense that\nmulticulturalism is somehow to blame. Consider then-Prime Minister\nDavid Cameron’s 2011 speech: “Under the doctrine of state\nmulticulturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live\nseparate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream.\nWe’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they [young\nMuslims] feel they want to belong” (Cameron 2011). According to\nCameron, multiculturalism stands for separation and division, not\nintegration and unity. But the survey of different theories of\nmulticulturalism above demonstrates that most theories of immigrant\nmulticulturalism do not aim at separation but rather devising fairer\nterms of inclusion for religious and cultural minorities into\nmainstream society (Kymlicka 1995). \nGoing forward, public debate about immigrant multiculturalism should be pursued in a\nbroader context that considers the politics of immigration, race,\nreligion, and national security. Multiculturalism may become an easy\nrhetorical scapegoat for public fear and anxiety whenever national\nsecurity is seen to be threatened and when economic conditions are bad. In\nEurope, concerns about the radicalization of Muslim minorities have\nbecome central to public debates about immigration and\nmulticulturalism. This was especially true in the face of the European\nmigration crisis as over a million people fleeing war and violence in\nSyria, Iraq, and elsewhere made perilous journeys by sea and land\ninto Europe. This crisis tapped into fears about terrorism and security, especially after the November 2015 Paris and July 2016 Nice attacks; it also renewed concerns about the limits\nof past efforts to integrate newcomers and their descendants. Evidence\nfrom across Europe suggests that Muslims are struggling to succeed in\neducation and the labor market in comparison to other religious and\ncultural minorities (Givens 2007). \nSocioeconomic and political marginalization interacts with immigrants’ own sense of belonging: it is hard to imagine newcomers feeling integrated before they make\nsignificant steps toward socioeconomic integration. Integration is a two-way street: not only must immigrants work to integrate themselves, but the state itself must make accommodations to facilitate integration, as many multicultural theorists have emphasized. As\nCecile Laborde observes, North African youth in France are\n“routinely blamed for not being integrated,” but this\nblame “confuses French society’s institutional responsibility to\nintegrate immigrants with immigrants’ personal failure to integrate\ninto society” (Laborde 2008, 208). The challenge of integrating\nimmigrants has been heightened by increasing public acceptability of\nexpressions of anti-Muslim sentiment. The rise of far-right political\nparties and their anti-Muslim publicity campaigns, coupled with the\nmedia’s willingness to report, often uncritically, their positions\ndamage the prospects for integrating Muslims in Europe (Lenard 2010,\n311). Muslim political leaders report that it is “part of\nmainstream public dialogue” to refer to the “menace of\nforeign cultures and the threat posed by immigrants in general, and\nMuslims in particular, to social solidarity and cultural\nhomogeneity” (Klausen 2005, 123). Muslims have been, in\nLaborde’s words, “reduced to their presumed identity, culture,\nor religion, and consequently stigmatized as immigrant, Arab, or\nMuslim” (2008, 17). The challenges posed by integrating Muslims\nare thought to be more complex than the challenges of integrating\nearlier waves of immigrants, but as Patti Lenard argues, this alleged\ncomplexity derives from the simplistic and unfair elision between\nIslamic fundamentalism and the vast majority of Muslim minorities in\nEurope who desire integration on fairer terms of the sort that\nmulticulturalists defend (Lenard 2010, 318). \nIn light of these concerns with immigrant multiculturalism,\nmulticultural theorists need to continue to make the case that the\nideal of multicultural citizenship stands for fairer terms of\nintegration, not separation and division, and offer answers to\nquestions such as: Why is multicultural citizenship more desirable\nthan the traditional liberal ideal of common citizenship based on a\nuniform set of rights and opportunities for everyone? Are\nmulticulturalism policies actually fostering greater integration of\nimmigrants and their descendants? How should we think about the\nrelationship between multiculturalism and struggles to address\ninequalities based on race, indigeneity, class, gender, sexuality, and\ndisability? It is also important to study the development of\nmulticulturalism beyond the West, including whether and how Western\ntheories and practices of multiculturalism have traveled and been\nincorporated. For example, what lessons have states that only recently\nopened up to significant immigration, such as South Korea, drawn from\nthe experiences of other states, and what sorts of multiculturalism\npolicies have they adopted and why?
