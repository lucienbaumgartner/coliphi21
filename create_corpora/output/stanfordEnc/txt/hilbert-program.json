It calls for a formalization of all of mathematics in\naxiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization of\nmathematics is consistent. The consistency proof itself was to be\ncarried out using only what Hilbert called “finitary”\nmethods. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoning\nthen yields the required justification of classical\nmathematics. Although Hilbert proposed his program in this form only\nin 1921, various facets of it are rooted in foundational work of his\ngoing back until around 1900, when he first pointed out the necessity\nof giving a direct consistency proof of analysis. Work on the program\nprogressed significantly in the 1920s with contributions from\nlogicians such as Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann,\nand Jacques Herbrand. It was also a great influence\non Kurt Gödel, whose work on the\nincompleteness theorems were motivated by Hilbert’s Program.\nGödel’s work is generally taken to show that Hilbert’s Program\ncannot be carried out. It has nevertheless continued to be an\ninfluential position in the philosophy of mathematics, and, starting\nwith the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the 1930s, work on so-called\nRelativized Hilbert Programs have been central to the\ndevelopment of proof theory.\n\n\n\nHilbert’s work on the foundations of mathematics has its roots in\nhis work on geometry of the 1890s, culminating in his influential\ntextbook Foundations of Geometry\n (1899)\n (see\n 19th Century Geometry).\n Hilbert believed that the proper way to develop\nany scientific subject rigorously required an axiomatic approach. In\nproviding an axiomatic treatment, the theory would be developed\nindependently of any need for intuition, and it would facilitate an\nanalysis of the logical relationships between the basic concepts and\nthe axioms. Of basic importance for an axiomatic treatment are, so\nHilbert, investigation of the independence and, above all, of the\nconsistency of the axioms. For the axioms of geometry, consistency can\nbe proved by providing an interpretation of the system in the real\nplane, and thus, the consistency of geometry is reduced to the\nconsistency of analysis. The foundation of analysis, of course, itself\nrequires an axiomatization and a consistency proof. Hilbert provided\nsuch an axiomatization in\n (1900b),\n but it\nbecame clear very quickly that the consistency of analysis faced\nsignificant difficulties, in particular because the favored way of\nproviding a foundation for analysis in Dedekind’s work relied on\ndubious assumptions akin to to those that lead to the paradoxes of set\ntheory and\n Russell’s Paradox\n in\nFrege’s foundation of arithmetic. \n\nHilbert thus realized that a direct consistency proof of\nanalysis, i.e., one not based on reduction to another theory, was\nneeded. He proposed the problem of finding such a proof as the second\nof his 23 mathematical problems in his address to the International\nCongress of Mathematicians in 1900\n (1900a)\nand presented a sketch of such a proof in his Heidelberg talk\n (1905).\n Several factors delayed the further\ndevelopment of Hilbert’s foundational program. One was perhaps the\ncriticism of\n Poincaré (1906)\n against\nwhat he saw as a viciously circular use of induction in Hilbert’s\nsketched consistency proof (see\n Steiner 1975,\nAppendix). Hilbert also realized that axiomatic investigations required\na well worked-out logical formalism. At the time he relied on a\nconception of logic based on the algebraic tradition, in particular, on\nSchröder’s work, which was not particularly suited as a formalism\nfor the axiomatization of mathematics. (See\n Peckhaus 1990\n on the early development of\nHilbert’s Program.) \n\nThe publication of Russell and Whitehead’s\n Principia Mathematica\nprovided the required logical basis for a renewed attack on\nfoundational issues. Beginning in 1914, Hilbert’s student Heinrich\nBehmann and others studied the system of Principia (see\n Mancosu 1999\n on Behmann’s role in Hilbert’s\nschool). Hilbert himself returned to work on foundational issues in\n1917. In September 1917, he delivered an address to the Swiss\nMathematical Society entitled “Axiomatic Thought”\n (1918a).\n It is his first published contribution\nto mathematical foundations since 1905. In it, he again emphasizes the\nrequirement of consistency proofs for axiomatic systems: “The chief\nrequirement of the theory of axioms must go farther [than merely\navoiding known paradoxes], namely, to show that within every field of\nknowledge contradictions based on the underlying axiom-system are\nabsolutely impossible.” He poses the proof of the consistency\nof arithmetic (and of set theory) again as the main open problems. In\nboth these cases, there seems to be nothing more fundamental available\nto which the consistency could be reduced other than logic itself. And\nHilbert then thought that the problem had essentially been solved by\nRussell’s work in Principia. Nevertheless, other fundamental\nproblems of axiomatics remained unsolved, including the problem of the\n“decidability of every mathematical question,” which also traces back\nto Hilbert’s 1900 address. \n\nThese unresolved problems of axiomatics led Hilbert to devote\nsignificant effort to work on logic in the following years. In 1917,\nPaul Bernays joined him as his assistant in Göttingen. In a series\nof courses from 1917–1921, Hilbert, with the assistance of Bernays and\nBehmann, made significant new contributions to formal logic. The course\nfrom 1917\n (Hilbert, 1918b),\n in particular,\ncontains a sophisticated development of first-order logic, and forms\nthe basis of Hilbert and Ackermann’s textbook Principles of\nTheoretical Logic\n (1928)\n (see\n Ewald and Sieg 2013,\n Sieg 1999,\n and\n Zach 1999, 2003). \n\nWithin the next few years, however, Hilbert came to reject Russell’s\nlogicist solution to the consistency problem for arithmetic. At the\nsame time,\n Brouwer’s\n intuitionistic\nmathematics gained currency. In particular, Hilbert’s former student\nHermann Weyl converted to intuitionism. Weyl’s paper “The new\nfoundational crisis in mathematics”\n (1921)\n was\nanswered by Hilbert in three talks in Hamburg in the Summer of 1921\n (1922b).\n Here, Hilbert presented his own\nproposal for a solution to the problem of the foundation of\nmathematics. This proposal incorporated Hilbert’s ideas from 1904\nregarding direct consistency proofs, his conception of axiomatic\nsystems, and also the technical developments in the axiomatization of\nmathematics in the work of Russell as well as the further developments\ncarried out by him and his collaborators. What was new was the way in\nwhich Hilbert wanted to imbue his consistency project with the\nphilosophical significance necessary to answer Brouwer and Weyl’s\ncriticisms: the finitary point of view. \n\nAccording to Hilbert, there is a privileged part of mathematics,\ncontentual elementary number theory, which relies only on a “purely\nintuitive basis of concrete signs.” Whereas the operating with abstract\nconcepts was considered “inadequate and uncertain,” there is a realm\nof \n\nThese objects were, for Hilbert, signs. The domain of\ncontentual number theory consists in the finitary numerals, i.e.,\nsequences of strokes. These have no meaning, i.e., they do not stand\nfor abstract objects, but they can be operated on (e.g., concatenated)\nand compared. Knowledge of their properties and relations is intuitive\nand unmediated by logical inference. Contentual number theory developed\nthis way is secure, according to Hilbert: no contradictions can arise\nsimply because there is no logical structure in the propositions of\ncontentual number theory. \n\nThe intuitive-contentual operations with signs forms the basis of\nHilbert’s metamathematics. Just as contentual number theory operates\nwith sequences of strokes, so metamathematics operates with sequences\nof symbols (formulas, proofs). Formulas and proofs can be syntactically\nmanipulated, and the properties and relationships of formulas and\nproofs are similarly based in a logic-free intuitive capacity which\nguarantees certainty of knowledge about formulas and proofs arrived at\nby such syntactic operations. Mathematics itself, however, operates\nwith abstract concepts, e.g., quantifiers, sets, functions, and uses\nlogical inference based on principles such as mathematical induction or\nthe principle of the excluded middle. These “concept-formations” and\nmodes of reasoning had been criticized by Brouwer and others on grounds\nthat they presuppose infinite totalities as given, or that they involve\nimpredicative definitions (which were considered by the critics as\nviciously circular). Hilbert’s aim was to justify their use. To this\nend, he pointed out that they can be formalized in axiomatic systems\n(such as that of Principia or those developed by Hilbert\nhimself), and mathematical propositions and proofs thus turn into\nformulas and derivations from axioms according to strictly\ncircumscribed rules of derivation. Mathematics, so Hilbert, “becomes an\ninventory of provable formulas.” In this way the proofs of mathematics\nare subject to metamathematical, contentual investigation. The goal of\nHilbert’s program is then to give a contentual, metamathematical proof\nthat there can be no derivation of a contradiction, i.e., no formal\nderivations of a formula \\(A\\) and of its negation\n\\(\\neg A\\). \n\nThis sketch of the aims of the program was fleshed out by Hilbert\nand his collaborators in the following 10 years. On the conceptual\nside, the finite standpoint and the strategy for a consistency proof\nwere elaborated by\n Hilbert (1928);\n Hilbert (1923);\n Hilbert (1926)\n and\n Bernays (1928b);\n Bernays (1922);\n Bernays (1930),\n of which Hilbert’s article “On the infinite”\n (1926)\n provides the most detailed elaboration of\nthe finitary standpoint. In addition to Hilbert and Bernays, a number\nof other people were involved in technical work on the program. In\nlectures given in Göttingen\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1923;\n Hilbert, 1922a),\n Hilbert\nand Bernays developed the\n \\(\\varepsilon\\)-calculus\n as their definitive\nformalism for axiom systems for arithmetic and analysis. Hilbert there\nalso presented his approach to giving consistency proofs using his\nso-called \\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution method.\n Ackermann (1924)\n attempted to extend Hilbert’s\nidea to a system of analysis. The proof was, however, erroneous (see\n Zach 2003).\n John von Neumann, then visiting\nGöttingen, gave a corrected consistency proof for a system of the\n\\(\\varepsilon\\)-formalism (which, however, did not include the induction\naxiom) in 1925 (published in\n 1927).\n Building\non von Neumann’s work, Ackermann devised a new \\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution\nprocedure which he communicated to Bernays (see\n Bernays 1928b).\n In his address “Problems of the\ngrounding of mathematics” to the International Congress of\nMathematicians in Bologna in 1928\n (1929),\nHilbert optimistically claimed that the work of Ackermann and von\nNeumann had established the consistency of number theory and that the\nproof for analysis had already been carried out by Ackermann “to the\nextent that the only remaining task consists in the proof of an\nelementary finiteness theorem that is purely arithmetical.” \n\nGödel’s incompleteness\ntheorems showed that Hilbert’s optimism was undue. In September 1930,\nKurt Gödel announced his first incompleteness theorem at a\nconference in Königsberg. Von Neumann, who was in the audience,\nimmediately recognized the significance of Gödel’s result for\nHilbert’s program. Shortly after the conference he wrote to\nGödel, telling him that he had found a corollary to Gödel’s\nresult. Gödel had found the same result already independently:\nthe second incompleteness theorem, asserting that the system\nof Principia does not prove the formalization of the claim\nthat the system of Principia is consistent (provided it\nis). All the methods of finitary reasoning used in the consistency\nproofs up till then were believed to be formalizable in\nPrincipia, however. Hence, if the consistency of\nPrincipia were provable by the methods used in Ackermann’s\nproofs, it should be possible to formalize this proof in\nPrincipia; but this is what the second incompleteness theorem\nstates is impossible. Bernays also realized the importance of\nGödel’s results immediately after he studied Gödel’s paper in\nJanuary 1931, writing to Gödel that (under the assumption that\nfinitary reasoning can be formalized in Principia) the\nincompleteness theorem show that a finitary consistency proof of\nPrincipia is impossible. Shortly thereafter, von Neumann\nshowed that Ackermann’s consistency proof is flawed and provided a\ncounterexample to the proposed \\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution procedure (see\n Zach 2003). \n\nIn\n (1936),\n Gentzen published a consistency\nproof of first-order Peano Arithmetic (\\(\\PA\\)). As Gödel had\nshown was necessary, Gentzen’s proof used methods that could not be\nformalized in \\(\\PA\\) itself, namely, transfinite induction along\nthe ordinal \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Gentzen’s work marks the beginning\nof post-Gödelian proof theory and work on Relativized Hilbert\nPrograms. Proof theory in the tradition of Gentzen has analyzed\naxiomatic systems according to what extensions of the finitary\nstandpoint are necessary to prove their consistency. Usually, the\nconsistency strength of systems has been measured by the system’s\nproof-theoretic ordinal, i.e., the ordinal transfinite\ninduction along which suffices to prove consistency. In the case of\n\\(\\PA\\), that ordinal is \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). (For further\ndiscussion, see the entry on \nthe development of proof theory.) \n\nThe cornerstone of Hilbert’s philosophy of mathematics, and the\nsubstantially new aspect of his foundational thought from\n 1922b\n onward, consisted in what he called the\nfinitary standpoint. This methodological standpoint consists in a\nrestriction of mathematical thought to those objects which are\n“intuitively present as immediate experience prior to all thought,” and\nto those operations on and methods of reasoning about such objects\nwhich do not require the introduction of abstract concepts, in\nparticular, without appeal to completed infinite totalities. \n\nThere are several basic and interrelated issues in understanding\nHilbert’s finitary standpoint: \n\nHilbert characterized the domain of finitary reasoning in a\nwell-known paragraph which appears in roughly the same formulation in\nall of Hilbert’s more philosophical papers from the 1920s\n (1931b;\n 1922b;\n 1928;\n 1926): \n\nThese objects are, for Hilbert, the signs. For the domain\nof contentual number theory, the signs in question are numerals such\nas \n\nThe question of how exactly Hilbert understood the numerals is\ndifficult to answer. They are not physical objects (actual strokes on\npaper, for instance), since it must always be possible to extend a\nnumeral by adding another stroke (and, as Hilbert also argues in “On\nthe infinite”\n (1926),\n it is doubtful that the\nphysical universe is infinite). According to\n Hilbert (1922b, 202),\n their “shape can be\ngenerally and certainly recognized by us—independently of space and\ntime, of the special conditions of the production of the sign, and of\nthe insignificant differences in the finished product.” They are not\nmental constructions, since their properties are objective, yet their\nexistence is dependent on their intuitive construction (see\n Bernays 1923,\n 226). What is clear in any case\nis that they are logically primitive, i.e., they are neither concepts\n(as Frege’s numbers are) nor sets. What is important here is not\nprimarily their metaphysical status (abstract versus concrete in the\ncurrent sense of these terms), but that they do not enter into logical\nrelations, e.g., they cannot be predicated of anything. In Bernays’s\nmost mature presentations of finitism\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1939;\n Bernays, 1930),\n the objects of finitism are\ncharacterized as formal objects which are recursively\ngenerated by a process of repetition; the stroke symbols are then\nconcrete representations of these formal objects. \n\nThe question of what Hilbert thought the epistemological status of\nthe objects of finitism was is equally difficult. In order to carry out\nthe task of providing a secure foundation for infinitistic mathematics,\naccess to finitary objects must be immediate and certain. Hilbert’s\nphilosophical background was broadly Kantian, as was Bernays’s, who was\nclosely affiliated with the neo-Kantian school of philosophy around\nLeonard Nelson in Göttingen. Hilbert’s characterization of\nfinitism often refers to Kantian intuition, and the objects of finitism\nas objects given intuitively. Indeed, in Kant’s epistemology, immediacy\nis a defining characteristic of intuitive knowledge. The question is,\nwhat kind of intuition is at play?\n Mancosu (1998b)\n identifies a shift in this regard. He argues that whereas\nthe intuition involved in Hilbert’s early papers was a kind of\nperceptual intuition, in later writings (e.g.,\n Bernays 1928a)\n it is identified as a form of\npure intuition in the Kantian sense. However, at roughly the same\n time\n Hilbert (1928, 469)\n still identifies the kind\nof intuition at play as perceptual. In\n (1931b,\n 266–267), Hilbert sees the finite mode\nof thought as a separate source of a priori knowledge in\naddition to pure intuition (e.g., of space) and reason, claiming that\nhe has “recognized and characterized the third source of knowledge that\naccompanies experience and logic.” Both Bernays and Hilbert justify\nfinitary knowledge in broadly Kantian terms (without however going so\nfar as to provide a transcendental deduction), characterizing finitary\nreasoning as the kind of reasoning that underlies all mathematical, and\nindeed, scientific, thinking, and without which such thought would be\nimpossible. (See\n Kitcher 1976\n and\n Parsons 1998 \non the epistemology of finitism, and\n Patton 2014 for historical and philosophical\n context of Hilbert’s theory of signs.) \n\nThe most basic judgments about finitary numerals are those about\nequality and inequality. In addition, the finite standpoint allows\noperations on finitary objects. Here the most basic is that of\nconcatenation. The concatenation of the numerals 11 and 111 is\ncommunicated as “\\(2 + 3\\),” and the statement that 11 concatenated with\n111 results in the same numeral as 111 concatenated with 11 by “\\(2 + 3\n= 3 + 2\\).” In actual proof-theoretic practice, as well as explicitly\n in\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1934;\n Bernays, 1930),\n these basic operations are\ngeneralized to operations defined by recursion, paradigmatically,\nprimitive recursion, e.g., multiplication and exponentiation (see\n Parsons 1998 for philosophical\ndifficulties in relation to exponentiation and 2007 for an extended discussion of intuitive mathematics and finitism). Similarly, finitary\njudgments may involve not just equality or inequality but also basic\ndecidable properties, such as “is a prime.” This is finitarily\nacceptable as long as the characteristic function of such a property is\nitself finitary: For instance, the operation which transforms a numeral\nto 1 if it is prime and 11 otherwise can be defined by primitive\nrecursion and is hence finitary. Such finitary propositions may be\ncombined by the usual logical operations of conjunction, disjunction,\nnegation, but also bounded quantification.\n (Hilbert, 1926)\n gives the example of the\nproposition that “there is a prime number between \\(p + 1\\) and\n\\(p! + 1\\)” where \\(p\\) is a certain large prime. This\nstatement is finitarily acceptable since it “serves merely to\nabbreviate the proposition” that either \\(p + 1\\) or \\(p +\n2\\) or \\(p + 3\\) or … or \\(p! + 1\\) is a prime. \n\nThe problematic finitary propositions are those that express general\nfacts about numerals such as that, for any given numeral \\(n,\n1+n = n+1\\). It is problematic because, as Hilbert puts\nit, it “is from the finitist point of view incapable of being\nnegated”\n (1926,\n 378). By this he means\nthat the contradictory proposition that there is a numeral \\(n\\)\nfor which \\(1+n \\ne n+1\\) is not finitarily meaningful.\n“One cannot, after all, try out all numbers”\n (1928,\n 470). For the same reason, a finitary\ngeneral proposition is not to be understood as an infinite conjunction\nbut “only as a hypothetical judgment that comes to assert something\nwhen a numeral is given” (ibid.). Even though they are problematic in\nthis sense, general finitary statements are of particular importance to\nHilbert’s proof theory, since the statement of consistency of a formal\nsystem \\(S\\) is of such a general form: for any given sequence of\nformulas \\(P, P\\) is not a derivation of a contradiction\nin \\(S\\). \n\nOf crucial importance to both an understanding of finitism and of\nHilbert’s proof theory is the question of what operations and what\nprinciples of proof should be allowed from the finitist standpoint.\nThat a general answer is necessary is clear from the demands of\nHilbert’s proof theory, i.e., it is not to be expected that given a\nformal system of mathematics (or even a single sequence of formulas)\none can “see” that it is consistent (or that it cannot be a genuine\nderivation of an inconsistency) the way we can see, e.g., that \\(11 + 111\n= 111 + 11\\). What is required for a consistency proof is an operation\nwhich, given a formal derivation, transforms such a derivation into one\nof a special form, plus proofs that the operation in fact does this and\nthat proofs of the special kind cannot be proofs of an inconsistency.\nTo count as a finitary consistency proof, the operation itself must be\nacceptable from the finitist standpoint, and the proofs required must\nuse only finitarily acceptable principles. \n\nHilbert never gave a general account of which operations and methods\nof proof are acceptable from the finitist standpoint, but only examples\nof operations and methods of inference in contentual finitary number\ntheory which he accepted as finitary. Contentual induction was accepted\nin its application to finitary statements of the hypothetical, general\nkind explicitly in\n Hilbert (1922b).\n He\n (1923,\n 1139) said that intuitive thought\n“includes recursion and intuitive induction for finite existing\ntotalities,” and used exponentiation in an example in\n 1928.\n Bernays (1930)\nexplained how exponentiation may be understood as a finitary operation\non numerals.\n Hilbert and Bernays (1934)\n give the only general account of finitary contentual number\ntheory; according to it, operations defined by primitive recursion and\nproofs using induction are finitarily acceptable. All of these methods\ncan be formalized in a system known as primitive recursive arithmetic\n(\\(\\PRA\\)), which allows definitions of functions by primitive\nrecursion and induction on quantifier-free formulas (ibid.). However,\nneither Hilbert nor Bernays ever claimed that only primitive\nrecursive operations count as finitary, and they in fact did use some\nnon-primitive recursive methods in ostensibly finitary consistency\nproofs already in 1923 (see\n Tait 2002\n and\n Zach 2003). \n\nThe more interesting conceptual issue is which operations\nshould be considered as finitary. Since Hilbert was less than\ncompletely clear on what the finitary standpoint consists in, there is\nsome leeway in setting up the constraints, epistemological and\notherwise, an analysis of finitist operation and proof must fulfill.\nHilbert characterized (see above) the objects of finitary number theory\nas “intuitively given,” as “surveyable in all their parts,” and said\nthat their having basic properties must “exist intuitively” for us.\n Bernays (1922, 216)\n suggests that in finitary\nmathematics, only “primitive intuitive cognitions come into play,” and\nuses the term “point of view of intuitive evidence” in connection with\nfinitism\n 1930,\n 250. This characterization of\nfinitism as primarily to do with intuition and intuitive\nknowledge has been emphasized in particular by\n (Parsons, 1998)\n who argues that what can count as\nfinitary on this understanding is not more than those arithmetical\noperations that can be defined from addition and multiplication using\nbounded recursion. In particular, according to him, exponentiation and\ngeneral primitive recursion are not finitarily acceptable. \n\nThe thesis that finitism coincides with primitive recursive reasoning\nhas received a forceful defense by\n(Tait 1981; see\nalso 2002 and 2005b).\nTait, in contrast to Parsons, rejects the aspect of representability\nin intuition as the hallmark of the finitary; instead he takes\nfinitary reasoning to be “a minimal kind of reasoning presupposed\nby all non-trivial mathematical reasoning about numbers.” and\nanalyzes finitary operations and methods of proof as those that are\nimplicit in the very notion of number as the form of a finite\nsequence. This analysis of finitism is supported by Hilbert’s\ncontention that finitary reasoning is a precondition for logical and\nmathematical, indeed any scientific thinking\n Hilbert (1931b, 267).\n Since finitary reasoning\nis that part of mathematics which is presupposed by all non-trivial\nreasoning about numbers, it is, so Tait, “indubitable” in a Cartesian\nsense, and this indubitability as all that would be required of\nfinitary reasoning to provide the epistemological grounding of\nmathematics Hilbert intended it for. \n\nAnother interesting analysis of finitary proof, which, however, does\nnot provide as detailed a philosophical justification, was proposed\n by\n Kreisel (1960).\n It yields the result that\nexactly those functions are finitary which can be proved to be total in\nfirst-order arithmetic \\(\\PA\\). It is based on the proof-theoretic\nconcept of a reflection principle; see Zach (2006)\n for more detail and Dean (2015) for an analysis.\n Kreisel (1970, Section 3.5)\n provides another analysis by focusing on what\nis “visualizable.” The result is the same: finitary provability turns\nout to be coextensive with provability in \\(\\PA\\). \n\nTait’s technical analysis yields that the finitistic functions are\nexactly the primitive recursive ones, and the finitistic\nnumber-theoretic truths are exactly those provable in the theory of\nprimitive recursive arithmetic \\(\\PRA\\). It is important to\nstress that this analysis is not carried out from within the finitist\nviewpoint itself. Since the general notions of “function”\nand “proof” are not themselves finitary, the finitist is\nunable to make sense of Tait’s thesis that everything provable\nin \\(\\PRA\\) is finitistically true. According to Tait, a proper\nanalysis of finitistic provability must not assume that finitism\nitself has access to such non-finitistic notions. Kreisel’s approach\nand some criticisms of Tait that rely on reflection principles or\n\\(\\omega\\)-rules run afoul of this requirement (see\nTait 2002, 2005b). On\nthe other hand, one could argue that \\(\\PRA\\) is too strong a\ntheory to count as a formalization of what is “presupposed by\nall non-trivial mathematical reasoning about numbers”: there are\nweaker but non-trivial theories which are related to smaller classes\nof functions than the primitive recursive ones, such as \\(\\PV\\)\nand \\(\\EA\\), related to the polynomial-time and Kalmar-elementary\nfunctions respectively (see Avigad 2003 on\nhow much mathematics can be carried out in \\(\\EA)\\). Using an\nanalysis along the same lines as Tait’s,\n Ganea (2010) has arrived at the\n corresponding class of Kalmar-elementary\nfunctions as those that are finitistic. \n\n Weyl (1925)\n was a conciliatory reaction to\nHilbert’s proposal in\n 1922b\n and\n 1923,\n which nevertheless contained some\nimportant criticisms. Weyl described Hilbert’s project as replacing\ncontentual mathematics by a meaningless game of formulas. He noted that\nHilbert wanted to “secure not truth, but the\nconsistency of analysis” and suggested a criticism that echoes\nan earlier one by Frege: Why should we take consistency of a formal\nsystem of mathematics as a reason to believe in the truth of the\npre-formal mathematics it codifies? Is Hilbert’s meaningless inventory\nof formulas not just “the bloodless ghost of analysis”? Weyl suggested\na solution: \n\nThe analogy with physics is striking, and one can find similar ideas\nin Hilbert’s own writing—perhaps Hilbert was influenced in this by\nWeyl. Although Hilbert’s first proposals focused exclusively on\nconsistency, there is a noticeable development in Hilbert’s thinking in\nthe direction of a general reductivist project of a sort quite common\nin the philosophy of science at the time (as was pointed out by\n Giaquinto 1983).\n In the second half of the\n1920s, Hilbert replaced the consistency program with a conservativity\nprogram: Formalized mathematics was to be considered by analogy with\ntheoretical physics. The ultimate justification for the theoretical\npart lies in its conservativity over “real” mathematics: whenever\ntheoretical, “ideal” mathematics proves a “real” proposition, that\nproposition is also intuitively true. This justifies the use of\ntransfinite mathematics: it is not only internally consistent, but it\nproves only true intuitive propositions (and indeed all, since a\nformalization of intuitive mathematics is part of the formalization of\nall mathematics). \n\nIn\n 1926,\n Hilbert introduced a distinction\nbetween real and ideal formulas. This distinction was not present in\n 1922b\n and only hinted at in\n 1923.\n In the latter, Hilbert presents first a\nformal system of quantifier-free number theory about which he says that\n“The provable formulae we acquire in this way all have the character of\nthe finite” (1139). Then the transfinite axioms (i.e., quantifiers) are\nadded to simplify and complete the theory (1144). Here he draws the\nanalogy with the method of ideal elements for the first time: “In my\nproof theory, the transfinite axioms and formulae are adjoined to the\nfinite axioms, just as in the theory of complex variables the imaginary\nelements are adjoined to the real, and just as in geometry the ideal\nconstructions are adjoined to the actual” (ibid). When Hilbert, in\n 1926\n explicitly introduces the notion of an\nideal proposition, and in\n 1928,\n when he first\nspeaks of real propositions in addition to the ideal, he is\nquite clear that the real part of the theory consists only of\ndecidable, variable-free formulas. They are supposed to be “directly\ncapable of verification”—akin to propositions derived from laws of\nnature which can be checked by experiment\n (1928,\n 475). The new picture of the program was\nthis: Classical mathematics is to be formalized in a system which\nincludes formalizations of all the directly verifiable (by calculation)\npropositions of contentual finite number theory. The consistency proof\nshould show that all real propositions which can be proved by ideal\nmethods are true, i.e., can be directly verified by finite calculation.\n(Actual proofs such as the \\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution had always been of\nsuch a kind: provide finitary procedures which eliminate transfinite\nelements from proofs of real statements, in particular, of \\(0 = 1\\).)\nIndeed, Hilbert saw that something stronger is true: not only does a\nconsistency proof establish truth of real formulas provable by ideal\nmethods, but it yields finitary proofs of finitary general propositions\nif the corresponding free-variable formula is derivable by ideal\nmethods\n (1928,\n 474). \n\nHilbert suggested further restrictions on the theory in addition to\nconservativity: simplicity, brevity of proofs, “economy of thought” and\nmathematical productivity. The formal system of transfinite logic is\nnot arbitrary: “This formula game is carried out according to certain\ndefinite rules, in which the technique of our thinking is\nexpressed. […] The fundamental idea of my proof theory is none other\nthan to describe the activity of our understanding, to make a protocol\nof the rules according to which our thinking actually proceeds”\n (Hilbert, 1928,\n 475). When\n Weyl (1928)\n eventually turned away from\nintuitionism (for the reasons, see\n Mancosu and Ryckman, 2002),\n he emphasized this motivation of Hilbert’s\nproof theory: not to turn mathematics into a meaningless game of\nsymbols, but to turn it into a theoretical science which codifies\nscientific (mathematical) practice. \n\nHilbert’s formalism was thus quite sophisticated: It avoided two\ncrucial objections: (1) If the formulas of the system are meaningless,\nhow can derivability in the system generate any kind of belief? (2) Why\naccept the system of \\(\\PA\\) and not any other consistent system?\nBoth objections are familiar from Frege; both questions are (in part)\nanswered by a conservativity proof for real statements. For (2),\nfurthermore, Hilbert has a naturalistic criterion of acceptance: we are\nconstrained in the choice of systems by considerations of simplicity,\nfecundity, uniformity, and by what mathematicians actually do; Weyl\nwould add that the ultimate test of a theory would be its usefulness in\nphysics. \n\nMost philosophers of mathematics writing on Hilbert have read him as\nan instrumentalist (including\n Kitcher 1976,\n Resnik 1980,\n Giaquinto 1983,\n Sieg 1990,\n and in particular\n Detlefsen 1986)\n in that they read Hilbert’s\nexplanation that the ideal propositions “have no meaning in\n themselves”\n (Hilbert, 1926,\n 381) as claiming that\nclassical mathematics is a mere instrument, and that\nstatements of transfinite mathematics have no truth value. To the\nextent that this is accurate, it must be understood as a methodological\ninstrumentalism: A successful execution of the proof-theoretic program\nwould show that one could pretend as if mathematics was\nmeaningless. The analogy with physics is therefore not: transfinite\npropositions have no meaning just as propositions involving theoretical\nterms have no meaning, but: transfinite propositions require no direct\nintuitive meaning just as one does not have to directly see electrons\nin order to theorize about them.\n Hallett (1990),\n taking into account the 19th century mathematical\nbackground from which Hilbert came as well as published and unpublished\nsources from Hilbert’s entire career (in particular\n Hilbert 1992,\n the most extensive discussion of\nthe method of ideal elements) comes to the following conclusion: \n\nThere has been some debate over the impact of\n Gödel’s\nincompleteness theorems on Hilbert’s Program, and whether it was the\nfirst or the second incompleteness theorem that delivered the coup\nde grâce. Undoubtedly the opinion of those most directly\ninvolved in the developments were convinced that the theorems did have\na decisive impact. Gödel announced the second incompleteness\ntheorem in an abstract published in October 1930: no consistency proof\nof systems such as Principia,\n Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or\nthe systems investigated by Ackermann and von Neumann is possible by\nmethods which can be formulated in these systems. In the full version\nof his paper,\n Gödel (1931)\n left open the\npossibility that there could be finitary methods which are not\nformalizable in these systems and which would yield the required\nconsistency proofs. Bernays’s first reaction in a letter to Gödel\nin January 1931 was likewise that “if, as von Neumann does, one takes\nit as certain that any and every finitary consideration may be\nformalized within the system \\(P\\)—like you, I regard that in no\nway as settled—one comes to the conclusion that a finitary\ndemonstration of the consistency of \\(P\\) is impossible”\n (Gödel, 2003a,\n 87). \n\nHow do Gödel’s theorems impact Hilbert’s program?\nThrough a careful (“Gödel”-) coding of sequences of\nsymbols (formulas, proofs), Gödel showed that in theories \\(T\\)\nwhich contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic, it is possible to\nproduce a formula \\(Pr(x, y)\\) which “says” that \\(x\\) is\n(the code of) a proof of (the formula with code) \\(y\\).  Specifically,\nif \\(\\ulcorner 0 = 1\\urcorner\\) is the code of the formula \\(0 = 1\\),\nthen \\(Con_T = \\forall x \\neg Pr(x,\\ulcorner 0 =\n1\\urcorner)\\) may be taken to “say” that \\(T\\) is\nconsistent (no number is the code of a derivation in \\(T\\) of \\(0 =\n1)\\). The second incompleteness theorem (G2) says that says that under\ncertain assumptions about \\(T\\) and the coding apparatus, \\(T\\) does\nnot prove \\(Con_T\\). Now suppose there were a finitary\nconsistency proof of \\(T\\). The methods used in such a proof would\npresumably be formalizable in \\(T\\). (“Formalizable” means\nthat, roughly, if the proof uses a finitary operation \\(f\\) on\nderivations which transforms any derivation \\(D\\) into a derivation\n\\(f (D)\\) of a simple form; then there is a formula \\(F(x, y)\\) so\nthat, for all derivations \\(D,T \\vdash F(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner\n,\\ulcorner f (D)\\urcorner)\\).) The consistency of \\(T\\) would be\nfinitarily expressed as the general hypothetical that, if \\(D\\) is any\ngiven sequence of symbols, \\(D\\) is not a derivation in \\(T\\) of the\nformula \\(0 = 1\\). The formalization of this proposition is the\nformula \\(\\neg Pr(x,\\ulcorner 0 = 1\\urcorner)\\) in which the variable\n\\(x\\) occurs free. If there were a finitary proof of the consistency\nof \\(T\\), its formalization would yield a derivation in \\(T\\) of\n\\(\\neg Pr_T (x,\\ulcorner 0 = 1\\urcorner)\\), from\nwhich \\(Con_T\\) can be derived in \\(T\\) by simple universal\ngeneralization on \\(x\\). Yet, a derivation of\n\\(Con_T\\) in \\(T\\) is ruled out by G2. \n\nAs mentioned above, initially Gödel and Bernays thought that\nthe difficulty for the consistency proof of \\(\\PA\\) could be\novercome by employing methods which, although not formalizable in\n\\(\\PA\\), are nonetheless finitary. Whether such methods would be\nconsidered finitary according to the original conception of finitism or\nconstitute an extension of the original finitist viewpoint is a matter\nof debate. The new methods considered included a finitary version of\nthe \\(\\omega\\)-rule proposed by Hilbert\n (1931b;\n 1931a).\n It is fair to say, however, that\nafter about 1934 it has been almost universally accepted that the\nmethods of proof accepted as finitary prior to Gödel’s results are\nall formalizable in \\(\\PA\\). Extensions of the original finitist\nstandpoint have been proposed and defended on broadly finitary grounds,\ne.g.,\n Gentzen (1936)\n defended the use of\ntransfinite induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) in his consistency\nproof for \\(\\PA\\) as “indisputable,”\n Takeuti (1987)\n gave another defense.\n Gödel (1958)\n presented another extension of the finitist standpoint; the\nwork of Kreisel mentioned above may be seen as another attempt to\nextend finitism while retaining the spirit of Hilbert’s original\nconception. \n\nA different attempt at providing a way around Gödel’s second\ntheorem for Hilbert’s Program was proposed by Detlefsen\n (1986;\n 2001;\n 1979).\n Detlefsen presents several lines of\ndefense, one of which is similar to the one just described: arguing\nthat a version of the \\(\\omega\\)-rule is finitarily acceptable, although\nnot capable of formalization (however, see\n Ignjatovic 1994).\n Detlefsen’s other argument\nagainst the common interpretation of Gödel’s second theorem\nfocuses on the notion of formalization: That the particular\nformalization of “\\(T\\) is consistent” by Gödel’s formula\n\\(Con_T\\) is not provable does not imply that there\ncouldn’t be other formulas, which are provable in \\(T\\),\nand which have as much right to be called “formalizations of the\nconsistency of \\(T\\).” These rely on different formalizations of\nthe provability predicate \\(Pr_T\\) than the standard\nones. It is known that formalized consistency statements are unprovable\nwhenever the provability predicate obeys certain general derivability\nconditions. Detlefsen argues that these conditions are not necessary\nfor a predicate to count as a genuine provability predicate, and indeed\nthere are provability predicates which violate the provability\nconditions and which give rise to consistency formulas which\nare provable in their corresponding theories. These, however,\ndepend on non-standard conceptions of provability which would likely\nnot have been accepted by Hilbert (see also\n Resnik 1974,\n Auerbach 1992\n and\n Steiner 1991). \n\n Smorynski (1977)\n has argued that already\nthe first incompleteness theorem defeats Hilbert’s Program. Hilbert’s\naim was not merely to show that formalized mathematics is consistent,\nbut to do so in a specific way by showing that ideal mathematics can\nnever lead to conclusions not in accord with real mathematics. Thus, to\nsucceed, ideal mathematics must be conservative over the real\npart: whenever formalized ideal mathematics proves a real formula\n\\(P, P\\) itself (or the finitary proposition it\nexpresses) must be finitarily provable. For Smorynski the real formulas\ninclude not just numerical equalities and combinations thereof, but\nalso general formulas with free variables but without unbounded\nquantifiers. \n\nNow Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem (G1) states that for\nany sufficiently strong, consistent formal theory \\(S\\) there is a\nsentence \\(G_S\\) which is true but not derivable in\n\\(S\\). \\(G_S\\) is a real sentence according to\nSmorynski’s definition. Now consider a theory \\(T\\) which\nformalizes ideal mathematics and its subtheory \\(S\\) which\nformalizes real mathematics. \\(S\\) satisfies the conditions of G1\nand hence \\(S\\) does not derive \\(G_S\\). Yet,\n\\(T\\), being a formalization of all of mathematics (including what\nis required to see that \\(G_S\\) is true), does derive\n\\(G_S\\). Hence, we have a real statement which is\nprovable in ideal mathematics and not in real mathematics. Detlefsen (1986, Appendix; see also\n 1990) has defended Hilbert’s Program\nagainst this argument as well. Detlefsen argues that\n“Hilbertian” instrumentalism escapes the argument from G1\nby denying that ideal mathematics must be conservative over the real\npart; all that is required is real-soundness. Hilbertian\ninstrumentalism requires only that the ideal theory not prove anything\nwhich is in conflict with the real theory; it is not required that it\nprove only real statements which the real theory also\nproves. (See Zach 2006 for more on the issue of\nconservativity and consistency, the relevant section in\nthe entry on Gödel\nfor further discussion, Franks 2009 for a\nrelated defense and re-evaluation of Hilbert’s project, and McCarthy 2016 for an alternative approach to the provability of consistency and G2 due to Gödel himself.) \n\nEven if no finitary consistency proof of arithmetic can be given,\nthe question of finding consistency proofs is nevertheless of value:\nthe methods used in such proofs, although they must go beyond Hilbert’s\noriginal sense of finitism, might provide genuine insight into the\nconstructive content of arithmetic and stronger theories. What\nGödel’s result showed was that there can be no absolute\nconsistency proof of all of mathematics; hence work in proof theory\nafter Gödel concentrated on relative results, both: relative to\nthe system for which a consistency proof was given, and relative to the\nproof methods used. \n\nReductive proof theory in this sense has followed two traditions:\nthe first, mainly carried out by proof theorists following Gentzen and\nSchütte, has pursued a program of what is called ordinal\nanalysis, and is exemplified by Gentzen’s first consistency proof\nof \\(\\PA\\) by induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0 .\n\\varepsilon_0\\) is a certain transfinite (though countable)\nordinal, however, “induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\)” in the sense\nused here is not a genuinely transfinite procedure. Ordinal analysis\ndoes not operate with infinite ordinal numbers, but rather with\nordinal notation systems which themselves can be formalized\nin very weak (essentially, finitary) systems. An ordinal analysis of a\nsystem \\(T\\) is given if: (a) one can produce an ordinal notation\nsystem which mimics the ordinals less than some ordinal \\(\\alpha_T\\)\nso that (b) it can be proved finitarily that the formalization\n\\(TI(\\alpha_T)\\) of the principle of induction up to \\(\\alpha_T\\)\nimplies the consistency of \\(T\\) (i.e., \\(S \\vdash\nTI(\\alpha_T)\\rightarrow Con_T)\\) and (c) \\(T\\) proves \\(TI(\\beta)\\)\nfor all \\(\\beta \\lt \\alpha_T\\) (\\(S\\) is a theory formalizing finitary\nmetamathematics and is generally a weak sub-theory of \\(T)\\). To have\nany foundational significance it is also required that one can give a\nconstructive argument for transfinite induction up to \\(\\alpha_T\\). As\nmentioned above, this was done for by Gentzen and Takeuti for\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\), the proof theoretic ordinal of \\(\\PA\\), but becomes\nmore difficult and of progressively questionable philosophical\nsignificance for stronger theories. \n\nA philosophically more satisfactory continuation of Hilbert’s\nProgram in proof theoretic terms has been suggested by Kreisel\n (1983;\n 1968)\n and\nFeferman\n (Feferman, 1988;\n Feferman, 1993a).\n This work proceeds from a\nwider conception of Hilbert’s Program as an attempt to justify ideal\nmathematics by restricted means. In this conception, the aim of\nHilbert’s proof theory was to show that, at least as far as a certain\nclass of real propositions is concerned, ideal mathematics does not go\nbeyond real mathematics. A finitary consistency proof of the kind\nenvisaged by Hilbert would have accomplished this: if ideal mathematics\nproves a real proposition, then this proposition is already provable by\nreal (i.e., finitary) methods. In a sense this reduces ideal\nmathematics to real mathematics. A proof-theoretic reduction\nof a theory \\(T\\) to a theory \\(S\\) shows that, as far as a\ncertain class of propositions is concerned, if \\(T\\) proves a\nproposition, then \\(S\\) proves it too, and the proof of this fact\nis itself finitary. Hilbert’s proof theoretic program can then be seen\nto be a search for a proof theoretic reduction of all of mathematics to\nfinitary mathematics; in a relativized program one looks for reductions\nof theories weaker than all of classical mathematics to theories often\nstronger than finitary mathematics. Proof theorists have obtained a\nnumber of such results, including reductions of theories which on their\nface require a significant amount of ideal mathematics for their\njustification (e.g., subsystems of analysis) to finitary systems.\n (Feferman, 1993b)\n has used such results in\ncombination with other results that show that most, if not all, of\nscientifically applicable mathematics can be carried out in systems for\nwhich such reductions are available to argue against the\n indispensability argument\n in the\nphilosophy of mathematics. The philosophical significance of such proof\ntheoretic reductions is currently the subject of debate\n (Hofweber, 2000;\n Feferman, 2000). \n\nThe program of so-called reverse mathematics developed by, in\nparticular, Friedman and Simpson, is another continuation of Hilbert’s\nprogram. In the face of Gödel’s results showing that not all of\nclassical mathematics can be reduced to the finitary, they seek to\nanswer the question: how much of classical mathematics can be so\nreduced? Reverse mathematics seeks to give a precise answer to this\nquestion by investigating which theorems of classical mathematics are\nprovable in weak subsystems of analysis which are reducible to finitary\nmathematics (in the sense discussed in the preceding paragraph). A\ntypical result is that the Hahn-Banach theorem of functional analysis\nis provable in a theory known as \\(WKL_0\\) (for “weak\nKönig lemma”); \\(WKL_0\\) is conservative over\n\\(\\PRA\\) for \\(\\Pi^{0}_2\\) sentences (i.e., sentences of the form\n\\(\\forall x\\exists yA(x, y)\\).\n(See\n Simpson 1988\n for an overview and\n Simpson 1999\n for a technical treatment.)","contact.mail":"rzach@ucalgary.ca","contact.domain":"ucalgary.ca"}]
