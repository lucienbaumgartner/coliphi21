Unlike Pyrrho, he\nwrote numerous poems and prose works; fragments of and reports on some\nof these have survived, by far the largest number (more than sixty)\nbeing from the Silloi (Lampoons). Several of these\nworks were devoted to, or at least included, laudatory descriptions of\nPyrrho and his philosophy; the Silloi appears to have\ncontained some passages in this vein, but consisted largely of\nsatirical thumbnail sketches of a wide range of other philosophers, all\nof whom, in Timon’s estimation, failed wholly or partly to achieve the\nideal outlook exemplified by Pyrrho. Despite the hazards of attempting\nto extrapolate from this meager and highly colored material, it\nconstitutes much the best evidence we have for the character of\nPyrrho’s thought. There is, however, some indication that Timon also\ntook stands on philosophical matters about which Pyrrho is unlikely to\nhave had anything to say. And even when he can be assumed to be\nemulating Pyrrho’s frame of mind, he may sometimes be expanding on or\nadapting Pyrrho’s original position rather than simply reporting it. He\nshould not, then, be regarded as a mere carbon copy of his teacher.\n\n\n\nThe present article concentrates on the nature of Timon’s writings,\nand on contributions to philosophy that may be thought to be original\nwith him.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of a number of slender indications, Timon’s date of\nbirth is generally set at around 325–320 BCE and his date of death at\naround 235–230 BCE. For the details of his life we are wholly dependent\non the brief account in Diogenes Laertius (9.109–115) (see the entry on \n doxography of ancient philosophy); \nDiogenes wrote perhaps in the early to mid-third\ncentury CE, but his account claims to be drawn from several earlier\nsources. According to Diogenes, Timon initially studied (after an\nearly career as a dancer in his home town of Phlius, an inland city of\nthe Peloponnese not far from the gulf of Corinth) with Stilpo of\nMegara. After an interval in which he returned home and married, he\nthen went to Elis, in the northwest corner of the\nPeloponnese,  to study with Pyrrho. Diogenes makes it sound as if\nhis stay at Elis was relatively brief; he says that it lasted until\nTimon had children (9.109), and that at that point he was compelled to\ngo elsewhere to make money as a sophist, or paid teacher of\nphilosophical and other theory to late adolescent young men. But\nwhatever the length of his association with Pyrrho, Timon became an\nadherent of Pyrrho’s philosophy from then on. His activities as a\nsophist (whatever exactly these involved) appear to have left him\nfinancially secure; we are told that he then went to Athens and lived\nthere (except for a short stay at Thebes) until his death. Diogenes\nnames two kings with whom he was acquainted, and several poets with\nwhom he collaborated; it is difficult to know what to make of this\ninformation, although the recent work of Clayman (2010) has shown, by\nmeans of detailed parallels with contemporary poetry, that he was\ndeeply immersed in the poetic world of his time. During his time at\nAthens—probably several decades—he is likely also to have\nmade the acquaintance of the leading philosophers of the time;\nDiogenes includes anecdotes featuring him making fun of\nArcesilaus, who was head of the \nAcademy\n during most or all of this time, but he no doubt encountered Stoics\nand Epicureans as well. That no representatives of any of these schools\nrefer to him in any surviving records is perhaps not surprising, given\nthe scathing critiques that are implicit in his portraits of them in\nthe Silloi. \n\nThe Silloi, in hexameter verse, has already been mentioned.\nThe other poem from which a few fragments survive was called\nIndalmoi (Images or Appearances), which was\nin elegiac couplets (alternating hexameters and pentameters). The\nsignificance of this title is by no means clear. It might refer to the\n“appearances” on the basis of which Pyrrhonists are\ncompelled to make their decisions; one of the surviving lines from the\npoem reads “But the appearance [to phainomenon] is\npowerful everywhere, wherever it comes” (quoted in Diogenes\nLaertius 9.105), and most scholars have taken this to point to the\nimportance of appearances in shaping our actions. Another possibility\nis that the ‘images’ referred to in the title are images\nof Pyrrho himself, and that the poem was a depiction of Pyrrho and his\nblissful tranquility; the longest surviving fragment from the\npoem—a sequence of seven lines pieced together from three\npassages in Diogenes Laertius and Sextus Empiricus—certainly\nfits this description. A third suggestion is that ‘images’\nor ‘appearances’ is to be taken in a negative sense,\nreferring to the fictions or illusions by which naive non-Pyrrhonists\nare taken in. Possible support for this comes from a single pentameter\nline, which is regularly assigned to the\nIndalmoi because of the meter. This reads “but these\nthings are judged by mind [or: by convention] on the part of\nhumans” (Sextus Empiricus M 11.140); the context\nsuggests that the ‘things’ in question are things\n(wrongly) taken to be by nature good or bad. None of these proposals\nas to the character of the work can be ruled out, but none can be\nregarded as more than conjecture. With the exception of a four-line\nfragment about “the nature of the divine and the good”,\nwhich is probably the most contentious of all the fragments of Timon,\nno other lines survive beyond the three passages just referred\nto. (See the discussion of “The Nature of the Divine and the\nGood” in Section 6 of the entry on\n Pyrrho,\n for a brief account of the difficulties\nsurrounding this fragment.) Nor do we have any general description of\nthe work (unlike in the case of the Silloi—see the next\nsection); Diogenes Laertius does not even include it in his list of\nTimon’s works, although he does elsewhere cite it. Thus despite the\nimportance of the few surviving pieces of the Indalmoi, the\npoem as a whole is almost entirely opaque to us. \n\nDiogenes (9.110) claims that, in addition to the poems already\nmentioned, Timon wrote sixty tragedies and thirty comedies, as well as\nepics, satyr plays and kinaidoi (usually translated\n‘obscene poems’—kinaidos normally means\n‘catamite’; see Strabo 14.1.41, Athenaeus XIV.620e–f for\nwhat appear to be other references to the same verse form). He says\nthat Timon indulged in poetry while taking time off from philosophy;\nbut the poems he lists in this context include the\nSilloi, which certainly qualifies as part of Timon’s\nphilosophical activity. The report is confused in other ways as well;\nin any case, no trace of this voluminous non-philosophical corpus, if\nit ever existed, seems to have survived. (There are a few lines of\nTimon’s verse that cannot be definitely attributed to either the\nSilloi or the Indalmoi; but there is no particular\nreason to believe that they derive from any of these other works.) \n\nThe remaining works attributed to Timon are prose works. Of these the\nmost important is the Pytho. We are told (by Aristocles in\nEusebius,\nPraeparatio evangelica 14.18.14) that this described a meeting\nand a dialogue between Timon and Pyrrho; Timon portrayed himself as\nencountering Pyrrho by a temple, as he was walking towards Pytho (the\nregion that included Delphi). Whether the work itself was in dialogue\nform, or merely recounted a dialogue in the third person, is not clear.\nBut it appears that this dialogue consisted of a thorough presentation\nof Pyrrho’s outlook and demeanor; Diogenes Laertius, in what seems to\nbe a reference to the same work (9.67), says that Timon\n‘clarifies’ (diasaphei) Pyrrho’s disposition\n(diathesin) in the account that he ‘goes through’\n(diexeisin, a word often used of detailed exposition). This\naccount will presumably have been placed in Pyrrho’s mouth, with Timon\nhimself depicted as an eager pupil. (This motif seems to have been a\nrecurring one in Timon’s writings; fragments from both the\nSilloi and the Indalmoi consist of questions put to\nPyrrho—most probably by Timon himself as speaker—about how he\nmanages to sustain his tranquility.) There is one quotation from the\nPytho and one further report about a statement that it\nincluded; both are of some philosophical significance, and will be\ntouched on below, but neither furnishes any additional clues concerning\nthe general character of the Pytho itself. It has usually been\nthought that the setting of the dialogue has symbolic significance\n(Delphi being the seat of the important oracle of Apollo), but the\ninterpretations that have been offered of this are various. Aristocles\noffers a summary of an account by Timon of the central points of\nPyrrho’s philosophy, and this is often thought to have occurred in the\nPytho; but this is no more than plausible speculation. (The\nsummary itself, however, is crucial for the reconstruction of Pyrrho’s\nviews; for discussion see the entry on\n Pyrrho.) \n\nDiogenes (9.105) mentions a work called On the Senses and\nSextus (M 3.2) mentions a work called Against the\nPhysicists. Again, the specific words or ideas that are attributed\nto Timon in these contexts deserve some discussion, but they tell us\nlittle or nothing about the works themselves, beyond what the titles\nwould anyway suggest. It is worth noting, however, that there is no\nindication that these works consisted of or included exposition of\nPyrrho’s philosophy. Finally, Diogenes tells us (9.115) that Timon\npraised Arcesilaus (who, during Timon’s lifetime, took the Academy in a\nskeptical direction) in a work called Arcesilaus’ Funeral\nBanquet—this by contrast with his attacks on him in the\nSilloi, as Diogenes mentions and as we can confirm from the\nsurviving fragments. This work is generally taken as evidence that\nTimon outlived Arcesilaus. But given Timon’s penchant for elaborate\nnarrative conceits, the inference is hazardous. As Clayman (2010),\n13–15 has made clear, the funeral banquet was a recognized\nparodic verse form dating back to before Timon’s day, and by no means\nrequires that its subjects be actually deceased; the genre also gives\nus grounds for wondering whether the praise of Arcesilaus was partly\nor even wholly mock-praise. \n\nLiterary devices appear to have been extensively employed in the\nSilloi. Diogenes Laertius tells us (9.111) that the\nSilloi was divided into three books. In the first book Timon\nspoke solely in the first person, whereas the second and third took the\nform of dialogues between Timon himself and the early (late 6th c. BCE)\nphilosopher\nXenophanes. Timon is said to\nhave questioned Xenophanes about every philosopher—the older ones\nin the second book and the more recent in the third book—and\nXenophanes answered him. The work as a whole, however, was devoted to\nabuse and ridicule of non-Pyrrhonist philosophers. It looks as if part\nof the work was modeled after the famous scene in Odyssey\nBook XI where Odysseus visits the underworld; several fragments\ninclude the words ‘I saw’ or ‘I recognized’\n(where the person seen or recognized is a dead philosopher), and this\nformula is highly reminiscent of Odysseus’ language in describing his\nencounters with his dead comrades. There are other echoes of Homer as\nwell, most notably from the early books of the Iliad, the\neffect being to represent philosophical disputants as literal\ncombatants. Clayman (2010), chapter 3 identifies two other likely\nscenes: “Marketplace of Ideas” in which philosophers are shown selling\ntheir ideas, and “Hyde Park Corner”, in which philosophers address\ncrowds. Clayman, however, convincingly argues against the hypothesis\nof a fishing scene, accepted by several earlier scholars; the\nfragments that have been taken to depict philosophers as fishers or as\nfish frequently do not need to be, or even lend themselves especially\nto being, interpreted in this way. \n\nTimon is indebted for his style and tone in the Silloi to a\ntradition of moralizing diatribe prevalent among the Cynics. The word\ntuphos, ‘vanity,’ was a favorite Cynic term of\ninvective, and it occurs in several fragments from the Silloi,\nas do a number of related terms. The Cynic Crates also wrote satirical\nverses; one of the few surviving fragments of Crates begins “And\nI saw Stilpo enduring severe pains in Megara,” which is a parody\nof a line from Odyssey XI and again seems to assimilate a\nphilosophical encounter to Odysseus’ underworld encounters. Crates’\nwritings may well, then, have been an important influence on the\nSilloi (on this see Long 1978). A more distant inspiration was\nXenophanes, who can plausibly be seen as the originator of the genre of\nphilosophical satire in which Timon was writing. (Later sources even\ngive Silloi as the title of a poem by Xenophanes; but it is\nnot clear whether this title was attached to the poem before or only\nafter Timon’s day.) This is surely part of the reason for Timon’s\nchoice of Xenophanes as the main character in the second and third\nbooks. \n\nBut there were philosophical as well as literary reasons for this\nchoice, and this takes us into the question of the outlook projected by\nthe poem. In one of the two surviving fragments concerned with\nXenophanes, he is referred to as hupatuphos, ‘partly\nfree from tuphos.’ Pyrrho is the only one who managed to\nbe entirely ‘free from tuphos’ (atuphos);\nbut in the highly critical context of the Silloi, the epithet\nhupatuphos already raises Xenophanes above almost all the\nother philosophers who appear in the poem. The specific point for which\nTimon singles him out for this qualified praise is that he was a\n“mocker of Homeric deception.” This clearly refers to\nXenophanes’ criticism of Homer’s (and Hesiod’s) anthropomorphic\ndepiction of the gods (in which, among other typically human faults,\nthey engage in deception—Timon’s coinage ‘of Homeric\ndeception’ (Homêrapatês) may very well be a\nreflection of this point). This is not to say, however, that Timon\nwholly approves of Xenophanes’ theological stance. For Xenophanes’\npositive view, according to which there is one unchanging god, appears\nto be a target for criticism in the same fragment (which is why he\nqualifies only as partly free from tuphos). In fact, it looks\nas if Timon is suspicious of theological pronouncements of any kind.\nFor in another fragment Timon (very unusually among ancient\ncommentators) praises Protagoras for his agnostic attitude towards\nthe gods. This is understandable\ngiven the general framework supplied by Pyrrho; however precisely\nPyrrho’s thought is interpreted, he clearly rejected physical\nspeculation—and it was under that heading that speculation about the\ngods was taken, in the Hellenistic period, to belong. \n\nIn another fragment Xenophanes is represented as regretting his\nfailure to ‘look both ways’ (to be\namphoterobleptos), and so embracing an ill-considered monism.\n(This interpretation of Xenophanes, which assimilates him to the\nEleatics, is highly disputable given the surviving fragments, but was\ncommon in the ancient world.) The ability to ‘look both\nways’ is therefore presented as a positive characteristic, and\nthis is echoed in two other fragments. \n\nZeno of Elea\n is described as ‘double-tongued’\n(amphoteroglôssos)—presumably on the basis of his\nparadoxes arguing for two opposite conclusions—and Democritus is\ndescribed as ‘two-minded’ (amphinoon); the\ncontexts make clear that these, too, are intended as positive\nappellations. Timon is eager, then, to reject any fixed or one-sided\nview of reality. Again, the precise interpretation of this attitude\nwill depend in part on one’s conception of Pyrrho’s philosophy; but the\nlink with a Pyrrhonist outlook is, at a general level, not hard to see.\nIn the same fragment Xenophanes is also pictured as regretting his\nfailure to engage in skeptosunê. It is tempting to read\nthis as an early occurrence of the notion of skepticism familiar to us\nfrom the later Pyrrhonist (or Neo-Pyrrhonist) Sextus Empiricus. But\nthere is no clear reason for doing so; the term may just mean\n‘inquiry’ in the usual sense, and Xenophanes may simply be\nbemoaning his inadequate investigation of things. \n\nZeno is not the only Eleatic thinker to receive favorable treatment\nin the Silloi. Timon calls Parmenides\n‘high-minded’ and ‘not full of opinions,’ and\nsays that he “elevated our thought-processes from the deception\nof appearance.” This clearly refers to Parmenides’ rejection of\nordinary common-sense views of reality, and of the senses as an\nadequate guide to the nature of reality; and it is no doubt on the same\ngrounds that Parmenides’ follower Melissus is described as “above\nmany illusions and yielding to few.” This, of course, indicates\nthat Melissus did go wrong in certain respects, but that is not\nsurprising. As was suggested in the previous paragraph, Timon would\nhave had little sympathy for the Eleatics’ positive doctrines; he\nregards them as valuable because they refuse to accept any\nsimple-minded conception according to which things are as they\nseem. \n\nAs was mentioned in the previous section, Timon’s picture of\nArcesilaus, in three surviving fragments of the Silloi,\nappears wholly uncomplimentary; although the imagery in these fragments\n(shorn of their surrounding context) is not entirely perspicuous, the\ngeneral impression seems to be of an unoriginal and self-important\nfool. This may seem surprising given the points just mentioned; one\nmight have expected that Arcesilaus’ skepticism would have struck Timon\nas highly congenial. However, there do clearly seem to have been some\ndifferences in temperament and approach between Arcesilaus and Pyrrho;\nand this may be a case (of a kind common in intellectual history) where\nbroad common ground led to especially intense rivalry over differences\nthat, from an outsider’s perspective, might have seemed\ninsignificant. \n\nWe only have one fragment specifically cited from the\nSilloi in which Pyrrho himself is the subject; one other about\nPyrrho is regularly and probably correctly assigned to the\nSilloi, and the same is true of a third fragment about\nPyrrho’s follower Philo. In all three fragments (as in the fragment on\nPyrrho from the Indalmoi) the emphasis is on the attainment of\na supremely tranquil disposition. This tranquility is associated with a\nrefusal to be involved in detailed speculations about the universe, and\nalso with not engaging in contentious disputes with philosophical\nopponents. (By contrast, several other fragments about non-Pyrrhonists\nberate them for their contentiousness.) But these fragments give few if\nany clues about the specifics of Pyrrho’s (or Timon’s) thought. The aim\nin the Silloi is clearly to evoke a certain kind of ideal\nattitude rather than to detail the means of attaining that\nattitude. \n\nThis is not to say, however, that the Silloi has no concern\nfor philosophical detail. We have seen that Timon’s remarks about those\nphilosophers of whom he partially approves often point to specific\nviews of theirs as worthy of praise or criticism. Similarly, many of\nthe fragments on philosophers with whom he has no sympathy pick on some\ncentral point in their philosophies as material for caricature—Mind\nin the case of\n Anaxagoras, for\nexample, or the four basic elements in the case of \nEmpedocles. The surviving\nfragments include portraits of most of the major Greek philosophers up\nto and including Timon’s time; like good political cartoons, they are\nsharply drawn and often savagely witty. Indeed, it is arguable that the\nintensity of the implied criticism in these fragments is at odds with\nthe calm demeanor, and the lack of concern with competitive\nphilosophical debate, that Timon elsewhere celebrates in Pyrrho. Timon\nmay have been an effective spokesman for Pyrrho’s outlook, but it is\nnot clear that he entirely succeeds in exemplifying it himself. \n\nAs was noted earlier, the surviving fragments of the\nIndalmoi include a line that is plausibly taken to point to\nthe importance, for the Pyrrhonist, of the appearances of things as a\nbasis for decision and action. Whether or not it is this theme that is\nalluded to in the title Indalmoi itself (see above, in Section\n2, Works), it looks as if this is a topic to which Timon returned in\nseveral works. The sole reference to Timon’s On the Senses is\na quotation that reads “that honey is sweet I do not posit, but\nthat it appears so I agree” (Diogenes Laertius 9.105). Both the\ncontext in Diogenes, and the obvious implication of the words\nthemselves, suggest that here too Timon is making the same point: for\npractical purposes it is both possible and legitimate for Pyrrhonists\nto let themselves be guided by appearances of things, even while they\nrigorously refrain from attributing definite characteristics to those\nthings in their real nature. On this matter Timon’s influence on the\nPyrrhonist tradition seems to have been far-reaching; the same point\nand the same example (and even the notion of “agreeing”\nthat things appear a certain way, although the Greek words are not\nidentical) reappear in the opening pages of Sextus Empiricus’\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism (1.20). \n\nThe same passage of Diogenes Laertius includes a reference to\nanother remark of Timon, this time from the Pytho; according\nto Diogenes, Timon said in this work that he had not “gone\noutside sunêtheia.” Sunêtheia can\nmean several things. But the meaning that best fits the context, and\nthe one that tends to occur in epistemological contexts in general, is\n‘ordinary experience.’ Diogenes is commenting on the\nPyrrhonists’ response to the common objection that their philosophy\namounts to a rejection of life itself. The Pyrrhonists, he says, reply\nthat this is not so, since they readily accept that things appear in\ntheir many familiar ways; it is only at the level of the underlying\nnature of things that they avoid definite pronouncements. The comment\nfrom the Pytho is then cited as an instance of this kind of\nreply. Timon, then, is apparently saying that, in allowing the\nappearances to guide his behavior, he is not doing away with our\neveryday experience of things. \n\nThe fact that Timon needs to make this statement suggests that the\naccusation regularly leveled against the Pyrrhonists (as well as the\nskeptical Academy), that it would be impossible to live in accordance\nwith their philosophy, goes back to the earliest phase of the\ntradition. It was perhaps in response to this objection that Timon\ndeveloped this position on the practical value of the appearances.\nWhile we cannot exclude the possibility that it was already an element\nin Pyrrho’s thinking, there is no evidence linking Pyrrho with any\nremarks about appearances; this may, then, be Timon’s own contribution,\nprompted by hostile criticism. \n\nThere are other instances where it is not clear whether Timon is\nsimply reproducing Pyrrho’s outlook or adding creatively to it. For\nexample, Diogenes reports that in the Pytho Timon offered a\ngloss on the phrase ‘no more’ (ouden mallon),\nnamely, ‘determining nothing and withholding assent’\n(9.76). The phrase ouden mallon became a stock Pyrrhonist\nexpression, and occurs several times in connection with Pyrrho’s own\nviews. But is Timon here giving his own distinctive explanation of the\nsignificance of this phrase? Given the meager evidence available, we\ncannot hope to settle the matter. It has even been suggested that\nlarge parts of the Pyrrhonist position expounded in the key passage of\nAristocles mentioned earlier are in fact additions by Timon to a core\nidea of Pyrrho’s. But this is controversial, and the passage as a\nwhole has generally been taken to be giving us the philosophy of\nPyrrho—though via the medium of a summary by Timon. However,\nsince so much of what we know about Pyrrho comes through Timon, the\nline between these two possibilities is often very difficult to\ndraw. \n\nThere are, though, two cases where it seems clear that Timon is\nspeaking for himself rather than reproducing the thoughts of Pyrrho.\nSextus (M 3.2) reports a comment (from Timon’s On the\nPhysicists) about the legitimacy of using hypotheses. He also\ntwice reports a remark of Timon about divisibility and time (M\n6.66, 10.197—the wording is not quite identical, but it is clearly\nthe same thought in both places); it is a reasonable supposition that\nthis too came from On the Physicists, although Sextus does not\nsay so. Now in both cases Timon is involved in a very different kind of\nactivity from anything attested for Pyrrho. He is intervening in\ntechnical philosophical debates; the very concepts at issue make this\nclear. But as we saw earlier, philosophical debate was something that\nPyrrho rigorously avoided; this was emphasized by Timon himself as one\nof the main sources of his tranquility. Again, it appears that Timon\ndoes not entirely live up to the ideal that he ascribes to his\nteacher. \n\nBeyond the fact that these are Timon’s own ideas, the amount that we\ncan learn from Sextus’ reports is less than one might have hoped. On\nthe subject of hypothesis, he simply tells us that Timon regarded it as\na question of primary importance whether anything should be assumed by\nhypothesis. The practice of assuming things by hypothesis appears to\nhave had its original home in geometry, and it is not surprising that\nthe remark is cited at the beginning of Sextus’ Against the\nGeometers. But the occurrence of the remark in a work called\nAgainst the Physicists may suggest that Timon had in mind a\nnotion of unargued assumption that was not restricted to any particular\nsubject-matter. In any case, it is a fair conjecture that Timon’s\nimplied answer to the question was ‘no’; accepting things\nby hypothesis is equivalent to accepting them without grounds, and this\nis a highly dubious procedure. If so, Timon anticipates the Mode from\nHypothesis, which is one of the Five Modes of the later Pyrrhonists\n(and where the notion of hypothesis has lost its specific link with\ngeometry). \n\nThe other claim that Sextus attributes to Timon is that no process\ndivisible into temporal parts—such as coming into being, perishing,\nand the like—can take place in an indivisible time. Sextus uses this\nas an argument for the conclusion that the present is not indivisible;\nbut there is no clear indication that this was Timon’s purpose as well.\nThe claim itself is unobjectionable, indeed almost tautological; one\ncan imagine numerous contexts in debates about the nature of time in\nwhich it might have had a point. Some scholars have sought to link it\nto doctrines current in the immediately preceding period, including\nthose of Timon’s first teacher Stilpo of Megara. But again, it is hard\nto connect such a trivially true statement with any definite\nphilosophical position. If Timon retained any of Stilpo’s teachings,\nthey were most likely in the area of ethics; Stilpo, and the Megarians\ngenerally, seem to have espoused an ideal of mild or moderate feeling\nand freedom from disturbance that is recognizably akin to Pyrrho’s\ntranquility.","contact.mail":"rbett1@jhu.edu","contact.domain":"jhu.edu"}]
