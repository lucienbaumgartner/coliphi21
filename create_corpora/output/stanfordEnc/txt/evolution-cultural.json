For many evolutionists, this means\nexplaining the possession by species of characteristic adaptations. It\nalso means explaining diversity within species. The general mark of\nmodern theories of cultural evolution is their insistence on the\nsignificance of cultural inheritance—particularly various forms\nof learning from others—for both of these questions. The\nprima-facie case for cultural evolutionary theories is irresistible.\nMembers of our own species are able to survive and reproduce in part\nbecause of habits, know-how and technology that are not only\nmaintained by learning from others, they are initially generated as\npart of a cumulative project that builds on discoveries made by\nothers. And our own species also contains sub-groups with different\nhabits, know-how and technologies, which are once again generated and\nmaintained through social learning. Social learning is also an\nimportant agent of adaptation, and perhaps of speciation, in animals.\nThe question is not so much whether cultural evolution is important,\nbut how theories of cultural evolution should be fashioned, and how\nthey should be related to more traditional understandings of organic\nevolution.\n\nTheories of cultural evolution need to be distinguished from theories\nwithin evolutionary psychology, even though both may involve an\napplication of evolutionary ideas to the explanation of cultural\nphenomena. The evolutionary psychologist (e.g. Tooby and Cosmides\n1992) tends to assume that the most important inheritance mechanism in\nall species—our own included—is genetic inheritance.\nEvolutionary psychology regards the human mind as evolving through a\nconventional process of natural selection acting on genetically\ninherited variation. For example, an evolutionary psychologist might\nexplain the widespread taste among humans for fatty foods in terms of\nthe importance in our species’ distant past of consuming as much\nfat as possible on those rare occasions when the circumstances\npresented themselves. Such a hypothesis can also help to explain novel\ncultural trends: the recent increase in obesity is explained as the\nresult of a novel environmental change—the increased\navailability of cheap, high-fat foods—acting in concert with a\nonce-adaptive, now dangerous, gustatory preference. So evolutionary\npsychology is hardly silent about culture and cultural change. Even\nso, cultural evolutionary theorists tend to place far more stress on\nthe role of non-genetic inheritance, and specifically of cultural\ninheritance mediated via learning, as a factor playing a positive,\ncreative role in adapting species to their social and biological\nenvironments. \nDarwin believed, as do biologists today, that natural selection can\nexplain the origin of many complex adaptive traits. In Darwin’s\noriginal presentation of natural selection, he requires that parent\norganisms differ in their abilities to survive and reproduce, and that\noffspring resemble their parents in terms of the traits that promote\nor inhibit these abilities (Darwin 1859). This explanatory schema is\nlargely neutral regarding what mechanism accounts for parent-offspring\nresemblance. For example, offspring might learn skills from their\nparents, and thereby come to resemble them behaviourally. From the\nperspective of natural selection explanations, it does not matter why\noffspring resemble parents, only that they do resemble them. \nDarwin’s theory of natural selection explains adaptation by\nappealing to what we now call vertical transmission—the\ninheritance of parental traits by offspring. As we have seen, cultural\nprocesses such as learning might, in principle, underpin this form of\ninheritance. But we do not learn only from our parents—we also\nlearn from peers, authority-figures and so forth. This is known as\noblique transmission. Once we acknowledge the possibility\nthat learning can underpin natural selection, we also acknowledge that\na theory of evolution—a theory which seeks to explain change,\nincluding adaptive change in a population—may also need to be\nfurther expanded to encompass oblique transmission. The admittance of\noblique transmission into evolutionary theory necessitates far more\nradical revisions to traditional Darwinian models of evolution. This\nis because oblique transmission opens up the possibility that some\ntraits may spread through a population in spite of the fact that they\nreduce the fitness of the individuals who bear them. \nWhile large amounts of work in cultural evolution have focused on the\nhuman species, there is also a growing body of work assessing the\nimplications of learning for adaptation and speciation in many other\nspecies including chimpanzees (Whiten et al. 1999), whales (Rendell and\nWhitehead 2001), fish and birds among many others (Laland and Hoppitt\n2003). Moreover, this work on non-human species also helps to refine\nand to answer a series of questions about why humans, compared with\nother species, seem so conspicuously good at building, maintaining and\nrefining collective storehouses of adaptive cultural capital (Henrich\n2015, Laland 2016). \nIn a classic early work of cultural evolution, Cavalli-Sforza and\nFeldman (1981) ask (among other things) how we can explain declining\nbirth rates among Italian women in the nineteenth century. These women\nwent from having around five children on average to having only two.\nIt would be extremely implausible to argue that this occurred as\nresult of natural selection (Sober 1991, 482). It would be\nimplausible, for example, to argue that the fitness of women with\nsmaller families was greater than the fitness of women with larger\nfamilies. True enough, an individual’s long-term fitness\n(measured in terms of numbers of grandchildren, or\ngreat-grandchildren) may sometimes be augmented by having a few strong\noffspring rather than lots of weak ones (Lack 1954). But surely\nItalian women could have raised more than two children to be healthy\nadults. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman instead argue that the practice of\nhaving fewer children spread through Italy because women acquired the\ntrait both from peers and from individuals from their mother’s\ngeneration, through modes of cultural transmission. Forms of oblique\ntransmission are required to explain this transition, because if\ncultural transmission were always vertical, then the trait of having\ngreater numbers of offspring would be maintained in the population by\nnatural selection, albeit selection acting via cultural\ninheritance. \nOne might react to this with confusion: why is a body of theory needed\nto make these claims? Of course we acquire traits from others by\nlearning. And of course those others from whom we learn can include\npeers as well as parents. In part, we can respond to this bewilderment\nby pointing to the virtues of clarifying the conditions required for\ncultural inheritance to overcome natural selection. Cavalli-Sforza and\nFeldman argue that if women simply acquired whichever preference for\nfamily size was the most widely adopted in their local cultural\nenvironment, then cultural inheritance would not have enough of an\neffect to overcome natural selection. Women must be disposed to\nacquire the preference for small family size even when it is present\nin only a small proportion of their cultural circle, if small family\nsize is to replace large family size in the population as a whole.\nThis is an illuminating claim, and it takes a quantitative model to\nshow it. \nThis question of what benefit is to be had from setting these sorts of\nclaims in a quantitative theory will be raised in more detail later in\nthis article. For the moment, note that one may also ask why it should\nbe the case that we are able to learn from non-parents at all, given\nthe adaptive costs of such a disposition. If the tendency of Italian\nwomen to learn from their peers has led them to reduce their fitness\nby reducing their family size, why did natural selection allow such\nlearning dispositions to become established in the first place? Boyd\nand Richerson, two other pioneers in cultural evolutionary theory,\nclaim that the overall adaptive benefits of learning from non-parents\nin fact outweigh the overall adaptive costs (Richerson and Boyd 2005,\nCh. 4). They give several reasons for this view. Suppose an inventive\n(or lucky) individual is able to discover some behaviour, or\ntechnique, which augments fitness. If other individuals in the\npopulation can copy that behaviour, then their fitness will probably\nbe augmented, too. It will often be difficult for individuals to\nascertain which behaviours in fact augment fitness, hence which\nbehaviours should be copied. The problem, then, is how to tune a\nlearning mechanism so that beneficial behaviours are copied, while\nnon-beneficial behaviours are not. \nBoyd and Richerson suggest that prestige bias can overcome\nthis problem: if individuals copy techniques from those who are in\nprestigious positions, then this increases the chances that they will\ncopy techniques that are, in fact, beneficial. As they put it,\n“Determining who is a success is much easier than\ndetermining how to be a success” (Richerson and Boyd,\n2005, 124). Moreover, evidence has been accumulating for the reality\nof prestige bias. Henrich and Broesch (2011) have argued, based on\nfieldwork in Fiji, that an individual’s perceived success in a\nsingle domain of activity (for example, yam cultivation) predicts\nwhether that individual will be asked for advice in other domains (for\nexample, fishing). In other words, they claim that individuals are\naccorded a broad form of prestige, which affects their likelihood of\nserving as a cultural model. The value of prestige bias relies on the\nsupposition that those individuals who are able to get themselves into\nprestigious positions have a better than average tendency to make use\nof fitness-enhancing techniques. This heuristic will not be failsafe:\nafter all, not every technique a prestigious individual uses will also\naugment fitness, and some individuals may be accorded prestige without\ngood cause. But the question which settles the plausibility of natural\nselection explaining prestige bias is not whether prestige bias will\nsometimes lead to the copying of maladaptive techniques; the question,\nrather, is whether individuals who learn from the prestigious will\ntend to be fitter on average than individuals who either do not learn\nat all, or who are equally likely to learn from any member of the\npopulation, regardless of their social status. \nRicherson and Boyd (2005, 120–22) suggest that other learning\nheuristics may be adaptive. One of these is standardly referred to by cultural evolutionists as conformist\nbias. To say that someone has conformist bias is to say that the person in question has a tendency to imitate those behaviours, beliefs or other dispositions that are present among a high frequency of individuals in the population. More precisely, this bias is usually defined as a heightened, or exaggerated, tendency to imitate the most common behaviour. That is because if (for example) the great majority of people eat with chopsticks, and just a few eat with a knife and fork, then choosing whom to imitate at random will also be likely to lead to imitation of the majority chopstick behaviour. Under these circumstances purely random choice of whom to imitate is likely to lead one to choose a chopstick user as a model. So if 70 percent of individuals in some population use chopsticks, then an imitator only has conformist bias in the strict sense favoured by cultural evolutionists if the imitator has a chance greater than 70 percent of acquiring the behaviour of chopstick use. \nRicherson and Boyd argue (along with many others in the field) that conformist learning is adaptive, in the sense that it provides an individual learner with behaviours that\nare appropriate to novel situations. More specifically, they argue that it is more adaptive in this regard than not\nimitating others at all, and more adaptive than imitating randomly-chosen\nmembers of a population. Conformist learning, they say, can help with the acquisition of\nbehaviours appropriate to a new biological environment: when moving\ninto a new habitat, with unknown plants and animals, it is best to eat\nthe foods the locals eat, for one thereby avoids poisoning. But it can\nalso lead to the generation of socially appropriate behaviours, which\nwill obviate ostracism or attack. Harris and Corriveau’s (2011)\nempirical work concludes that while young children are unselective\nwith regard to what they learn, they are far more selective regarding\nwhom they learn from. Moreover, they argue that children tend to seek\nout cultural conformists as individuals whom they should trust. These\nfindings offer some support for the existence of a form of conformist\nbias, although Lewens (2015) has suggested that both the theoretical\nand empirical cases for conformist bias may not be as strong as first\nmeets the eye. \nThese examples show the nature of the interaction between cultural\nevolutionary thinking and more traditional natural selection thinking.\nNatural selection acting on genetic variation can establish\ndispositions to learn from non-kin in spite of the fact that under\nsome circumstances these dispositions lead to the proliferation of\nmaladaptive traits. It is worth noting that this aspect of much\ncultural evolutionary thinking retains a strong methodological\naffinity with the evolutionary psychological approach it is sometimes\ncontrasted with (Lewens 2015). Learning dispositions themselves are\noften understood by cultural evolutionists as genetically inherited\nadaptations, produced in response to adaptive problems faced by our\nearlier ancestors. Some recent critics of cultural evolutionary\nthinking (e.g. Heyes 2012, and especially Heyes 2018) consequently\nargue that it is not cultural enough, for it tends to downplay the\npossibility that learning dispositions themselves might be inherited\nthrough forms of learning. All agree, though, that once these learning\ndispositions are in place, we should not assume that every trait in a\npopulation must be explained by reference to the biological fitness\nbenefit it has conferred in the past. Evolutionary adaptationists tend\nto ask, of any given trait, what effect might have led natural\nselection to favour that trait. Even if an adaptationist stance of\nthis sort is justifiable for learning mechanisms (and cultural\nevolutionists typically are adaptationists in this respect) this does\nnot mean that an adaptationist stance is justifiable for learned\ntraits. \nThe notion that culture itself evolves, and that Darwinian insights\ncan be applied to understanding cultural change, is by no means new. A\nvery early example of cultural evolutionary thinking comes from\nWilliam James: \nJames’s paper is primarily concerned with using what he regards\nas a proper understanding of Darwinism to undermine the\n“so-called evolutionary philosophy of Mr Herbert Spencer”\n(ibid., 422). Spencer had argued that ‘great men’ were of\nsecondary importance in determining the course of history, on the\ngrounds that ‘Before he can remake his society, his society must\nmake him’ (from Spencer’s Study of Sociology,\nquoted in ibid., 449). The great man needs to be made, and society\ndoes this. Hence ultimately it is society itself that explains social\nchange. \nJames argues that the central key to Darwin’s natural selection\nmechanism is to decouple the causes of variation from the causes of\nselection (see Lewens, 2007, Ch. 2). Variations are produced by\nunknown causes, and the environment selects among them. Variations\nthemselves (for James’s Darwin) are inexplicable. The same is\ntrue of great men: ‘The causes of production of great men lie in\na sphere wholly inaccessible to the social philosopher. He must simply\naccept geniuses as data, just as Darwin accepts his spontaneous\nvariations’ (James, 1880, 445). Great men, like spontaneous\nvariations, are essential and inexplicable elements of the\nevolutionary process. Just as Darwin’s theory credits\nenvironment and variation with distinctive, yet vital, roles, so both\ngreat men and the social environment are important for the explanation\nof social change: \nThere are problems associated with any effort to trace the pedigree of\ncultural evolutionary theories back to Darwin himself. One of the\nreasons for this is that cultural evolutionary theories often define\nthemselves in opposition to those which claim that genetic inheritance\nis the only significant inheritance mechanism. Clearly one cannot cast\nDarwin as a cultural evolutionist in this manner, for he had no notion\nof genetic inheritance to oppose. Having said this, Darwin did believe\nthat what was learned in one generation could be inherited in later\ngenerations. But far from distinguishing cultural inheritance from\norganic inheritance, Darwin thought that all inheritance should be\nexplained by the transmission of ‘gemmules’. These were\nunderstood to be particles produced throughout the body, of a\ncharacter specific to the body part that produces them. Darwin\nbelieved that gemmules then travelled to the gonads, where they were\ntransmitted to offspring in the sex cells. Darwin claimed that\ngemmules were produced throughout the body in order to explain the\ninheritance of acquired characteristics. So in one sense Darwin is in\nalignment with modern cultural evolutionists—he believed that\ncharacteristics learned during the life of a parent could be\ntransmitted to offspring. But in another sense Darwin is opposed to\nmodern cultural evolutionists, for rather than distinguishing between\ndifferent interacting inheritance systems (e.g. cultural and genetic\ninheritance), Darwin tends to use the transmission of gemmules to\nexplain the inheritance of all types of trait. \nThere are other respects in which one might choose to regard Darwin as\na proto-cultural evolutionist. Darwin sometimes integrates discussion\nof technological evolution into his broader discussions of natural\nselection. In the Descent of Man, Darwin pauses to discuss\ntechnical innovation, arguing that successful innovations will usually\nbe imitated, thereby increasing the success of a group as a whole,\nincreasing the size of that group, and consequently increasing the\nchances of inventive members being born into it (Darwin 1877, 154). This\nexplanation combines natural selection’s central concern with\nreproductive output, and cultural evolution’s central concern\nwith imitation. Darwin writes: \nFinally, Darwin endorses the view, widely favoured these days, that\nnatural selection need not act on organisms. Rather, natural selection\nis substrate-neutral. A natural selection process can occur\nwhenever certain abstract conditions—these days often expressed\nas differential reproduction with inheritance—are met. Darwin\nexplicitly endorses the view that natural selection can act on\nentities other than organisms in the context of language change, a\ncultural phenomenon. This position is briefly explored in the\nOrigin of Species, and further expanded in the Descent of\nMan. In this work, he endorses the opinion of Max\nMüller: \nDarwin asserts that this is no mere analogy: “The survival or\npreservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for existence\nis natural selection” (1877, 113). This\nclaim—that cultural entities of various sorts can undergo\nnatural selection processes in their own right—is not a\nnecessary feature of a theory of cultural evolution. Cultural\nevolutionary theory in general requires only a systematic effort to\nmodel the effects of cultural inheritance, and one might decide that\nthinking in terms of natural selection acting on units of culture is\nnot the best way of doing this. We will investigate these issues in\nmore detail later in this article. \nWe have already mentioned Herbert Spencer, and Spencer is sometimes\nregarded as a key early advocate of efforts to apply evolutionary\nthinking to human culture (e.g. Jablonka and Lamb 2005, 21–22).\nAs early as 1855, in his Principles of Psychology, Spencer\nproposed a form of evolutionary epistemology, arguing for a third way\nbetween empiricism’s emphasis on the necessity of experience for\nknowledge, and rationalism’s insistence on the importance of\na priori knowledge. Spencer reasoned that if the experiences\nof past generations were imprinted on human minds, then it would be\ntrue both that some forms of knowledge in current generations were\na priori, and also that this knowledge had its origins in\nexperience, albeit the experience of our ancestors. Darwin himself had\nmade a brief note along similar lines in his M notebook:\n‘Plato…says in Phaedo that our\n‘necessary ideas’ arise from the preexistence of\nthe soul, are not derivable from experience.—read monkeys for\npreexistence.’ (Barrett et al. 1987, 551) Much later in the\ntwentieth century, Konrad Lorenz would argue for a similar set of\nviews in his efforts to see the Kantian a priori through the\nlens of evolutionary biology, and natural selection more specifically\n(Lorenz 1941). There is an important difference between Darwin and\nLorenz, which these superficial similarities might hide.\nDarwin’s comments do not presuppose the action of natural\nselection as the mechanism by which these adaptive ideas become common\nin the species; rather, the mechanism of use-inheritance is what\nexplains the preservation of concepts and techniques that are seen to\nwork well. \nAlthough Spencer is sometimes credited with initiating the application\nof evolutionary thinking to culture, Spencer’s contributions in\nthis domain and others are often regarded as scientifically worthless\n(although see Jablonka and Lamb 2005, 372–3 for an exception). Ernst\nMayr, for example, claimed that ‘It would be quite justifiable\nto ignore Spencer totally in a history of biological ideas because his\npositive contributions were nil’ (Mayr 1982, 386). Spencer is\nusually treated harshly for his adherence to the importance of\n‘use-inheritance’, according to which habits initially\nlearned are eventually inherited automatically in offspring. This form\nof inheritance would be classed by many as ‘Lamarckian’,\nin contrast to the ‘Darwinian’ forms of inheritance that\nare typically placed in the foreground in presentations of modern\nevolutionary theory. \nSome recent modern theorists have argued that Lamarckian inheritance\nshould not be dismissed out of hand (e.g. Jablonka and Lamb 1995).\nWhatever we think of this move, the tendency to praise Darwin while\ndamning Spencer often overlooks the fact that Darwin, too, believed in\nthe biological significance of use-inheritance, and it figured\nstrongly in his own views of cultural evolution. Spencer is also\ncriticised for his ‘social Darwinist’ beliefs, but Darwin,\ntoo, was a social Darwinist of sorts, and held evolutionary views\nregarding race, social degeneration and other such topics that most\nwould dismiss today (see Lewens 2007, chapter eight). As we have seen,\nDarwin’s theory of pangenesis was developed partly in order to\nexplain what he took to be the phenomena of use-inheritance, and a\ngeneral account of use-inheritance played an important role in\nDarwin’s cultural evolutionary account of human moral progress.\nIndeed, at one point in the Descent of Man, Darwin quotes\nSpencer at length and with approval: \nSerious efforts to construct cultural evolutionary theories can be\ntraced to the work of Lumsden and Wilson (1981), Cavalli-Sforza and\nFeldman (1981), and Boyd and Richerson (1985). All of these authors\nhave attempted, in one way or another, to produce formal models that\ncan integrate the effects of cultural inheritance into more standard\nbiological models of evolution. We have already looked at some of the\nclaims of these theorists, but before looking at their work in more\ndetail, let us look at the theory of memetics. This theory, originally\nput forward by Richard Dawkins (1976), is perhaps the best known\nattempt to apply evolutionary thinking to culture; that said, while\nit has enjoyed considerable popular attention, it has not become well\nestablished in scientific circles. Instead, the school of Boyd and\nRicherson has been far more successful, for reasons that are explained\nbelow. \nThe meme theory seeks to draw a very strong analogy between evolution\nat the cultural level, and biological evolution. It begins with an\nabstract characterisation of selection as a process requiring entities\nthat reproduce, such that parents resemble offspring. Memetics takes\nthe view, popularised by Dawkins, that entities which have the ability\nto make faithful copies of themselves—so-called\n‘replicators’—are required to explain this\ntrans-generational resemblance. In standard biological models of\nevolution it is assumed that genes are the relevant replicators. Genes\nmake copies of themselves, and this ability explains why offspring\norganisms resemble their parents. If culture is to evolve, it\ntherefore becomes necessary to find some form of cultural replicator\nthat explains cultural inheritance. Memes play this role. Dawkins\ngives a list of some exemplary memes: ‘tunes, ideas,\ncatch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building\narches.’ Note that while it is sometimes assumed that all memes\nare ideas (and vice versa) Dawkins’s list includes other types\nof thing, such as ways of making pots, which are techniques. \nDawkins’s claim is that ideas, for example, can be\nconceptualised as entities that hop from mind to mind, making copies\nof themselves as they go. On the face of things, this seems an\nattractive proposition. Just as genes make copies of themselves at\ndifferent rates according to their effects on the organisms that bear\nthem and on their local environments, so ideas make copies of\nthemselves at different rates according to their effects on the\norganisms that bear them and on their local environments. In a\ncommunity of scientists, for example, different hypotheses are\nentertained, and some come to be believed more widely than others. A\nhypothesis that begins in the mind of one or two scientists thereby\nspreads, until it is widely held in the research community. Another\nhypothesis quickly dies. We can perhaps characterise the features that\nmake some hypotheses likely to spread, and others likely to perish.\n‘Fit’ hypotheses may have predictive power, or simplicity,\nor they may integrate well with existing bodies of theory. Note that\nwhat this example shows is that taking the meme’s-eye\nperspective does not literally show that we are being manipulated by\nselfish cultural replicators. One can describe scientific change as a\nstruggle between selfish memes, but one can also describe just the\nsame process in terms of scientists choosing to accept, or to reject,\ntheories by reference to familiar criteria of explanatory power,\ntheoretical elegance and so forth. It is only an incidental feature of\nthe metaphor of memetic selfishness that appears to deprive humans of\ncontrol over which ideas they do, and do not, accept. \nThere are various problems associated with memetic views, most of\nwhich focus on limitations of the gene/meme analogy. These worries are\nsometimes raised by theorists from the social sciences who are hostile\nto evolutionary theories of culture. But they are also raised quite\nfrequently by cultural evolutionists who argue that the meme concept\nis not the right way to ground a theory of cultural evolution: it is\nessential to bear in mind, then, that cultural evolutionary theories\nin general do not require the meme theory to be true (see Henrich et\nal. 2008). Here are some of the most frequently encountered arguments\nagainst the meme concept (the remainder of this section draws on\nLewens, 2007, Ch. 7): \nCultural units are not replicators: Replicators, remember,\nare supposed to be units that make copies of themselves. Some critics\nof the meme concept argue that there is no known mechanism that could\nexplain how memes are copied. But this is a mistake. An idea can be\ncopied simply through observation and inference: agent B can\nobserve the behaviour of agent A, infer that A holds\nsome belief X, and thereby come to hold the same belief as\nA. Ideas can also be copied using linguistic communication.\nAgent A might be convinced of belief X, she tells\nB about it, and B comes to believe X too.\nIn both cases one can say that belief X makes a copy of\nitself, albeit via language, inference, and so forth. A more pressing\nworry for memetics is that imitation is usually too error-prone to\nunderpin replication. If I make a cake on the basis of a secret family\nrecipe, you eat the cake, and you then attempt to make another one,\nthen the chances are that the recipe you hit upon will not, in fact,\nbe exactly the same as the one I used, even if you are able to make a\nsimilar-tasting cake. Another significant worry for memetics is that\nwhen the same ideas do spread through a population, it is rarely\nbecause they are literally copied from each other. Sperber argues that\ncultural reproduction is rarely meme-like, but instead makes use of\nwhat he calls ‘attractors’—culturally shared\npatterns of thought, which enable representations to spread through a\npopulation without literal copying. Sticking with the cake example,\nperhaps you eat a slice of my Victoria sponge, you like it, and you\ndecide to make one for yourself. Perhaps the recipe you use is very\nsimilar to mine. But you have not figured out by tasting my cake which\ningredients needed to go in and in what order. Rather, you already\nknew how to make a Victoria sponge. Eating my cake simply triggered\nthe use of a recipe that was already in your repertoire. In this case,\nthe recipe has appeared in my head, and because of this it has\nappeared in yours, but not because your recipe is a copy of mine.\nSperber argues that memetics is mistaken because most cases of the\nspread of ideas are like this: \nBoth of these concerns raise serious problems for the generality of\nmemetics: not all ideas are replicators, hence not all ideas are\nmemes. Whether this shows the meme concept to be useless depends on\nwhether there are insights to be had by distinguishing cultural\ninheritance that is meme-like from cultural inheritance that is not\n(Sterelny 2006a). \nCultural units do not form lineages: A closely-related\ncriticism of memetics draws on the fact that while in genetic\nreplication we can trace a new copy of a gene back to a single parent,\nideas are rarely copied from a single source in a way that allows us\nto trace clear lineages (Boyd and Richerson 2000). Memeticists are\nfond of analysing religious belief in terms of the spread of memes.\nBut while religious beliefs may well spread through populations of\nhumans, it seems unlikely that we will always be able to trace token\ninstances of faith back to one source. Instead, individuals often\nacquire belief in God through exposure to several believers in their\nlocal community. In these circumstances, belief in God is not caused\nby one identifiable earlier token of the same type. Within the realm\nof biological evolution, an understanding of Mendel’s laws has\nbeen important in explaining some aspects of evolutionary dynamics.\nMendel’s laws rely on an understanding of genes as discrete,\ntransmitted units. But if token ideas can appear in an individual in\nvirtue of that individual’s exposure to several sources, then\nthis makes it unlikely that anything close to Mendel’s laws will\nbe discovered within cultural evolution. This suggests a practical\nlimitation on enquiry that may result from this difference between\nideas and genes. Criticisms of this form have been put especially\nforcefully by William Wimsatt (1999), who argues that the creative and\ninferential abilities of human users make it the case that any given\nidea, or item of technology, can have fluctuating numbers of cultural\nparents over time. This is because the causal sources of its\nreproduction may vary. Belief in God may sometimes be caused by\nexposure to a single charismatic evangelist, it may sometimes be\ncaused by the joint inculcation of two biological parents, and it may\nsometimes be caused by immersion in a diffuse community of theists.\nIdeas and items of technology also have no stable analogue to the\ngenome, or germline, because different elements within cycles of\ntechnological reproduction, including ideas, behaviours of artisans,\nand material elements of technologies themselves, can all temporarily\nacquire the status of replicators depending on the attention that\nhuman agents happen to be paying to them. Accidental variations in\none’s mental plan for constructing a pot, or in one’s\nactions in producing the pot, or in the made pot itself, can all\nconceivably be reproduced when another artisan comes to make a\nresembling item. Wimsatt uses these disanalogies to highlight the\nformidable problems facing any effort to use population genetic models\nin the explanation of cultural change. \nCulture cannot be atomised into discrete units: Ideas stand\nin logical relations to each other. Whether an individual is able to\nacquire some belief, for example, depends on their related conceptual\ncompetencies. It is impossible to believe in the theory of relativity\nwithout understanding it, and one cannot understand it without holding\nmany additional beliefs relating to physics. The same is true for\nnon-technical beliefs. Depending on which religion one is talking\nabout, belief in God is likely to be related to various other beliefs\nconcerning forgiveness, retribution, love and so forth. This has led\nsome critics to argue that it is a mistake to take a view of culture\nwhich atomises it into discrete units, assigning replicative power to\nthem individually. The anthropologist Adam Kuper complains that\n‘Unlike genes, cultural traits are not particulate. An idea\nabout God cannot be separated from other ideas with which it is\nindissolubly linked in a particular religion’ (Kuper 2000, 180).\nMemeticists are likely to respond by saying that although ideas are\ninter-linked, this does not undermine the meme-gene analogy:\nO’Brien et al. (2010) have argued that a more mature view of the\nrole of genes in evolution and development re-instates the meme-gene\nparallel. For there is a sense in which genes, too, need to be studied\nin a context that takes other genes, and their broader developmental\nand environmental settings, into account. A DNA sequence can have\ndifferent effects in different organisms, depending on the network of\nrelations it enters into with other genetic and developmental\nresources. Just as the significance of belief in God can vary with\nsocial context, with the result that it can make little sense to think\nof ‘belief in God’ as a meme, so the function of some DNA\nsequence can vary with organic context, with the result that it makes\nlittle sense to identify some sequence type as a gene for the purposes\nof evolutionary analysis. \nThese criticisms focus on whether there truly are memes. But there are\nalso criticisms of the usefulness of the meme concept, regardless of\nwhether memes exist. As was already indicated above, one might worry\nthat memetics merely offers a cosmetic re-packaging of a familiar set\nof stories about cultural change. Perhaps science is composed of\nreplicating entities struggling against various selection pressures,\nbut what insight does this offer us, if in the end it presents us with\nnothing more than an alternative idiom in which to describe the\nvarious factors that affect the evaluation of scientific hypotheses?\nPerhaps clothes fashions are memes, but even if that is the case, one\nstill needs to explain what makes one clothing meme fitter than\nanother, and the fear is that once spelled out this will quickly boil\ndown to a well-known appeal to consumer psychology. \nThe most serious and most respected efforts to apply evolutionary\nthinking to culture begin from a different starting point to memetics\n(although see Shennan 2008, 2011 for significant work that takes the\nmeme’s-eye view). Meme theorists tend to begin with a general\ncharacterisation of evolution by natural selection, namely as a\nprocess that requires differential competition between replicators.\nHence the meme theorist looks for some strict analogue to the gene in\nthe cultural realm, which can play the replicator role. Dawkins\nimplies that it is only because humans are subject to colonisation by\nreplicators other than genes that human evolution escapes the tyranny\nof the gene. On this view, memes are required in order to free our\nspecies from a form of biological determinism. \nThe alternative to this view begins with the observation that cultural\ninheritance is important, and it seeks to integrate cultural\ninheritance into traditional evolutionary models. But this general\nmotivation leaves open the issue of whether cultural evolution\nrequires the existence of cultural replicators. Clearly one can accept\nmany of the criticisms of the meme concept, and still attempt to model\nthe effects of cultural inheritance. Rather than seeking to show that\nthere are cultural replicators, one can instead seek to build models\nthat allow for error-prone learning, and that acknowledge that an\nindividual’s beliefs are often the result of exposure to many\nsources, rather than copying from just one source. The interest of\ncultural evolutionary models in this tradition is sometimes simply to\nshow how cultural change of various sorts—not necessarily\nadaptive cultural change—can subsequently affect genetic\nevolution, and vice versa. This is the general goal of models of\ngene-culture co-evolution. But cultural evolutionary models also aim\nto assess the role of cultural inheritance in the construction of\nadaptation: here, cultural evolutionary theorists are not merely\nseeking to explain distributions of traits in populations, they are\nseeking to explain the appearance of valuable cultural novelties\n(Godfrey-Smith 2012). \nOne might think that even if cultural change does not require cultural\nreplicators, at least adaptive cultural change does. The\ngeneral Darwinian scheme for explaining adaptation demands reliable\ninheritance—it demands that once a fitness-augmenting mutation\narises, it can be retained in future generations. If cultural learning\nis error-prone, or if individuals acquire cultural traits by taking an\naverage of many different models, then one might think that if some\nindividual is able to discover a fitness-enhancing behaviour, that\ntrait will be lost to future generations either because it is\nmis-copied, or because it is combined with other less adaptive traits\nto produce an averaged mish-mash of a behaviour. \nAll of these inferences have been challenged by recent cultural\nevolutionary theory. Cultural evolutionists agree that at the level of\nthe population, cumulative evolution requires that fitness-enhancing\ncultural traits are preserved in the offspring generation. However,\nthey deny that this requires faithful transmission between\nindividuals. A formal model from Henrich and Boyd (2002) suggests that\nconformist bias can overcome the effects of\nerror-prone learning to produce reliable inheritance at the population\nlevel. Conformist bias was defined, in section 2 above, as the tendency of individuals to\nadopt the most common representation in a\npopulation. Henrich and Boyd cite evidence that conformist bias is a\nreal phenomenon (although again see Lewens 2015 for scepticism about\nthe case for conformism). Henrich and Boyd’s theoretical model\nassumes that individuals are poor at inferring the representations of\nothers. Even so, they argue that when we look to the population level,\nconformist bias helps to correct the effects of such errors, producing\na population-wide distribution of representations in the offspring\ngeneration that is close to the population-wide distribution of\nrepresentations in the parent generation. Henrich and Boyd explain the\nreason for this. In general, error-prone transmission has a tendency\nto produce a mixture of different representations. In a population\nthat already contains several different representations at significant\nfrequencies, the effect of error on a population-wide distribution of\nrepresentations is therefore low. In a population in which one\nrepresentation is common, the effects of error are much more\nsignificant. But if we add conformist bias, we increase the chances of\na commonly held representation remaining commonly held in future\ngenerations, even with error-prone imitation. \nBoyd and Henrich acknowledge that this does not make population-level\ndistributions perfectly reliably inherited. But this does not show\nthat cumulative evolution acting on cultural inheritance is\nimpossible. At the genetic level, highly faithful copying processes\nallow even very small selective forces to preserve adaptive variation.\nLess faithful copying demands stronger selective forces if adaptive\nvariation is not to be lost. Boyd and Henrich are confident that\nselective forces in the cultural realm are stronger than selective\nforces in the genetic realm. The moral, once again, is that it is\nimportant not to focus too closely on genetic evolution as a model for\ncultural evolution. \nMemetics tends to be driven by a desire to see cultural analogies to\ngenetic evolution. Cultural evolutionary models in the manner of Boyd\nand Henrich are driven instead by a desire to find ways of\nunderstanding how cultural inheritance affects evolutionary processes.\nThese sorts of cultural evolutionary models do not assume that\ncultural inheritance works in the same way as genetic inheritance.\nIndeed, they are free to model cultural inheritance in ways that\ndepart quite markedly from genetic inheritance. Yet they remain\nrecognisably evolutionary in style, primarily because they seek to\nexplain the changes in trait frequencies in a population over time.\nThey do this by making broad assumptions about how individuals acquire\ncultural traits—for example, they may assume that an\nindividual’s representations are the product of learning from a\nvariety of peers, or that they arise from attending particularly to\nauthority figures—and by assessing how such rules will play out\nat the population level. Moreover, these rules for cultural\nacquisition are not merely conjectured, they are given experimental\nbacking. Cultural evolutionary theorists seek to document the effects\nof various empirically supported forms of bias, such as prestige bias.\nJust as Darwin’s own theory of evolution by natural selection\nremained largely conjectural until supplemented by empirical work\nshowing how inheritance worked, and by statistical work focusing on\nthe population-level consequences of inheritance, selection, mutation\nand other forces, so cultural evolutionary theory has gained its\ninsights from a similar combination of empirical and mathematical\napproaches. \nAt the beginning of this entry it was claimed that the case for\ncultural evolution was irresistible. No one can deny that cultural\ninheritance is an important factor in explaining how our species has\nchanged over time. Cultural inheritance is not merely a process that\nacts in parallel to genetic evolution, it is intertwined with genetic\nevolution. Cultural changes bring about alterations to the\nenvironment, which in turn affect both how genes act in development,\nand what selection pressures act on genes. In spite of all this, one\nmight still worry that it is a mistake to understand the importance of\nculture using the tools of evolutionary theory. This is because one\nmay be sceptical of the existence of a theory that is both general\nenough to cover all forms of cultural change, and informative enough\nto be enlightening. \nThere is no doubt that it is often important to remind\noverly-enthusiastic orthodox Darwinians of the importance of culture.\nFor example, it seems that the increased incidence of\nlactose-tolerance among human populations has arisen as a consequence\nof a cultural innovation—namely dairy farming. The relatively\nrecent appearance of this genetically-controlled adaptation\ndemonstrates that human physiological nature is something that\ncontinues to change, and it also demonstrates the causal impact of\nculture on genes (Richerson and Boyd 2005, 191–92). Such\nexamples by themselves show the rashness of any view that claims\neither that human nature has remained fixed since the Stone Age, or\nthat genes are somehow in the evolutionary driving seat. Yet none of\nthis shows that we can develop a general, informative theory of\ncultural evolution. One might fear that in the end cultural change,\nand the influence of cultural change on other aspects of the human\nspecies, are best understood through a series of individual\nnarratives. Our brief examination of memetics illustrated this\nconcern. We gain no real explanatory insight if we are told that ideas\nspread through populations, some more successfully than others. We\nwant to know what makes some ideas fitter than others. And it is not\nclear that there will be any general rules that can help us to answer\nthis question. In the biological realm we need detailed accounts of\nlocal environmental circumstances, species-specific physiology and\nanatomy, and so forth, to tell us what makes one organic variant\nfitter than another. Similarly, in the cultural realm we will need to\nlook at local psychological dispositions to explain why some ideas are\nmore likely to spread than others. So any explanatory value to be had\nfrom memetics is parasitic on conventional work done in psychology.\nAnd if individual preferences are subject to change over time, then\nthere may be no general and informative theory of cultural evolution\nto be had; rather, we will have to settle for local explanations that\nlook to shifting preferences. Rather than provide a new scientific\nframework for an understanding of culture, memetics will tend to\ndegenerate into conventional narrative cultural history. \nIn the remaining sections I distinguish five broad sets of responses\nto this line of argument, each of which picks up on a different\nexplanatory element of mainstream evolutionary theory (Lewens 2012).\nThey can be yoked together to provide a broad justification for the\npayoffs of a cultural evolutionary perspective (Lewens 2015). First,\nBoyd and Richerson argue that informative insights arise out of\ncultural evolution’s ‘population thinking’\n(Richerson and Boyd 2005). Second, Sperber and collaborators have\nendorsed this populational approach, while further insisting on the\nexplanatory value of the notion of cultural ‘attractors’\nin pinpointing why traditions are sustained over time (Sperber 1996,\nMorin 2016). Third, Richerson, Boyd, Henrich and others have stressed\nthe importance of cumulative cultural adaptation, alongside a specific\nset of explanatory puzzles that these phenomena present (Richerson and\nBoyd 2005, Henrich 2015). Fourth, Sterelny (2001, 2003, 2006a, 2006b,\n2007, 2012) and Wimsatt (1999) argue that illuminating insights\nregarding the general conditions required for evolvability also apply\nin the cultural realm. Fifth, many have argued that cultural\nevolutionary theories can provide insights into the historical\npatterns of cultural change, in much the same way that evolutionary\nbiological tools have enabled us to reconstruct the branching (or\nperhaps reticulated) history of life. We will look at each line of\ndefence in turn. For a much fuller account of the value of cultural\nevolutionary thinking, and indeed for a thorough and accessible\nintroduction to the theory as a whole, Alex Mesoudi’s (2011)\nbook is an excellent place to look. Meanwhile, Sterelny (2017) and\nLewens (2015) offer overviews of some of the main conceptual divisions\nwithin the field. \n‘Population thinking’ means many things to many people.\nFor Boyd and Richerson it denotes any effort to abstract from a\ncharacterisation of individual psychological profiles, in a way that\nallows an exploration of the consequences of these individual-level\ndispositions for population-level properties. We have already seen an\nexample of this sort of population thinking in action. It is far from\nobvious that conformist bias among individuals can enable\npopulation-level inheritance in spite of individual-level errors in\ncopying. To show that these properties of individual psychology\n(conformist bias and error-prone learning) combine to yield\npopulation-level inheritance requires some abstract mathematical\nmodelling. And the establishment of this population-level consequence\nis important, for it enables the investigator to revise the\nconstraints one might naively think must bear on cultural inheritance\nif cumulative cultural evolution is to occur. \nIn a useful article, Elliott Sober (1991) suggests that theories of\ncultural evolution may have limited value for the work of social\nscientists, on the grounds that social scientists are primarily\ninterested in explaining what makes individuals likely to adopt one\nidea, rather than another. They want to know, for example, why\nnineteenth-century Italian women decided that they would rather have\ntwo children than five, not what the population-level consequences of\ntheir decisions might be. Richerson and Boyd respond by saying that\nSober’s argument assumes, erroneously, that ‘we are all\ngood intuitive population thinkers’ (Richerson and Boyd 2005,\n97). In Sober’s original article he points out that population\nthinking might save cultural evolutionary models from vacuity in just\nthis way: \nMany of Richerson and Boyd’s models are enlightening. As we have\nseen, it takes work to show that cumulative cultural adaptation does\nnot require replication. Note, however, in favour of Sober’s\nscepticism, that the most interesting cultural evolutionary models are\noften those which show the general circumstances under which it is\npossible for cultural inheritance to be effective in producing\nadaptation. Boyd and Richerson’s claim in favour of the\nimportance of prestige bias is primarily an effort to show how natural\nselection might have favoured cultural learning. Sober’s concern\nis with whether models such as these will also affect ‘the\nday-to-day research of social scientists’, who are not so\ninterested in establishing such general conditions for cumulative\ncultural evolution, but who are instead interested in understanding\nparticular episodes of social and cultural change. Even here,\nRicherson and Boyd’s population thinking may have some bite.\nThey seek, for example, to explain the disappearance of important\ntechnologies on Tasmania. Drawing on the work of Joseph Henrich, they\nsuggest (Richerson and Boyd 2005, 138) that the maintenance of\ntechnologies and the associated behaviours required to produce and\noperate them may require a population that is large enough for the\nrate of innovation to offset the degradation that results from\nerror-prone imitation. If Boyd and Richerson are right about this\nepisode in the history of Tasmania, then we may be able to explain the\ndifferences in the abilities of the Tasmanians, compared with other\npeoples, to maintain a set of technologies, merely by citing\npopulation size, rather than other forms of social or cultural\ndifference. Note, finally, that Henrich’s model, like any\npopulational model, must proceed by making highly simplified\nassumptions about the properties of the individual entities that make\nup the larger population. This invites a generic series of criticisms\naimed at any effort at abstract modelling: Henrich’s model has\nbeen criticized by those who doubt the robustness of its assumptions\nand its match with empirical data (see Read 2006 for such criticism,\nKline and Boyd 2010 for a response, and Houkes 2012 for a useful\nphilosophical overview). At the same time, this abstraction\nconstitutes a potential strength of the populational approach, for it\noffers us the possibility of understanding a complex system without\nneeding comprehensive information about all of its parts. \nSperber and other advocates of the approach to cultural evolution\nknown as ‘cultural epidemiology’ share Richerson and\nBoyd’s focus on a populational approach to understanding culture\n(Sperber 1996). As they put it, “the overall general framework\nfor the study and modelling of cultural evolution should be that of\n‘population thinking’ … ” (Claidiere et al\n2014). They argue that any successful execution of this populational\napproach requires that we explain the distributions of cultural items\nby paying close attention to what they call cultural\n‘attractors’. Moreover, they argue that this approach\nfrequently (although not always) gives rise to explanations that elude\napproaches grounded in forms of cultural selection. \nAs indicated earlier, Sperber argues that the simple notion of copying\nis only rarely appropriate to explain why broadly similar cultural\nitems propagate in a stable manner through a population. For example,\nwhen emotional states spread through communities—perhaps at\ntimes of national mourning—it is often the case that one\nindividual’s grief is causally initiated by that of another. But\nthe second individual does not closely imitate, or copy, the emotional\nstate of the first, even if the second emotional state\nresembles—and hence is a ‘reproduction’ of—the\nfirst. Instead, a shared set of background emotional dispositions,\nperhaps coupled to shared norms for public behaviour, conspire to\nreconstruct a second emotional state that is similar to the first.\nSuch states, which are the broadly stable outcomes of these\nreconstructive processes, are examples of cultural\n‘attractors’. \nAn attractor should not simply be equated with an idea that is\npsychologically attractive to individuals (Sperber 1996, Buskell\n2017). Instead, it is a more abstract notion corresponding to any\nmore-or-less stable outcome of processes of cultural reproduction.\nVery many different ‘factors of attraction’ can\npotentially underpin such stable reproduction. For example, if a\nwidely-encountered engineering problem has only a few effective\nsolutions, which are also easy to figure out, then we should expect\nthose solutions to appear again and again, even if individuals are not\nattempting to copy the innovations of others in detail. In other\nwords, factors of attraction need not be psychological at all, and can\ninstead correspond to physical or ecological constraints. Shared\nbodies of information, shared preferences and shared emotional or\ninferential biases might also explain why some cultural variants\nre-appear with regularity. Some such attractors may be grounded in\nevolved cognitive dispositions shared by almost everyone. When drawing\non these factors of attraction, Sperber and like-minded colleagues\nhave often declared explicit debts to evolutionary psychology (Sperber\n1996). Yet attractors can also be more local, corresponding to more\nnarrowly shared cognitive dispositions or biases, common only to small\ncommunities. Such dispositions can explain reproduction that is only\nreliable across narrowly specified cultural contexts. Work in this\ntradition (e.g. Morin 2016) aims to answer the charge that the\ncultural evolutionary approach is vacuous via the detailed delineation\nof such factors of attraction, and their populational consequences, at\nvarious spatial and temporal scales. \nSome theorists begin their presentations of cultural evolutionary\ntheory by arguing that cultural change meets the conditions for\nevolution by natural selection stressed by Darwin. They argue, for\nexample, that in the realm of culture we find ample\nvariation—there are alternative ways of making pots, alternative\ndesigns for kayaks, and so forth—that there are differences in\nthe likelihood of these variants being preserved or multiplied in\nfuture generations—dependent on whether the pots in question\nlook attractive, whether the different forms of kayak are easy to\nhandle—and that there is adequately faithful reproduction as\nthese techniques or designs travel from one individual to another. In\nother words, we find some version of variation, differential fitness\nand inheritance instantiated in the cultural context, as well as in\nthe organic realm that Darwin primarily focused on. One of the risks\nof approaching the cultural evolution project in this abstract manner,\nwhich begins with the hunt for general similarities between the\ncultural and organic domains, has already been touched on. While we\nsecure the general claim that a form of natural selection applies in\nthe cultural domain, we can lose sight of what specific explanatory\nproblems a theory of cultural evolution is supposed to address. \nAs we have seen, other presentations of cultural evolution begin in a\nmore pragmatic, problem-driven fashion. In some cases they begin with\nexplanatory puzzles similar to those that led Darwin to formulate his\nprinciple of natural selection in the first place. Darwin was\nconcerned to explain how structures could arise which fit organisms so\nremarkably well to their conditions of existence. Cultural\nevolutionists frequently draw attention to a variety of adaptive\ncultural traits, whose origination seems inexplicable in terms of\nindividual innovation alone. Henrich (2015, 97–100), for example,\nmakes good use of the example of manioc processing. Manioc (also\ncalled cassava) is a good source of starch, but it needs to be\nprocessed to make it safe to eat. Without this processing it can\nrelease poisonous hydrogen cyanide. According to Henrich, while unprocessed\nmanioc tastes bitter, the bitter taste is not a good indicator of its\nsafety: bitterness disappears in the preparation process before it\nbecomes safe to eat. Worse, while unprocessed manioc is poisonous, it\nis hard to discover that this is the case, because the symptoms of\npoisoning only appear well after eating unsafe manioc. Henrich argues\nthat it is hard to see how any single insightful individual could have\ninvented this processing technology. Instead, a more gradual process\nof cumulative cultural adaptation, spread across the population, must\nbe invoked. In this kind of work, cultural analogues of organic\nselection processes are invoked because they promise a ‘hidden\nhand’ explanation for the appearance of adaptation, in contexts\nwhere explanations that rely on foresight seem unavailable. In other\nwords, the rationale for turning to selection is the same in both the\ncultural and organic domains. \nA second example of a more pragmatic, problem-driven invocation of\ncultural selection can be found in the ‘Tribal Social\nInstincts’ hypothesis. As Darwin (1877, 134) noted, humans are\nregularly moved to act in ways that benefit others, even when those\nothers are not members of extended families. He suggested that we are\nmoved by sympathy for others, and that the ultimate explanation for\nwhy we have such fellow-feeling can be explained as a result of a\nprocess of selection, albeit one that acts at the level of what he\ncalls ‘tribes’. This explanation has been updated across a\nlong series of publications by Richerson, Boyd and others, who also\naim to explain the very widespread tendencies of modern humans to\nshare valuable resources across broad social networks (e.g. Richerson\nand Boyd 2005, Richerson et al. 2016). Their view is that the resources\nof more mainstream evolutionary theory are not up to this explanatory\ntask. Kin selection is insufficient, they say, because humans\nregularly share with people outside their immediate family groups.\nMoreover, they take the view that the Pleistocene social groups in\nwhich (they believe) these sharing behaviours evolved were probably\ntoo large for reciprocal altruism to explain their emergence. Their\nfavoured explanatory hypothesis is a complex one, involving\ninteraction between what they call ‘cultural group\nselection’ and natural selection acting on genetic variation:\n“Selection on tribes can account for the innate foundation of\nour social psychology via the process of gene-culture\ncoevolution” (Richerson and Boyd 2005). \nThey argue, based on a mixture of historical, ethnographic and\ntheoretical work, for a scenario that begins with what they also call\n‘tribes’—they consider these to be ethnolinguistic\nunits of around 500 to 1500 people—competing against each other\nin ways that are aided by culturally transmissible differences in\ngroup properties. This competitive process eventually produces\n“culturally transmitted cooperative, group-oriented norms, and\nsystems of rewards and punishments to ensure that such norms are\nobeyed” (Richerson and Boyd 2005). Once cultural transmission\nhas established this social environment, natural selection acting on\ngenetic variation then favours an innate psychology that is suited to\nthis new, socially-inherited set of environmental problems. \nThe very idea of group selection is a controversial one. Many\ncommentators have taken a sceptical view of group selection when\nunderpinned by genetic inheritance, because of worries that\ncompetition based on genetic variation within groups will tend to\nundermine the effects of competition between groups. Several cultural\nevolutionists (e.g. Boyd and Richerson 2009, Henrich 2015) have argued\nthat cultural inheritance processes are better able than processes of\ngenetic inheritance to sustain between-group differences, for they\nbelieve there is good empirical and theoretical evidence that cultural\nprocesses can maintain within-group homogeneity in the face of various\ncountervailing factors (immigration, unreliable imitation and so\nforth). \nNeedless to say, this work is contentious. It is possible to challenge\nthe claims made about the innateness of the social psychological\ndispositions in question, the characterisation of likely Pleistocene\nsocial groups, the inability of more traditional evolutionary\nresources to explain our altruistic tendencies, and so forth (see\nBirch 2018). Such challenges are inevitable when a hypothesis is as\nambitious as this one, and when it draws on such a variety of\nsupporting sources of data. There are also conceptual concerns. A\nrecent paper lists three different forms of cultural group selection,\nof which straightforward competition between groups is just one\nvariant (Richerson et al. 2016). The authors also offer selective\nimitation (by individuals) of individuals in successful groups, and\nselective migration (by individuals) into successful groups, as two\nfurther types of cultural group selection. These are indeed additional\nways by which behavioural traits that are of benefit to a group can\nincrease in frequency in a larger population of groups. However, in\nthe second two cases, trait frequencies are increased simply by\nindividuals’ attraction to traits that they regard as bestowing\ncollective benefits. Because of this, thinking of them as forms of\ngroup selection may introduce confusion (see also Morin 2016).\nRegardless of these worries, it is clear that the cultural group\nselection explanation for forms of altruistic behaviour marks a\nsignificant effort to synthesise theory and evidence across a wide set\nof domains. \nA closely related way to vindicate models of cultural evolution looks\nto the question of the general features of inheritance systems that\nmake for evolvability in a lineage. This project has been pioneered in\nrecent years by Kim Sterelny (e.g., 2001, 2003, 2006a, 2006b, 2007,\n2012). Once again, let us illustrate the general nature of these\nissues by beginning in the organic realm. Darwin’s theory is\nintended to explain adaptation. The basic conditions for natural\nselection do not, in spite of appearances, suffice for the appearance\nof functional traits. A system in which offspring resemble parents\nwith respect to fitness-enhancing traits may not develop complex\nadaptations. The environment needs to cooperate: if selective\npressures change very quickly then there will be no sustained\nenvironmental demands of the sort that might build complex adaptations\nover time. Development also matters. If ontogeny is set up in such a\nway that changes to any one trait tend to be accompanied by changes to\nall other traits, then the chances are that cumulative adaptation will\nbe particularly hard to come by. For even in those cases where a\nmutation contributes positively to the function of one trait, the\nchances are that it will contribute negatively to overall fitness in\nvirtue of its disruption of the functioning of other traits.\nDevelopment also needs to make a wide range of variation available. If\nit is highly constrained, so that only a small number of forms are\npossible, then selection is not presented with a broad enough range of\nraw materials from which to fashion complex traits. It also seems that\ncumulative adaptation relies on the suppression of\n‘outlaws’ (Sterelny 2001, 2006b). We saw in the previous\nsection that group selection is often held to be an ineffective agent\nof group-level adaptation, on the grounds that it is vulnerable to\n‘subversion from within’. This occurs when individual\norganisms go it alone, sabotaging complex features of group\norganisation in favour of their own fitness. Individual-level\nselection, in contrast, can build individual-level adaptations. This\nis because, by and large, genes in a given human organism share a\n‘common fate’—they do not behave as though they were\nin direct competition, struggling for representation in future\ngenerations. When genes genuinely ‘go it alone’, for\nexample by sabotaging meiosis so that some have greater chances of\nappearing in future generations than others, then the overall\nintegrity of the organism can be compromised, and individual-level\nadaptation is undermined. \nBy applying these sorts of considerations to the cultural realm we can\nattempt to understand the likely costs and benefits associated with\nvarious different forms of cultural inheritance (vertical, oblique,\nmeme-like and so forth). We can also perhaps come to an understanding\nof the different evolutionary forces that might bring these different\nforms of cultural inheritance into existence. And, in turn, these\ninsights may facilitate comparative work that seeks to document the\ngeneral conditions that are required for a species to make use of\ncultural inheritance in order to build complex adaptations such as\ntools. This way of thinking offers the promise, for example, of\nexplaining why few, if any, non-human species are able to build\nprogressively more and more complex cultural features in a cumulative\nmanner (Richerson and Boyd 2005, 107; see also Laland 2017). The\nexploration of the significance of these conditions in the cultural\nrealm is contentious, partly because the conditions for evolvability\nthemselves are disputed (see Godfrey-Smith 2009). Boyd and\nHenrich’s work brings out the fact that although\npopulation-level inheritance is important for adaptation,\nparent-offspring resemblance is not, in fact, necessary. Questions\nrelating to evolvability are also tied up with difficult issues\nrelating to the units-of-selection debate (Okasha 2006). As we have\nseen, natural selection at a higher level of organisation may be\nrequired to generate mechanisms that suppress the ability of\ndisruptive ‘outlaws’ to go it alone at lower levels of\norganisation. Does something like this occur in the cultural realm?\nDoes selection on human groups act so as to limit the ability of\nindividual humans to go it alone? In what ways might cultural\ninheritance be involved in these processes? These questions are\ncomplex, both in terms of how they should be posed and how they should\nbe answered. But some of the most interesting work in cultural\nevolutionary theory may come from efforts to answer them. \nIssues relating to evolvability are sometimes framed in terms of\nsystems of information transfer. On this view, if offspring are to\nresemble parents, developmental information must be transmitted from\none generation to the next. The question is what forms of information\ntransmission system do this job. This mode of framing the issue is\ncontentious, for it is not always clear how we are to understand the\nconcept of information, and what it means for some causal contributor\nto development to count as an information-bearer, rather than some\nother kind of developmental participant, such as an\ninformation-reader, say, or a background condition for information\ntransfer (see Oyama 2000 and Griffiths 2001 for discussion of these\nissues). This general way of thinking about inheritance has, however,\nbeen influential in characterising so-called ‘major evolutionary\ntransitions’ (Maynard Smith and Szathmary 1995). Key transitions\nin the history of life are said to include the development of\nDNA-based inheritance, the emergence of chromosomes, the advent of the\n‘genetic code’, and events such as the arrival of\nsociality and language. Maynard Smith and Szathmary propose that we\ncan think of these events as modifications to the mechanisms of\ninter-generational information transmission. \nJablonka and Lamb (2005) argue that thinking in terms of information\ntransmission systems also allows us to point out salient differences\nin the forms of social transmission underlying cultural evolution.\nThey claim that only some forms of social transmission make use of a\nsystem of symbols. Consider, for example, that to say that\nsome birds inherit their song by social transmission is not to say\nthat birdsong is a symbolic system. Humans, on the other hand, trade\nin publicly-accessible symbols. Moreover, repositories of symbols,\nmost obviously in the form of libraries and computer databases, are\nvital inheritance systems for humans, allowing the preservation and\naccumulation of knowledge across generations. Note, also, that there\nare different types of symbol system. In some cases the relationship\nbetween a symbol and what is represented is arbitrary. The is the case\nfor a word like ‘man’, which does not look or sound like a\nhuman male. In other cases of iconic symbolism, the\nrelationship is one of resemblance: a sign for the gents’ toilet\nlooks like a man. \nJablonka and Lamb use the characteristic differences between typical\nmodes of social inheritance in animals and humans to illuminate the\nimpact our own symbolic transmission systems have on human cultural\nevolution (see also Deacon 1997). Although they argue that there can\nbe non-linguistic symbolic systems (2005, 224), language exemplifies\nnicely the way in which systems of symbols contain elements that can\nbe recombined in countless ways to yield a vast array of different\nmeaningful messages. Repositories of symbolically stored information,\nsuch as books, can also be searched, annotated, edited and so forth,\nin ways that add to their power and versatility. This manner of\nthinking opens up a number of challenging issues. The question of the\ndegree to which symbolic systems resemble other inheritance systems is\nan illuminating one. Consider, by way of example, Stegmann’s\n(2004) discussion of the sense in which the genetic code is\n‘arbitrary’. One quickly realises that any attempt to say\nprecisely what makes some inheritance system a symbolic system, and\nany attempt to differentiate between types of symbolic systems\n(linguistic, non-linguistic and so forth), will be exceptionally\nphilosophically demanding. \nMany evolutionists have argued that biological tools can have great\nvalue when we wish to develop a historical view of the pattern of\ncultural change (see, for example, Gray at al 2007, Mace and Holden\n2005: this section itself draws on Lewens 2012). A variety of\nbiological methods have been developed that help us to uncover the\nstructure of evolutionary trees: they help us to understand which taxa\nsplit from which others and when. It seems clear that cultural items\nof many kinds (most obviously languages, but also tools and\ntechniques) also stand in recognizable genealogical relationships, and\nthis has led many biological anthropologists to use phylogenetic\nmethods borrowed or adapted from the biological sciences in order to\nreconstruct the history of borrowings in the cultural realm. Critics\nhave sometimes followed Gould (1988) in arguing that these biological\nmethods cannot be properly applied to the cultural realm, because\ncultural genealogies take the form of reticulated networks, rather\nthan branching trees. Cultural change is indeed often highly\nreticulated: it is obvious that a complex object like a car is a\nconfluence of numerous technical lineages, which come together to form\nthe hi-fi system, the engine, the safety devices, and so forth.\nMoreover, as improvements are made to cars these new developments may\nbe borrowed by innovators of bicycles, furniture, toys and other\nshifting constellations of artifacts.  \nThese important observations need not undermine the project of\ncultural phylogeny. Much of biological evolution is also reticulated.\nBacteria, for example, do not form genealogically isolated lineages,\nhybridization is rife among plants, and there is also considerable\nborrowing of elements of the genome between apparently isolated\nmammalian species. Of course this might show simply that phylogenetic\nmodes of inference are doubly imperilled: they don’t work for\nmuch of the biological world either. But cultural evolutionists (e.g.\nGray et al. 2007) are encouraged by inferential developments within\nbiology itself, which aim to reconstruct partially reticulated trees\nby proposing so-called reconciliations of the conflicting trees that\ntraditional methods often propose for species and genes.  \nThis kind of work is important, in part because of the uses to which\nwell-confirmed cultural phylogenies can be put. It may be easiest to\nillustrate their value via a simple example. On the face of things,\nlooking for correlations is a reasonable (albeit fallible) way to\ndiscover causal relationships. If, for example, people who smoke often\nget lung cancer, and people with lung cancer are often smokers, then\nwe have good evidence that smoking causes lung cancer (or perhaps that\nlung cancer causes smoking). But there can be strong correlations that\ndo not indicate causation. If, for example, we find that there is a\nstrong correlation in animals between making a moo sound and producing\nlarge quantities of milk, we should not conclude that one causes the\nother. Mooing and milk production go together because the creatures in\nquestion share ancestors in common, who both mooed and gave lots of\nmilk. Of course, in the case of cows this fact of common ancestry is\nso obvious that we hardly notice how it informs our causal inference.\nBut cultural phylogenies are unobvious. Russell Gray, among others,\nhas long argued that when we understand them better, our knowledge of\nphylogenies can then confirm, or undermine, causal hypotheses that are\nclaimed on the basis of correlation.  \nGray and Watts (2017), for example, have scrutinised what is sometimes\ncalled the Supernatural Punishment Hypothesis. This is the hypothesis\nthat belief in powerful gods, who inflict punishment on wrongdoers,\ntends to result in societies that are better able to harness the\nfruits of cooperation (see Norenzayan et al. 2016). Gray and Watts\nagain caution that mere correlation between societies that believe in\n‘moralising high gods’ and various measures of social\ncomplexity does not count strongly in favour of the Supernatural\nPunishment Hypothesis. We must also take into account the potentially\nconfounding consequences of shared ancestry among the societies\nsurveyed. Gray and Watts draw on Austronesian data to argue that\nbelief in moralising high gods tends to be gained after, not before,\nthe emergence of political complexity; so these data, they suggest,\nundermine the thought that moralising high gods drive this form of\ncomplexity. That said, they do find some support for a weaker\nsupernatural punishment hypothesis based on belief in punishment\ninterventions from natural spirits, ancestral spirits and mythical\nheroes, as well as from moralising high gods. In their view this type\nof belief facilitated, ‘the rise of political complexity’\nwithout ‘helping sustain it’ (2017: 7848). Work such as\nthis indicates the potential for cultural phylogenetics to inform\nbroad-sweep hypotheses about not just the patterns, but also the\ncausal processes, that have marked the cultural history of our\nspecies. \nHow do theorists within the field of cultural evolution understand\nwhat ‘culture’ is (see Driscoll 2017 for general\ndiscussion)? Richerson and Boyd’s (2005) definition is fairly\ntypical of the field as a whole, and is mirrored in definitions given\nby Mesoudi (2011) and Henrich (2015). Culture, they say, is\n‘information capable of affecting individuals’ behavior\nthat they acquire from other members of their species through\nteaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning’\n(Richerson and Boyd 2005, 5). This raises the further question of what\nis meant by ‘social learning’. In an important overview of\nwork on cultural evolution, Henrich gives a definition of this key\nnotion for cultural evolutionary theory, and of the notion of\n‘individual learning’ that it is regularly contrasted\nwith: \nOne consequence of this way of defining things (a consequence which\nHenrich explicitly recognises) is that the two terms, ‘social\nlearning’ and ‘individual learning’, are not\nexclusive. In a species like ours it is hardly ever the case that what\nan individual learns is free from influence by others. Even in extreme\ncases where we learn by probing our surroundings well away from social\ncompany, almost every aspect of the environments we interact\nwith—and hence what we end up learning from those\nenvironments—has been affected by other people’s past\nactions. The structures and contents of our dwellings and workplaces,\nthe constitutions of the domesticated plants and animals we interact\nwith, the cultivated and engineered environments we live in, all have\nbeen affected by the activities of our predecessors. \nThe overlap between individual and social forms of learning has\nsignificance for research on non-human, as well as the human, species.\nThe group of wild chimpanzees studied by Hobaiter et al. (2014) began\nto develop a new behaviour: previously they had used\n‘sponges’, made from chewed-up leaves, to soak up drinking\nwater. Some then began to make these sponges from moss instead. The\nresearchers saw one individual develop this behaviour because she\nre-used an old moss sponge, which had previously been discarded by\nanother chimp. But she did not do this because she had seen the sponge\nin use. One the one hand, this is a clear case of individual learning:\nfrom the chimp’s-eye view the discarded sponge was simply\nsomething she happened to have found lying around. On the other hand,\nthis is manifestly a piece of social learning according to\nHenrich’s definition, for the past action of another chimp\ngreatly eased the inventive burden in discovering that moss could be\nused as a sponge. Little wonder, then, that the study authors mention\nthis example as part of ‘a growing literature that refutes a\nstrong distinction between individual and social learning’\n(2014). As that distinction blurs, so the further question of what\nculture consists in becomes less clear (Lewens 2017). For there are\nnumerous ways in which activities of one generation can, by altering\nor maintaining stable features of biotic, social and technical\nenvironments, have an influence over what individuals in the following\ngenerations end up learning. \nThese phenomena are recognised by many prominent theorists of cultural\nevolution. Laland et al. stress this theme in their work on\nniche-construction—i.e. the role of organisms in fashioning\ntheir environments—when they remark that, ‘We inherit a\nworld of our making...This is both our ecological and our cultural\ninheritance’ (2001). Sterelny’s work on the evolution of\ncognition (e.g. Sterelny 2012) also places stress on what he sometimes\ncalls ‘scaffolded learning’. Like Hobaiter et al’s\nchimps, unskilled, ignorant or uninitiated human novices can find\ntheir epistemic burdens greatly eased by the ways in which the\nenvironments in which they learn are littered with the fruits of past\nactivities of adepts. \nHenrich, also, remarks that ‘...the least sophisticated forms of\nsocial learning occur simply as a by-product of being around others,\nand engaging in individual learning’. He reserves the term\n‘cultural learning’ for the ‘more sophisticated\nsubclass of social learning abilities in which individuals seek to\nacquire information from others...’ (2015, 12–13). Critics of\nthese final comments (e.g. Clarke and Heyes 2017) have urged that we\nseek more detailed information concerning whether individual\nlearning—which, as we have seen, can take place in felicitously\nstructured environments—truly is less sophisticated than forms\nof learning that attend directly to the behaviours of others. We need\nto ask both whether there is an additional form of sophistication in\nthe cognitive mechanisms that underpin social (compared with\nindividual) learning, and also whether social learning has greater\nfunctionality, specifically with respect to the generation of\nincreasingly refined behaviours, technologies, norms and institutions\nacross populations. These are just the types of questions to which the\nmethods of cultural evolutionary work—which combine populational\nmodelling with work in cognitive science—are well placed to give\nanswers.","contact.mail":"tml1000@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
