For example, we seem to be directly aware of change,\nmovement, and succession across brief temporal intervals. How is\nthis possible? Many different models of\ntemporal consciousness have been proposed. Some philosophers have\nargued that consciousness is confined to a momentary interval and that\nwe are not in fact directly aware of change. Others have argued that\nalthough consciousness itself is momentary, we are nevertheless\nconscious of change. Still others have argued that consciousness\nis itself extended in time. In this entry, the motivations and\nmerits of these and other positions will be expounded and assessed.\n\n\n\nTime and consciousness are interwoven on several levels. From\nthe vantage point of ordinary life and common sense, consciousness\nplainly seems to exists in time. When we hear the clock\nstrike twelve, our auditory experience of it so doing also occurs at\ntwelve (or at most a few moments later). Watching a 120\nminute action movie results in a two hour stream of auditory and visual\nexperiences (along with accompanying thoughts and feelings), and this\nstream runs concurrently with the playing of the movie. Quite\ngenerally, our conscious states, irrespective of their kind or\ncharacter, seem to occur in the same temporal framework as the events\nin the wider world – even if their precise timing is not easy to\nascertain. But this is by no means the whole story.  \n\nOur consciousness may be located within time, but there are also ways\nin which time or temporality might be regarded as\nmanifest within consciousness. While watching a two hour\nmovie, we will generally remain aware how much of the two hour period\nremains, even if we are paying no attention to the plot.  We can judge\nthe duration of temporal intervals, particularly short ones, with\nreasonable accuracy – an ability that psychologists have\ninvestigated in considerable detail (see Wearden 2016 for an\noverview). Our episodic (or autobiographical) memories supply us with\naccess to our own pasts; thanks to such memories our earlier states of\nconsciousness are not altogether lost to us: they can be recreated (or\nrelived), albeit imperfectly, in our present consciousness. And of\ncourse there are past-oriented emotions, such as remorse or regret or\nshame: through these the past can influence our present feelings,\noften in powerful ways. While there is no future-directed counterpart\nof memory, we can anticipate future happenings (more or less\naccurately, more or less eagerly), and experience future-directed\nemotions: fear, dread, hope – and these too can exert a powerful\ninfluence of our present states of consciousness. \n\nThe story is still by no means complete, for temporality is manifest\nin consciousness in a further and more intimate way. In our\nordinary experience, over brief intervals, we seem to be directly aware of\ntemporally extended phenomena such as change, persistence and\nsuccession. When we see a friend waving goodbye, do we\ninfer that their arm is moving, on the basis of having\nobserved a motionless arm occupying a sequence of adjacent spatial\nlocation? We do make such inferences of this kind: if I see that\nmy neighbour’s dustbin is in the middle of the road rather than\nits usual position on the pavement, I (rightly) infer that it has been\nmoved. But the case in question is not at all like this: what we\nsee is simply an arm in motion. (Is it for nothing that\ncinema is often called ‘the moving image’?) The same\napplies in other sensory modalities. When listening to a\nmelody, we hear each note giving way to its successor; when we hear a\nsustained violin tone, we hear the tone continuing on, from\nmoment to moment. If temporally extended occurrences such as\nthese can feature in our immediate experience, it is natural to\nconclude that our awareness must be capable of embracing a temporal\ninterval. \n\nWhile this may seem obvious, it can also seem problematic. We\ncan remember the past and anticipate the future, but we are only\ndirectly aware of what is present – or so it is natural to say\nand suppose. But the present, strictly speaking, is\nmomentary. So if our awareness is confined to the present, our\nawareness must itself lack temporal depth. Hence we are led\nswiftly to the conclusion that our direct awareness cannot possibly\nencompass phenomena possessing temporal extension. We are thus\nconfronted with a conundrum: it seems our awareness must extend over\ntime, but it seems it can’t. \n\nIn grappling with this ‘paradox of temporal awareness’\nas it is sometimes called, different philosophers have proposed quite\ndifferent accounts (or models) of the structure of this form of temporal\nconsciousness. Simplifying somewhat, the most commonly favoured\noptions fall into three main categories: Cinematic Model: our immediate awareness lacks any\n(or any significant) temporal extension, and the same applies to the\ncontents of which we are directly aware – they are akin to\nstatic, motion-free ‘snapshots’ or\n‘stills’. Our streams of consciousness are composed\nof continuous successions of these momentary states of\nconsciousness. In this respect they are analogous to\nmovies, which (as displayed) consist of rapid sequences of still\nimages. \nRetentional Model: our experiencing of change and\nsuccession occurs within episodes of consciousness which themselves\nlack temporal extension, but whose contents present (or represent)\ntemporally extended intervals and phenomena. These episodes thus have a\ncomplex structure, comprising momentary phases of immediate experience,\nalong with representations (or retentions) of the recent\npast. Our streams of consciousness are composed of successions of\nthese momentary states. \n\nExtensional Model: our episodes of experiencing are\nthemselves temporally extended, and are thus able to incorporate change\nand persistence in a quite straightforward way. Our streams\nof consciousness are composed of successions of these extended\n‘chunks’ of experience. \n\nThese labels are not standard – in this field there is little\nby way of terminological uniformity – but for present purposes they will serve (see Kon and Miller (2015) for a more fine-grained categorization). All three models are depicted in Figure 1 below. In\neach of the diagrams the horizontal line represents ordinary\nclock-time. Although the Retentional and Cinematic models both\ntrade in momentary (or very brief) states of consciousness – in\nthe diagrams such states are represented by thin vertical lines –\nthese states are construed very differently. In the Cinematic\ncase the momentary contents seem momentary, and are static (they\ncontain no discernible motion or change); in the Retentional case the\ncontents appear to possess a brief temporal depth, containing as they\ndo experienced change and succession – hence the backward\npointing arrows, intended to signify the way in which the recent past\nis supposedly ‘retained’ in present consciousness. Figure 1. The Three Main Conceptions of Temporal Consciousness. \n\nIn his influential writings on these matters William James argued\nthat to make sense of our temporal experience we need to distinguish\nthe strict (or mathematical) present from the from the\nexperiential (or specious) present: whereas the first\nis indeed durationless, the second possesses a brief duration,\nsufficient to accommodate the change and persistence we find in our\nimmediate experience. The Retentional and Extensional\napproaches can each be seen as implementing James’ proposal,\nalbeit in very different ways. \n\nAscertaining where the truth lies among the differing accounts of\nthe temporal contents of our immediate experience is interesting and\nintriguing in itself. Although most forms of experience seemingly\nfeature succession and persistence – even the most primitive\nforms if James was correct in characterizing infant consciousness as a\n‘blooming, buzzing confusion’ – it is not easy to\nunderstand how any form of experience can have such\nfeatures. The interest and importance of the debate does\nnot end here, for each of the accounts of temporal awareness on offer has\nsignificant, and very different, implications for our understanding of\nthe general structure of consciousness. In this entry we will be\nexploring the principle features and motivations of the competing\naccounts, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. \n\nAlthough proponents of all three approaches are attempting to make\nsense of our experience of temporally extended phenomena, there are\ndivergences on the issue of how precisely this experience should be\nconstrued, and on several related matters. \n\nOne significant divide is between those who believe that temporally\nextended phenomena really do figure in our immediate experience, and\nthose who deny this. To coin some terminology: \nPhenomeno-temporal Realism (PT-realism,\nsometimes further abbreviated to realism): change, succession\nand persistence can be directly perceived or apprehended. \n\nPhenomeno-temporal Antirealism\n(PT-antirealism, sometimes further abbreviated to\nantirealism): change, succession and persistence\ncannot be directly perceived or apprehended. \n\nThe Extensional and Retentional models are the two principle forms\nof PT-realism. Proponents of the Cinematic model can subscribe to\nrealism, but most do not. The task facing PT-antirealists\nis in one respect the easier of the two: unlike their realist\ncounterparts, they are under no obligation to provide an intelligible\naccount of how it is possible for our consciousness to embrace\ntemporally extended phenomena. But in another respect their task\nis the more difficult. Antirealists are under an obligation to\n‘save the (temporal) phenomena’: they need to supply a\ncredible explanation as to why it seems so natural to say we\nperceive movement and change when, in actual fact, we do no such\nthing. \n\nFor realists it is important to distinguish the experience\nof succession from a mere succession of experiencings.\nAn experience of succession involves a temporal spread of contents\nbeing presented together in consciousness, albeit in the form\nof a perceived succession rather than simultaneously. Hence both\nExtensional and Retentional theorists agree that a temporal spread of\ncontents can be apprehended as a unity. To introduce some further\nterminology: \nThe Diachronic Unity Thesis: simultaneous contents\ncan be experienced together, but so too can contents that appear to be\nsuccessive (at least over short intervals). \n\nContents which are apprehended as unified in this way belong to a\nsingle specious present. Note the ‘appear to be\nsuccessive’. This is needed to accommodate Retentional\nspecious presents: although on a phenomenological level these seem to\npossess temporal extension, in reality they are housed in episodes of\nexperiencing which are momentary, objectively speaking.\nExtensional theorists, by contrast, regard specious presents as\nextending a short distance through ordinary clock-time, in just the way\nthey seem to. \n\nThe confinement of immediate experience to a momentary present has a\nlong and distinguished pedigree. In the preamble to his\nLectures on the Consciousness of Internal Time Husserl tells\nus ‘The analysis of time-consciousness is an ancient burden for\ndescriptive psychology and epistemology. The first thinker who sensed\nprofoundly the enormous difficulties inherent in this analysis, and who\nstruggled with them almost to despair, was Augustine’ (1991:\n3). Irrespective of whether he was the first to dwell on such\nmatters, Augustine’s labours in Book XI of the\nConfessions led him to espouse a position that is at least\nhighly suggestive of the Cinematic conception outlined in\n§1. Augustine subscribed to the doctrine of\nPresentism (as it has latterly become known), i.e., he held\nthat only what is present is real: \n\nSince for Augustine it was also clear that the present must be\nentirely without duration, and that our perception is restricted to\nwhat is present – ‘that only can be seen, which is’\n(Gale 1968: 43) – we are led swiftly to the conclusion that we\ncan perceive or experience only what is contained in a momentary\npresent. \n\nAugustine went further. If our consciousness is confined to\nthe momentary present, how is it possible for us to know as much as we\ndo about the duration of events or processes we live through?\nAugustine’s solution to this problem turns on the way memory and\nexpectation can interact. For illustrative purposes he envisages\nhimself on the verge of reciting a familiar Psalm. Before\nstarting to speak all the verses are laid out before him in the form\nof expectations concerning what he is about to say; when part-way\nthrough his performance, the reciting of some verses is transferred\nfrom expectation to memory; as he continues to speak this transfer\ncontinues until the whole of the Psalm passes into memory: ‘thus\nthe life of this action of mine is divided between my memory as to what\nI have repeated, and expectation as to what I am about to\nrepeat.’ (Gale 1968: 52). Analogous considerations apply\nover shorter timescales (the experiencing of individual sounds and\nsyllables) and over longer periods (a person’s entire\nlife). \n\nAs we shall see, this reliance on a combination of momentary\nperceptual experience, memory and expectation in explaining our\nexperience of temporality is typical of PT-antirealists. \n\nSince we evidently possess concepts of persistence,\nsuccession and suchlike, one would expect philosophers who believe that\nour basic concepts derive their content from the content of our\nimmediate experience – philosophers such as Locke, Berkeley and\nHume – would incline in the direction of realism. And\ngenerally speaking, albeit with certain complications, this is\nwhat we find. In the Enquiry (1690) Locke\nwrites: \n\nAs it stands, the import of this passage is not entirely clear, for\nit is not entirely clear what Locke mean when he talks of our\n‘reflecting’ on successions of ideas (i.e.,\nexperiences). If reflection simply means introspection\n– i.e., the directing of our attention, the focusing of our\nintrospective awareness – then for Locke succession is something\nof which we are directly aware. If ‘reflecting’ means\n‘think about’ in the sense of reason about, there\nis no such implication. Other passages from the Enquiry\ntend to confirm the introspective construal. When explicitly\ndefining ‘reflection’ Locke links it closely to attentive\nawareness: ‘By REFLECTION … I would be understood to mean,\nthat notice which the Mind takes of its own Operations, and the manner\nof them, by reason whereof, there come to be Ideas of these\nOperations in the Understanding.’ (II, 1, 4) The\nintrospective interpretation gains further support in this passage: \n\nGiven that Locke’s defines consciousness itself as\n‘the perception of what passes in a Man’s own mind’\n(II, 1, 19), if we can observe (and hence perceive) succession in our\nown minds, we are surely conscious of it too. \n\nThe case for taking Locke to subscribe to realism looks\n strong.[1]\nRemarks along\nvery similar lines can also be found in Berkeley: in section 98 of\nThe Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) he tells us that\n‘Time therefore [is] nothing, abstracted from the\nsuccession of ideas in our minds’. Hume’s position on\nthe origin of our concept of succession is likewise broadly similar to\nthat of Locke. In Book 1, Part II(§3) of his\nTreatise (1739) he writes: \n… time cannot make its appearance to the mind, either alone,\nor attended with a steady unchangeable object, but is always discovered\nby some perceivable succession of changeable objects.\n(Treatise: 35) \n\n… Five notes played on a flute give us the impression and\nidea of time; though time be not a sixth impression, which presents\nitself to the hearing or any other of the senses.\n(ibid., 36) \n\n… the indivisible moments of time must be filled with some\nreal object or existence, whose succession forms the duration, and\nmakes it conceivable by the mind. (ibid., 39) \n\nAlthough Hume agrees with Locke over the origin of our concept of\nsuccession, what he says about duration sits uneasily with\nLocke’s contention that we arrive at the latter concept by\nobserving the distances between impressions. For Hume, \n\nSince a period of (total) silence between the hearing of two sounds\nwould not itself contain any change or succession – at least of\nan auditory kind – the concept of duration cannot be derived from\nthis period of silence, or so Hume maintains. For an ingenious\nattempt to derive a consistent doctrine from Hume’s various\n(sometimes puzzling) remarks on time and temporal concepts in the\nTreatise see Baxter (2007); for further useful discussion see\nBardon (2007). \n\nThomas Reid also takes issue with some of Locke’s claims in\nhis Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785). For\nLocke succession is a more basic concept than duration – since we\narrive at the concept of duration by reflecting on the distances\nbetween parts of successions – but Reid argues the reverse is the\ncase. For a succession to exist at all, its parts – either\nparticular impressions or the intervals between them – must\nthemselves already have duration: for if these parts were all entirely\nlacking in duration, we would be dealing with a purely momentary\nphenomenon, and hence something which could not contain any kind of\nsuccession. Hence succession presupposes duration, and not\nvice-versa. \n\nReid’s second complaint concerns the role Locke assigns to\nreflection, construed as the awareness we have of the contents\nand operations of our own minds. Reid doesn’t dismiss this\nuse of the term as illegitimate, but he does suggest it is a good deal\nnarrower than the ordinary (and thus more proper) use, which\nallows reflection to encompass reasoning, judging, and remembering what\nis past. The latter is of particular relevance, for Reid goes on\nto argue without memory to inform us of what we have already\nexperienced, we could never arrive at a concept of succession.\nConsequently, since ‘reflection’ construed in Locke’s\nnarrow, quasi-technical way doesn’t involve memory,\nLocke was mistaken in thinking that reflection – of this sort at\nleast – could ever furnish us with our concept of\nsuccession. \n\nIn arguing thus Reid is evidently assuming that our direct awareness\nis incapable of spanning even a brief temporal interval: if it could,\nwe could directly apprehend successions, without relying on\nmemory. His argument for this assumption is succinct, and on the\nface of it, quite plausible: \n\nSince the claim that we are immediately aware only of what is\npresent can seem common sense of the plainest sort, it is not\nsurprising to find Reid endorsing it, and hence rejecting realism in\nfavour of the antirealist alternative. Reid recognizes that it\nseems equally common sensical to say that we see bodies move\n– after all, we often talk in such terms: e.g., ‘I saw her\nwaving her arm’. In response he argues that such talk is\nperfectly legitimate, provided it is construed in loose or popular\nsense, and not taken strictly and literally. \n\nSo far as the perception of change is concerned, matters are by no\nmeans as clear-cut as Reid suggests. Endorsing the\nplausible-seeming Augustinian doctrine that consciousness is confined\nto the present point of time does not oblige one to reject the (equally\nplausible) claim that change and succession feature prominently in\nimmediate experience. These claims are quite compatible with one\nanother provided the experience of change occurs within the\nconfines of the momentary present. Indeed, in the eyes of\nsome – but not all – this confinement is a necessary\nprecondition for contents to be experienced together. For\naccording to one influential line of thinking regarding phenomenal\nunity, in order for contents to be experienced as unified, they\nmust be presented simultaneously to a single momentary\nawareness. \n\nThe obvious way of developing an account along these lines is to\nhold that momentary episodes of sensory consciousness are accompanied\nby a simultaneously existing array of representations (or\nretentions) of immediately preceding conscious states, and our\nawareness – at a single moment of time – of this\ncombination of ingredients provides us with (what we take to be) a\ndirect awareness of change and succession. Kant propounds\nsomething alone these lines in ‘The Synthesis of Reproduction in\nImagination’ from the first Critique (1787): \n\nKant here is concerned with the necessary preconditions for thought\n(or cognition) as well as perceptual experience, and his overall line\nof argument is\n complex.[2]\nHowever, it is easy to grasp (at\nleast part of) what he has in mind. Anyone who inclines to\nrealism, but also follows Augustine in confining consciousness to the\nmomentary present, faces the difficulty of explaining how we can have\nan awareness of succession if our consciousness consists of nothing\nmore than a succession of momentary snapshot-like experiences.\nKant solves this problem by offering a richer account of these\nmomentary states of consciousness. In the visual case, momentary\nepisodes of visual experiencing are accompanied by representations of\nrecently experienced visual contents. More generally, these\nrepresentations (or retentions) allow us to be aware that our presently\noccurring experience is a part of an ongoing process. \n\nMore needs to be said, but Kant supplies at least the beginnings of\none plausible-looking account of how it might be possible for us to be\naware of change and succession in the way we seem to be. This\n‘Retentional’ approach – recalling the terminology of\n§1.1 – soon found other advocates, and is comparatively\ncommonplace by the end of the nineteenth century. Brentano\nrecognized that reaching a clear understanding how it is possible for\nus to directly experience succession and persistence is central issue\nfor phenomenology (or ‘descriptive psychology’ as he\npreferred to call it). He also recognized that a mere succession\nof experiences does not, in and of itself, add up to an experience of\nsuccession. Brentano’s solution is reminiscent of\nKant’s: when listening (say) to an extended tone or melody, he\nargued, at each moment you are aware of a momentary sound-phase, in the\nform of a momentary auditory sensation, but you are also (and\nsimultaneously) aware of a series of representations (or retentions) of\nthe immediately preceding phases. The latter Brentano referred to\nas proteraesthesis. In lectures in Würzburg in 1873\nBrentano illustrated what he had in mind with a diagram, similar to the\none depicted in Figure 2, which depicts the experiencing of a\nmelody. Figure 2.\nBrentano on hearing a melody. \n\nThe horizontal line a-b-c-d corresponds to a continuous flow of\nongoing auditory sensations; the vertical lines correspond to the\nproteraestheses which accompany these sensations at three particular\npoints b, c an d. As can be seen, as\nwe move from b to c to d, the\nproteraestheses gradually increase in complexity, with the result that\nthe hearing of d is accompanied by representations of\npreceding tone-phases stretching right back to a, but no\nfurther: this is the limit of the experienced present. Although\nin this last episode representations of a, b and\nc are experienced together with d, these tone-phases\nare not experienced as simultaneous – i.e., as a chord\n– rather, they are experienced as a succession. This gives\nrise to several questions. How can contents which are\nsimultaneous, objectively speaking, seem to be successive? What\nis the precise nature of the representations occurring in\nproteraestheses? \n\nBrentano’s views on these matters underwent several\nchanges. In his earlier writings, he held that proteraestheses\nare filled with non-existent (purely intentional) objects; the latter\nare apprehended under a ‘modifying attribute’ which results\nin their (seemingly) possessing a certain degree of pastness. He\ncame to view this is as mistake, and in later writings he argued that\nthe difference between the content of a proteraesthesis and an ordinary\n(present) sensation lies not in the nature of the object of\nwhich we are aware, but rather the way in which we are aware\nof it – there are ‘temporal modes of\nconsciousness’. Initially he construed these temporal modes\nin terms of differences in judgement (a represented content\na is judged be past to a certain degree); in the final phase\nof his thought he opted instead for temporal modes of\npresentation: sensory objects can be apprehended as past\nto differing degrees. See Chisholm (1981) and Kraus (1976)\nfor further details. \n\nIn his account of how it is possible for us to perceive a temporally\nextended phenomena such as a melody, Meinong (1899) defended a\nRetentional conception of time consciousness along the same general\nlines as Brentano’s, but he also emphasised some relevant\ndistinctions. \n\nMeinong points out that the temporal properties of the objects we\nperceive need not coincide with the temporal properties of the\npresentations (or episodes of awareness) in which we apprehend\nthem: e.g., objects which are past can be presented in the\npresent. A further distinction concerns ‘temporally\ndistributed’ and ‘temporally undistributed’\nobjects. An entity is temporally distributed if its existence is\nspread over time, it is temporally undistributed if its existence is\nconfined to a single moment. It is natural to think that a\ntemporally distributed process such as a melody is perceived via a\nsequence of presentations which are themselves temporally distributed\n– presentations which run concurrently, or in parallel, with what\nis presented. However, this natural or naïve picture is also\nproblematic: since a succession of presentations does not amount to a\npresentation of succession, something further is needed. For\nMeinong, as for Brentano, the way forward is dictated by a necessary\nconstraint on experienced unity: for contents to make up a perceived\nsuccession they must be presented simultaneously, to a single momentary\nact of apprehension. So it turns out that, contrary to the\nnaïve view, temporally distributed objects are apprehended by\nepisodes of experiencing which are themselves non-distributed. \n\nThe naïve view rejected by Meinong may have its problems, but\nit also has its defenders. The psychologist L.W Stern criticised\nMeinong’s own preferred model on phenomenological grounds.\nWe are seeking an account of how we can directly perceive change and\npersistence. Meinong locates the perception of succession in\nreproductions of previously experienced contents, housed in\nmomentary episodes of experiencing. How can apprehending these\nreproductions (or retentions) deliver a full-blooded perception of\nsuccession? The only way to achieve what is needed is to allow\nsuccessions of properly perceptual contents to be directly\napprehended. For Stern this means acts of apprehension\nmust be temporally distributed: \n\nSo for Stern the episodes of experiencing in which temporally\nextended phenomena are apprehended are themselves temporally\nextended. The doctrine that diachronic phenomenal unity can only\nexist in strictly momentary states of consciousness is rejected in\nfavour of a more natural (or naïve) model of temporal\nawareness. \n\nThis ‘Extensional’ approach – again\nrecalling the terminology of §1.1 – has the definite\nadvantage of allowing change to be perceived in as immediate manner as\none might wish for. In subsequent years variants of it will be defended by\nMundle (1966), Foster (1979, 1982, 1991), Dainton (2000/2006, 2003,\n2008, 2014), Hoerl (2013b), Phillips (2010, 2014b), Rashbrook (2013), Soteriou (2010). \n\nHowever, although it has its advantages, this model\nalso faces difficulties. How is it possible for contents that are\nall experienced together, and also as present, seemingly to occur in\nsuccession rather than simultaneously? Meinong pointed out a\nfurther potentially significant problem. In virtue of what are\nthe successive phases of a temporally extended episode of experiencing\nunified? What prevents a temporally distributed awareness from\nalso being a fragmented one? This is a difficulty Brentano,\nMeinong and other Retentional theorists avoid: if the experience of\nsuccession is housed in momentary states of consciousness, the problem\nof securing diachronic unity for temporally distributed experiencings\nsimply does not arise. Allowing consciousness to extend through time may bring advantages, but it is not without costs. \n\nThe last decades of the 19th century saw the Retentional\nform of realism also finding favour in Anglophone circles. James\nWard’s ‘Psychology’ entry for the ninth edition of the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica (1886) includes the following account of the\nexperience of succession: ‘In a succession of events, say of\nsense-impressions A B C D E … the presence of B means the absence of\nA and of C, but the presentation of this succession involves the\nsimultaneous presence, in some mode or other, of two or more of the\npresentations A B C D. In presentation … all that corresponds\nto the differences of past, present and future is in consciousness\nsimultaneously’. The second chapter of Shadworth\nHodgson’s The Metaphysic of Experience (1898) contains a\ndetailed phenomenological analysis of what is involved in hearing a\nsuccession of tones C-D, and the account Hodgson develops there is\nclearly along Retentionalist lines: “In this sequence, when we are\nactually hearing D, we are actually not hearing but remembering C\n… the content of C being now continued, but with less\nvividness, into the portion of the process occupied by D thereby\nbecoming a representation of C which is no longer heard as a\npresentation.” (1898: 70–72)  \nBoth Ward and Hodgson are cited by William James in his influential\nchapter ‘The Perception of Time’ in his Principles of\nPsychology (1890). It was thanks to James’ discussion that\n‘the specious present’ entered the vocabulary of both\nphilosophers and psychologists. James gives E.R. Clay credit both for\nthe term, and for recognizing that the ‘sensible present’\nhas duration; he quotes him thus: \n\nWhile it is not clear from this passage quite how Clay construed the\nspecious present, it evidently has some apparent duration\n– enough to contain the seeing of a shooting star – hence\nits difference from the strict (durationless or\nmathematical)\n present.[3]\nJames claimed the latter to be ‘an altogether ideal abstraction,\nnot only never realized in sense, but probably never even conceived of\nby those unaccustomed to philosophic meditation.’ (1890:\n608) For James the only present with experiential reality is the\nspecious present: ‘the original paragon and prototype of all\nconceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which we\nare immediately and incessantly sensible.’ (1890: 631) In\nanother formulation he enters into more detail, and says something\nabout what this short duration contains: \n\nJames’ specious present and Stern’s\n‘presence-time’ obviously have much in common – both\nare intended to designate the brief temporal window through which we\nare directly aware of change and persistence – but in one respect\nthey are very different. Stern construed this window in an\nExtensionalist way, as extending over a brief interval of ordinary\ntime. James, by contrast, followed Ward and Hodgson and\nsubscribed to a Retentional interpretation. Or at least he did so\nin the Principles, in other writings a different story is\ntold; see Section 3 of the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues\n for more on the interpretation of James. \nAlthough Hodgson’s analysis of experiencing a sequence of tones is clearly Retentionalist in spirit – see Anderson (2017) for more on this –\nwhat he says in the course of his analysis of the experiencing of a single C-tone in the Metaphysic suggests his position may be more complex.  Here Hodgson stresses that no matter how brief the C-tone might be it will have some experienced duration, and so will consist of an experienced transition between earlier and later phases, even if these are very difficult to discern in introspection.  Although these elementary durations will also feature retentions, they are of a distinctive kind:\n\n \n\nIn the context of the experiencing of C-D, Hodgson holds that\nretention of C is definitely not a presentation, but rather a less\nvivid “representation” of C that is experienced with D.\nIn the case of the single tone C, the retention of the earlier phase\nis quite different: it is indistinguishable from perception, or\nperception by “another name”.  Since Hodgson quotes the\nsecond passage in clarifying his position in an exchange with Stout\n(Hodgson 1900), he evidently believed it to be of some\nimportance.   \nAlthough his terminology could have been clearer, Hodgson may well\nhave been conceiving of the single brief C-tone experience in an\nExtensionalist manner, i.e. as being wholly perceptual in character,\neven though it is temporally extended. In which case, by also holding\nthat these brief perceptions are accompanied by retentions, he was in\nfact adopting a hybrid model of temporal experience that incorporates\nelements of both Extensionalism (over short intervals) and\nRetentionalism (over larger intervals).\n \n\nAs Canales (2015) vividly demonstrates, around the turn of the 20th century Bergson’s\nwritings on time and consciousness had considerable influence. In\nhis Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\nConsciousness (1889/1910) he began his campaign against the\n‘spatializing’ of time, and in this campaign the concept of\nduration (or durée) plays a key\nrole. At least in his earlier writings, this concept\napplies to time as it is featured in our immediate experience.\nFor Bergson, duration is a continuous flow, immeasurable and\nunquantifiable – the ‘ceaselessly seething surd at the\nheart of things’, in Barrett’s words (1968: 373). As\nsuch it is radically unlike the static conception of time as a manifold\nof mere locations to be found in the scientific conception of the\nworld, whether Newtonian or Einsteinian.  \n\nMany of Bergson characterizations of duration are negative:\nhe tells us a good deal about what it is not, but comparatively little\nabout what it actually is. While this can sometimes be frustrating,\nthere is a rationale for it: Bergson held that any attempt to\nconceptualize the flux of consciousness could succeed only at the cost\nof distorting the phenomena – a doctrine which influenced\nWilliam James in his later years (for more on this see Dainton (2017)\nand Section 3 of the supplementary\n document The Specious Present: Further Issues).  \n\nThe early years of the 20th century see Husserl developing an account of time-consciousness along\nRetentional lines. Husserl attended Brentano’s lectures\nbetween 1884–6; inspired by them, he decided to devote his\nenergies to philosophy rather than mathematics. If\nHusserl’s phenomenology can be viewed as a development of\nBrentano’s descriptive psychology, so too can his accounts of\ntime-consciousness. In elaborating his own position, in lectures\nin 1904–6, although he begins with criticisms of what Brentano and\nMeinong had to say on the topic, the position he ends up with is along\nthe same general lines. Husserl may not have adopted the term\n‘specious\n present’,[4]\nbut he did hold that we have a seemingly direct\nawareness of change and persistence amongst the objects and processes\nwe perceive over short intervals. He also held, plausibly, that\nas our streams of consciousness flow on, we have an awareness of their\nso doing. As for how this is possible, he thought it must\ninvolve past phases of consciousness somehow being ‘retained in\ngrasp’ in later moments of consciousness. In this passage\nwe find the ‘wonder of time-consciousness’ disclosing\nitself to him as he hears the rumble of an approaching coach: \n\nAt the heart of Husserl’s account is a dynamic tri-partite\nview of the composition of consciousness at any instant. The\nthree components are: primal impressions, retentions\n(or ‘primary memories’) and protentions.\nPrimal impressions are the live, actual experiences that occupy the\nmomentary now. No sooner does a primal impression – e.g., a\nmomentary tone-phase – occur than it slips seamlessly into the\npast. But it does not vanish from consciousness altogether: it\nsurvives in the form of a retention, which presents it as\npast. For Husserl, retentions are a quite distinctive form of\nconsciousness, and differ significantly from ordinary memories.\n(They are also the ‘adumbrations’ mentioned in the\nquotation.) As new primal impressions dawn – as they gush\nforth from the ‘primal source-point’ of the now – the\ninitial tone-phase continues to be retained, but as increasingly more\npast, until it fades from consciousness altogether. From then on,\nit can only be accessed through ordinary memory. As for\nprotentions, these are the future-oriented counterparts of\nretentions. In some cases – e.g., when we are perceiving or\nremembering a familiar sequence of events – they can be quite\ndetailed, but often they consist of nothing more than an\nopenness to the future, an expectation that something will\ncome. Or as Husserl puts it: \n\nIrrespective of how the forward-looking protentional aspect of\nconsciousness is to be properly understood, this is a plausible piece\nof phenomenology. As we go about our business, we generally do so\nwith an anticipative awareness – different in different\ncircumstances, and difficult to describe – of where we are\nheading, or what is likely to come\n next.[5] \n\nThe broad outlines of Husserl’s position may be perfectly\nclear, but the details pose more of a challenge. Husserl’s\nterminology underwent regular changes: his wrote of ‘primary\nmemory’ prior to adopting ‘retention’; rather than\nthe ‘specious present’ or ‘presence-time’\nHusserl prefers in his early writings to talk of ‘the original\ntemporal field’; in later writings he adopts other language:\n‘primal present’, ‘flowing present’,\n‘living present’. This terminological evolution goes\nhand-in-hand with doctrinal evolutions. Husserl wrote\nvoluminously on time-consciousness throughout his career but never\nfound a position he was happy with for long – in his lectures\nfrom 1907–10 he found fault with the position he elaborated in the\n1904–6 lectures – and he never published a definitive statement\nof his position. His early lectures, along with some additional\nmaterial, edited by Heidegger and Edith Stein, appeared in 1928 –\nand in English as The Phenomenology of Internal\nTime-Consciousness (1964). A fuller picture emerges from the\nmaterial on the topic gathered into Husserliana X. For\nhis subsequent thinking other sources come into play: the Bernau (or\nL-manuscripts) contain notes on time-consciousness dating from 1917–18,\nand the C-manuscripts contain material on the topic from the late\n1920’s to the early 1930’s. For an overview of\nHusserl’s changing views, over the whole of his career, see\nKortooms (2002). \n\nIn Anglophone circles in the same period, the realist position was\nbeing advocated by leading figures such as Broad and Russell.\nAccording to the latter, \nSuccession is a relation which may hold between two parts of\none sensation, for instance between parts of a swift movement which is\nthe object of one sensation. (1913: 65) \n\nImmediate experience provides us with two time-relations among\nevents: they may be simultaneous, or one may be earlier and the other\nlater. These two are part of the crude data; it is not the case\nthat only the events are given, and their time-order is added by our\nsubjective activity. The time-order, within certain limits, is as\nmuch given as the events. (1914: 121–2) \n\nBroad was of much the same opinion. Writing in Scientific\nThought (1923) he says: ‘There is no doubt that\nsensible motion and rest are genuine unanalysable properties of visual\nsensa. I am aware of them as directly as I am aware of the\nredness of a red patch.’ (1923: 287) – a clear commitment\nto realism. Later in the same work he elaborates thus: \n\nUnlike Russell, who did not elaborate greatly on these matters,\nBroad went on provide quite detailed analyses of the structure of\ntemporal consciousness. The account developed in Scientific\nThought is of a distinctive kind. It is constructed around\nacts of awareness that are themselves momentary, but which apprehend\nphenomenal contents distributed over a short interval of time; a stream\nof consciousness consists of dense sequences of such acts, with the\nconsequence that the contents apprehended by neighbouring acts largely\noverlap. Since Broad agrees with Stern that our consciousness\nextends a short distance through time his approach can be classed as\nExtensional. But since Broad also maintains – along with\nBrentano, Meinong and Husserl – that our immediate experience of\nchange involves contents being presented to acts of awareness that are\nstrictly momentary, it is not an Extensional view of the ordinary sort:\nfor Stern and those in the Extensional camp, the acts of awareness (or\nepisodes of experiencing) in which dynamic contents are apprehended are\nthemselves temporally extended. For this reason Broad’s\nposition is probably best classed as a Partial\nExtensionalism. In any event, this hybrid approach is\nnot without its difficulties – see Mabbott (1951) – and in\nhis later An Examination of McTaggart’s\nPhilosophy (1938) Broad develops an account along more\northodox Retentionalist lines. \n\nThe Cinematic, Retentional and Extensional models (as sketched in\n§1.1) offer different and competing accounts of the structure of\nconsciousness over those short intervals – perhaps no more than a\nsecond or so, perhaps less – during which we seem to be able to\nexperience change and succession. Before moving on to explore\nthese models in more detail, it is worth pausing to register in a clear\nand explicit way some further important theses and distinctions; some\nof these we have already encountered in one guise or another, others\nare new. \n\nPT-realists share a commitment to the Diachronic Unity\nThesis (see §1.2), i.e., the claim that contents (seemingly)\nspread over a short temporal interval can be experienced\ntogether. The various different ways of construing the specious\npresent reflect a divergence of opinion as to how the Diachronic Unity\nThesis can be satisfied. According to one influential\nview, phenomenal unity – the sort of unity which exists amongst\ncontents that are experienced together – is confined to contents\nwhich are (objectively) simultaneous. As we have just see,\nKant, Brentano, Meinong and Husserl were all of the opinion that\nphenomenal unity is constrained in this manner. Miller (1984:\n109) supplies a label for this doctrine: \n\nThe Principle of Simultaneous Awareness (PSA): to\nbe experienced as unified, contents must be presented simultaneously to\na single momentary awareness. \n\nCinematic and Retentional theorists generally embrace PSA.\nExtensional theorists are united in their rejection of PSA: for them,\nexperiential phenomenal unity is not necessarily confined to\nmomentary episodes of experiencing. Hence it is possible for the\nexperiencing of change to occur over intervals of ordinary time. \n\nThis (potential) divergence aside, both Retentional and Extensional\ntheorists face a problem – albeit not the same problem –\nwhen it comes to handling the relationship between\nsimultaneity and presence. Whatever their other\nproperties, the contents of the specious present (supposedly) all\nseem present as and when they occur. This makes for a\nproblem for Extensional theorists. The contents of a typical\nspecious present will all be experienced together, as parts of a\nunified whole, but they will also seem to occur successively. But\nhow is this possible? Won’t contents that are all\nexperienced together as present appear to occur simultaneously, rather\nthan in succession? Retentional theorists face a rather different\ndifficulty. If we suppose, in line with Retentional doctrine,\nthat the contents of an individual specious present are actually\nsimultaneous, at least with regard to ordinary clock time, how can it\nbe that they also appear successive? In slightly more formal\nguise: \n\nExtensional Simultaneity Problem: how is it\npossible for contents which are (i) experienced together, and (ii)\nexperienced as present, to be experienced as anything other than\nsimultaneous? \n\nRetentional Simultaneity Problem: how is it\npossible for a collection of contents which occur simultaneously to\nseem successive? \n\nAt first glance each of these problems may look very serious, even\ninsuperable. It is not for nothing that many have despaired of\nfinding a coherent account of the specious present. However, when\nwe turn to explore the Retention and Extensional approaches in more\ndetail, we shall see that these difficulties may not be as serious as\nthey can initially seem. \n\nA further issue concerns the kind of contents to be found\nwithin individual specious presents. Foster, himself a leading\nrealist of the Extensional persuasion, writes: ‘duration and\nchange through time seem to be presented to us with the same phenomenal\nimmediacy as homogeneity and variation of colour through space’\n(1982: 255). Broad remarks: ‘There is no doubt that\nsensible motion and rest are genuine unanalysable properties of visual\nsensa. I am aware of them as directly as I am aware of the\nredness of a red patch.’ (1923: 287) Broad and Foster are\ncommitted to the following general principle: \n\nThe Immediacy Thesis: change, succession and\npersistence can feature in our experience with the same vivid immediacy\nas colour or sound, or any other phenomenal feature. \n\nThe contents of Extensional specious presents – the contents\napprehended as changing – are ordinary experiential\ncontents (e.g., sounds as they feature in immediate experience).\nConsequently it is not surprising to find that proponents of the\nExtensional model generally subscribe to the Immediacy Thesis.\nTheir Retentionalist counterparts can do so, but usually\ndon’t – a notable exception is Lee (2014a, 2014b). Brentano, Husserl and other leading Retentional theorists hold that the contents of the specious present appear under\nvarying ‘temporal modes of presentation’ (as they are often\ncalled). If the succession of tones [C-D-E] form a single\nspecious present, if E seem fully or maximally present, D will appear\nunder the mode ‘just past’, and E ‘a little more\npast’. On this view, each of C, D and E are experienced as\nparts of a unified ensemble – in conformity with the Diachronic\nUnity Thesis – but they are not experienced as possessing the\nsame phenomenal immediacy. \n\nProponents of the Cinematic, Extensional and Retentional models are\noffering very different accounts of the structure and composition of\nour consciousness of over short periods of time. There is a\nfurther issue: what is the structure of consciousness over\nlonger intervals? It is not unusual for us to remain\nawake for hours at a stretch; although the contents of our\nconsciousness may frequently change, we can remain continuously\n(uninterruptedly) awake and aware for quite long periods. William\nJames is well-known for emphasising the continuity of\nexperience – ‘Consciousness, then, does not appear to\nitself as chopped up into bits. Such words as “chain”\nor “train” do not describe it fitly … It is nothing\njointed, it flows. A “river” or a\n“stream” are the metaphors by which it is naturally\ndescribed’ (1890: 239) – and James’ stream metaphor\nstrikes many as apt. In the light of this new questions\narise. How do the momentary static states of the Cinematic\ntheorists combine to form extended streams of continuous consciousness\nof the sort we typically enjoy during our waking hours? Indeed,\ncan they combine in the way required? Analogous\nquestions can be posed for the specious presents posited by Retentional\nand Extensional theorists: how do they manage to combine to\nform such streams? \n\nWhile the inability to answer these new questions in a satisfactory\nmanner can certainly count against a model of temporal consciousness, the situation is\ncomplicated by the diversity of opinions concerning both the degree to\nwhich consciousness really is continuous, and manner or nature of its\ncontinuity. James himself defined ‘continuous’\nas ‘that which is without breach, crack or division’ (1890:\n237), but what he meant by this requires some unpacking. \n\nIt is certainly possible – and quite natural – to\ncharacterize continuity in terms of an absence of gaps: a subject\nS’s consciousness can be said to be continuous with\nrespect to an interval T if S is having an experience of some\nkind at every moment during T. In more subjective vein, a\nsuccession of stream-phases belonging to S could be said to be\ncontinuous if S is incapable of discerning any gaps between\nthem. For James this subjective mode of continuity was\nparticularly important, and – perhaps controversially – he\nheld that it is possible for streams that are objectively discontinuous\n(e.g., separated by a gap of minutes or hours) to be subjectively\ncontinuous. \n\nHowever, for James the continuity that is characteristic of our\nconsciousness involved more than the mere absence of gaps, whether\nobjective or subjective. He also held that this continuity\ntypically involves a (fairly) high degree of similarity in the\nqualitative character of one’s experience from moment to\nmoment. Large and sudden variations do occur – a sudden\nthunderclap makes a massive difference to one’s auditory\nexperience – but these do not usually disrupt background\ncontinuities in (say) bodily feeling, or so James argued. \n\nIn addition to gaplessness and qualitative similarity, James\nrecognized a further mode of connectedness between stream-phases:\nsuccessive phases are linked experientially. He held\nthat each brief phase of our stream of consciousness flows, in seamless\nfashion, into its successor, and that these ‘co-conscious\ntransitions’ are themselves experienced. There is more than\na hint of this in the passage just cited, but elsewhere he is more\nexplicit. In the essay ‘A World of Pure Experience’\n(1904) he writes: ‘My experiences and your experiences are\n“with” each other in various external ways, but mine pass\ninto mine, and yours pass into yours in a way in which yours and mine\nnever pass into one another’. More generally, James\nheld that consciousness is not composed of absolutely distinct\ncomponent parts (i.e., individual isolated experiences), but is\n‘conjunctive’: \n\nTo coin some further terminology, on this view each brief\nstream-phase is experientially connected to its\nneighbours. Irrespective of whether it is correct, James’\ncontention certainly possesses prima facie plausibility: if one hears a\nsuccession of brief tones do-re-mi-fa-so, it is certainly\nnatural to say that one also hear each tone flowing into its\nsuccessor. It does not seem implausible to suppose the same holds\nmore generally: does not each brief phase of a typical stream of\nconsciousness seem to merge smoothly and seamlessly with its\nsuccessor? \n\nAlthough the Jamesian emphasis on the continuity of consciousness is\nwidely viewed sympathetically, there are dissenters. Galen\nStrawson endorses realism – he believes change and succession can\nbe directly experienced – but he also rejects James’\nstream-metaphor as ‘inept’, and argues that consciousness\nis radically discontinuous and disjointed: ‘It is always shooting\noff, fuzzing, shorting out, spurting and stalling.’ (1997:\n421). For Strawson there are gaps and fissures in our experience,\nand these are sometimes accompanied by dramatic changes in content:\n‘The (invariably brief) periods of true experiential continuity\nare usually radically disjunct from each other in this way, even when\nthey are not radically disjunct in terms of content.’\n(1997:\n 422)[6]\nIn a\nsimilar vein, Dennett holds that ‘One of the most striking\nfeatures of consciousness is its discontinuity (1991:\n356). \n\nPulling these points together, we can distinguish three main\npositions on the continuity issue: \n\nThe Discontinuity Thesis: although consciousness is\ncommonly described as continuous, this is wrong: in fact our\nconsciousness is highly disjointed, far more so than most people\nsuppose. \n\nThe Modest Continuity Thesis: our typical streams\nof consciousness are indeed continuous, and this involves (i) freedom\nfrom gaps, in either or both of the senses mentioned above, and/or (ii)\na significant degree of moment-to-moment qualitative similarity. \n\nThe Strong Continuity Thesis: in addition to the\nrelationships encapsulated in the Modest Thesis, the successive brief\nphases of our typical streams of consciousness are experientially\nconnected. \n\nWhat divides Modest from Strong forms of continuity is the existence\nof directly experienced connections – James’\n‘co-conscious transitions’ – between successive\nstream-phases. The experienced transitions posited by advocates\nof Strong Continuity can plausibly be regarded as experienced changes\n(or successions). Since antirealists deny that change or\nsuccession can be directly experienced, they are not in a position to\naccept the Strong Continuity Thesis. It is otherwise for\nrealists: since the latter hold that change and succession can\nbe directly experienced, their position looks to be entirely compatible\nwith Strong Continuity. However, as we shall see in due course,\nthe situation is by no means straightforward: some realist models can\naccommodate Strong Continuity more easily than others. \n\nWhen it comes to explaining how it is possible for our consciousness\nto combine experiential continuity with the experience of change\nthe account offered by the Cinematic realist is appealingly\nstraightforward. On this view, a typical stream of consciousness\nconsists of a close-packed, gap-free continuum of momentary (or very\nbrief) phases. Although the contents of these phases are\nthemselves momentary – they do not present motion or change, they\nare akin to static snapshots – their occurrence in rapid\nsuccession succeeds in generating all the change, succession and motion\nwe find in our experience – or so the Cinematic realist\nclaims. The basic feature of the model are depicted in Figure\n3. On the left we see a punctual beam of awareness, the smooth,\nsteady advance of which generates a sequence of momentary snapshot-like\ncontents (of a falling object, in this instance), only a small\nselection of which is shown on the right. Figure 3.\nCinematic PT-realism: seemingly dynamic phenomenal contents are\nproduced by an advancing ‘beam’ of awareness. \n\nThis Cinematic form of realism does not feature prominently in the\nliterature – it was not encountered at all in the course of our\nbrief historical survey – and with good reason: we shall see\nshortly that it is vulnerable to serious objections. But it\nnonetheless has sufficient intuitive appeal to be worth\nconsidering. By accepting that motion and change feature in our\nimmediate experience the doctrine has the merit of taking the\nphenomenological data at face value. It also combines a quite\nnatural way of conceiving of the temporal structure of consciousness\n– i.e., as confined to the momentary present – with an\nequally natural view as to the kind of content the resulting\nmomentary episodes of experiencing could have. A\ncamera with a fast shutter-speed (e.g., 1/10,000 of a second) will\n‘freeze’ all but the fastest of motions: the facial\nexpression of victorious sprinter at the precise moment they crossed\nthe line can thus be revealed. If our consciousness takes the\nform of a series of momentary (or extremely brief)\n‘exposures’, won’t the contents of our consciousness\nbe similarly static or frozen? As an additional bonus the\nCinematic realist can easily explain at least one aspect of the\ncontinuity of consciousness. If a stream of consciousness is\ncomposed of a gap-free sequence (or continuum) of momentary\n(or extremely brief) states, it is not surprising that we can be\ncontinually aware for hours at a stretch. The Modest Continuity\nThesis (§3) is thus easily accommodated. \n\nAs for how sequences of static ‘snapshots’ can give rise\nto experiences which seem to possess dynamic contents, the Cinematic\nrealist certainly has to provide a plausible account of how this comes\nabout. Two avenues may seem promising in this regard.\nFirst, even if our awareness lacks any significant temporal depth, as\nit does on the proposed model, might it not be that the\ncontinuous advance of a point-like ray of awareness will\ngenerate episodes of experiencing which can encompass change and\nsuccession? By way of an analogy, think of the way a needle (or\nany other sharply pointed object) moved across the surface of\none’s skin produces a continuous sensation of motion.\nAlthough at any one time it is only the needle’s\nnear-dimensionless point that is in contact with our skin, we can\nnonetheless feel the needle moving smoothly and continuously\nfrom one location to another. Second, in the visual case, it is\nwell known that rapid successions of static images can result\nin experiences of motion. The images shown on a TV or cinema\nscreen are static snapshots, but evidently, they are perceived as\ndynamic: objects on a cinema screen are seen to move as smoothly and\ncontinuously as their real-life counterparts. Might not the same\napply to other modes of experience, and hence to our streams of\nconsciousness as a whole? \n\nUnfortunately for the Cinematic realist, closer scrutiny reveals\nthat each of these proposals is problematic. A moving\n‘beam’ of awareness could produce a period of time during\nwhich experience is continuously occurring, in the sense that at each\nmoment during the interval there is an experience being had by the\nrelevant subject, but by itself it can produce nothing more, and\n– for a viable form of realism, at least – more is\nrequired. For a subject to be directly aware of a temporally\nextended phenomenon (such as a brief movement), adjoining phases of the\nphenomenon must in some manner be experienced together by the\nsubject. As noted in §1.2, realists subscribe to the\nDiachronic Unity Thesis: they hold that contents that appear to occur\nin succession can be experienced together (or be co-conscious), in just\nthe same way as contents which appear to occur simultaneously, at least\nwithin the confines of the specious present. But since for the\nCinematic realist individual episodes of awareness are durationless,\nand likewise the contents apprehended in such episodes, it is difficult\nto see how the required Diachronic Unity can be accommodated.\nSince ex hypothesi our awareness does not extend beyond or\nbetween momentary episodes of experiencing, there is no scope at all\nfor adjoining phases to be experienced together in the way\nrequired. \n\nThe point can be made a slightly different way. To employ the\nusual terminology, a succession of experiences is one thing, an\nexperience of succession is quite another. Suppose there are\nten people, P1, P2, P3 …\nP10 standing in line with their eyes closed, but\ndirected at a tennis game taking place nearby. If first\nP1 opens their eyes momentarily before closing them again,\nfollowed immediately by P2, then by P3, all the\nway to P10, then we have a succession of ten experiences,\neach revealing the on-court action at a particular moment. But\nthere is no experience of succession: all each person sees is a\nmomentary still image, and these momentary experiencings are completely\nisolated from one another. Accordingly, the resulting sequence of\nexperiences do not add up to an experiencing of movement or\nchange. Although it may not be quite so obvious, the model\nof temporal consciousness proposed by the Cinematic realist also\ncreates nothing more than mere succession of experiences. There\nare, of course, differences between the two cases, but these\ndifferences do not affect the point at issue. First, in the\ntennis example there are ten distinct subjects, whereas the sequence of\nmomentary states posited by the Cinematic realist experienced by a\nsingle subject. But for this difference to matter, the momentary\nstates enjoyed by the single subject would have to be unified within\nthat subject’s consciousness: for if they remain discrete,\nexperientially isolated from one another, as it were, there is\nno possibility of their combining to constitute an experience of\nsuccession. But with the resources available to the Cinematic\nrealist – momentary acts of awareness, momentary contents –\nthere is no obvious way of creating the required unity. As for\nthe second difference, in our simple example there are but ten\ndistinct experiences, whereas Cinematic realists will insist that on\ntheir model we are dealing with a true continuum, in the\nmathematical sense: we are to suppose that the perceiving of the tennis\ngame involves an infinite number of distinct momentary\nexperiences, not just ten. But as Bergson was fond of pointing\nout, numbers make no difference here: the points in the orthodox\nmathematical continuum are always entirely distinct from one\nanother, no matter how close together they may be: indeed, since these\npoints are densely ordered, between any two points there is always a\nfurther\n point.[7] \n\nWhat of the cinematic analogy itself? Isn’t the fact\nthat we see motion on TV and movie screens evidence that successions of\nmotion-free images can give rise to an experience of\nmotion? Although there is a sense in which this is correct, it is\nof little or no assistance to the Cinematic realist. \n\nIt is perfectly true that perceiving a succession of still images\ncan result in a full-blooded perception of motion. If the stills\nwhich compose cinema film are shown quite slowly – say 2–5 frames\nper second (fps) – they are seen quite clearly as\nstills; if the pace picks up – to around 10 fps, they start to\nlook somewhat blurred; if the pace picks up still further – to 20\nor 25 fps – something remarkable happens: the images come\nalive, and we suddenly start to see genuine (and very clear,\nnon-blurry) motion. This phenomenon – known as\n‘illusory motion’ or ‘the phi phenomenon’ was\nfirst explored in the 19th century by Exner, and has been\nmuch-studied since then (not surprisingly, since it underpins\ntelevisual industries). But while it is real enough, the phi\nphenomenon is of little assistance to the Cinematic realist. What\nthe latter needs is an account of how successions of momentary\nconscious states, each possessing entirely static contents, can\ngive rise to the experience of motion. Static images are\nindeed being displayed on a cinema screen while we view a movie, but\nnot only are these onscreen stills not themselves experiences, they do\nnot register in our visual experience as static images: what\nwe actually seem to see onscreen are objects in motion.\nPhenomenologically speaking, the stills are invisible. Given\nthis, all the phi phenomenon clearly and unambiguously demonstrates is\nthat a rapid succession of brief perceptual stimuli (each\nderiving from a brief on-screen image) can be transformed by our visual\nsystems – after a good deal of processing – into\nexperiences which feature motion. These perceptual stimuli are\nnot themselves experiential in nature, consisting as they do of showers\nof photons (or, alternatively, patterns of electro-chemical activity on\nthe surface of the retina). \n\nIn the absence of any plausible account of how change and succession\ncan feature in our immediate experience, the Cinematic model cannot be\nregarded as a promising form of realism. Its difficulties do not\nend here. The Cinematic model certainly conforms to the Modest\nContinuity Thesis – it is compatible with our streams of\nconsciousness being continuous in the sense of gap-free – but it\nis otherwise with regard to the Strong Continuity Thesis.\nAccording to proponents of the latter, the sense we have that each\nbrief phase of our streams of consciousness flow into their successors\nis underpinned (or generated by) the existence of real experiential\nconnections between such phases. It is not obvious, to say the\nleast, how such connections could exist if all streams are composed of\ndiscrete momentary states that are experientially isolated from their\nimmediate neighbours – see Figure 4. Figure 4.\nHow to satisfy (and not satisfy) the Strong Continuity Thesis.\n \n\nThis failure will not matter for realists who reject the full-blown\nJamesian conception of streamal continuity, but for those realists who\nfind the case for Strong Continuity compelling, the failure is a\nserious one. \n\nFor the PT-antirealist it is a mistake to suppose that change,\npersistence and succession feature in our immediate experience.\nWhile this standpoint can seem wrongheaded, it can also seem the\nplainest common sense – or at least a consequence of\nplain common sense. As Augustine and Reid both recognised, it is very\nnatural to suppose that we are only directly aware of what is going on\nnow. If the present, strictly conceived, is the\ndurationless interface between the past and the future – and it\nis commonly taken to be precisely this – the conclusion that our\nconsciousness is confined to a durationless instant swiftly\nfollows. As noted in §4.1, in connection with Cinematic\nrealism, it is also quite natural to think that the content of a\nmomentary state of consciousness will itself have a momentary\ncharacter: in effect, such a content will take the form of a still,\nstatic snapshot. If this conception of both consciousness and its\ncontents is correct, antirealism looms large on the horizon. \n\nIrrespective of the considerations which can make antirealism an\nappealing doctrine, there remain the considerations, of a largely\nphenomenological character, which strongly favour realism.\nAren’t there occasions (many of them) when we see a\nhorse crossing a finishing line, or a car turning round a corner, or a\npostman walking up the garden path? Can’t we hear\nthe explosive roar of crowd, or the sound of an approaching car, or the\nbarking of a dog? Can’t we feel shivers running\ndown our spine? Claims that change and movement can be directly\nexperienced have a good deal of plausibility. What can be done to\nundermine these claims? \n\nThomas Reid believed that our streams of consciousness are composed\nof sequences of momentary states; since he also believed these such\nstates incapable of furnishing us with an genuine experience of\nsuccession (see §2.3) Reid can safely be classed as a Cinematic\nantirealist. Although Reid recognized that this austere position\non the contents of experience is in conflict with how we normally think\nand talk, he also thought this conflict could be defused. \n\nFor Reid the apparent contradiction between strict philosophical\ntruth and common sense (and common experience) is superficial:\n‘It arises from this, that philosophers and the vulgar differ in\nthe meaning they put upon what is called the present time, and\nare thereby led to made a different limit between sense and\nmemory’ (1855: 236). Reid argues that our ordinary talk of\n‘seeing’ things move is intelligible, at least on its own\nterms, because in ordinary life we generally construe the present in a\nloose and flexible way. If it suits our purposes – and it\noften does – we allow ‘the present’ to denote a\nperiod of time, rather than a durationless moment.\n(There is no need for the period to be short: we sometimes refer to the\npresent decade or century.) And since temporal intervals can\ncontain change and movement, our ordinary ways of talking are not in\nthe least paradoxical: \n\nSo far so plausible, perhaps. But a significant worry\nremains. How plausible is Reid’s proposed (precise,\nphilosophical) delineation of the respective provinces of\nsense and memory? Realists will insist that it\nis questionable. To illustrate, consider the case of\nmotion. Reid claims that ‘it is only by the aid of\nmemory that we discern motion, or any succession whatsoever.\nWe see the present place of the body; we remember the successive\nadvance it made to that place: the first can, then, only give us a\nconception of motion, when joined to the last.’ (ibid.\n237) If this is right, then when (say) we see a car turning a corner,\nall that is ever present in our sensory consciousness is a\nseries of static images, each revealing the car to be at a particular\nlocation. The car’s motion, to the extent it enters our\nawareness at all, exists only in memories which accompany these\nmomentary perceptions. But from a phenomenological standpoint at\nleast, this does not ring true. The phenomenal character (the\n‘what it’s like-ness’) of actually seeing a\ncar turn a corner, and remembering (via recollected visual\nimages) seeing an otherwise similar car turn a corner are very\ndifferent indeed. Not to dwell too long on the obvious: in the\nperceptual case the car is clear, vivid and (seemingly) out\nthere in the world, whereas the remembered car is far less clear\nand vivid, and very definitely in here (in the head, rather\nthan out in the world). If the car’s motion is\nsomething we perceive, and it certainly seems to be, Reid’s\nantirealist analysis is lacking in plausibility. \n\nIn fact, the antirealist’s predicament may well be more\nserious still. Conflating perceived motion with remembered motion\nis one thing, but there is an important sense in which the antirealist\nis not in a position to appeal to memories of motion\neither. A memory-replay of a prior perceiving of motion is itself\na process which unfolds over time, and – on the face of it\n– has a dynamic character: e.g., you see (albeit in your\nmind’s eye) the car sweeping round the corner.\nSince it would be odd to hold that motion can be remembered but not\nperceived, the antirealist will presumably want to analyse both forms\nof experience in the same sort of way. Accordingly, your visual\nremembering (or replay) of the car’s turning the corner will take\nthe form of a series of static memory-images of the car at particular\nlocations, and each of these images (save the first) will be\naccompanied by other static images, in the form of\nsnapshot-like memories of the car as seen at still earlier\nlocations. Antirealism in this form may be a more consistent\ndoctrine, but the wholesale elimination (or reduction) of the moving to\nthe motion-free has two consequences. First of all, it is by no\nmeans obvious how our memories could have the dynamic character they\nseem to possess if they consisted of nothing but still images piled on\ntop of other still images. Second, and for present purposes more\nimportantly, the Reid-style antirealist’s account of\nperceived motion is significantly weakened. Realists\nwill argue that it is not very plausible to analyse the perceived\nmotion in terms of momentary motion-free perceptual experiences\naccompanied memories of motion, but it is significantly less plausible\nif the relevant memories, rather than being truly dynamic, are\nthemselves composed of entirely static images. \n\nAlthough it may well be that the most compelling evidence for the\nrealist’s claim that motion (and other forms of change) feature\nin immediate experience is straightforwardly phenomenological –\nthat’s just the way our experience seems to be – there are\nempirical findings in psychology and neuroscience which point in the\nsame general direction. We have already encountered (in\n§3.1) the phi phenomenon (or ‘illusory motion’).\nIn the simplest of cases – as observed by Plateau in 1850 and\nExner in 1875 – what is in reality a pair of lights some distance\napart flashing alternately, is perceived as a single light moving back\nand forth. A more dramatic (and ubiquitous) illustration of the\nsame tendency is television and cinema, where a mere 25 frames per\nsecond suffices to produce a perception of smooth motion. It\nseems that when our visual systems are supplied with stimuli which are\nmerely suggestive of movement they are eager to supply us with vivid\nexperiences of motion itself. This is not all. Studies of\nthe visual systems in the brain have revealed areas – in\nparticular the region known as V5 – which specialize in\nmotion-detection. Interestingly, the condition of cerebral\nakinetopsia, a form of motion-blindness, has been linked to damage\nin the V5 area. An afflicted patient, known as LM, \n\nThis too is suggestive: if, as the antirealist claims, motion never\nfeatures in the immediate experience of normal human perceivers, what\nis it that LM has lost? (For some further details of these findings\nsee Section 1 of the supplementary document\n Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience).) \n\nEmpirical findings along these lines by no means definitively refute\nthe antirealist – alternative interpretations are possible\n– but they do make life more difficult. Rather than\nstraightforwardly denying that we directly experience motion in the\nmanner of Reid, the antirealist stance would be more plausible if a\ncredible explanation as to why we believe we experience motion\n(and more generally, change) if in fact we do not. One route,\nsuggested by Crick and Kock, is to find (or posit) a vector-like\nfeature that durationless contents could possess, and which is also\nsuch as to strongly suggest or imply movement, even though no movement\nis actually present. According to their ‘snapshot\nhypothesis’ (2003: 122) – in effect, a version of Cinematic\nanti-realism – our consciousness not only comes in discrete\nchunks, the experience of motion is itself illusory: \n\nQuite what is involved, at the phenomenal level, in motion being\n‘painted onto’ a motionless snapshot is explained only by\nway of an analogy: a drawing of a person in motion (running or ice\nskating, say) can suggest motion, even though it is entirely\nmotion-free. In response, realists will point out that there is a\nsizeable difference, phenomenologically speaking, between even looking\nat a still image which merely depicts motion, no matter how suggestively,\nand actually seeing motion. By way of further support, Koch\nquotes Oliver Sacks, who reports in his (1970) an occurrence of\n‘cinematographic vision’ during one of his own migraine\nattacks: \n\nKoch approvingly cites Sacks’ suggestion that cinematographic\nvision – a form of akinetopsia – reveals the ‘nature\nof visual experience when the illusion of motion has been\nlost’. However, this speculation is puzzling for two\nreasons. The first is trivial: the designation\n‘cinematographic’ is less than ideal and potentially\nmisleading: as we have already seen (in §4.1), a plausible case\ncan be made for holding that in a properly run cinema, the stills\nprojected onto the screen are not themselves seen as such\n– all we see are the intended moving images.\nSecond and more importantly, given the world of difference between\nSacks’ motion-free experience and our everyday visual experience,\nin what sense can the motion we apprehend in the latter reasonably be\nconstrued as illusory? The realist will insist that if motion is\nan intrinsic feature of sensory experience – and it seems to be\n– doesn’t that suffice to ensure that it is a real\nfeature of it too? \n\nLe Poidevin (2007: 88–92) tentatively forwards an alternative\nhypothesis. As Aristotle noted, if you stare at a waterfall for a\nshort period, and then turn your gaze to the bank beside it, you will\nsee part of the bank (seemingly) start to move in an upwards\ndirection. This phenomenon is commonly called ‘the\nwaterfall illusion’ (or motion aftereffect), and the\nillusory motion is of an intriguing sort. You will not see a part\nof the bank detach itself from its surroundings and drift up towards\nthe sky. Rather, you will see the contents within a fixed and\nimmobile region of the bank – roughly the size of the waterfall\nyou were staring at previously – losing their normal solidity and\nbecoming fluid-like. Although these contents seems to be flowing\nupward, they do so without changing – at least in a clear and\nunambiguous way – their location with respect to the rest of\nthe\n bank.[8]\nAs\nfor an explanation of what is going on in such cases, Le Poidevin (following Richard Gregory) suggests that perhaps we can discern here\nthe workings of two distinct neural mechanisms. One\n‘registers what we might call “pure motion”, i.e.,\ngives rise to the impression of motion without any associated sense of\nchange of position. It is this system that is responsible for the\nsense of perceiving motion as happening now.’ (2007:\n89) A second system, relying on short-term memory, tracks and\ncompares the alterations in location over time. This second\nsystem is not concerned with telling us about presently occurring\nmotions, rather it gives rise to the sense that objects have changed\ntheir positions relative to one another. Hence Le\nPoidevin’s proposal. Perhaps our ordinary experience of\nmotion does, after all, consist of nothing but momentary static\nsnapshots – in accord with Cinematic antirealism – but\nthese momentary experiences seem dynamic thanks to the\nactivation of the ‘pure motion’ mechanism in our visual\nsystem. These snapshots do not actually feature movement, but as\nthe waterfall illusion illustrates, movement – at least in the\nform of change of position over time – is not required for the\nvivid impression of motion. \n\nAlthough this is a far more promising line for the antirealist to take – see Arstila (2016a) for a spirited defence – it also faces challenges. \nAs Le Poidevin concedes, it is not obvious that the proposed explanation can be generalized: even if the\nexistence of the envisaged twin-track neural systems could be\nestablished in the visual case, there is at present no reason to think\nthat there are corresponding systems for all the other modes\nof experience, and as Realists will be swift to point out, change can\nbe heard, felt, remembered and imagined, as well as\n seen.[9]\nA second\nworry concerns the character of the ‘sense’ or\n‘impression’ of motion delivered by the hypothesized pure\nmotion system. These have to account for the very vivid\nappearances of motion in ordinary perceptions, not just the\nrather peculiar motions produced in waterfall-type illusions. How\nprecisely do they do this? What is their character? There\nare only two obvious options. The impressions could themselves be\nsensory ingredients, of a visual kind, which are in some way suggestive\nof motion. Alternatively, they could be non-sensory: perhaps they\nare akin to judgements, or intuitive feelings (or convictions or\nbeliefs), bearing a message along the lines of ‘that thing\nthere is moving!’ The sensory option is problematic, for\n– as already noted in connection with Crick and Koch – it\nis not easy to see what feature of a still, static image could be\nsufficiently suggestive of motion. But the non-sensory option is\nalso vulnerable to an objection. Realists will point out, once\nagain, that perceived motion – both the ordinary kind, and the\npeculiar kind associated with motion aftereffect – exists on the\nlevel of sensory phenomena: it features prominently in our immediate experience. If this is right, the claim that motion-as-seen can be\nconstituted of judgements or convictions, no matter how deep-seated or\ninstinctive these might be, does not seem very plausible. \n\nThese issues about temporally dynamic contents aside, there remains\nthe more general question of whether the Cinematic antirealist can deal\nin a satisfactory manner with the continuity of\nconsciousness. If not, the Cinematic model itself would be less\nthan fully unsatisfactory, even if it could provide a credible account\nof our short-term experience of motion and change. In this\nregard, the points made in connection with the realist version of the\nCinematic approach (in §4.1) also apply to the antirealist\nversion. Whereas Modest Continuity poses no difficulty at\nall, the confinement of phenomenal unity to the contents of momentary\nstates (see Fig. 4.2) means that Strong Continuity is\nunattainable. \n\nGiven the difficulties antirealists have encountered in doing full\njustice to the phenomenological considerations to which their realist\ncounterparts give such emphasis, they may be tempted – or wise to\nconsider – a more radical option. Perhaps there is a more\ndramatic discrepancy between the actual characteristics of our\nexperience, on the one hand, and our beliefs about these\ncharacteristics on the other, than anything we have considered up to\nnow. True, we do talk as though we see things move (and more\ngenerally, perceive change), and doubtless this talk reflects our\nbeliefs, but perhaps our beliefs are simply wrong. Perhaps our\nimmediate experience is in reality entirely motion-free, and our\nstreams of consciousness radically fragmented, but since we do not\nbelieve our experience is like this, we do not talk as though it\nis. \n\nWith regard to the continuity issue, as noted in §3, a position\nalong these lines has been advocated by Dennett. If asked whether\nour typical visual fields are fully continuous, even when one of our eyes is closed, most\nof us are inclined to answer in the affirmative: when we look at (say) a white wall, we see an uninterrupted expanse of white.  In such cases we are certainly\nunable to detect a beachball-sized fuzzy dark expanse lying just to one side\nof the central axis of vision. But the physiology of the eye\nsuggests there should be a ‘blind spot’ at that location,\ncorresponding to the region of the retina occupied by the optic nerve\nwhich is devoid of light-sensitive cells. As for why we do not\ndetect a blind region in our visual field, the standard – and on\nthe face of it, plausible – answer is that our visual systems\nengage in some ‘perceptual interpolation’ or\nfilling-in: our brains extrapolate from the stimuli reaching\nthe light-sensitive cells in the region of the retina immediately\nsurrounding the blind-spot, and fabricate experience to fill the\nrelevant region of the visual field accordingly. \n\nDennett points out that there is alternative to this account. Rather\nthan ‘making up’ experience in this manner, perhaps our\nbrains simply fail to notice that there is a lack of visual\ninformation deriving from the hole-region: after all, an absence of\ninformation is not the same thing as information about an\nabsence. Never having received information from this region, the\nbrain simply works on the assumption that nothing special is going on\nthere: ‘The brain doesn’t have to “fill in” for\nthe blind spot, since the region in which the blind spot falls is\nalready labelled (e.g., “plaid” … “more of the\nsame”) (1991: 335). In effect, since we have a\nbelief about what the blind region contains – typically,\n‘more of the same’ – why should the brain go to the\ntrouble of generating experience as well? Dennett goes on to\nsuggest that this treatment of spatial holes can plausibly be extended\nto temporal holes (gaps in the continuity of experience) also.\nOur visual experience is constantly interrupted by our eyes darting\nabout during saccades. We don’t notice the resulting holes or\ngaps in our experience, but they don’t need to be filled in\nbecause we’re not designed to notice them. More\ngenerally: ‘One of the most striking features of consciousness is\nits discontinuity – as revealed in the blind spot, and\nthe saccadic gaps, to take the simplest examples. The\ndiscontinuity of consciousness is striking because of the\napparent continuity of consciousness.’ (1991:\n356) \n\nAlthough Dennett himself concentrates on explaining why we are\ninclined to describe our experience as continuous if it really\ndiscontinuous, the approach can be extended to the immediate experience\nof change, or so Chuard argues: \nSuppose the ‘succession of static snapshots’ conception of\nexperience, as proposed by the Cinematic antirealist is\ncorrect. Provided the contents and temporal arrangement of these\nstatic snapshots are enough to convince our brains that we are\nperceiving motion and change, we will inevitably believe that\nthis is what we are perceiving, and hence describe our\nexperience in such terms. Isn’t this all that we are required to\nexplain?  For Dennett and Chuard nothing further is needed. \n\nIn response realists will fully accept that we believe that change and\ncontinuity (of the Modest and/or Strong forms) are features of our\nimmediate experience. What they are unlikely to accept is the\nproposal that (in effect) these features of our experience\nreduce to these beliefs. They will claim – and on\nthe face of it, plausibly – that we know there is more to our\nconsciousness than our beliefs about our consciousness. We know\nthis because we have direct introspective access to the content and\ncharacter of our experiences, and typically, our beliefs about the\ncharacter of our experiences are informed by what introspection\nreveals. Hence if we believe our visual field is spatially\ncontinuous, it is because – when we direct our attention and\nintrospect – we find precisely this; similarly, if we believe our\nimmediate experience exhibits continuity and embraces change, it is\nbecause these same features are to be found in our\nexperience. Prudent realists will accept that our judgements\nabout the character of our experience are fallible. But they will\nalso point that our judgements are less likely to err when they concern\nthe more basic and ubiquitous features of our consciousness, and\n– arguably – change and continuity are among these\nfeatures. The situation would be different if the antirealist\ncould provide reasons for being particularly sceptical about our\njudgements concerning change and continuity – reasons for\nthinking that our beliefs about these features of our experience are\nmore dubious than the belief that colour, sound or warmth are\nexperienced. It is certainly possible to argue – and some\nantirealists have (e.g., Plumer 1985) – that we know these\nbeliefs are false because it is impossible to provide intelligible\naccount of how we can be directly aware of change or\nmovement. We will be considering such arguments when we come to\nassess the viability of the various realist proposals. \n\nDennett himself is unmoved by such considerations. While\nrecognising that we find it natural to think our beliefs about our\nexperiences are answerable to a distinct and distinctive realm\nof experience, Dennett argues that this is misguided, that\nultimately – so far as consciousness is concerned – there\nis only judgement and belief: \n\nDennett’s strong reductionism with regard to experience is an\nextreme and controversial doctrine. It may well give antirealists\nwhat they need, but many may find the price rather too high. \n\nWhile PT-realists agree that change, persistence and other\ntemporally extended phenomena can feature in our immediate experience,\nthey disagree over the experiential structures which make this\npossible. Cinematic realists hold that all our experiences of\nchange are the product of gap-free successions of momentary\nstream-phases, each possessing momentary – and static,\nmotion-free – phenomenal contents. As we saw in §4.1,\nalthough this version of realism can seem appealing, it is also\nproblematic, in several respects. Proponents of the\nremaining principal forms of realism, the Extensional and Retentional\napproaches, allow that the contents of our consciousness are themselves\ndynamic – they can contain or present succession and persistence\n– but they disagree about the manner in which these contents exist\nwithin consciousness. On the Retentional view, which we shall be\nlooking at in more detail in §6, the dynamic contents are housed\nin episodes of consciousness that are themselves momentary.\nAccording to the Extensional view, the topic of this section, these\ncontents are themselves spread through (or extended over) time. \n\nAlthough the Extensional model can be developed in different ways, much\nof what these variants have in common can be brought out by looking at\nhow proponents of the approach construe individual specious\npresents. For present purposes, so as to bring the\nessentials to the fore, it will be useful to focus on a very simple\ninstance. Figure 5 depicts a single specious present with a\nvery simple content: ‘C’ and ‘D’ are each brief\ntones, which are heard and experienced in succession; this specious\npresent contains nothing but these two tones. Figure 5. \n\nBoth ‘C’ and ‘D’ here denote the actual\n‘live’ experiencings of tones C and D, rather than\nmemory-images or any other form of after-the-event\nrepresentation. The specious present they jointly compose is a\n(short-ish) period of continuous experiencing, spread through ordinary\ntime. Although D occurs later than C, it is also experienced as\nfollowing on from C (as indicated by the small block-arrows connecting\nthe two). Accordingly, what we have here is a genuine experience\nof succession, and no mere succession of experiences. Since\nthe tones are experienced together, albeit in succession, the\ntwo are phenomenally unified, or diachronically co-conscious – as\nindicated by the lower double-headed arrow. The limits of the\nspecious present are determined by the temporal extent of the\ndiachronic co-consciousness relationship. \n\nAs we saw in §2.5, in characterizing his presence-time,\nStern held that experiences unfolding over an interval of time can\n“form a unified and complex act of consciousness regardless of\nthe non-simultaneity of individual parts.” Since the successive\nphases of the specious present depicted in Figure 5 do form a\nunified ensemble, they clearly conform to Stern’s conception of a\npresence-time. James sometimes referred to the specious present a\nduration-block, which he characterized thus: ‘We do not\nfirst feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the\nperception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we\nseem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends\nembedded in it.’ (1890: 610) The specious present of\nthe Extensional model conforms to this characterization. Since\nthe successive constituents which compose a duration-block are live\nexperiences, the Extensional specious present also conforms fully to\nthe Immediacy Thesis (see §3): change can be experienced with the\nsame force, vivacity (or immediacy) as colour, sound or any other\nphenomenal feature. Figure 6. \n\nThe specious present, thus construed, is not confined to the housing\nof successions of discrete tones: it can also house continuous change,\nin the manner shown in Figure 6. Here we see a ball falling,\nbouncing and rising again, all within the confines of a single specious\npresent. The contents of specious presents are often dynamic\ntemporal patterns of this sort – though of course\nreal-life specious presents will usually have far complex and more\nvaried content: in addition to perceptual contents (from all five\nsenses) there will usually be conscious thoughts, bodily sensations,\nmental images and so forth. \n\nThere may seem to be a fundamental difficulty with supposing that our\nimmediate experience extends through time in the way being\nenvisaged. Since the successive contents contained within a specious\npresent are experienced together, isn’t there is a sense in which both\ntones are present even though they are non-simultaneous?\nRecalling the Extensional Simultaneity Problem (from §3), this\ncan easily seem absurd. If x and y are experienced\ntogether, and both x and y are present, how can x\nand y fail to be simultaneous? If x and y are\nboth occurring now, mustn’t they also be simultaneous? It is\nfor precisely this reason that Le Poidevin argues that change and\nduration cannot be directly\n perceived.[10]\nHowever, closer scrutiny suggests\nthere is no real difficulty here. The earlier and later contents\nof a single specious present do not occupy ‘the present\nmoment’ if this is construed as the durationless interface\nbetween past and future – the defining trait of the Extensional\napproach is the rejection of the confinement of consciousness to\nmomentary stream-phases. Nonetheless, there is a sense – a\nquite different sense – in which all the contents of a specious\npresent could legitimately be regarded as ‘being present’:\nsuch contents possess (what we might call) phenomenal\npresence, i.e., they each have the immediacy and vivacity that is\ncharacteristic of experiences as they occur. There is no\ncontradiction in the idea that experiences (or experiential contents)\nat different times can possess this property, they obviously do:\nyesterday’s toothache was as vivid and real current toothache at\nthe time I felt it as the toothache I am currently feeling – both\nhave just as much phenomenal\n presence.[11] \n\nReturning to our main theme – the makeup of individual\nspecious presents – while Figures 5 and 6 capture the core\nfeatures of the Extensional model, they also have their limitations:\nthe Extensional approach can accommodate different views as to general\ncharacter and composition of consciousness, and these differences do\nnot register in these diagrams. Some philosophers hold that\nconsciousness has an act-object (or awareness-content) structure, so\nevery experiencing – even the simplest –involves two\ndistinguishable components: an awareness (however construed) on the one\nhand, and an object or content on the other. Other philosophers\nreject this two-level picture, and hold that contents do not need to\nfall under an awareness in order to be conscious. As we shall see\nin §5.4, the Extensional model is compatible with both these\nviews. Divergent conceptions of the nature of perceptual\nexperience are also very relevant in this context. Is the moving\nitem shown in Figure 6 a phenomenal feature of a conscious state, or\nis it a physical object in motion through physical space? Those\nwho incline to the direct (or naïve) realist view of perception\nwill favour the latter answer, whereas those who subscribe to the\nindirect realist (or Lockean-style representational) view of perception\nwill favour the former answer. In slightly more general terms,\nExtensional theorists who believe that in our ordinary perceptual\nexperience we are presented with purely phenomenal items (sense-data,\nqualia or similar) will regard the visual and auditory contents of\nspecious presents as themselves being phenomenal in nature.\nAlthough most Extensional theorists subscribe to this general view of\nperception – e.g., Foster, Broad, Dainton, Sprigge – there\nis no obvious obstacle to combining the Extensional conception of the\nspecious present with a direct realist construal of perception.\nWith this combination of views, a typical specious present will consist\nof a temporally extended episode of awareness, some of whose contents\nwill be internal or phenomenal (e.g., a conscious thought, a mental\nimage), whereas others will be external (e.g., a bouncing ball, a\nmoving\n car).[12] \n\nEnough has been said – for present purposes at least –\nabout individual specious presents. The next task is to examine\nhow individual specious presents, construed in a broadly Extensional\nmanner, combine to form continuous streams of consciousness. As\nwe shall see, on this issue there are significant divergences of\nopinion among Extensional theorists – divergences which impact\nsignificantly on the general structure of temporal consciousness. \n\nWhen it comes to explaining how individual specious presents combine\nto form streams of consciousness, a simple and perspicuous solution is\navailable to the Extensional theorist: perhaps a stream of\nconsciousness is nothing more than a succession of specious presents\nlaid end-to-end in the manner of a line of building blocks, or bricks\nin a wall, in the manner depicted in Figure 7 below. Here just\na short stretch of a stream of consciousness is depicted, consisting of\njust two adjacent specious presents, SP1 and SP2,\nbut the same experiential structure could easily extend over longer\nperiods. Figure 7. \n\nSomething along the lines of this ‘Discrete Block’ (as\nwe might call it) conception of a stream of consciousness has been\nadvocated by Sprigge, Bradley and (perhaps)\n Whitehead.[13]\nBut while it has a\nsimplicity that may well be appealing, it is also\nproblematic. \n\nPT-realists are agreed that change and succession feature in our\nimmediate experience. To be viable on the phenomenological level,\na realist account of how this is possible must not just capture\nsome of the change that it is plausible to suppose we directly\nexperience, it must capture all of it. Let us suppose\nthat C-D-E-F in Figure 7 are brief tones that are heard in\nsuccession. Given that this sequence is a typical one –\nwith no sudden or massive disruptions in the listener’s\nconsciousness over the relevant period – each tone will be heard\nas flowing into (or giving way) to its immediate successor. The\ndiscrete block model certain captures some of these experienced\ntransitions: namely C-D (occurring in SP1) and E-F\n(occurring in SP2). But what of the transition between\nD and E? Since each of these tones occurs in a distinct specious\npresent, and (by hypothesis) there is no specious present which\nincludes them both, this transition is not experienced. For a\nsequence of contents to be experienced as a succession, they\nmust be experienced together, and to be experienced together\nthey need to be diachronically co-conscious. C and D are thus\nrelated, as are E and F, but D and E are not diachronically\nco-conscious. The tones are experienced in a sequence\n– D is heard first, then E – but they are not experienced\nas a sequence – or to put it another way, these tones\nform a succession of experiences, but there is no\nexperience of succession. The difficulty is serious and\npervasive: Figure 7 illustrates just one instance of a\n‘missed’ succession, if the Discrete Block model obtained,\nevery transition between successive specious presents would fail to be\nexperienced. Evidently, this is not a desirable result, at least\nfrom the standpoint of realism. \n\nEssentially the same point can be made in terms of the distinction\ndrawn in §3 between the Moderate and Strong Continuity\ntheses. If our streams of consciousness were structured in the\nway envisaged, there would be no gaps in our experience – no\nperiods during which nothing is being experienced – and so the\nkey requirement of Modest Continuity is satisfied. But the Strong\nContinuity Thesis requires more: as well as an absence of gaps, all the\nsuccessive brief phases which make up a single stream must\nexperientially connected to their immediate neighbours – each\nmust be experienced as flowing into its successor. The Discrete\nBlock model evidently falls short in this respect. \n\nA very different variant of the Extensional approach was proposed by\nC.D. Broad in Scientific Thought (1923).\nAs we have already seen, Broad subscribed to the Immediacy\nThesis: he held that (over short intervals) we experience change with\nthe same phenomenal immediacy as we experience colour or sound.\nSince change can only be directly apprehended if our consciousness can\nspan a temporal interval, Broad concluded that consciousness\ncan span a temporal interval. Given this commitment, his\n(1923) account is naturally classed as Extensional. However, as\nnoted in §2.7, this is not the whole story: the mechanics of\nBroad’s account are such that is probably more accurately\nconstrued as only partially Extensional. For Broad also\nheld that our experience of change occurs within momentary episodes of\nexperiencing – a doctrine which is characteristic of Retentional\naccounts. \n\nThis hybrid model is heavily dependent upon a particular conception of\nthe structure of experience. Broad generally worked with a two-level\n‘act-object’ or ‘awareness-content’ conception\nof consciousness. On this conception, any episode of experiencing\ncomprises two components: an act of awareness, and a phenomenal\ncontent; experiences per se come into being when contents are\napprehended by acts of awareness. Broad starts his analysis by\nproposing that acts of awareness that are themselves strictly\nmomentary are capable of apprehending phenomenal contents distributed\nover short periods of time, in the manner depicted in Figure 8. Figure 8. \n\nThe earlier and later parts of the temporal spread apprehended by the\nmomentary act of awareness depicted in Figure 8 are evidently\nexperienced together – they are diachronically co-conscious\n– and they are also experienced as a succession. This\nspread of content is experienced as a temporally extended whole, in\nconformity with James’ characterization of the specious present\nas a ‘duration-block’. There is however, one significant\npoint of divergence: whereas James held that the specious present both\nbackward and forward (or future-directed) elements, for Broad it is\nentirely backward-looking: it stretches from the present point of time\na short distance into the past. \n\nWhatever one may think of its reliance on a ‘momentary\nawareness + extended content’ mechanism, Broad’s theory has\n– on the face of it at least – a distinctive advantage over\nthe Sprigge’s Discrete Block model when it comes to conforming to\nthe Strong Continuity Thesis. The many experienced successions\nthe Discrete Block model fails to register are all effortlessly\ncaptured by Broad’s theory. This is easily\nappreciated with the assistance of Figure 9. Figure 9. \n\nAs can be seen, act of awareness A1 apprehends the\ntone-sequence C-D, and act of awareness A3 apprehends the\ntone-sequence E-F, but the tone-sequence not recognized by the\nDiscrete Block model – D-E – is now apprehended by the act\nof awareness A2, which occurs between A1 and\nA3. Since Broad postulated that the acts of awareness\nform a dense continuum (hence between A1 and A2\nthere are uncountable number of other acts, and likewise between\nA2 and A3) the theory can accommodate all the\nexperienced transitions it needs to accommodate. The\nact-continuum is represented in Figure 9 by the line running beneath\nA1-A3. \n\nIn the light of what has been said so far, it would be natural to\nsuppose that Broad would identify individual specious presents with\nmomentary acts and the contents these acts apprehend (e.g., the\ncombination A1[C-D] would count as a single specious\npresent). In fact he opted for another position. Agreeing\nwith James that strictly durationless experiences (or apprehensions)\nare abstractions, Broad insists that a viable account of sensible\nduration must rest on the foundation of continuous periods of\nsensing. Since he defines the duration of the specious present in\nterms of momentary acts, strictly speaking temporally extended acts do\nnot possess specious presents; however, they do possess close analogues\nof these: what is (in effect) the specious present of an interval of\nsensing S is the stretch of content that is apprehended\nthroughout S. To get a rough idea of what this involves,\nconsider the continuous act of sensing A1-A2 in\nFigure 9. What stretch of content does the specious present of\nthis act comprise? According to Broad the answer is D. The\nearlier phases of A1-A2 apprehend C (or parts of\nit), and the later phases of it apprehend E (or parts of it), but D is\nthe largest stretch of content that is apprehended by every\nphase of A1-A2. \n\nThis feature of Broad’s theory is counterintuitive, and it\ngives rise to some intriguing, and arguably peculiar,\n results.[14]\nPresent\npurposes, however, will best be served by concentrating on two most\nfundamental problems faced by Broad’s account. The first\nworry concerns phenomenological adequacy. Consider again\ntone-phase D in Figure 9. As we have just seen, it is\nexperienced as a whole throughout the period of sensing\n[A1-A2]. Broad may reject durationless acts\nof sensing, but he does not reject acts of sensing of varying extents\nor durations, and [A1-A2] includes as proper\nparts many acts of finite duration that are shorter than itself, and\njust as [A1-A2] apprehends D as a whole, so too\ndo all these finite parts. In which case, instead of being\nexperienced just once, won’t D be experienced many times\nover? How could it be otherwise, given that each of these finite\nparts includes an experiencing of the whole of D? If\nBroad’s model predicts the existence of experiences which do not\nactually occur, it seems safe to conclude that the mechanism at the\nheart of it is\n flawed.[15] \n\nThe second worry is whether Broad’s model can secure the\ncontinuity of consciousness in a way that is acceptable to the\nrealist. At the heart of Broad’s account are acts of\nsensing which apprehend temporally extended contents. Since in\nthe case of a continuous stream of consciousness these acts form a\ndense continuum, there is no difficulty with ‘gaps’ in\nconsciousness, and so Broad’s account meets the requirements of\nthe Modest Continuity Thesis. It is not clear, however, that it\nmeets the requirements of the Strong Continuity Thesis. To do so,\nBroad’s account must allow successive phases of a stream to be\nexperienced as flowing into one another – it must make room for\nexperiential connections between stream-phases – but\nthis looks problematic. Returning to Figure 9, consider the\nextended act of sensing stretching from A1 to AN,\nand the extended act stretching from shortly after AN to\nA2, where AN (not shown in the figure) is roughly\nmid-way between A1 and A2. These two\nextended acts can be as close together in time we like, but they are\nnonetheless entirely distinct acts of awareness, and the two\nare not experientially connected. Hence the problem. It is\ntrue that the acts apprehend (in part) the same content, but\nit is not clear this suffices to forge the required experiential\nlinks. We can certainly stipulate that the acts concerned have\nthe same subject, but in the absence of any compelling story\nas to how this secures phenomenal continuity it is not clear how this\nhelps either. Nor is it clear that a viable account can be\nconstructed if we remain faithful to the spirit of Broad’s\napproach. Suppose we were to hold that the acts\n[A1-AN] and [AN-A2] are\nunified by virtue of their both falling under a second-order act of\nawareness, an act which apprehends first-order acts (and their\ncontents). Since the entire spread of content apprehended over\nthe interval encompassed by A1 and A2 would be\nexperienced together, the result would be phenomenologically\nunrealistic: the specious present would have twice the duration that it\nhas in actuality. And the difficulties do not end here: for what\nunifies the second-order acts? As illustrated in Figure 10, if\nwe take this route, we can easily end up with a situation in which the\nentire content of a stream of consciousness is apprehended as a single\nwhole, by a single all-embracing act. Figure 10. \n\nAccording to one theological tradition, God’s experience has the\ncharacter of a totum simul, and takes in the entire history of\nthe universe in a single apprehension. Since it is clear that our\nis experience is not of this form – the span of our\nimmediate awareness is measured in seconds at most – it is clear\nthat this way of securing Strong Continuity is a non-starter. \n\nThe problems encountered by the Discrete Block theory and\nBroad’s hybrid model point the way forward to a more promising\nExtensional account. Recall the problem of ‘missed\ntransitions’ that afflicts the Discrete Block model: in the case\nof the succession of tones C-D-E-F, although C and D are experienced as\nphenomenally continuous, E and F likewise, D and E are not – for\nunlike [C-D] and [E-F] they do not fall within the confines of a single\nspecious present (see Figure 7). There is a simple remedy for\nthis problem: the omitted transition can be restored by positing that\n[D-E] itself forms a single specious present – a further\n‘duration block’ in the manner of Sprigge and Bradley\n– which for convenience we can call SPX. Since\n(by hypothesis) D-E is an experienced succession, this stipulation is\nwell-motivated on the phenomenological level. What is more, this\nuseful result has been achieved without recourse to Broad’s\nmomentary-act/extended content conception of the specious present: the\naccount remains fully (rather than merely partially)\nExtensionalist. \n\nAs Figure 11 makes clear, acknowledging the existence of\nSPX does not commit us to recognizing any experiences in\naddition to C-D-E-F, for SPX is composed of the second-half\nof SP1 (= D) and the first-half of SP2 (=\nE). To put it another way, there is a D-type experience to be\nfound in SP1 and also in SPX, but there are not\ntwo token D-type experiences, for the simple reason that the\nD-token in SP1 is numerically identical with the D-token in\nSPX, and similarly for E. By holding that specious\npresents can overlap by sharing common parts, phenomenal\ncontinuity can be secured in an economical manner. As Foster puts\nit: ‘where the successive patterns overlap, the experiences which\npresent them overlap in a corresponding way’ (1991: 249). Figure 11. \n\nRecognizing the existence of SPX may not incur the cost\nof additional experiences, but it does involve the\nintroduction of additional experiential relationships.\nIt is now being supposed that D and E are connected by the relationship\nof diachronic co-consciousness, whereas previously it was previously\nheld that only C-D and E-F were so related. But on the assumption\nthat D and E constitute a directly experienced succession, D evidently\nis diachronically co-conscious with E. \n\nAs this example also illustrates, the relationship of diachronic\nco-consciousness is not transitive: C and D are related in this manner,\nas are D and E, but C and E are not so related. This\nfailure of transitivity plays a crucial role in ensuring that the\noverlap theory delivers a phenomenologically realistic result. If\ndiachronic co-consciousness were transitive, all the phases of a\ncontinuous stream of consciousness would be experienced together\n– we would be back with the totum simul. The point\nconcerning transitivity failure was perhaps first noted by Russell in\nhis ‘On the Experience of Time’ (1913), where he assumes\nspecious presents combine by overlap to form streams\nof\n consciousness.[16]\nThe Overlap Model (as we can\ncall it) in the form just outlined has been advocated on several\noccasions by Foster (1979; ;1982: 255ff; 1991: 247–50) and Dainton\n(2000/6: §7; 2003; 2009). \n\nIts proponents intend the Overlap Model to capture not just the\nstructure of a sequences of tones, but of entire streams of\nconsciousness. If the Overlap theorists are right, such streams\nare composed of successions of stream-phases which overlap by sharing\ncommon parts, in the manner of C-D-E-F. However, on close\nscrutiny the description just given of the structure of even this\nsimple sequence turns out to be inadequate. By supposing that\nSPX exists, in addition to SP1 and SP2\nwe capture an experienced transition (or specious present) which\nactually exists, but which gets ignored by the Discrete Block\nmodel. But does Figure 11 include all the experienced\ntransitions which exist in the case of C-D-E-F? Given the\ncontinuous character of our experience, probably not: for just as D-E\nis experienced as an extended whole, so to is the tone-pattern running\nfrom the mid-point in C to the mid-point in E, or from the\nthree-quarter point in D to the three-quarter point in F, and so on for\nmany (many) other cases. These ‘omitted transitions’\nare easily accommodated by the Overlap Model, as illustrated in Figure\n12. This new example is still unrealistically simplistic, for\nonce again only a single sensory modality is represented, in the form\nof a visual experience of a bouncing ball, but it in one key respect it\nis less artificial. Figure 12. \n\nAs this diagram makes illustrates, specious presents can be more\nclosely packed than sequence of tones depicted in Figure 11. In\nthis new example, each double-headed line represents a distinct\nspecious present, each differing from its immediate neighbours by a\njust-noticeable\n difference.[17]\nAlthough these specious presents\noverlap to a very significant degree, given that the overlap takes the\nform of a sharing of common parts, there is no phenomenologically\nunrealistic repetitions: the greater the extent to which two specious\npresents overlap, the greater the number of phases they share.\nWhat we have here is what is needed: a temporally extended stretch of\nconsciousness that is phenomenally continuous, and which includes all\nthe experienced transitions which are experienced. Or so\nthe Overlap theorists maintain. \n\nThe ‘duration-blocks’ we have been dealing with latterly\nare unified episodes of experiencing, conceived in the Sprigge-Bradley\nmanner, i.e. as collections of phenomenal contents that are also\nphenomenally unified (or experienced together). The Overlap Model\ncan also be developed in the context of an awareness-content conception\nof experience, of the sort which Broad adopted. The most\nstraightforward way of implementing this\n‘awareness-overlap’ model is illustrated in Figure\n13. Here A1, A2 and A3 are\ntemporally extended acts of awareness, apprehending contents C-D, D-E\nand E-F respectively. Each of these acts generates a single\nspecious present. We further suppose that these acts overlap by\nsharing common parts, i.e., that the portion of A1 which\napprehends D is numerically identical with the portion of A2\nwhich apprehends D, and likewise for the portions of A2 and\nA3 which apprehend E. Once again we have a situation\nin which continuous streams of consciousness are composed of\noverlapping specious presents. Figure 13. \n\nWhen the awareness-content conception of the specious present is\ndeveloped in this manner the problems which afflicted Broad’s\naccount no longer arise. Phenomenal continuity is secured by the\noverlapping of neighbouring acts of sensing (e.g., the second half of\nA1 and the first half of A2 are numerically\nidentical). As Foster notes (1979), these overlaps also solve the\nproblem of repeatedly-experienced contents. If A1 and\nA2 are discrete acts then D is experienced\ntwice-over. But if A1 and A2 overlap in the\nmanner indicated, D is experienced just once: by the episode of sensing\nthat is common to A1 and A2. \n\nSo much for the bare bones of the Overlap version of\nExtensionalism. For further elaboration and discussion see\nDainton (2003, 2009, 2014a, 2014b), Hoerl (2013a, 2013b), Phillips (2014c), Rashbrook (2013b), Soteriou (2010). \n\nThe Overlap Model looks to be the most promising variant of the\nExtensional approach. Like other Extensional accounts, it allows\nchange and succession to be directly experienced in a clear and\nunambiguous manner, and so fully satisfies the requirements of\nrealism. Also, by virtue of the fact that each successive\nphase of an Extensional specious present contains ordinary first-order\nexperiences, the requirements of the Immediacy Thesis are also met:\nchange and succession can be experienced with maximal (phenomenal)\nvividness. Further, and distinctively, the Overlap Model secures\nboth Modest and Strong Continuity: not only is a (typical) stream of\nconsciousness a gap-free stretch of experience, but each of its\nsuccessive brief phases is experientially connected to its immediate\nneighbours. Kelly (2005: 231) points out that for the Extensional\napproach to be viable it must be able to explain how we manage to\nperceive continuous changes which last longer than the specious\npresent, which in turn requires an explanation of how it is possible\nfor specious presents to be strung together; he also suggests no such\nexplanation is available. The Overlap approach provides just such\nan explanation. \n\nDespite this, some critics have suggested the overlap mechanism is\nsurplus to requirements. Gallagher (2003) is unable to find any\ntrace of the alleged overlaps between specious presents in his own\nexperience, and concludes that the account is phenomenologically\nsuspect. The Overlap theorist can respond by arguing that the\nseamless continuity, lasting for minutes or hours, that we find in our\nstreams of consciousness is itself evidence for the proposed overlap\nstructure, since the latter is responsible for the continuity in\nquestion: \n\nIf these claims are true, the Extensional model (in its Overlap\nmode) has secure foundations. But are they? Strawson (2009:\nPart 5) argues, in effect, that direct experiential connections between\nsuccessive stream-phases are invisible to introspection; for further\ndiscussion see Dainton (2004: §4). \n\nIn a different vein, Mabbot argues that ‘qualitative\ndifferences of content alone determine sub-divisions within our\ncontinuous experience’(1951: 166). Finding this plausible,\nPhillips (2010: 189) suggests that the overlap theory\n‘looks like unwholesome food served to a man already\nfull’. Overlap theorists will agree that content does\nindeed provide a way of demarcating subdivisions within streams – the period spent\nlistening to the sound of a passing plane, or watching a bird fly\nacross the sky, etc. – but they will insist that an additional\ningredient is required. We need to be able to explains why it is\nthat we are only directly aware of change and persistence over short\nintervals, rather than the several hours through which a typical stream\nof consciousness extends. By holding that the diachronic\nco-consciousness relationship only extends for a short interval the\nOverlap theorist can meets this need. In the Overlap Model\ninherently dynamic contents and the limited span of the diachronic\nco-consciousness relationship work together in delivering (what is\narguably) a phenomenologically realistic result. \n\nOther criticisms are directed at the Extensional specious\npresent. One main issue here concerns phenomenal\nunity. As we saw in §2.5, Meinong (1899: 187) pointed\nout a potential difficulty with Stern’s temporally extended\n‘presence-time’ (in effect, an Extensionalist specious\npresent). If a specious present extends through (ordinary) time,\nthe parts or phases of which it is composed – let us designate\nthem [P1, P2, P3 …\nPn] – will also be distributed through time. The\nquestion then arises as to what unifies these components. If\nnothing unifies them, we are left with a succession experiences, but no\nexperience of succession. We could hold that [P1,\nP2, P3 … Pn] are unified\nbecause they fall within the scope of a single episode of awareness A,\nbut if we also hold that A is extended through ordinary time, the\noriginal problem simply re-occurs: A will be composed of a succession\nof phases, [A1, A2, A3 …\nAn], and unless these phases are themselves unified, we will\nonce again be left with a mere succession of experiencings. To\navoid this we might posit a higher-order act awareness, A*, which takes\n[A1, A2, A3 … An]\nand their contents its objects, and in so doing creates an experience\nof succession. But if we suppose that A* is a temporally extended\nepisode of awareness, then evidently we have solved nothing –\nwhat unifies the component parts of A*? – and are embarked on a\nmenacing-looking infinite regress. Happily, there is a simple and\nobvious way to avoid this regress: we need simply hold that the\nawareness A which unifies [P1, P2, P3\n… Pn] itself lacks temporal extension. If A is\nstrictly momentary, the problem of what unifies its constituent phases\nsimply does not arise: it lacks such phases entirely. \n\nThis influential line of argument leads directly to PSA, and thence\nto the associated Retentional model of temporal\nconsciousness. Although the difficulty may seem serious, the\nExtensional theorist has an effective line of reply: the argument in\nquestion can be seen as simply begging the question. Recall the\nway in which the Extensional theorist construes an individual specious\npresent, as depicted in Figures 5 and 6: a single specious present\nis viewed as a temporal spread of contents that are all experienced\ntogether, i.e., that are diachronically co-conscious. Right\nat the heart of the Extensional model is an assumption concerning the\nnature of phenomenal unity. The assumption is precisely that\nphenomenal unity is not confined to contents that are\nmomentary and simultaneous, it can embrace contents that are spread (a\nshort distance) through time. Accordingly, provided the envisaged\nsuccession of phases [P1, P2, P3\n… Pn] are related in this manner – they are\ndiachronically co-conscious, and so are experienced together –\nthey already constitute an experience of succession, and nothing\nfurther is required. Now it could be that the Extensional\ntheorists are misguided in making this assumption: perhaps phenomenal\nunity cannot extend over time in the way they claim. But since\nthe line of argument set out in the previous paragraph simply ignores\nthe mode of phenomenal unity posited by Extensional model theorists, it\nfails to provide us with any reason for thinking this is the\ncase. In effect, the objection presupposes that that synchronic\nphenomenal unity – the sort of unity which obtains among\nsimultaneous momentary contents – is the only mode of phenomenal\nunity. \n\nSince Extensional specious presents comprise earlier and later\nphases that are experienced together, in a single unified (albeit\nextended) state of consciousness, it may well be that Extensional\nmodels are incompatible with the Presentist conception of time,\naccording to which only what is present is real. For two\nphenomenal contents C1 and C2 be experienced\ntogether, to be diachronically co-conscious, both\nC1 and C2 must surely both exist. But if\nPresentism were true, when C1 is present C2 would\nbe non-existent, and when C2 is present C1 would\nbe non-existent. Extensional theorists will not be overly worried\nby this consequence, which they will construe as a reason for rejecting\nthe Presentist conception of time. See §7.2 for further\ndiscussion of this issue. \n\nComing from a very different direction, Grush has argued\n(2005b, 2006, 2007, 2016) that Retentional models have a distinct advantage\nover Extensional models when it comes to accommodating certain\n‘temporal illusions’. The relevant category of cases\nare those where a stimuli occurring later than a time t\naffects the character of what is perceived as occurring at t\nitself; the so-called flash-lag effect and the\nphi-phenomenon fall into this category. These instances\nof (apparent) retro-active causation are only found occurring over\nbrief intervals, but they are certainly as puzzling as they are\nintriguing. Grush suggests that Retentional models can handle\nsuch cases by virtue of the fact that what is perceived as occurring at\nt need not remain constant from one specious present to\nanother. So, for example, a particular spot of light might be\nperceived as motionless in a specious present S1 occurring very shortly\nafter t, and that same spot might be perceived as being in\nmotion in a later specious present S2. This option is not\navailable to Extensional theorists – since on this view the spot\nis represented just once – and as a consequence there will be\nconflicting perceptual experiences of what is occurring at t:\nthe spot will be perceived (impossibly) as both stationary and in\nmotion. However, there are replies available to the Extensional\ntheorist. It takes some time for our perceptual systems to\nproduce an experience in response to a stimuli; perhaps our perceptual\nsystems make use of this time to work out (as it were) a single\ncoherent response to ambiguous or conflicting stimuli.\nAccordingly, rather than the spot’s being experienced as both\nstationary and as moving, it is experienced just the once, in\nmotion. For more on the relevant illusions, Grush’s\nargument, and the responses available to the Extensionalist see\nSection 3 of the supplementary document\n Husserl, the Brain and Cognitive Science, \nand the supplementary document \n Interpreting Temporal Illusions. \n\nStill more recently, Pelczar has argued (2010a, 2010b) that\nthe Extensional model rests on an inadequate conception of the temporal\nmicrostructure of consciousness. An Extensional specious present\nis a chunk of experiencing which extends over a second or so of\nordinary time, so it will inevitably possesses temporal parts –\nthe still briefer chunks of experiencing of which it is composed\n– and the briefest of these parts will be strictly momentary\nepisodes of experiencing. Since on the Extensional model it takes\nan interval of time to experience change or succession, these momentary\nstream-phases will not contain any experience of change: their contents\nwill be entirely static in character. This is problematic, argues\nPelczar, because we have good reason to believe it is impossible for\nsuch experiences to exist. The grounds for this are\nphenomenological: ‘When I have an experience as of some smooth\ncontinuous change – when watching a leaf drift to the ground, for\nexample, or listening to a steadily rising tone – my experience\ndoes not contain or decompose into a series of experiences that are not\nas of change’ (forthcoming A). Since the briefest of\nexperiences that we can conceive or imagine contains some element of\nchange, or passage – or so Pelczar maintains – we should\naccept that experience is essentially dynamic, or better:\nsubjectively dynamic. Since the momentary episodes of\nexperience which feature in the Extensional model do not feature\nchange, it seems that Extensional specious presents are composed of\ningredients which cannot possibly exist. Retentionalist accounts\ndo not face this difficulty. A Retentionalist specious present is\nmomentary episode of experiencing whose contents are (by hypothesis)\nsubjectively dynamic. \n\nIf this reasoning is sound, it looks as though we have good reason\nfor preferring the Retentional model to the Extensional\nalternative. However, there are replies available to the\nExtensionalist. One option is to hold grant that phenomenal\ncontents are essentially (subjectively) dynamic, but hold that the\nbriefest genuine episodes of experiencing in a specious\npresent (or stream of consciousness) have a finite temporal extension;\non this view momentary cross-sections of a stream of consciousness are no more than abstractions. A second option is to\nreject the claim that phenomenal contents are essentially\ndynamic. We may not be able to imagine experiential contents that\nare entirely static, but this doesn’t mean they are not possible:\nperhaps our imaginations are incapable of recreating all possible modes\nof experience. A third, and more intriguing option, is to accept\nthat experience is essentially dynamic, and also accept that a stream\ncan decompose into ever briefer parts, but reject the\nassumption that this decomposition must terminate in durationless\nepisodes of experience. An alternative possibility is that the\ndecomposition continues indefinitely – to infinity –\nwithout ever terminating in durationless point-like parts. In\ncontemporary parlance, perhaps consciousness has the structure of\natomless gunk. This species of gunk is a sort of stuff\nthat is infinitely divisible, but not possessing point-like parts: all\nthe parts of a portion of gunk have proper parts, without end.\nWhitehead and Broad were of the view that ordinary space and time\npossessed this structure. Irrespective of whether they were right\nabout this, it may be that our streams of consciousness have this\nstructure. If so, then they can possess an infinite number of\nparts, all of which have some (usually very brief) duration,\nand each of these parts may have a dynamic content. Wherever the\ntruth lies on this issue, the temporal microstructure of experience\nlooks to be fertile ground for Extensionalist exploration. \n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to the Extensional\nspecious present see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues. \n\nHaving looked in some detail at two of the main forms of PT-realism\n– the Cinematic approach (in §4.1) and the Extensional model\n(in §5) – there remains the third: the Retentional\nmodel. Although the Retentional model itself comes in several\nvariants, its proponents share a distinctive conception of the\nstructure of temporal consciousness. Whereas Extensional\ntheorists hold that our immediate experience of change and succession\noccurs within specious presents which are themselves extended through\ntime, Retentional theorists hold that individual specious presents lack\ntemporal duration, but have contents which succeed in presenting (or\nrepresenting) temporally extended phenomena. As standardly\nconceived, a Retentionalist specious present consists of a complex of\nexperiential contents, comprising an instantaneous (or\nnear-instantaneous) phase of immediate experience, together with a\ncollection of representations – retentions – of the recent\npast, all packaged into an episode of experiencing that is momentary; a\nstream of consciousness is composed of a continuum of these\nmomentary\n episodes.[18] \n\nIn effect, whereas Extensional specious presents run horizontally\nalong the time-line, Retentional specious presents stands vertically,\nat right-angles to it. On the face of it the Extensional approach\nis the more natural way for a realist to go: the most obvious and\nstraightforward explanation of how we can be directly aware of change\nand persistence is to hold that our direct awareness can span an\ninterval of ordinary time. By contrast, the Retentional view can\nseem almost perverse: why think that our apparently immediate\nexperience of change and persistence is in fact packaged into momentary\n(or extremely brief) slices of experience? Since it is by no\nmeans obvious how this can be, Retentionalism is not the\nobvious way to go. Yet a good many of the most famous names\nassociated with the specious present – James (at times), Husserl,\nBroad (in his later work on the topic) – have opted for the\nRetentional approach. Before looking at Retentional models in\nmore detail, it is worth pausing to consider the motivations which have\nled such philosophers to move in this direction. \n\nWhy think our experience of change occurs in experiences which are\nthemselves durationless? There are a number of considerations\nwhich point in this direction; some of these we have already\nencountered, others we have not. \n\nFor the Retentional model to be viable at all, we must be able to\nmake sense of the idea that duration and succession, in the forms we\nimmediately experience them, can be contained in episodes of\nexperiencing that are themselves without duration. Provided one\ndraws some relevant distinctions, this is by no means as impossible as\nit might initially seem. The three letters ‘R E D’\ncan represent red without themselves being red; and the same applies,\nmutatis mutandis, for ‘L O U D’ and ‘S Q U A\nR E’. Generally speaking, the properties of a\nrepresentation (that which is doing the representing) and the content\nof that representation (what is represented) can differ\ndramatically. The distinction extends to mental representations:\nthe conscious thought ‘the Earth’s equator is\ncircular’ succeeds in representing the geometrical property of\ncircularity without itself possessing this property. Bearing this\nin mind, there is no obvious reason why the temporal\nproperties of a mental representation R need entirely coincide\nwith the temporal properties of the content C carried by\nR. Accordingly, in a more extreme case, it may be\npossible for a content C to have an apparent duration of a\nsecond or so, whereas R exists in an episode of experiencing\nwhich has no significant duration at all. As Hoerl (2013(a) argues, Retentionalists such as\nMeinong and Husserl were well aware of the need to distinguish between\nthe temporal properties featuring in the contents of experience, from\nthe temporal properties of the experiences carrying these\ncontents. See §7.1 for more on this distinction; see Rashbrook (2013a) for more in its role in motivating Retentionalism. \n\nAs for the question of motivation, common sense no doubt plays a\nrole. Reid’s contention (see §2.3) that ‘the\nsenses give us information of things only as they exist in the present\nmoment’ has a good deal of intuitive plausibility, as does taking\nthe present moment to lack duration, in the manner of Augustine.\nAnyone who subscribes to each of these doctrines and who also believes\nwe are immediately aware of change has little option but to opt for the\nRetentional approach. Tradition is another likely reason.\nAs we saw in §2.4, in his First Critique Kant\nmaintained that we could only have experience of the sort we have if at\nevery moment we also retain something of our prior experience:\n‘if I were always to lose the preceding representations (the\nfirst parts of the line, the preceding parts of the time, or the\nsuccessively represented unity) from my thoughts, and not reproduce\nthem when I proceed to the following ones, then no whole representation\nand none of the previously mentioned thoughts, not even the purest and\nmost fundamental representations of space and time, could ever\narise.’ (A102) For philosophers working within the Kantian\nand Post-Kantian tradition – and this includes the majority of\nEuropean phenomenologists in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries – it would be natural to start from the\nassumption that our experience of change and persistence arises from a\ncombination of two factors: a momentary phase of present experience and\nsimultaneously apprehended reproductions or retentions of just-past\nexperiences. \n\nMany realists have no doubt found the Retentional approach appealing\nbecause it offers a simple and intuitively satisfying explanation of\nhow an experience of succession differs from a mere succession of\nexperiences: in the former case, the contents forming the succession\nare presented together, as an ensemble, to a single momentary\nawareness. Brentano and Husserl both subscribed to The\nPrinciple of Simultaneous Awareness (PSA) ‘No succession of\nawarenesses – no matter how close together in time they come\n– can, by itself, account for an awareness of succession; it must\nbe the case that an awareness of succession derives from simultaneous\nfeatures of the structure of that awareness’ (Miller (1984:\n109). As we saw in §5.5, Meinong and Husserl both argued\n– correctly – that the successive phases of a temporally\nextended awareness of the sort advocated by Stern needed to be unified,\nand both realized that a unifying act which is not temporally\nextended does not face the same difficulty. Indeed, it may well\nbe that some theorists, consciously or unconsciously, have found the\nRetentional approach appealing because of the way it (in effect)\nreduces the problem of diachronic phenomenal unity to the\ncomparatively straightforward problem of synchronic unity.\nAlthough the latter is by no means unproblematic – there are\ndifferent accounts of it – it is at least widely accepted that\nthere is such a thing as synchronic phenomenal unity. \n\nA further, and no less deep, motivation for the Retentional view is\nconnected with the common sense considerations mentioned above: tacit\nassumptions, of a broadly metaphysical character, concerning the\nstructure or nature of time itself are very relevant in this\ncontext. There may well be no single conception of time which\nperfectly fits all our common sense assumptions about it, but\nPresentism – the doctrine, favoured by Augustine, that\nneither the past nor the future exist, and hence that only the present\nis real – fits them better than most. If the momentary\npresent is all that is real, there is no obvious option but to locate\nour experience of change and persistence in the momentary\npresent. (The relationship between different conceptions of\ntemporal consciousness and different ways of thinking about time\nper se is the topic of §7.2 below.) \n\nA similar conclusion can be reached without recourse to highly\ncontroversial conceptions of time. Russell once wrote\n‘There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the\nworld sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with\na population that “remembered” a wholly unreal past.\nThere is no logically necessary connection between events at different\ntimes’ (1921: 159). If the world could have sprung into\nexistence five minutes ago, why not five seconds, or five\nnano-seconds ago? The claim that the subjective character of our\ncurrent experience is logically independent of the past can seem\neminently plausible. But so too can the claim that the character\nof our current experience is logically independent of the future.\nSuppose five seconds from now I were to be instantaneously annihilated\nby a nuclear bomb concealed under my chair. Would this fact\nimpinge on my current experience? It seems unlikely – how\ncan something that is yet to happen affect what is happening now?\nBut doesn’t the same apply if I will be annihilated a mere five nano-seconds\nfrom now? It seems plausible to think that it does. This reasoning leads ineluctably to the conclusion that the character of our experience at any one time is\nlogically independent of our past and future experiences, and this\napplies to every part of every stream of consciousness. If this\nis the case, our experience of change and persistence cannot\nessentially depend on experiential connections between the neighbouring\nphases of our streams of consciousness, connections of the sort\nExtensional models posit and require: for if such connections were to\nexist, adjoining stream-phases would not be logically independent of\none another. And if adjoining momentary stream phases\nare logically independent of one another, it may well be that\nthe Retentional approach is the only game in town. \n\nLet us suppose that for the past minute or so you have just been\nwatching the pointer moving around a dial; the pointer has been moving\nsufficiently quickly that you are able to see it in motion.\nLet us further suppose that your experience of change is\noccurring within the confines of a succession of specious presents, and\nthat each of the latter consists of a momentary phase of perceptual\nexperience together with a sequence of retentions of recent\nexperiences. For present purposes, we can think of retentions as\na special form of past-directed mental representations that are\ntriggered in an automatic (and involuntary) manner after each momentary\nphase of experiencing. This basic Retentional model is depicted\nin Figure 14. Figure 14. \n\nIn the bottom row of the diagram are three momentary perceptual\nexperiences, registering the location of the pointer at three\nneighbouring times. For convenience, only a small selection of\nsuch experiences have been shown; we can suppose that in reality you\nenjoyed a distinct momentary experience for (at least) each discernibly\ndistinct location of the pointer as it moved from the half-past\nposition to the quarter-to position. The vertical column to the\nright depicts a single specious present, S. This has two sorts of\ncomponent: a momentary visual experience of the dial-face (with the\npointer at quarter-to); accompanying the latter (and co-conscious with\nit) are retentions of the earlier experiences, shown unshaded and in\ndotted outline. Again, only a few of the actual retentions are\nshown in the diagram: in reality there will be a retention\ncorresponding to each of the momentary perceptual experiences you\nenjoyed during this brief interval. We are to suppose that your\ndirect experience of change – in this case visible movement\n– takes place exclusively within these vertical structures. \n\nSo much for the basics of the Retentional model. Might\nexperiential structures of this sort be responsible for our immediate\nexperience of change and persistence? Perhaps, but there are a\nnumber of hurdles which must be crossed or circumvented. \n\nFor a Retentional model to amount to a viable form of PT-realism it\nmust be possible for momentary states such as S to include change,\nsuccession and persistence in the forms in which we experience\nthem. One difficulty here is the Retentional Simultaneity Problem\nnoted in §3. The contents in any given Retentional specious\npresent exist simultaneously – at least as measured by ordinary\nclock-time – but if they are to generate the appearance of\nsuccession they must avoid leaving the impression that the events they\nrepresent also occur simultaneously. If a number of tones are\nheard simultaneously, the result is obviously a chord rather\nthan a succession. In fact, it is not just succession that the\nRetentional theorist needs to accommodate. Returning to Figure\n14, it was stipulated that you see the pointer moving\nsmoothly from half-past to quarter-to. Where is the\nmovement in S? There may seem to be no real difficulty\nhere: after all, we can easily call up a moving image in our memories\nor imaginations – as when we remember seeing a bird in flight, or\na ball in motion – so we know that our minds are capable of\ngenerating dynamic imagery. There is, however, an important\ndifference between the two cases. Running re-plays of past\nexperiences in ordinary memory is a process which itself unfolds over\ntime, but the dynamic re-plays required by the Retentionalist are\nsupposed to occur at a single moment. Indeed, as\nprocesses which occur over time, remembered or imagined movements will\nthemselves occur within momentary specious presents, and so their\ndynamic character will depend on that of retentions. \n\nGiven the requirements of realism, what characteristics must\nretentions themselves possess? Retentions are akin to\nmemories in that they re-present the past, but to fulfil the task\nrequired of them they must be more vivid than ordinary memories.\nWe all know what it is like to call up a memory of seeing and hearing\nthe falling of a tree; we all know what it is like to actually see\nand hear the falling of a tree. In the case of the former\nthere is a visual and acoustic mental images. In the latter case\nthere is the immediately perceived motion and noise: sharp, vivid\n– LOUD – and out there. Between these\ntwo forms of experience there is all the difference in the\nworld. Since it is not plausible to suppose that ordinary\nmemory-images are responsible for our immediate experience of change,\nretentions must be a of a distinctive (and not commonly recognised)\nform of experience. \n\nDiagrams along the lines of 6.1 are commonplace in the\nRetentionalist literature, and all such figures serve the useful\npurpose of making it clear that Retentionalist are offering what is, in\neffect, a two-dimensional model of temporal\nconsciousness. The change and succession which feature in our\nimmediate experience occur within specious presents which have no\ntemporal extension in ordinary objective time; these specious presents\ndo possess a temporal extension – an experienced\nextension – but this exists (as it were) orthogonally to ordinary\ntime, along the vertical rather than the horizontal. Opting for a\ntwo-dimensional temporal framework is an elegant solution to the\nproblem of how it is possible for succession and persistence to exist\nin experiences which (objectively) have no duration, but is also a\nsource of potential difficulties. Since Extensional models do not\nrequire the positing of this additional dimension, Retentional models\nare vulnerable to the accusation that they are needlessly\nprofligate. \n\nThe additional dimension also creates a problem on the purely\nphenomenological level. There are two general options concerning\nthe subjective character of Retentional specious presents, we can call\nthem the Modal and Non-Modal, see Figure 15.\nModal theorists, such as Brentano and Husserl, hold that the successive contents within a single\nspecious present appear under different temporal modes of presentation:\nroughly speaking, whereas some contents appear as fully present, others\nas ‘just past’, others as ‘more past’, and so\non. These temporal modes do not figure in any shape or form on\nthe Non-modal option: on this view, all the contents within a\nsingle specious present appear equally present, in the phenomenal\nsense, as well as successive. In effect, the Retentionalist\nNon-modal specious present is subjectively indistinguishable from an\nExtensionalist duration-block (see §5.1), it is simply differently\nlocated with respect to ordinary time. See Lee (2014a, 2014b) for a vigourous recent defence of a Non-Modal form of Retentionalism.  Figure 15. Two\nconceptions of the Retentionalist specious present.  \nThe Non-Modal option has the advantage of ensuring that\nRetentionalist specious presents feature change and succession with\nmaximal phenomenal immediacy – important for those who subscribe\nto the Immediacy Thesis (see §3) – but it also brings a\nserious disadvantage. To bring this out, let us suppose a single\nspecious present has an apparent duration of around one second, e.g.,\nenough to encompass two brief tones ‘do-re’. Since\nRetentionalist specious presents supposedly form a close-packed\ncontinuum, over a period of (say) ten seconds of ordinary objective\nclock-time, we will be experiencing content with a subjective duration\nof vastly more than one minute. To simplify, if we suppose there are a\nhundred specious presents per objective second, in a ten second\ninterval we will enjoy experiences with an apparent duration of 1000\nseconds – enough (apparent) time to hear ‘do-re’ a\nthousand times. Non-Modal versions of Retentionalism thus suffer from\na serious problem with surplus content: they generate more\nexperience (or more phenomenal content) than it is plausible to\nsuppose actually occurs over a given interval of experiencing.  For\ndiverging views as to the seriousness of this problem see Phillips\n(2010), Lee (2014b), Dainton (2014), Pelczar (2015) and Grush\n(2016). \n\nMany Retentional theorists have eschewed the Non-Modal option in favour of\nthe Modal alternative. Since on this view only a small portion of\na single specious present is experienced as fully present, the\nproblem of surplus content is greatly diminished. The adoption of\ntemporal modes also offers a promising-looking solution the Retentional\nSimultaneity problem: by virtue of appearing under different temporal\nmodes, the contents of a single specious present will not seem\nto be simultaneous, even if this is what they are, objectively\nspeaking. As for how temporal modes are to be conceived,\nRetentional theorists have outlined a variety of proposals. \n\nIn his Examination of McTaggart’s Philosophy (1938,\nvol.2) Broad expounds an account of temporal consciousness which is\nseemingly at odds with his earlier theory (see §5.3). First\nof all, he no longer subscribes to the view that momentary acts of\nawareness (or ‘prehensions’ in the McTaggart\nterminology) are fictions: the new account is built on them. The\nsecond main change is that Broad no longer allows momentary acts to\nextend a short distance through ordinary time: he now holds that they are confined to single\nmoments. He thus trades in his previous (partial) Extensionalism\nfor a Retentional model. The third new ingredient is the property\nof presentedness. This, claims Broad, is a\n‘psychological’ (or phenomenal) feature which all\nphenomenal contents possess to some degree. Different degrees of\npresentedness are correlated with differences in apparent temporal\nlocation, with contents possessing a high intensity of presentedness\nseeming more present (or less past) than those which possess it to a\nlesser degree. On Broad’s new view, a single specious\npresent can be conceived along the lines shown in Figure 16. Figure 16.\nBroad’s later conception of the specious present. \n\nHow does the property of presentedness work? How does one\nphenomenal characteristic manage to make one or more other phenomenal\ncharacteristics appear to be less than wholly present? The\nquestion is of interest because the only obvious way of construing\n‘different degrees of presentedness’ is in terms of\ndifferent degrees of Humean force and vivacity: a memory-image of a red\nballoon could easily be described as seeming ‘less present’\nin this sense than a perceptual experience of a red balloon. But\nthus construed presentedness fails to do the job required: the upper\nparts of the specious present depicted in Figure 16 evidently possess\nless force and vivacity than those lower down, but they don’t\nseem in the least less present (in the temporal sense) as a\nresult. Since Broad is silent on this issue, he presumably takes\npresentedness to be a primitive property, whose character and mode of\nfunctioning cannot usefully be elucidated. Nonetheless, it\nremains mysterious how any phenomenal property could do the\nwork required. \n\nBrentano has rather more to say on this issue. We saw earlier\n(§2.4) that Brentano was the first to expound a Modal Retentional\nmodel in any detail, and that his views went through several\nchanges. Initially he sought to explain the difference between\npresent sensations and proteraestheses (in effect, retentions) in terms\nof different kinds of experiential objects: he held that\nproteraestheses are composed of intentionally unreal objects that are\napprehended under a ‘modifying attribute’ of a (certain\ndegree) of pastness. He came to view this as an error, in part\nbecause he believed past, present and future form a continuum, a view\nwhich is difficult to hold onto if present experiences are real, and\npast and future ones are not. In later writings he suggested that\nthe difference between the contents of an ordinary sensation and a\nproteraesthesis is to be located in the way we are aware of\nthem. He first explicated these differences in temporal modes in\nterms of differences in judgement : a represented content a is\njudged be past to a certain degree, a content b is judged to\nbe past to a greater degree, and so forth. In a further change of\nview he rejected judgements in favour of temporal modes of\npresentation: sensory objects can be apprehended as past\nto differing degrees. In his essay ‘Our intuition of Time\nis a Continuum of Modes of Presentation and Acceptance’ he\nwrites: \n\nThus in Brentano’s mature account of the Retentional specious\npresent, alterations in contents themselves – a mechanism similar\nto that proposed by Broad – have given way to alterations in the\nway contents are experienced, and these ways of experiencing\nare to be viewed as basic modes of consciousness. \n\nThis change of stance was accompanied by a further significant\nevolution in doctrine. Brentano subscribed to a two-component\nconception of consciousness: in perceiving an object, we are aware not\nonly of the object presented in perception, but also of our\nperceiving of that object. Hence in any perceptual act, e.g.\nthe hearing of a tone C, there are two ingredients: the\nprimary object of the act, the tone C, and the\nsecondary object, which in this case is the hearing\nof C. In virtue of this two-fold structure, consciousness at a\ngiven moment of time is always accompanied by a form of\nself-consciousness. But what of the diachronic case? Does\nthis mode of self-consciousness extend over time?\nBrentano’s views on this also underwent changes. On his\nearly ‘object modification’ view, he held that the primary\nobject of a proteraesthesis is an earlier act of experiencing:\ne.g., a past sensing of tone C, rather than C itself. In virtue of\nthis, we have a continuous awareness of our own conscious acts over\ntime as well as at a time, although the mechanism in the diachronic\ncase (involving primary objects) differs from that which operates in\nthe synchronic case (which relies on secondary objects). However,\nBrentano came to regard this as a mistake, and in his mature\n‘temporal mode of presentation’ account, the primary object\nof the proteraesthesis is no longer the act of sensing C, but C itself,\nalbeit presented under the mode of ‘having occurred in the\npast’. \n\nThe reasoning behind this shift in position sheds useful light on\nthe motives which move Retentional theorists. Brentano believed\nthat while we can never know with certainty that primary\nobjects of consciousness exist, we can know with certainly\nthat secondary objects exist, and are as they appear.\nAccordingly, if the secondary object of a proteraesthesis were a\njust-past act of sensing, we could know with certainty that we\nourselves, as the subject of that act, existed a few moments ago.\nBut Brentano held that we have no such knowledge: it is logically\npossible that we have only just now come into existence. By\nmaking the primary object the past tone, rather than the sensing of\nthis tone, the unwanted consequence is averted. For further\ndetail see Chisholm (1981), Albertazzi 1999 (59–65), Krauss (1976),\nMoran (1996). \n\nWe saw in §2.7 that for Husserl the specious present (or in his\nterminology, the ‘original temporal field’ or ‘living\npresent’) is a tripartite episode of experiencing consisting of\nthree ingredients: momentary primal impressions, a continuum of\nretentions (or ‘primary memories’), and forward looking\nprotentions (a distinctive kind of expectation). On the important\nquestion of the nature of retentions, Husserl’s views changed\nsignificantly over the many years during which he wrestled with these\nmatters – his notes and sketches suggest he never found an\naccount he was entirely happy with. \n\nIn the 1904–5 lectures, Husserl finds Brentano’s early account\nof time-consciousness – problematic on several counts. As\nHusserl interprets him, Brentano construed retentions as a distinctive\nkind of mental representation – or ‘phantasm’ –\nimbued with a modifying temporal attribute:\npastness. Husserl discerns a fatal tension here:\nretentional contents are presently occurring sensory items in\nconsciousness, but according to Brentano, they also supposed to be\n‘unreal’, by virtue of appearing as past. How can\nnumerically the same content be real and unreal, present and\npast? Husserl also finds it ‘most extraordinary that\nBrentano does not take into consideration the difference between the\nperception of time and the phantasy of time’ (1991: 17) In\neffect, the charge is that by building retentions out of mental images\ngenerated by the imagination, Brentano is unable to do adequate justice\nto the perceptual character of our temporal awareness –\nhere Husserl’s starting point is the realist claim that change\nand succession are seen and heard, not merely\nimagined or inferred. \n\nHusserl himself thought it appropriate to regard retentions as akin\nto memories, but memories of a distinctive or ‘primary’\nkind: ordinary memories, or recollections, he refers to as\n‘secondary memory’. Earlier, in the\nPrinciples, James had drawn a similar distinction, which he\nexplained thus: \n\nJames went on to suggest primary memories are akin to reverberations\nor after-images, that are triggered by ordinary perceptions.\nHusserl is in full agreement with James’ claim that retentions\ndiffer from ordinary memories in this respect: they are not\nre-presentations, since a retained content has never been\nabsent from consciousness. A further difference is that ordinary\nmemories are under the control of the will, whereas retentions are\nnot. However, Husserl thought it a mistake to suppose that\nretentions are remotely akin to echoes or reverberations. He\nfully accepts that echoes and the like are to be found in\nconsciousness, but they are contents of a perfectly ordinary kind\nperceptual kind: they are experiences which reveal to us what is going\non around us at the present time. Retentions, by contrast,\nalthough they exist alongside presently occurring perceptual contents,\nreveal the past. For this reason retentional consciousness is\n‘an original consciousness’ – a distinctive sui\ngeneris mode of experience, quite unlike any other: \n\nHusserl is vulnerable to the charge that he characterizes retention\nprimarily in terms of how it is different from other modes of\nconsciousness – recollection, imagination, and so forth –\nand there is some truth in this: we do not get a truly informative\naccount of how retention manages to present in the past in a\nperceptual way. In response, Husserl might reasonable point\nout that this is only to be expected, if, as he maintains, retention is\na sui generis mode of experience. \n\nIn subsequent writings Husserl experimented with several different\nways of conceiving of retentions – see Kortooms (2002) and de Warren (2009) for a full\npicture – but one development is of particular\nsignificance. In his early lectures, although it is not always\nevident from the lectures themselves, it seems that Husserl conceived\nof retentions in terms of a general conception of perceptual experience\nthat he had developed earlier, in his Logical\nInvestigations. According to this\n‘apprehension-content’ scheme, retentions – like all\nforms of perceptual consciousness – are real sensory-like\ncontents in experience, contents that are animated by an act of\napprehension, and thus seem a certain degree past. In the years\nfollowing the 1906–7 period, Husserl came to think that it was wrong to\napply the apprehension-content scheme to retentions. \n\nA normal perceptual content, such as a cloud-shaped white patch, can\nend up being perceived very differently: for example, we might see it\nas an actual cloud, or as merely part of a picture of a cloud –\nsuch cases can legitimately be viewed as instances of\n‘primary’ (sensory) contents being apprehended in different\nways. Husserl came to doubt whether temporal appearances\nof a content can vary in this sort of way: ‘The primary contents\nthat spread out in the now are not able to switch their temporal\nfunction: the now cannot stand before me as the not-now, the\nnot-now cannot stand before me as the now’ (1991: 334). He\ncontinues: ‘Can a series of coexistent primary contents\never bring a succession to intuition? Can a series of\nsimultaneous red-contents ever bring a duration of red, of a tone c,\nand the like, to intuition? Is that possible as a matter of\nprinciple?’ (1991: 335) Husserl now finds it is absurd\nto suppose that qualitatively identical contents can appear as both\nsimultaneous and successive, depending merely on how they are\napprehended. \n\nSince these difficulties arise because retentional contents are\nbeing conceived as sensory-like items, present in\nconsciousness, the solution might be to find a different way of\nthinking of retentional contents, and this is what Husserl does: \n\nOn this new view – modelled on his later understanding of\nphantasy-experience – retentions are intentional ‘through\nand through’: they do not have sensory-like content in the manner\nof properly perceptual experience. But while this may help with\nsome difficulties, it gives rise to new ones. Recalling\nHusserl’s own critique of Brentano, one might wonder whether a\nspecious present filled with purely intentional entities can\nsupply us with the properly perceptual experience of change and\nsuccession that realism demands. \n\nProviding a credible account of the character and composition of\nindividual specious presents is only the first stage in the development\nof a viable form of Retentional realism. The second stage is\nproviding a credible account of how individual specious presents\ncombine and interact to form our streams of consciousness. Here\nthere is a good deal of agreement between Retentional theorists, as\nwell as some variation. The basics of Brentano’s account\nwere presented in §2.4. For Brentano a stream of\nconsciousness simply takes the form of a dense (or gap-free) succession\nof momentary specious presents: see the diagram of hearing a melody\ndepicted in Figure 2. In his later writings Broad adopted a\nsimilar approach, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 17.\nBroad’s later account. \n\nThe bottom line represents a continuous stretch of sensory\nexperience, a continuous auditory tone, let’s suppose. This\nstretch of experience is apprehended by dense succession of momentary\nacts, represented by the full-length vertical lines. (Only a\nthree of these are shown here, in reality there would be an infinity of\nthem.) Focus first on D and the vertical line standing on it:\nD-A***. This line represents the content apprehended by the\nmomentary act occurring at D, and hence a single specious\npresent. This act’s content represents the tone segment\nA-D, but the act does not embrace the entirety of A-D itself – we\nare no longer dealing with acts of awareness which reach back to the\nrecent past. Instead, the act apprehends a content possessing\nparts which seem more and more past (or less and less present)\nas we move from D to A***. In the figure, the greater the number\nof asterisks affixed to a content, the less presentedness it\npossesses. Hence the same tone-segments occur in successive\nspecious presents with smoothly decreasing degrees of\npresentedness. If we simplify by first considering momentary\ntone-phases, the phase at A is experienced as A* in the specious\npresent at B, as A** in the specious present at C and finally as A***\nin the specious present at D. In a similar way, D is experienced\nas D* in the specious present occurring at E, and then as D** in\nspecious present occurring at F. Extended tone-segments (e.g.\nB-C) behave in the same manner, being experienced as B**-C* (at D) and\nB***-C** (at\n E).[19] \n\nBroad’s account explains how it is possible for temporally\nextended contents to be apprehended as wholes (provided they fall\nwithin the span of the specious present) and also be experienced as\nsmoothly sinking into the past. But while these are definite\nadvantages, there is a question mark over whether Broad successfully\nsecures the continuity of consciousness. Modest\nContinuity (see §3) poses him no difficulty: by virtue of being\ndense, the envisaged succession of momentary specious presents will\nconstitutes a stream of consciousness which is free from gaps.\nBut if Broad’s model is to conform to the Strong Continuity\nThesis, neighbouring stream phases must be experientially connected to\none another. In the absence of such connections – or so the\nproponents of the Strong Thesis will maintain – we do not have a\nstream of consciousness at all, merely a sequence of isolated\nmomentary stream-phases. This is an issue Broad does not\naddress. He may have assumed that a sequence of specious presents\nwhich (a) belong to the same subject, and (b) form a dense continuum,\ncannot fail to be phenomenally unified. But this does not follow,\nfor the familiar reason that a succession of experiences does not\nautomatically constitute an experience of succession. \n\nAlthough Husserl was certainly very much aware of the continuity\nissue, his account of how individual specious presents combine to form\nstreams of consciousness is, in many respects, very similar to the\npictures painted by Brentano and Broad. Husserl supplied several\ntime-diagrams to illustrate the details of his theory, several are\nalong the lines of Figure 18\n below.[20] Figure 18. \nHusserl’s time diagram. \n\nThe horizontal axis now represents a continuous flow of primal\nimpressions, the vertical axes represent a selection of retentions (and\nin the case of F) protentions which accompany the primal impressions D,\nE and F. (A ‘selection’ because in reality, according\nto Husserl, a continuous stretch of consciousness consists of a dense\ncontinuum of primal impressions, each of which is accompanied by its\n‘comet’s tail’ of retentions and\nprotentions.) As can be seen, individual primal impressions\nare retained in later specious presents – as previously,\nincreased ‘pastness’ is indicated by a greater number of\nasterisks. What goes for momentary primal impressions also goes\nfor intervals: D-E is retained at F in the form of the retentional\ncontinuum E*-D**. \n\nFrom what we have seen so far, with the exception of the\nprotentional aspect of consciousness, there are no significant\ndifferences between this Husserlian theory and Broad’s later\nmodel. But differences there are. Unlike Broad, Husserl\naddresses the Strong Continuity Thesis – albeit not in so many\nwords – and has a good deal to say about the experiential\nrelationships between neighbouring specious, relationships which (he\nbelieves) suffice to secure the kind of continuity in consciousness\nwhich actually exists. What he has to say on this topic is\ndifficult to interpret, and his views underwent changes, but they are\nby no means devoid of interest. \n\nBroad’s specious presents are complex things, containing as\nthey do continuum-many phases possessing distinct degrees of\npresentedness. In some of his writings, Husserl introduces (or\nrecognizes) an additional level of complexity. In a manner\nreminiscent of Brentano’s (early) view, according to the\nHusserlian doctrine of the ‘double intentionality’ of\nretentions, it is not only past primal impressions that are retained,\nso too are the acts of experiencing which apprehend them. Accordingly,\nat each moment we have a retentional awareness not merely of past\nperceptual objects (e.g., tone-phases), but the experiences in which\nthese objects are presented or apprehended. It is in virtue of\nthis second level or aspect of retention that consciousness manages to\nunify itself over time, or so Husserl believed. \n\nWhat does this amount to in practice? Husserl again toyed with\na variety of options, and seemed to have difficulty in reaching a\nsettled view. According to one proposal he considered, a\nretention such as E* in Figure 18 does not merely represent the\nmomentary primal impression to which it is directed, it represents (or\n‘intends’) an entire act-phase or streamal\ncross-section. In more concrete terms, the retention in question\nnot only contains a representation of E (the original primal\nimpression), it also contains representations of all the retentions and\nprotentions that were experienced with E. Since each of these\nnested retentions and protentions themselves represent entire\nact-phases, and so on ad infinitum (within the limits of the\nspecious present) we are clearly dealing here with a highly complicated\nexperiential structure. Thanks to this structure, later\nstream-phases retain a rich awareness of their immediate\npredecessors. But in other writings, Husserl envisages the\ncontinuity of consciousness being secured by a somewhat different\nmechanism: \n\nHusserl sometimes used the terms ‘horizontal-intentionality\nand ‘transverse-intentionality’ and to refer, respectively,\nto the stream-unifying and object-constituting functions of\nconsciousness. Figure 19 (which for good measure includes\nprotentions too) is an attempt to express this pictorially –\nalthough only a single retention and a single protention are\nshown here, in reality there would be a continuum of them. Figure 19. \n\nHusserl refers to the upper level – the level in which\nconsciousness unifies itself, in which consciousness is perpetually\npassively aware of itself as flowing – as ‘absolute’\ntime-consciousness. He suggests absolute consciousness (or\n‘absolute subjectivity’) is best thought of as a\nquasi-temporal process, on the grounds that our ordinary\ntemporal concepts properly apply only to objects we perceive in time,\nand not to the phenomenal processes which make such perceptions\npossible. \n\nThe introduction of absolute time-consciousness may solve one\nproblem, but another quickly appears. If absolute\ntime-consciousness is itself extended through time, and is composed of\nmomentary phases, what is it that unifies these phases? We could\nposit a further and higher stratum of consciousness, but since the same\nissue immediately arises with respect to this new level, nothing would\nbe gained. Husserl’s initial response was to hold\nthat the flow of absolute consciousness is not an ordinary temporal\nprocess: it is not something which extends or flows through time, it is\nthat within which time itself – in the form of temporal\nobjects and processes – arises and\n flows. Quite how Husserl’s doctrine of absolute consciousness should be construed has been much discussed by commentators; Hoerl (2013a) proposes – intriguingly – that it is linked to a previously overlooked Extensionalist tendency in Husserl’s \n thought.[21] \n\nIn later writings, after his discovery of the\ntranscendental-phenomenological ego, Husserl’s thought\ntook another turn. Rather than holding that streams of\nconsciousness unify themselves over (or through) time, he now claims\nthat the unifying work is carried out by the ego: \n\nAs usual, there are complications. Although in this passage\nHusserl rejects the horizontal and transverse modes of intentionality\nthat he previously held to be responsible for the creation of temporal\nunities in experience, it is not clear that he took the ego to be\nresponsible for all modes of temporal unity. There are\noccasions when he seems think the most basic forms of experience\npossess a passive ‘pre-temporal’ flow-structure prior to\nthe involvement of the ego – see Kortooms (2002: chapter 6) for\nmore on this. This complication aside, the basic picture is\nreasonably clear. As with absolute consciousness, since the ego\nis not itself a temporal object – it lies outside time, it is\nwhat creates or constitutes temporality – and so the issue of\nwhat unifies the successive phases of an ego (or an ego’s\nawareness) simply does not arise. \n\nThe gain is a substantial one, but is by no means cost-free: Husserl\nis now taking us deep into exotic metaphysical territory. And for\nthose who are prepared to follow him there, new questions arise.\nWhat precisely is the relationship between the pre-temporal ego and the\ntemporalized contents of ordinary consciousness? If an ego is\naware of change and succession among such contents, it is natural to\nsuppose that its awareness must also be temporally extended,\nphenomenally speaking. But if so, we are confronted once more\nwith the question of what unifies the successive phases of ego’s\nconsciousness: what prevents these phases being a mere succession of\nexperiencings, rather than an experiencing of succession? To\navoid this, we might hold that the ego’s awareness is timeless in\ncharacter, in the manner of Husserl’s own ‘absolute\nconsciousness’. The worry now is intelligibility: can we be\nconfident that we can really make sense of this mode of\nconsciousness? \n\nThe Retentional approach has some distinct advantages over the\nalternative forms of realism. All variants of the approach have\nthis much in common: they compress the experiencing of change into\nmomentary (or near-momentary) phases of consciousness. In virtue\nof this, Retentional models are compatible with metaphysical doctrines\nwhich require precisely this feature. The most obvious candidate\nhere is Presentism, the doctrine that what is not present is not real\n(see §7.2). In contrast, Extensional models require contents\nthat are distributed through an interval of (ordinary, objective) time\nto be experienced together, in a single unified phenomenal state.\nIt is not obvious that such models are compatible with the doctrine\nthat reality itself is confined to the momentary present.\nAccommodating the latter doctrine poses no problems whatsoever for\nRetentional models. \n\nNo less important is the Retentional theorists’ solution to\nthe problem of diachronic phenomenal unity. All forms of the\nExtensional approach stipulate that our immediate awareness is capable\nof routinely bridging a temporal interval. This could be viewed\nas admitting an unusual – and arguably undesirable – form\nof action-at-a-distance. Retentional models are free of this\nheavy commitment: the only mode of phenomenal unity such models require\nis the sort which connects contents that are both momentary and\nsimultaneous. By virtue of their conformity with PSA, Retentional\nmodels offer an appealing reduction of diachronic unity to synchronic\nunity. Again, this option is not available to Extensional\ntheorists, who are obliged to recognize two forms of phenomenal unity\nrather than just one. Further, as we saw in §2.5 and\n§5.5, there are those – e.g., Meinong – who believe\nthat incurable problems arise if we suppose phenomenal unity can extend\nover time. Though we as also saw in §5.5, the Extensional\ntheorists can, with some plausibility, argue that claims along these\nlines are question-begging. \n\nConfining the experience of change to momentary episodes of\nexperiencing may have its advantages, but it also makes for\ndifficulties of a distinctive sort. It might be objected that it\nis simply impossible for the temporal properties of experiences and\ntheir contents to diverge so dramatically: how could the latter be\ntemporally extended when the former are not? In reply, the\nRetentional theorist can point out that it is widely accepted that the\nproperties of representational vehicles, and the contents carried by\nthese vehicles, commonly diverge – although in this\ninstance there are certain significant complications (for further\ndiscussion of this issue see §7.1). Also pertinent here is\nour current level of ignorance concerning the relationship between the\nexperiential and the physical. Given that we are sure of so\nlittle in this domain, do we have any real grounds for supposing that\nit is impossible for momentary (or very brief) brain-states to generate\nexperiences which possess temporal depth on the subjective or\nphenomenal level? \n\nThe Simultaneity Problem (in its Retentional guise) may not in\nprinciple be insuperable, but in addition to establishing the bare\npossibility of objectively simultaneous contents appearing successive,\nRetentionalists should also aim to supply an intelligible and credible\naccount of how this appearance is created. Retentional theorists\nsubscribe to the doctrine of PT-realism, and so believe that change,\nsuccession and persistence figure in our immediate experience. We\nsaw in §3 that some realists also subscribe to the Immediacy\nThesis, and hold that change, and other dynamic properties,\nfeature as vividly in our experience as colour or shape. For\ndeep-seated structural reasons, Retentional models have difficulty in\naccommodating the Immediacy Thesis. If retentions have the same\nforce and vivacity as ordinary (presently occurring, first-order)\nexperience, as they do on the Non-Modal variant, there is the risk of\nflooding consciousness with enormous quantities of surplus content\n– content which we have no reason to suppose exists, as we saw in\n§6.2. It is thus not surprising to find that Retentional\ntheorists generally subscribe to the Modal form of the doctrine, and\nhold that retentions lack the force and vivacity of presently occurring\ncontents. But this option also brings a danger: if retentions are\ntoo unlike ordinary experience, there is a risk they will\nprove incapable of doing the job they are intended to do: namely, be\nthe purveyors of our immediate impressional experience of persistence,\nsuccession and change. To maintain that the dilemma is fatal to\nthe prospects of the Retentional approach would be premature. But\nBrentano and Husserl’s shifting position on the nature of\nretentions – recall the appeals to unreal objects, judgements,\nprimitive phenomenal features, additional dimensions, temporal modes of\npresentation and the like – is indicative of the difficulty of\nfinding the right balance here, or so might purveyors of alternative\nforms of realism allege. \n\nContinuity is also problematic from a Retentional perspective.\nAs we have seen, the Modest Continuity Thesis is easily\naccommodated. All the latter requires is that there be no gaps in\na typical stream of consciousness, and by stipulating that retentional\nspecious presents form dense, gap-free successions, this requirement is\neasily met. Strong Continuity requires a good deal more: real\nexperiential or phenomenal connections between neighbouring\nstream-phases. This is harder by far to achieve within a\nRetentional framework. What is needed is a credible account of\nhow neighbouring specious presents are related to one another which\npermits phenomenal continuity to run without impediment\nbetween specious presents, as well as within them – or\nso proponents of Strong Continuity will maintain. Yet the\ndefining characteristic of the Retentional approach is the confinement\nof phenomenal unity to within momentary states of consciousness, which\nis tantamount to the denial that phenomenal continuity can\nconnect earlier and later stream-phases, in the manner permitted by\nExtensional approaches. \n\nSo far as the Strong Continuity Thesis is concerned, Broad did not\naddress the objection that Retentional models atomize or fragment the\nstream of consciousness. Both he and Husserl were inclined to\nview individual specious presents as abstractions from full-blown\nstreams of consciousness, and thus incapable of leading an independent\nexistence. But if they believed taking this step suffices to\nsecure Strong Continuity they were mistaken. Rendering individual\nspecious presents dependent on their neighbours in the\nenvisaged manner certainly affects their metaphysical status, but it\ndoes not, in itself, do anything to forge phenomenal connections\nbetween such states. Husserl saw there was a real problem here,\nand at different stages of his career he ventured different\nsolutions. Early on he appealed to multiply-nested\nretentions. But arguably, these merely increase the complexity\nwithin individual momentary specious presents, without bridging the gap\nbetween specious presents. The doctrine of horizontal\nintentionality merely pushes the difficulty up a level: how precisely\ndo we have an awareness at one time of earlier acts of awareness\nwithout our awareness itself extending over time? In later\nwritings, Husserl sought to solve the problem by excluding the unifying\nagent – first in the form of absolute time-consciousness, later\nin guise of the transcendental ego – from ordinary time\naltogether. These manoeuvres may indeed solve the problem, but\nthey also leave the Retentional model reliant upon exotic and\nheavy-duty metaphysical machinery. While Strawson (2009: Part 5)\nfavours the Retentionalist conception of individual specious presents,\nhe does not see the lack of direct experiential connections between\nsuccessive stream-phases as in the least problematic; but since\nStrawson also believes that both the Modest and Strong Continuity\nTheses are false, this is not surprising. \n\nDifficulties aside, the Retentional approach in general, and\nHusserl’s work in particular, has provoked interest among neuro-\nand cognitive scientists, and like-minded philosophers. See\nthe supplementary document\n Husserl, the Brain and Cognitive Science\n for overviews and critical assessments. \n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to the Retentional\nspecious present see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues. \n\nThe word ‘red’ can represent the colour red\nwithout itself being red. If the message ‘bring the red\nflag’ is successfully transmitted by Morse code, red is\nsignified by a temporal pattern rather than a spatial pattern. To\naccommodate this sort of divergence the distinction is commonly drawn\nbetween the content and the vehicle of a\nrepresentation: the former is that which is being represented, the\nlatter is the entity which carries or bears the representation.\nIt is by no means impossible for a representational vehicle to possess\none or more of the properties that are represented by the content it carries, e.g.\nbold and black, but this is not always or necessarily\nthe case, as just seen. Experiences can represent temporal\nfeatures – a glance at a clock will reveal the time – but\nthey also themselves possess temporal features (e.g., different\nexperiences have different durations). How are the temporal\ncharacteristics that are represented in or by experiences related to\nthe temporal characteristics of the experiences themselves? In\nthe rather special case of conscious thoughts, there need be no close\ncorrespondence between content- and vehicle-properties: the thought\n‘I’ve been thinking about this for many years’ need\nonly occupy a moment or two. But what of the more basic forms of\nconsciousness, forms of the sort we have been concerned with –\npatterns in sensation, sequences of perceptual experiences, and the\nlike? As we shall see, the content-vehicle distinction impacts\nupon or intersects the issues we have been concerned with thus far in a\nnumber of interrelated ways. \n\nSystematic divergences between content- and vehicle-properties lie\nat the heart of the debate between the Extensional and Retentional\napproaches. Retentional theorists are committed to the claim that\nexperiences which present us with succession or persistence are able to\ndisguise (or conceal) their true temporal\nproperties. Why? Because the contents of individual\nspecious presents appear to be temporally extended even though the\nepisodes of experiencing that possess these same contents are\nthemselves momentary or minimally brief (as measured by clock\ntime). This amounts to a clear-cut divergence between the\ntemporal properties of the contents carried by specious presents, and\nthe specious presents themselves. \n\nThe Extensional approach carries no such implications. For on\nthis view, a typical specious present is itself temporally extended,\nand its parts succeed one another in time in just the way they seem\nto. Here vehicle and content share their temporal\nproperties. Or as Foster puts it, ‘we have to take\neach experience to extend over a period of real time in a way which\nexactly matches the phenomenal period it presents.’ (1991:\n249) However, while this precise matching may well be the norm,\nExtensional theorists will want to find room to allow the apparent (or\nsubjective) duration of an objective interval to vary: a few\nseconds spent waiting at traffic lights can seem like far\nlonger. This sort of discrepancy amount to another respect\nin which it is possible for content- and vehicle-properties to\ndiffer. (For further discussion see Section 1 of the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues.) \n\nThe viability of the Retentional approach by no means entirely\ndepends on the content/vehicle distinction, but Retentionalists can and\ndo appeal to it when trying to overcome resistance to the very idea\nthat change and succession can reside in momentary episodes of\nexperiencing. It is worth noting that in this instance there is\nan unusually close correspondence between the relevant content- and\nvehicle-properties. In the case of a Retentional specious\npresent, the relevant contents represent succession, but they\ndo so by appearing as a succession (rather than by carrying an\ninscription ‘this is a succession’). Does this mean\nthe vehicle must itself be temporally extended, so as to be able to\ninclude the apprehended succession? Not necessarily, for\nRetentional theorists can insist that we need to distinguish between\nsuccession as a purely phenomenal feature – i.e., a property of\nconscious mental states or representations – and succession as a\nproperty of physical events in the wider world. This move made,\nRetentional theorists can go on to argue that there is no reason to\nthink that phenomenal successions (and similarly for other temporal\nproperties) cannot reside within episodes of experiencing that are\nthemselves momentary. While this may well be true, it now looks\nvery much as though it is the phenomenal/physical distinction that is\ndoing the real work, rather than the content/vehicle distinction. \n\nThe latter distinction has entered recent debates by another\nroute. The school of contemporary\n‘representationalists’ – e.g., Dretske, Harman and\nTye – hold that otherwise intractable-seeming problems can be\nsidestepped by drawing on the distinction between vehicles and\ncontents. From the fact that the content of our experience is\n‘red object over there’ or somesuch, we should not conclude\nthat the vehicle of this content is itself red. In a\nmore general vein, experiences of colour are not themselves coloured,\nexperiences of sound are not themselves sonic. In this manner,\nthe problematic phenomenal properties – or sense-data, or\nqualia-instantiations – retreat from the scene. They are\npushed still further away by the second main plank of the\nrepresentationalist’s approach: an insistence on the\n‘transparency’ of experience. By this they mean that\nin ordinary perceptual experience, we have no awareness whatsoever of\nour experiences themselves, we are simply aware of the (worldly)\nobjects and properties that are presented in or by our\nexperiences. If our experiences are invisible, there is no need\nto introduce properties of experience – phenomenal\nproperties, qualia, sense-data and such – in order to explain the\ncontent and character of our ordinary perceptual consciousness.\nExtending this general approach to the particular case of temporal\nconsciousness, Tye argues as follows. First of all, if we assume\nthe transparency thesis is true, the traditional assumption that it is\nexperiences that are related by succession or simultaneity is\nmisguided: \n\nAccordingly, Tye holds that anyone seeking to account for our\nability to directly apprehend change by appealing to a unifying\nrelationship between experiences is also misguided: there simply\naren’t the token experiences there to be unified; a\ngiven period or stretch of consciousness is not composed of successive\nperceptions or experiences (203: 102). By way of an alternative\nhe offers a one experience view of streams of consciousness:\n‘The simplest hypothesis compatible with what is revealed by\nintrospection is that, for each period of consciousness, there is only\na single experience – an experience that represents everything\nexperienced within the period of consciousness as a whole.’\n(2003: 97) As for the manner in which succession itself is\nrepresented in the vehicles of phenomenal content, since\nintrospection provides us with no access to these vehicles, Tye leaves\nthe issue entirely open. \n\nWhether or not experiences can be eliminated in this manner is\ncontroversial, but in any event the direct awareness of change and\npersistence is alive and well in Tye’s scheme, it has simply been\nre-located and re-described. Tye himself sees the need to\ndistinguish between direct and indirect phenomenal\nunity. Direct unity obtains when the qualities represented\nin one specious present are experienced as succeeding on from qualities\nin the immediately preceding specious present; indirect unity is the\nancestral of direct unity, and obtains when qualities experienced in\nnon-adjacent specious presents are connected by chains of direct\nphenomenal unity (2003: 100). This general picture is close to\nthe orthodox one, at least to the extent that some experienced\nqualities in a stream of consciousness are experienced as successive,\nwhile others – farther apart in time – are not. Of\ncourse, those who adhere to the orthodox representational theory,\naccording to which the immediate objects and properties of experience\nare phenomenal – and Russell, Broad and Foster all fall into this\ncategory – will see no need to adopt Tye’s way of\nre-conceiving diachronic phenomenal\n unity.[22] \n\nReturning to the main theme, it is by no means necessary to be a\nsense-datum theorist in order to believe that there are systematic\ncorrelations between the temporal properties of experiences and their\ncontents. If my clock goes TICK-TICK-TICK I will hear\nTICK-TICK-TICK, with the order and temporal separation of the outer\nevents being mirrored – in a generally faithful manner – by\nthe order and temporal separation of my experiences (or the contents\nthey are carrying). Or so it seems plausible to suppose: as\nexternal events occur they are detected (after some delay) by our\nsensory organs, and when the resulting signals reach the brain they\ntrigger experiences, with the order of the experiences (or their\ncontents) reflecting the order of the relevant events. \n\nThis mirroring of basic temporal features has given rise to the idea\nthat, in a manner of speaking, time represents\nitself. Mellor starts from the premise that seeing\ne precede e* requires one to have a memory-trace of\nseeing e while actually perceiving e*. Since\nmemory is a causal process, and causes precede their effects, it is\nonly possible to perceive that e precedes e* if\none’s perception of e occurs before one’s\nperception of e*. Hence Mellor’s conclusion: \n\nThe general point is not new, and it applies to directly experienced\nsuccessions, as well as the memory-based ‘seeing’ of\nsuccessions that Mellor describes. James quotes Helmholtz, who\nmaintained that the only case in which \n\nThe picture painted by Helmholz is plausible and appealing. If\nthe pianist plays the note D followed by F followed by G, the\npianist’s audience will have a succession of specious presents in\nwhich D is experienced as giving way to F, which in turn gives way to\nG. Needless to say, the details of the process differ\ndepending on the particular form of realism: the tales told by\nCinematic and Extensional theorists is relatively straightforward,\nwhile matters are rather more convoluted in the case of Retentional\nmodels. \n\nThere are, inevitably, complications. In the broad run of\ncases the temporal relationships between and within our perceptual\nexperiences may accurately reflect the temporal relationships between\nthe events we perceive, but this is by no means always or necessarily\nthe case. If I were to see a star explode whilst hearing a clap\nof thunder (a remote coincidence, admittedly, but by no means an\nimpossible one), I would be mistaken to conclude that these two events\nwere in fact simultaneous. Since the light from the star has\ntaken years to reach me, whereas the sound from the thunder has been\ndelayed by only a few seconds, my experience is presenting as\nsimultaneous events that are non-simultaneous. There are\nfurther complications on the micro-temporal scale. It is possible\nfor quite striking ordering discrepancies to arise on shorter\ntime-scales – i.e., of few tenths of a second, with stimuli\nmeasured in a few tens of milliseconds. In the case of the\n‘flash-lag illusion’, for example, stimuli which are in\nfact simultaneous appear as successive (for more on this see\nSection 3 of the supplementary documents\n Husserl, the Brain and Cognitive Science\n and the supplementary document\n Interpreting Temporal Illusions). \n\nDennett makes much of these phenomena, arguing that on the\nmicro-temporal scale there need be no correspondence between\nthe order in which we represent events as occurring and the order in\nwhich these events impinge on our perceptual systems: ‘what\nmatters is that the brain can proceed to control events “under\nthe assumption that A happened before B” whether or not the\ninformation that A has happened enters the relevant system of the brain\nand gets recognized as such before or after the information that B has\nhappened.’ (1991: \n 149)[23]\nAlso, over short intervals it is\npossible for the brain’s interpretation of what happens at a\ngiven time to be revised or ‘re-written’ in the light of\nsubsequent information. Dennett goes on to argue that there is\noften no fact of the matter concerning the precise time at which\ninformational vehicles become conscious – hence his preference\nfor talking in terms of ‘informational vehicles’ as opposed\nto ‘experiences’. There is also no fact of the matter\nas to which information vehicles are conscious independently of which\n‘probes’ or queries are carried out. For Dennett, the\nassumption that anything akin to the Jamesian stream of consciousness\nexists is mistaken. These doctrines are important parts of his\n‘multiple-drafts’ theory of consciousness, which we will be\nlooking at in more detail in §7.3. \n\nIn arguing for these striking conclusions Dennett relies only in\npart on a variety of puzzling phenomena (‘temporal\nillusions’) discovered by psychologists investigating our\nperceptual abilities over short time scales. He also places\nconsiderable weight on the general distinction between\ncontent-properties and vehicle-properties, insisting frequently on the\ndangers of confusing them, or supposing that representations need share\nthe properties represented in their contents. Phillips forcefully\ntakes Dennett to task for failing to recognize that the temporal case\nis different and distinctive in this regard: \n\nReturning to Helmholtz’s claim, when in the\nPrinciples James remarked of it ‘This philosophy is\nunfortunately too crude’ (1890: 628) he was not concerned with\nthe sort of counterexamples we have just been considering. James\nwas making a far more general point: Even though we were to conceive the outer successions as\nforces stamping their image on the brain, and the brain’s\nsuccessions as forces stamping their image on the mind, still, between\nthe mind’s own changes being successive, and knowing\ntheir own succession, lies as broad a chasm as between the object\nand subject of any case of cognition in the world. A\nsuccession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling of\nsuccession. … what is past, to be known as past, must be\nknown with what is present, and during the\n‘present’ spot of time. (1890: 628–9) \n\nJames here berates Helmholtz for failing to recognize that a mere\nsuccession of experiences does not add up to an experience of\nsuccession, and then goes on to endorse a Retentional account of where\nthe difference between the two lies: the earlier and later parts of a\nsuccession must be experienced together and simultaneously in\norder to be experienced as a succession. And for the reasons\nalready outlined, this means James himself was committed – to the\nextent he was a Retentionalist – to a quite systematic\ndivergence between the temporal properties of experiential contents and\nthe temporal properties of experiences. For more on James’\nviews on the specious present, see Section 3 of the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues. \n\nJust as there are different conceptions of the nature of temporal\nawareness, there are very different conceptions of the nature and\nlarge-scale structure and composition of time itself (i.e., the time of\nthe universe as a whole). Can we hope to learn anything about the\nnature of our experience of time from theories about time per\nse? This is a complex issue, and this is not the place for a\nthorough investigation of it. Nonetheless, even a cursory look at\nthe lay of the land reveals a few points that are worth noting. \n\nMost of the connections between the metaphysics and the\nphenomenology of time involve, in one way or another, temporal\npassage. The latter can be characterized in a number of\nways, but at the very least passage is associated with the steady\nadvance of the present, an advance which entails that future times will\nbecome present, that present times and events will become past, and\nthat past times become every more past with every passing\nmoment. But while few deny that time seems to pass – and\nindeed, that this passage is (along with dimensionality) the most\nobvious difference between time and space – there are many who\nhave denied that time really does pass. Of these a few\nshare McTaggart’s view that time cannot pass because time does\nnot exist. A more popular view, these days at least, is the view\nthat while time certainly exists, it is more akin to space than it\nsuperficially seems. Proponents of the four-dimensional\n‘Block’ universe – also known as eternalism\n– hold that there is no ontological distinction between past,\npresent and future, and that all times are equally real. They\nfurther hold that there is no unique privileged present time, and a\nfortiori that there is no such thing as a moving\n present.[24]\nBlock theorists face a significant\nchallenge: Why does time seem to pass if it doesn’t? Part\nof the explanation lies in the way our memories accumulate.\nAnother part of the explanation lies in the character of our\nexperience. Time per se may not pass or flow, but there\nis undeniably something akin to passage and flow in our immediate\nexperience, and this phenomenal passage does not require\nphysical passage, it can exist a four-dimensional Block\nuniverse. Or so proponents of the latter maintain. \n\nThe Block conception of time has its advantages. It has an\nappealing simplicity, and accords well with Einstein’s relativity\ntheories, to mention but two. But the rejection of objective\ntemporal passage is not to everyone’s taste, and other\nconceptions of time also have their advocates. The main\ncontenders are depicted in Figure 20 below. Figure 20.\nFour conceptions of the large-scale composition of the universe. \n\nAt the opposite extreme to the 4-D Block view is\nPresentism, the doctrine that concrete reality is confined to\nthe momentary present. Presentists deny any reality to the past\nor future. Coming in between these extremes is the Growing\nBlock model. According to the latter, the past is real but\nthe future is not, and the sum total of reality is gradually\nincreasing, by a process of moment-by-moment ‘absolute\nbecoming’. On this view the present is merely the most\nrecent addition to reality; it is also the interface between being and\nnon-being. The Moving Spotlight model is in one respect\nakin to the standard Block model: it accords reality to all times and\nevents, including those yet to occur. It differs from the latter\nby virtue of the fact that it incorporates objective passage into the\nuniverse, in the shape of a privileged (and constantly advancing)\npresent – indicated by the blue line in Figure 20.\nMoving Spotlight theorists agree with Block theorists that both the\nfuture and the past exist, but they tend to hold that present events\nare (in some manner)\n distinctive.[25] \n\nHow do these different conceptions of time accord with our competing\nrealist accounts of temporal consciousness? One point is more\nobvious that most. If reality is confined to a momentary present\nin the way Presentists maintain, then it is difficult to see how any\nform of the Extensional approach can be true. Our immediate\nexperience cannot extend through time if time itself has no extension; if earlier and later stream-phases are experienced\ntogether, in the way Extensional models require, then it seems very\nplausible to suppose that these phases must both exist. (Or to\nput it another way: an experience which no longer figures in the sum\ntotal of reality is not in a position to be part of the same unified\nstate of consciousness as an experience which does so figure,\nany more than a non-existent brick can help hold up a wall.) By\ncontrast, since Retentional theorists hold that our experience of time\ntakes no time – objectively speaking – their\nposition looks to be entirely compatible with Presentism, and similarly\nfor the Cinematic models (realist and non-realist).\n [26] \n\nIs that the end of the story? Not necessarily, for the\nExtensional approach is perfectly compatible with version of Presentism\nwhich grant to the present a brief duration. It is only\nPresentism of the strictest form which is irreconcilable with the\nExtensional approach – for further discussion of this issue see\nDainton (2001: ch.6 and §7.8, also forthcoming) and McKinnon\n(2003: §10). The same manoeuvre will be necessary to secure\nthe compatibility of Extensional models with the Moving Spotlight\nconception of passage. The latter is most plausible when the\nexistence of consciousness is confined to the present, so a strictly\nmomentary Spotlight is problematic for the Extensional approach.\nIt is otherwise for a Spotlight which possesses some brief\nduration. \n\nAs for the 4-D Block conception, it looks equally compatible with\nboth views of phenomenal temporality. The Retentional\ntheorists’ momentary specious presents can exist in universes of\nthis sort, as can those of Cinematic theorists, but so too can the\nnon-momentary specious presents to be found in Extensional\nmodels. \n\nBut perhaps the situation is not quite so straightforward.\nSomeone might object: ‘There cannot be an experience of\nsuccession without genuine succession, and the latter consists\nof the coming into being of successive phases of a stream of\nconsciousness.’ If this view could be shown to be correct,\nthe Growing Block theorist would have the upper hand.\nFor if reality as a whole comes into being, drop by drop (or slice by\nslice), then so too does experience, and the experience of succession\nwould thereby be possible. Of course, the viability of this line\nof argument depends on the initial premise: does the experience of\nsuccession require absolute becoming? Retentionalists will reject\nthis entirely, holding as they do that experienced succession occurs\nwithin momentary slices of consciousness.\nExtensionalists can also question the premise. If the Extensional\nconception of Jamesian ‘duration-blocks’ expounded earlier\nwere along the right lines, then experienced succession would be an\nintrinsic phenomenal feature of temporally extended experiences, and as\nsuch would not require the successive coming-into-being of experiential\nphases. Also, the earlier and later phases of a duration-block\nare experienced together (they are diachronically\nco-conscious), and it is by no means obvious that this relationship\nrequires absolute becoming; indeed, it is more naturally construed as a\nconnection between experiential phases which exist at\nneighbouring\n times.[27] \n\nThere is obviously more work to be done here, and for further\ndiscussion see Baron (forthcoming),  Callender (2008), Deng (2013a, 2013b), Dainton (2011, 2016), Frischut (2015), Ismael (2015), Paul (2014), Power (2015) and Prosser (2016). But it doesn’t look as though there are many straightforward or simple\nanswers to the question: ‘What do the differing conceptions of\nthe nature of time imply about the nature of temporal\nawareness?’ \n\nPT-realists hold that Reid drew the line between sense and memory in\nthe wrong place: our immediate experience is not confined to an\ninstantaneous present, it extends a short way through time, with\nCinematic theorists, Retentionalists and Extensionalists offering very\ndifferent accounts of how this is possible. For Dennett, the\ndebate has been conducted on false premises, for in some cases at\nleast, there is no sharp dividing line between memory and experience,\nand the project of trying to ascertain the temporal microstructure of\nconsciousness is misconceived. In support of this claim Dennett\ndeploys a range of intriguing examples – including the cutaneous\nrabbit and the colour phi phenomenon (see Section 3 of the supplementary \ndocuments\n Husserl, the Brain and Cognitive Science\n and\n supplementary document\n Interpreting Temporal Illusions)\n – but the main line of argument can be brought out with\none of his simplest. (For the full case see Dennett (1991: chapters\n5–6, and also Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992). \n\nIn cases of so-called ‘backward masking’, if two stimuli\nare presented in rapid succession, most subjects will be able to\nidentify the second (and later) stimulus far more reliably than the\nfirst. In the particular experiment Dennett describes, the target\nstimulus is a solid disk, shown for 30 msec, and the mask – shown\nimmediately afterwards – is a larger surrounding circle.\nAlthough subjects are shown both images, when queried they report that\nthey saw just one: the circle. The standard interpretation of\nthis sort of experiment, according to Dennett, is that in such cases\nthe subject do not experience the target stimulus: they have\nno visual experience of the disk, the occurrence of the masking\nstimulus somehow interferes with the normal perceptual process.\nHowever, as he also notes, there is a second possible interpretation of\nthe subject’s responses. Perhaps the subjects\ndo experience the disk, but something interferes with their\nmemory of this experience, and so when subsequently queried they deny\nhaving seen it. Dennett labels the first mechanism\nStalinesque: since the experiences our perceptual systems\nproduce do not accurately reflect the stimuli, there is a sense in\nwhich they are putting on a false and misleading display, in a manner\n(somewhat) reminiscent of Stalin’s show-trials. He calls\nthe second mechanism Orwellian: a false and misleading version\nof recent events is being created by the subjects’ memories, and\nso history is being rewritten, in a manner (somewhat) reminiscent of\nOrwell’s 1984. \n\nDennett is right that the evidence thus far presented can be\ninterpreted in each of these ways, but what should we make of\nthis? The natural response would be to hold that in the absence\nof any further plausible interpretations of the evidence, then either\nthe Stalinesque or the Orwellian version of events must be true: if the\nlatter, then the subjects do experience the disk, if the former they\ndon’t. Dennett maintains that this line of thinking is\nmistaken. In the case described, and others like it,\nneither interpretation is correct, there is simply no fact of\nthe matter as to whether or not the subject’s experience the disk\nor not: ‘the distinction between perceptual revisions and memory\nrevisions that works so crisply at other scales is not guaranteed\napplication … The boundary between perception and memory, like\nmost boundaries, is not perfectly sharp’ (Dennett and Kinsbourne,\n1992: §2.2). The assumption that there must be a\ndeterminate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to the\nquestion of whether or not the subject saw the disk is grounded, he\nargues, in an appealing but mistaken neo-Cartesian conception of\nexperience. According to this conception, for any given subject\nduring their waking hours the question ‘What is currently\nappearing on the stage of your consciousness?’ always has a fully\nprecise answer, an answer determined by the experiential contents\npresent in the relevant subject’s consciousness. In place\nof this conception he offers his ‘Multiple Drafts’ model.\nThe latter is not easily summarized, but it replaces the familiar\nJamesian stream of consciousness with a multiplicity of\n‘informational vehicles’, and tightly connects the correct\nascription of experiences to subjects to what they say and do, and\nhence what they remember: ‘We might classify the Multiple Drafts\nmodel then as first-person operationalism, for it brusquely\ndenies the possibility in principle of consciousness of a stimulus in\nthe absence of that subject’s belief in that consciousness’\n(1991: 132). \n\nDennett’s position is open to criticism on two main\nfronts. He asserts that there is no possibility that future\nresearch will uncover evidence that will allow us to distinguish\nbetween Orwellian and Stalinesque interpretations. How can he be\nso confident about what the future will bring? Second-guessing\nscientific progress is a dangerous game. His argument also has a\nverificationist slant, relying as it does on the principle that if\nthere is no possible evidence that P obtains, there is no fact\nof the matter as to whether or not P obtains. When\napplied to ordinary material objects this principle has\ncounterintuitive consequences. Suppose there is a box that cannot\nbe opened, or probed by X-rays, ultrasound or any similar method.\nDoes the fact that we will never be in a position to discover what is\ninside the box mean there is no fact of the matter about its contents,\nabout whether it contains something or nothing at all? Dennett\nhimself agrees that verificationism is objectionable in this sort of\ncase, but insists that it is legitimate when it comes to\nquestions concerning the existence (or non-existence) of\nexperiences. Those who are inclined to a robust realism about the\nphenomenal realm will certainly find this downgrading of the\nontological credentials of conscious experiences objectionable.\nFor this reason they are likely to find Dennett’s attempt to\nfurther downgrade these credentials by appealing to features of\nshort-term experience guilty of begging the\n question.[28]","contact.mail":"bdainton@liverpool.ac.uk","contact.domain":"liverpool.ac.uk"}]
