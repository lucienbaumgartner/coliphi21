However, soon after the\nannouncement of her birth in February 1997 (Wilmut et al.,\n1997) she caused panic and controversy. An important, and for many\npeople troubling question arose: if the cloning of sheep is possible,\nwill scientists soon start cloning humans as well; and if they did,\nwould this be wrong or unwise?\n\n\n\nFor most people, Dolly was really a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\nShe represented a first undesirable and dangerous step to applying\nreproductive cloning in humans, something that many agreed should never\nbe done. Only a small minority thought it was permissible, or even\nmorally obligatory to conduct further research into human reproductive\ncloning. Some had no strong objections to it, but did not see any\nreason to promote it either.\n\n\n\nDolly is now stuffed and set up for display in the National Museum\nof Scotland. Many countries or jurisdictions have legally banned human\ncloning or are in the process of doing so. In some countries, including\nFrance and Singapore, reproductive cloning of humans is a criminal\noffence. In 2005, the United Nations adopted a ‘Declaration on\nHuman Cloning’, which calls for a universal ban on human cloning.\nThe debate on human reproductive cloning seems to have drawn to a\nclose. However, since reproductive cloning of mammals has\nbecome routine in several countries, there is reason to believe that at\nsome point in the future, humans will be cloned too. Moreover, even if\nreproductive cloning will not be possible in the near future,\ncloning for research and therapeutic purposes is likely to be.\n\n\n\nThis entry describes the most important areas of disagreement\nregarding the ethics of cloning. I will focus on human cloning (as\nopposed to animal cloning), since human cloning has been the focus of\nthe cloning debate.\n\nStrictly speaking, cloning is the creation of a genetic\ncopy of a sequence of DNA or of the entire genome of an organism. In\nthe latter sense, cloning occurs naturally in the birth of identical\ntwins and other multiples. But cloning can also be done artificially in\nthe laboratory via embryo twinning or splitting: an early embryo is\nsplit in vitro so that both parts, when transferred to a\nuterus, can develop into individual organisms genetically identical to\neach other. In the cloning debate, however, the term\n‘cloning’ typically refers to a technique called somatic\ncell nuclear transfer (SCNT). SCNT involves transferring the nucleus of\na somatic cell into an oocyte from which the nucleus and thus most of\nthe DNA has been removed. (The mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm is\nstill present). The manipulated oocyte is then treated with an electric\ncurrent in order to stimulate cell division, resulting in the formation\nof an embryo. The embryo is (virtually) genetically identical to, and\nthus a clone of the somatic cell donor. Dolly was the first mammal to be brought into the world\nusing SCNT. Wilmut and his team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland\nreplaced the nucleus from an oocyte taken from a Blackface ewe with the\nnucleus of a cell from the mammary gland of a six-year old Finn Dorset\nsheep (these sheep have a white face). They transferred the resulting\nembryo into the uterus of a surrogate ewe and approximately five months\nlater Dolly was born. Dolly had a white face: she was genetically\nidentical to the Finn Dorset ewe from which the somatic cell had been\nobtained. Dolly, however, was not 100% genetically identical to the\ndonor animal. Genetic material comes from two sources: the nucleus and\nthe mitochondria of a cell. Mitochondria are organelles that serve as\npower sources to the cell. They contain short segments of DNA. In\nDolly’s case, her nuclear DNA was the same as the donor\nanimal; other of her genetic materials came from the mitochondria in\nthe cytoplasm of the enucleated oocyte. For the clone and the donor\nanimal to be exact genetic copies, the oocyte too would have to come\nfrom the donor animal (or from the same maternal line –\nmitochondria are passed on by oocytes). Dolly’s birth was a real breakthrough, for it proved\nthat something that had been considered biologically impossible could\nindeed be done. Before Dolly, scientists thought that cell\ndifferentiation was irreversible: they believed that, once a cell has\ndifferentiated into a specialized body cell, such as a skin or liver\ncell, the process cannot be reversed. What Dolly demonstrated was that\nit is possible to take a differentiated cell, turn back its biological\nclock, and make the cell behave as though it was a recently fertilized\negg. Nuclear transfer can also be done using a donor cell from\nan embryo instead of from an organism after birth. Cloning mammals\nusing embryonic cells has been successful since the mid-1980s (for a\nhistory of cloning, see Wilmut et al. 2001). Another\ntechnique to produce genetically identical offspring or clones is\nembryo twinning or embryo splitting, in which an early embryo is split\nin vitro so that both parts, when implanted in the uterus, can\ndevelop into individual organisms genetically identical to each other.\nThis process occurs naturally with identical twins. However, what many people find disturbing is the idea of creating a\ngenetic duplicate of an existing person, or a person who has\nexisted. That is why the potential application of SCNT in humans set\noff a storm of controversy. Another way to produce a genetic duplicate\nfrom an existing person is by cryopreserving one of two genetically\nidentical embryos created in vitro for several years or\ndecades before using it to generate a pregnancy. Lastly, reproductive\ncloning of humans could, in theory, also be achieved by combining the\ninduced pluripotent stem cell technique with tetraploid\ncomplementation. Several research teams have succeeded in cloning mice\nthis way (see, for example, Boland et al. 2009). The technique\ninvolves injecting mouse iPS cells in tetraploid embryos, i.e. embryos\nwith twice the normal number of chromosomes that cannot result in live\noffspring. The resulting mouse pups are derived solely from the iPS\ncells, which means that the tetraploid embryos only acted as a\nsubstitute trophectoderm, which forms the placenta and other\nnourishing membranes but which does not contribute to the ‘embryo\nproper’. Dolly is a case of reproductive cloning, the aim of which\nis to create offspring. Reproductive cloning is to be distinguished\nfrom cloning for therapy and research, sometimes also referred to as\n‘therapeutic cloning’. Both reproductive cloning and\ncloning for research and therapy involve SCNT, but their aims, as well\nas most of the ethical concerns they raise, differ. I will first\ndiscuss cloning for research and therapy and will then proceed to\noutline the ethical debate surrounding reproductive\ncloning. \n\nCloning for research and therapy involves the creation of an embryo\nvia SCNT, but instead of transferring the cloned embryo to the uterus\nin order to generate a pregnancy, it is used to obtain pluripotent stem\ncells. It is thus not the intention to use the embryo for reproductive\npurposes. Embryonic stem cells offer powerful tools for developing\ntherapies for currently incurable diseases and conditions, for\nimportant biomedical research, and for drug discovery and toxicity\ntesting (Cervera & Stojkovic 2007). For example, one\ntherapeutic approach is to induce embryonic stem cells to differentiate\ninto cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) to repair or replace damaged\nheart tissue, into insulin-producing cells to treat diabetes, or into\nneurons and their supporting tissues to repair spinal cord\ninjuries. \n\nA potential problem with embryonic stem cells is that they will\nnormally not be genetically identical to the patient.\nEmbryonic stem cells are typically derived from embryos donated for\nresearch after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Because\nthese stem cells would have a genetic identity different from that of\nthe recipient – the patient – they may, when used in\ntherapy, be rejected by her immune system. Immunorejection can occur\nwhen the recipient’s body does not recognize the transplanted\ncells, tissues or organs as its own and as a defense mechanism attempts\nto destroy the graft. Another type of immunorejection involves a\ncondition called graft-versus-host disease, in which immune cells\ncontaminating the graft recognize the new host – the patient\n– as foreign and attack the host’s tissues and organs. Both types\nof immunorejection can result in loss of the graft or death of the\npatient. It is one of the most serious problems faced in transplant\nsurgery. \n\nCloning for research and therapy could potentially offer a solution to this\nproblem. An embryo produced via SNCT using the patient’s somatic\ncell as a donor cell would be virtually genetically identical to the\npatient. Stem cells obtained from that embryo would thus also be\ngenetically identical to the patient, as would be their derivatives,\nand would be less likely to be rejected after transplantation. Though\ntherapies using embryonic stem cells from SCNT embryos are not yet on\nthe horizon for humans, scientists have provided proof of concept for\nthese therapies in the mouse. \n\nEmbryonic stem cells from cloned embryos would also have significant\nadvantages for biomedical research, and for drug discovery and toxicity\ntesting. Embryonic stem cells genetically identical to the patient\ncould provide valuable in vitro models to study disease,\nespecially where animal models are not available, where the research\ncannot be done in patients themselves because it would be too invasive,\nor where there are too few patients to work with (as in the case of\nrare genetic diseases). Researchers could, for example, create large\nnumbers of embryonic stem cells genetically identical to the patient\nand then experiment on these in order to understand the particular\nfeatures of the disease in that person. The embryonic stem cells and\ntheir derivatives could also be used to test potential treatments. They\ncould, for example, be used to test candidate drug therapies to predict\ntheir likely toxicity. This would avoid dangerous exposure of patients\nto sometimes highly experimental drugs. \n\nCloning for research and therapy is, however, still in its infancy\nstages. In 2011, a team of scientists from the New York Stem Cell\nFoundation Laboratory was the first to have succeeded in creating two\nembryonic stem cell lines from human embryos produced through SCNT\n(Noggle et al. 2011). Three years earlier, a small San Diego\nbiotechnological company created human embryos (at the blastocyst\nstage) via SCNT but did not succeed in deriving embryonic stem cells\nfrom these cells (French et al. 2008). Cloning for research and\ntherapy is thus not likely to bear fruit in the short term though\nprogress is made (Tachibana et al. 2013).  Apart from unsolved\ntechnical difficulties, much more basic research in embryonic stem\ncell research is needed. The term ‘therapeutic cloning’\nhas been criticized precisely for this reason. It suggests that\ntherapy using embryonic stem cells from cloned embryos is already\nreality. In the phase before clinical trials, critics say, it is only\nreasonable to refer to research on nuclear transfer as ‘research\ncloning’ or ‘cloning for biomedical research’ (PCBE,\n2002). \n\nCloning for research and therapy holds great potential for future\nresearch and therapeutic applications, but it also raises various ethical\nconcerns. \n\nMuch of the debate about the ethics of cloning for research and\ntherapy turns on a basic disagreement about how we should treat early\nhuman embryos. As it is currently done, the isolation of embryonic\nstem cells involves the destruction of embryos at the blastocyst stage\n(day five after fertilization, when the embryo consists of\n125–225 cells). But cloning for research and therapy not only\ninvolves the destruction of embryos, it also involves the creation of\nembryos solely for the purpose of stem cell derivation.\nViews on whether and when it is permissible to create embryos solely\nto obtain stem cells differ profoundly. \n\nSome believe that an embryo, from the moment of conception, has the\nsame moral status, that is, the same set of basic moral rights, claims\nor interests as an ordinary adult human being. This view is sometimes\nexpressed by saying that the early embryo is a person. On this view,\ncreating and killing embryos for stem cells is a serious moral\nwrong. It is impermissible, even if it could save many lives (Deckers\n2007). Others believe that the early embryo is merely a cluster of\ncells or human tissue lacking any moral status. A common view among\nthose who hold this position is that, given its promising potential,\nembryonic stem cell and cloning research is a moral imperative\n(Devolder & Savulescu 2006). Many defend a view somewhere in\nbetween these opposing positions. They believe, for example, that the\nearly embryo should be treated with respect because it has an\nintermediate moral status: a moral status lower than that of a person\nbut higher than that of an ordinary body cell. A popular view amongst\nthose who hold this position is that using embryos for research might\nsometimes be justified. Respect can be demonstrated, it is typically\nargued, by using embryos only for very important research that cannot\nbe done using less controversial means, and by acknowledging the use\nof embryos for research with a sense of regret or loss (Robertson\n1995; Steinbock 2001). One common view among those who hold the\nintermediate moral status view is that the use of discarded IVF\nembryos to obtain stem cells is compatible with the respect we owe to\nthe embryo, whereas the creation and use of cloned embryos is not. An\nargument underlying this view is that, unlike IVF embryos, cloned\nembryos are created for instrumental use only; they are created and\ntreated as a mere means, which some regard as incompatible with\nrespectful treatment of the embryo (NBAC 1999). Others (both\nproponents and opponents of embryo research) have denied that there is\na significant moral difference between using discarded IVF embryos and\ncloned embryos as a source of stem cells. They have argued\nthat if killing embryos for research is wrong, it is wrong\nregardless of the embryo’s origin (Doerflinger 1999; Fitzpatrick\n2003; Devolder 2005, 2015). Douglas and Savulescu (2009) have argued\nthat it is permissible to destroy ‘unwanted’ embryos in\nresearch, that is, embryos that no one wishes to use for reproductive\npurposes. Since both discarded IVF embryos and cloned embryos created\nfor the purpose of stem cell derivation are unwanted embryos in that\nsense, it is, on their view, permissible to use both types of embryos\nfor research. \n\nA less common view holds that obtaining stem cells from cloned embryos\nposes fewer ethical problems than obtaining stem cells from\ndiscarded IVF embryos. Hansen (2002) has advanced this view, arguing\nthat embryos resulting from SCNT do not have the same moral status we\nnormally accord to other embryos: he calls the combination of a\nsomatic nucleus and an enucleated egg a “transnuclear\negg”, which, he says, is a mere “artifact” with no\n“natural purpose” or potential “to evolve into an\nembryo and eventually a human being,” and therefore falls\noutside the category of human beings. McHugh (2004) and Kiessling\n(2001) advance a similar argument. On their view, obtaining stem cells\nfrom cloned embryos is less morally problematic because embryos\nresulting from SCNT cannot (yet) develop further, and are thus better\nthought of as tissue culture, whereas IVF represents instrumental\nsupport for human reproduction. Since creating offspring is not the\ngoal, they argue, it is misleading to use the term\n‘embryo’ or ‘zygote’ to refer to the product\nof SCNT. They suggest to instead use the terms ‘clonote’\n(Mc Hugh) and ‘ovasome’ (Kiessling). \n\nCloning for research and therapy requires a large number of high-quality donor\noocytes. Ethical issues arise regarding how these oocytes could be\nobtained. Oocyte donation involves various risks and discomforts (for a\nreview of the risks, see Committee on Assessing the Medical Risks of\nHuman Oocyte Donation for Stem Cell Research, 2007). Among the\nmost pressing ethical issues raised by participating in such donation is what\nmodel of informed consent should be applied. Unlike women who are\nconsidering IVF, non-medical oocyte donors are not clinical patients.\nThey do not stand to derive any reproductive or medical benefit\nthemselves from the donation (though Kalfoglou & Gittelsohn,\n2000, argue that they may derive a psychological benefit). Magnus and\nCho (2005) have argued that donating women should not be classified as\nresearch subjects since, unlike in other research, the risks to the\ndonor do not lie in the research itself but in the procurement of the\nmaterials required for the research. They suggest that a new category\nnamed ‘research donors’ be created for those who expose\nthemselves to substantial risk only for the benefit of others (in this\ncase unidentifiable people in the future) and where the risk is\nincurred not in the actual research but in the procurement of the\nmaterials for the research. Informed consent for altruistic organ\ndonation by living donors to strangers has also been suggested as a\nmodel, since, in both cases, the benefits will be for strangers and not\nfor the donor. Critics of this latter suggestion have pointed out,\nhowever, that there is a disanalogy between these two types of\ndonation. The general ethical rule reflected in regulations concerning\naltruistic donation, namely that there must be a high chance of a good\noutcome for the patient, is violated in the case of oocyte donation for\ncloning research (George 2007). \n\nGiven the risks to the donor, the absence of direct medical benefit\nfor the donor, and the uncertain potential of cloning research, it is\nnot surprising that the number of altruistic oocyte donations for such\nresearch is very low. Financial incentives might be needed to increase\nthe supply of oocytes for cloning research. In some countries,\nincluding the US, selling and buying oocytes is legal. Some object to\nthese practices because they consider oocytes as integral to the body\nand think they should be kept out of the market: on their view, the\nvalue of the human body and its parts should not be expressed in terms\nof money or other fungible goods. Some also worry that, through\ncommercialization of oocytes, women themselves may become objects of\ninstrumental use (Alpers &Lo 1995). Many agree, however, that a\nconcern for commodification does not justify a complete ban on payment\nof oocyte donors and that justice requires that they be financially\ncompensated for the inconvenience, burden, and medical risk they\nendure, as is standard for other research subjects (Steinbock 2004;\nMertes &Pennings 2007). A related concern is the effect of\nfinancial or other offers of compensation on the voluntariness of\noocyte donation. Women, especially economically disadvantaged women\nfrom developing countries, might be unduly induced or even coerced\ninto selling their oocytes (Dickinson 2002). Baylis and McLeod (2007)\nhave highlighted how difficult it is concomitantly to avoid both undue\ninducement and exploitation: a price that is too low risks\nexploitation; a price that avoids exploitation risks undue\ninducement. \n\nConcerns about exploitation are not limited to concerns about\npayment, as became clear in the ‘Hwang scandal’ (for a\nreview, see Saunders & Savulescu 2008). In 2004,\nWoo-Suk-Hwang, a leading Korean stem cell scientist, claimed to be the\nfirst to clone human embryos using SCNT and to extract stem cells from\nthese embryos. In addition to finding that Hwang had fabricated many of\nhis research results, Korea’s National Bioethics Committee also\nfound that Hwang had pressured junior members of his lab to donate\noocytes for his cloning experiments. \n\nSome authors have argued that a regulated market in oocytes\ncould minimize ethical concerns raised by the commercialization of\noocytes and could be consistent with respect for women (Resnik 2001;\nGruen 2007). Researchers are also investigating the use of\nalternative sources of oocytes, including animal oocytes, fetal\noocytes, oocytes from adult ovaries obtained post mortem or during\noperation, and stem cell-derived oocytes. Scientists have already\nsucceeded in creating human oocytes from embryonic stem cells (Ma et\nal. 2017; Saitou & Miyauchi 2016).  Finally, another option is\n‘egg-sharing’ where couples who are undergoing IVF for\nreproductive purposes have the option to donate one or two of their\noocytes in return for a reduced fee for their fertility treatment. The\nadvantage of this system is that it avoids exposing women to extra\nrisks – these women were undergoing IVF in any case (Roberts\n& Throsby 2008). \n\nPersonalized cloning therapies are likely to be labor intensive and\nexpensive. This has raised social justice concerns. Perhaps cloning\ntherapies will only be a realistic option for the very rich? Cloning\ntherapies may, however, become cheaper, less labor intensive and more\nwidely accessible after time. Moreover, cloning may cure\ndiseases and not only treat symptoms. Regardless of the economic cost,\nit remains true of course that the cloning procedure is time consuming,\nrendering it inappropriate for certain clinical applications where\nurgent intervention is required (e.g., myocardial infarction, acute\nliver failure or traumatic or infectious spinal cord damage). If\ncloning for therapy became available, its application would thus likely\nbe restricted to chronic conditions. Wilmut (1997), who cloned Dolly,\nhas suggested that cloning treatments could be targeted to maximize\nbenefit: an older person with heart disease could be treated with stem\ncells that are not a genetic match, take drugs to suppress her immune\nsystem for the rest of her life, and live with the side-effects; a\nyounger person might benefit from stem cells from cloned embryos that\nmatch exactly. Devolder and Savulescu (2006) have argued that\nobjections about economic cost are most forceful against ‘cloning\nfor self-transplantation’ than, for example, against cloning for\ndeveloping cellular models of human disease. The latter will enable\nresearch into human diseases and may result in affordable therapies and\ncures for a variety of common diseases, such as cancer and heart\ndisease, which afflict people all over the world. Finally, some have\npointed out that it is not clear whether cloning research is\nnecessarily more labor intensive than experiments on cells and tissues\nnow done in animals. \n\nSome are skeptical about the claimed benefits of cloning for research\nand therapy. They stress that for many diseases in which cloned\nembryonic stem cells might offer a therapy, there are alternative\ntreatments and/or preventive measures in development, including gene\ntherapy, pharmacogenomical solutions and treatments based on\nnanotechnology.  It is often claimed that other types of stem cells\nsuch as adult stem cells and stem cells from the umbilical cord blood\nmight enable us to achieve the same aims as cloning. Especially\ninduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have raised the hope that\ncloning research is superfluous (Rao & Condic 2008). iPSCs are\ncreated through genetic manipulation of a body cell. iPSCs are similar\nto embryonic stem cells, and in particular to embryonic stem cells\nfrom cloned embryos. However, iPSC research could provide tissue- and\npatient-specific cells without relying on the need for human oocytes\nor the creation and destruction of embryos. iPSC research could thus\navoid the ethical issues raised by cloning. This promise\nnotwithstanding, scientists have warned that it would be premature to\nstop cloning research as iPSCs are not identical to embryonic stem\ncells (Pera & Trounson 2013). Cloning research may teach us\nthings that iPSC research cannot teach us.  Moreover, iPSC research\nhas been said to fail to completely avoid the issue of embryo\ndestruction (Brown 2009, Devolder 2015). \n\nSlippery slope arguments express the worry that permitting a certain\npractice may place us on a slippery slope to a dangerous or otherwise\nunacceptable outcome. Several commentators have argued that accepting\nor allowing cloning research is the first step that would place us on a\nslippery slope to reproductive cloning. As Leon Kass (1998, 702) has\nput it: “once the genies put the cloned embryos into the bottles,\nwho can strictly control where they go?” \n\nOthers are more skeptical about slippery slope arguments against\ncloning and think that effective legislation can prevent us from\nsliding down the slope (Savulescu 1999; Devolder & Savulescu\n2006). If reproductive cloning is unacceptable, these critics say, it\nis reasonable to prohibit this specific technology rather than to ban\nnon-reproductive applications of cloning. The UK and Belgium, for\nexample, allow cloning research but prohibit the transfer of cloned\nembryos to the uterus. \n\nApart from the question of how slippery the slope might be, another\nquestion raised by such arguments concerns the feared development\n–reproductive cloning– and whether it is really ethically\nobjectionable. Profound disagreement exists about the answer to this\nquestion. \n\nThe central argument in favor of reproductive cloning is expansion of\nopportunities for reproduction. Reproductive cloning could offer a new\nmeans for prospective parents to satisfy their reproductive goals or\ndesires. Infertile individuals or couples could have a child that is\ngenetically related to them. In addition, individuals, same sex\ncouples, or couples who cannot together produce an embryo would no\nlonger need donor gametes to reproduce if cloning were available (some\nmight still need donor eggs for the cloning procedure, but these would\nbe enucleated so that only the mitochondrial DNA remains). It would\nthen be possible to avoid that one’s child shares half of her nuclear\nDNA with a gamete donor. \n\nUsing cloning to help infertile people to have a genetically related\nchild, or a child that is only genetically related to them, has been\ndefended on the grounds of human wellbeing, personal autonomy, and the\nsatisfaction of the natural inclination to produce offspring\n(Häyry 2003; Strong 2008). Offering individuals or couples the\npossibility to reproduce using cloning technology has been said to be\nconsistent with the right to reproductive freedom, which, according to\nsome, implies the right to choose what kind of children we will have\n(Brock 1998, 145). \n\nAccording to some, the main benefit of reproductive cloning is that\nit would enable prospective parents to control what genome their\nchildren will be endowed with (Fletcher 1988, Harris 1997, 2004;\nPence 1998, 101–6; Tooley 1998). Cloning would enable parents to have\na child with a genome identical to that of a person with good health\nand/or other desirable characteristics. \n\nAnother possible use of reproductive cloning is to create a child\nthat is a tissue match for a sick sibling. The stem cells from the\numbilical cord blood or from the bone marrow of the cloned child could\nbe used to treat the diseased sibling. Such ‘saviour\nsiblings’, have already been created through sexual reproduction\nor, more efficiently, through a combination of IVF, preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis and HLA testing. \n\nMany people, however, have expressed concerns about human\nreproductive cloning. For some, these concerns are sufficient to reject\nhuman cloning. For others, these concerns should be weighed against\nreasons for reproductive cloning. \n\nWhat follows is an outline of some of the main areas of concern and\ndisagreement about human reproductive cloning. \n\nDespite the successful creation of viable offspring via SCNT in\nvarious mammalian species, researchers still have limited understanding\nof how the technique works on the subcellular and molecular level.\nAlthough the overall efficiency and safety of reproductive cloning in\nmammals has significantly increased over the past fifteen years, it is\nnot yet a safe process (Whitworth & Prather 2010). For\nexample, the rate of abortions, stillbirths and developmental\nabnormalities remains high. Another source of concern is the risk of\npremature ageing because of shortened telomeres. Telomeres are\nrepetitive DNA sequences at the tip of chromosomes that get shorter as\nan animal gets older. When the telomeres of a cell get so short that\nthey disappear, the cell dies. The concern is that cloned animals may\ninherit the shortened telomeres from their older progenitor, with\npossibly premature aging and a shortened lifespan as a result. \n\nFor many, the fact that reproductive cloning is unsafe provides a\nsufficient reason not to pursue it. It has been argued that it would\nsimply be wrong to impose such significant health risks on humans. The\nstrongest version of this argument states that it would be wrong now to\nproduce a child using SCNT because it would constitute a case of\nwrongful procreation. Some adopt a consent-based objection and condemn\ncloning because the person conceived cannot consent to being exposed to\nsignificant risks involved in the procedure (Kass 1998; PCBE 2002).\nAgainst this, it has been argued that even if reproductive cloning is\nunsafe, it may still be permissible if there are no safer means to\nbring that very same child into existence so long as the child is\nexpected to have a life worth living (Strong 2005). \n\nWith the actual rate of advancement in cloning, one cannot exclude a\nfuture in which the safety and efficiency of SCNT will be comparable or\nsuperior to that of IVF or even sexual reproduction. A remaining\nquestion is, then, whether those who condemn cloning because of its\nexperimental nature should continue to condemn it morally and legally.\nSome authors have reasoned that if, in the future, cloning becomes\nsafer than sexual reproduction, we should even make it our reproductive\nmethod of choice (Fletcher 1988; Harris 2004, Ch. 4). \n\nSome fear that cloning threatens the identity and individuality of\nthe clone, thus reducing her autonomy (Ramsey 1966; Kitcher 1997;\nAnnas 1998; Kass 1998). This may be bad in itself, or bad because it\nmight reduce the clone’s wellbeing. It may also be bad because it\nwill severely restrict the array of life plans open to the clone, thus\nviolating her ‘right to an open future’ (a concept\ndeveloped in Feinberg 1980). In its report ‘Human Cloning and\nHuman Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry’, the US President’s\nCouncil on Bioethics (2002) wrote that being genetically unique is\n“an emblem of independence and individuality” and allows us\nto go forward “with a relatively indeterminate future in front of\nus” (Ch. 5, Section c). Such concerns have formed the basis of\nstrong opposition to cloning. \n\nThe concern that cloning threatens the clone’s identity and\nindividuality has been criticized for relying on the mistaken belief\nthat who and what we become is entirely determined by our genes. Such\ngenetic determinism is clearly false. Though genes influence our\npersonal development, so does the complex and irreproducible context in\nwhich our lives take place. We know this, among others, from studying\nmonozygotic twins. Notwithstanding the fact that such twins are\ngenetically identical to each other and, therefore, sometimes look very\nsimilar and often share many character traits, habits and preferences,\nthey are different individuals, with different identities\n(Segal 2000). Thus, it is argued, having a genetic duplicate does not\nthreaten one’s individuality, or one’s distinct\nidentity. \n\nBrock (2002) has pointed out that one could nevertheless argue that\neven though individuals created through cloning would be unique\nindividuals with a distinct identity, they might not experience it that\nway. What is threatened by cloning then is not the individual’s\nidentity or individuality, but her sense of identity and\nindividuality, and this may reduce her autonomy. So even if a clone has\na unique identity, she may experience more difficulties in establishing\nher identity than if she had not been a clone. \n\nBut here too critics have relied on the comparison with monozygotic\ntwins. Harris (1997, 2004) and Tooley (1998), for example, have pointed\nout that each twin not only has a distinct identity, but generally also\nviews him or herself as having a distinct identity, as do their\nrelatives and friends. Moreover, so they argue, an individual created\nthrough cloning would likely be of a different age than her progenitor.\nThere may even be several generations between them. A clone would thus\nin essence be a ‘delayed’ twin. Presumably this would make\nit even easier for the clone to view herself as distinct from the\nprogenitor than if she had been genetically identical to someone her\nsame age. \n\nHowever, the reference to twins as a model to think about reproductive\ncloning has been criticized, for example, because it fails to reflect\nimportant aspects of the parent-child relationship that would incur if\nthe child were a clone of one of the rearing parents (Jonas 1974;\nLevick 2004). Because of the dominance of the progenitor, the risk of\nreduced autonomy and confused identity may be greater in such a\nsituation than in the case of ordinary twins. Moreover, just\nbecause the clone would be a delayed twin, she may have the\nfeeling that her life has already been lived or that she is\npredetermined to do the same things as her progenitor (Levy &\nLotz 2005). This problem may be exacerbated by others constantly\ncomparing her life with that of the progenitor, and having problematic\nexpectations based on these comparisons. The clone may feel under\nconstant pressure to live up to these expectations (Kass 1998; Levick\n2004, 101; Sandel 2007, 57–62), or may have the feeling she leads\n‘a life in the shadow’ of the progenitor (Holm 1998; PCBE\n2002, Ch.5). This may especially be the case if the clone was\ncreated as a ‘replacement’ for a deceased child. (Some\nprivate companies already offer to clone dead pets to create\nreplacements pets.) The fear is that the ‘ghost of the dead\nchild’ will get more attention and devotion than the replacement\nchild. Parents may expect the clone to be like the lost child, or some\nidealized image of it, which could hamper the development of her\nidentity and adversely affect her self-esteem (Levick 2004, 111–132).\nFinally, another reason why the clone’s autonomy may be reduced\nis because she would be involuntarily informed about her genetic\npredispositions. A clone who knows that her genetic parent developed a\nsevere single gene disease at the age of forty will realise it is very\nlikely that she will undergo the same fate. Unlike individuals who\nchoose to have themselves genetically tested, clones who know\ntheir genetic parent’s medical history will be involuntarily\ninformed. \n\nThese concerns have been challenged on several grounds. Some believe\nthat it is plausible that, through adequate information, we could\nlargely correct mistaken beliefs about the link between genetic and\npersonal identity, and thus reduce the risk of problematic expectations\ntoward the clone (Harris 1997, 2004; Tooley 1998, 84–5; Brock 1998,\nPence 1998). Brock (1998) and Buchanan et al. (2000, 198)\nhave argued that even if people persist in these mistaken beliefs and\ntheir attitudes or actions lead to cloned individuals\nbelieving they do not have an open future, this does not imply\nthat the clone’s right to ignorance about one’s personal\nfuture or to an open future has actually been violated. Pence\n(1998, 138) has argued that having high expectations, even if based on\nfalse beliefs, is not necessarily a bad thing. Parents with high\nexpectations often give their children the best chances to lead a happy\nand successful life. Brock (2002, 316) has argued that parents now also\nconstantly restrict the array of available life plans open to their\nchildren, for example, by selecting their school or by raising them\naccording to certain values. Though this may somewhat restrict the\nchild’s autonomy, there will always be enough decisions to take\nfor the child to be autonomous, and to realize this. According to\nBrock, it is not clear why this should be different in the case of\ncloning. He also points out that there may be advantages to being a\n‘delayed twin’ (154). For example, one may acquire\nknowledge about the progenitor’s medical history and use this\nknowledge to live longer, or to increase one’s autonomy. One\ncould, for example, use the information to reduce the risk of getting\nthe disease or condition, or to at least postpone its onset, by\nbehavioral changes, an appropriate diet and/or preventive medication.\nThis would not be possible, however, if the disease is untreatable (for\nexample, Huntington’s Disease). Harris (2004, Ch.1) has stressed\nthat information about one’s genetic predispositions for certain\ndiseases would also allow one to take better informed reproductive\ndecisions. Cloning would allow us to give our child a ‘tried and\ntested’ genome, not one created by the genetic lottery of sexual\nreproduction and the random combination of chromosomes. \n\nCloning arouses people’s imagination about the clone, but also\nabout those who will choose to have a child through cloning. Often\ndubious motives are ascribed to them: they would want a child\nthat is ‘just like so-and-so’ causing people to view children\nas objects or as commodities like a new car or a new house (Putnam\n1997, 7–8). They would want an attractive child (a clone of Scarlett\nJohansson) or a child with tennis talent (a clone of Victoria Azarenka)\npurely to show off. Dictators would want armies of clones to achieve\ntheir political goals. People would clone themselves out of vanity.\nParents would clone their existing child so that the clone can serve as\nan organ bank for that child, or would clone their deceased child to\nhave a replacement child. The conclusion is then that cloning is wrong\nbecause the clone will be used as a mere means to others’ ends.\nThese critiques have also been expressed with regard to other forms of\nassisted reproduction; but some worry that individuals created through\ncloning may be more likely to be viewed as commodities because their\ntotal genetic blueprint would be chosen – they would be\n“fully made and not begotten” (Ramsey 1966; Kass 1998;\nPCBE 2002, 107). \n\nStrong (2008) has argued that these concerns are based on a fallacious\ninference. It is one thing to desire genetically related children, and\nsomething else to believe that one owns one’s children or that one\nconsiders one’s children as objects, he writes. Other commentators,\nhowever, have pointed out that even if parents themselves do not\ncommodify their children, cloning might still have an impact on\nsociety as a whole, thereby increasing the tendency of others to do so\n(Levy & Lotz 2005; Sandel 2007). A related concern expressed by\nLevick (2004, 184–5) is that allowing cloning might result in a\nsociety where ‘production on demand’ clones are sold for\nadoption to people who are seeking to have children with special\nabilities – a clearer case of treating children as objects. \n\nBut suppose some people create a clone for instrumental reasons, for\nexample, as a stem cell donor for a sick sibling. Does this imply that\nthe clone will be treated merely as a means? Critics of this argument\nhave pointed out that parents have children for all kinds of\ninstrumental reasons, including the benefit for the husband-wife\nrelationship, continuity of the family name, and the economic and\npsychological benefits children provide when their parents become old\n(Harris 2004, 41–2, Pence 1998). This is generally not considered\nproblematic as long as the child is also valued in its own right. What\nis most important in a parent-child relationship is the love and care\ninherent in that relationship. They stress the fact that we judge\npeople on their attitudes toward children, rather than on their motives\nfor having them. They also deny that there is a strong link between\none’s intention or motive to have a child, and the way one will\ntreat the child. \n\nAnother concern is that clones may be the victims of unjustified\ndiscrimination and will not be respected as persons (Deech 1999;\nLevick 2004, 185–187). Savulescu (2005, Other Internet\nResources) has referred to such negative attitudes towards clones as\n‘clonism’: a new form of discrimination against a group of\nhumans who are different in a non-morally significant way. But does a\nfear for ‘clonism’ constitute a good reason for rejecting\ncloning? Savulescu and others have argued that, if it is, then we must\nconclude that racist attitudes and discriminatory behavior towards\npeople with a certain ethnicity provides a good reason for people with\nthat ethnicity not to procreate.  This, according to these critics, is\na morally objectionable way to solve the problem of racism. Instead of\nlimiting people’s procreative liberty we should combat existing\nprejudices and discrimination. Likewise, it is argued, instead of\nprohibiting cloning out of concern for clonism, we should combat\npossible prejudices and discrimination against clones (see also Pence\n1998, 46; Harris 2004, 92–93). Macintosh (2005, 119–21)\nhas warned that by expressing certain concerns about cloning one may\nactually reinforce certain prejudices and misguided stereotypes about\nclones. For example, saying that a clone would not have a personal\nidentity prejudges the clone as inferior or fraudulent (the idea that\noriginals are more valuable than their copies) or even less than human\n(as individuality is seen as an essential characteristic of human\nnature). \n\nAnother concern is that cloning threatens traditional family\nstructures; a fear that has come up in debates about homosexuals\nadopting children, IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques. But\nin cloning the situation would be more complex as it may blur\ngenerational boundaries (McGee 2000) and the clone would likely be\nconfused about her kinship ties (Kass 1998; O’Neil 2002, 67–68).\nFor example, a woman who has a child conceived through cloning would\nactually be the twin of her child and the woman’s mother would,\ngenetically, be its mother, not grandmother. Some have argued against\nthese concerns, replying that a cloned child would not necessarily be\nmore confused about her family ties than other children. Many have four\nnurturing parents because of a divorce, never knew their genetic\nparents, have nurturing parents that are not their genetic parents, or\nthink that their nurturing father is also their genetic father when in\nfact he is not. While these complex family relationships can be\ntroubling for some children, they are not insurmountable, critics say.\nHarris (2004, 77–78) argues that there are many aspects about the\nsituation one is born and raised in that may be troublesome. As with\nall children, the most important thing is the relation with people who\nnurture and educate them, and children usually know very well who these\npeople are. There is no reason to believe that with cloning, this will\nbe any different. Onora O’Neil (2002, 67–8) argues that such\nresponses are misplaced. While she acknowledges that there are already\nchildren now with confused family relationships, she argues that it is\nvery different when prospective parents seek such potentially confused\nrelationships for their children from the start. \n\nOther concerns related to cloning focus on the potential harmful\neffects of cloning for others. Sometimes these concerns are related to\nthose about the wellbeing of the clone. For example, McGee’s concern\nabout confused family relationships not only bears on the clone but\nalso on society as a whole. However, since I have already mentioned\nthis concern, I will, in the remainder of this entry, focus on other\narguments \n\nThe strongest reason for why reproductive cloning should be\npermissible, if safe, is that it will allow infertile people to have a\ngenetically related child. This position relies on the view that\nhaving genetically related children is morally significant and\nvaluable. This is a controversial view. For example, Levy and Lotz\n(2005) and Rulli (2016) have denied the importance of a genetic link\nbetween parents and their children. Moreover, they have argued that\nclaiming that this link is important will give rise to bad\nconsequences, such as reduced adoption rates (and, in Rulli’s case, a\nfailure to fulfil one’s duty to adopt) and diminished resources for\nimproving the life prospects of the disadvantaged, including those\nwaiting to be adopted.  Levick (2004, 185) and Ahlberg and Brighouse\n(2011) have also advanced this view. Since, according to these\nauthors, these undesirable consequences would be magnified if we\nallowed human cloning, we have good reason to prohibit it. In\nresponse, Strong (2008) has argued that this effect is uncertain, and\nthat there are other, probably more effective, ways to help such\nchildren or to prevent them from ending up in such a\nsituation. Moreover, if cloning is banned, infertile couples may make\nuse of donor embryos or gametes rather than adoption. \n\nAnother concern is that because cloning is an asexual way of\nreproducing it would decrease genetic variation among offspring and, in\nthe long run, might even constitute a threat to the human race. The\ngene pool may narrow sufficiently to threaten humanity’s\nresistance to disease (AMA 1999, 6). In response, it has been argued\nthat if cloning becomes possible, the number of people who will choose\nit as their mode of reproduction will very likely be too low to\nconstitute a threat to genetic diversity. It would be unlikely to be\nhigher than the rate of natural twinning, which, occurring at a rate of\n3.5/1000 children, does not seriously impact on genetic diversity.\nFurther, even if millions of people would create children through\ncloning, the same genomes will not be cloned over and over: each person\nwould have a genetic copy of his or her genome, which means the result\nwill still be a high diversity of genomes. Others argue that, even if\ngenetic diversity were not diminished by cloning, a society that\nsupports reproductive cloning might be taken to express the view that\nvariety is not important. Conveying such a message, these authors say,\ncould have harmful consequences for a multicultural society. \n\nSome see the increase in control of what kind of genome we want to\npass on to our children as a positive development. A major concern,\nhowever, is that this shift ‘from chance to choice’ will\nlead to problematic eugenic practices. \n\nOne version of this concern states that cloning would, from the\noutset, constitute a problematic form of eugenics. However, critics\nhave argued that this is implausible: the best explanations of what was\nwrong with immoral cases of eugenics, such as the Nazi eugenic\nprograms, are that they involved coercion and were motivated by\nobjectionable moral beliefs or false non-moral beliefs. This would not\nnecessarily be the case were cloning to be implemented now (Agar 2004;\nBuchanan 2007). Unlike the coercive and state-directed eugenics of the\npast, new ‘liberal eugenics’ defends values such as\nautonomy, reproductive freedom, beneficence, empathy and the avoidance\nof harm. Enthusiasts of so-called ‘liberal eugenics’ are\ninterested in helping individuals to prevent or diminish the suffering\nand increase the well-being of their children by endowing them with\ncertain genes.  \n\nAnother version of the eugenics concern points out the risk of a\nslippery slope: the claim is that cloning will lead to objectionable\nforms of eugenics—for example, coercive eugenics—in the\nfuture. After all, historical cases of immoral eugenics often developed\nfrom earlier well intentioned and less problematic practices (for a\nhistory of eugenics as well as an analysis of philosophical and\npolitical issues raised by eugenics, see Kevles 1985 and Paul 1995).\nAccording to Sandel (2007, Ch.5), for example, ‘liberal\neugenics’ might imply more state compulsion than first appears:\njust as governments can force children to go to school, they could\nrequire people to use genetics to have ‘better’\nchildren. \n\nA related concern expressed by Sandel (2007, 52–7) is that cloning, and\nenhancement technologies in general, may result in a society in which\nparents will not accept their child for what it is, reinforcing an\nalready existing trend of heavily managed, high-pressure child-rearing\nor ‘hyper-parenting’. Asch and Wasserman (2005, 202) have\nexpressed a similar concern; arguing that having more control over what\nfeatures a child has can pose an “affront to an ideal of unconditioned\ndevotion”. Another concern, most often expressed by disability\nrights advocates, is that if cloning is used to have\n‘better’ children, it may create a more intolerant climate\ntowards the disabled and the diseased, and that such practices can\nexpress negative judgments about people with disabilities. This\nargument has also been advanced in the debate about selective abortion,\nprenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Disagreement\nexists about whether these effects are likely. For example, Buchanan\net al. (2002, 278) have argued that one can devalue disability\nwhile valuing existing disabled people and that trying to help parents\nwho want to avoid having a disabled child does not imply that society\nshould make no efforts to increase accessibility for existing people\nwith disabilities. \n\nUNESCO’s Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human\nRights (1997) was the first international instrument to condemn human\nreproductive cloning as a practice against human dignity. Article 11 of\nthis Declaration states: “Practices which are contrary to\nhuman dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not\nbe permitted…” This position is shared by the World\nHealth Organization, the European Parliament and several other\ninternational instruments. Critics have pointed out that the reference\nto human dignity is problematic as it is rarely specified how human\ndignity is to be understood, whose dignity is at stake, and how dignity\nis relevant to the ethics of cloning (Harris 2004, Ch.2, Birnbacher\n2005, McDougall 2008,). Some commentators state that it is the copying\nof a genome which violates human dignity (Kass 1998); others have\npointed out that this interpretation could be experienced as an offence\nto genetically identical twins, and that we typically do not regard\ntwins as a threat to human dignity (although some societies in the past\ndid), nor do we prevent twins from coming into existence. On the\ncontrary, IVF, which involves an increased ‘risk’ of having \ntwins, is a widely accepted fertility treatment. \n\nHuman dignity is most often related to Kant’s second\nformulation of the Categorical Imperative, namely the idea that we\nshould never use a person merely as a means to an end. I have, however,\nalready discussed this concern in section 4.2.2. \n\nNo unified religious perspective on human cloning exists; indeed,\nthere are a diversity of opinions within each individual religious\ntradition. For an overview of the evaluation of cloning by the main\nreligious groups see, for example, Cole-Turner (1997) and Walters\n(2004). For a specifically Jewish perspective on cloning, see, for\nexample, Lipschutz (1999), for an Islamic perspective, Sadeghi (2007)\nand for a Catholic perspective, Doerflinger (1999).","contact.mail":"katrien.devolder@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"}]
