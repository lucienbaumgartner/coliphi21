This was an historical position which \nallowed him to consider many important developments (both inside and \noutside the Madhyamaka tradition) that preceded \n him.[3]\n The central claim of the Madhyamaka School is that all phenomena are \nempty (śūnya) of any intrinsic nature, unchanging \nessence, or absolute mode of being. This was the central idea in \nŚāntarakṣita’s thought as well, however, he was a \ncommentator on both Nāgārjuna and Dharmakīrti in equal\nmeasure. In fact, Śāntarakṣita attempted to integrate\nthe anti-essentialism of Nāgārjuna with the \nlogico-epistemological thought of Dignāga (ca. 6th c.)\nand Dharmakīrti (ca. 7th c.) along with facets of \n Yogācāra/Cittamātra[4]\n thought into one internally consistent, yet fundamentally Madhyamaka \nsystem. His innovative integration of facets of the three into a \nMadhyamaka framework of analysis are exemplary of the unique fruits \nwhich benefit from his historical local. The synthesis of these three\nmajor movements in Indian Buddhist philosophy was perhaps his most \nimportant contribution, among many, to the Indian Buddhist \nphilosophical tradition. This synthesis, which was also taken up by \nhis disciples (important philosophers in their own right) such as \nKamalaśīla and to a lesser extent, Haribhadra, has been \ncharacterized as the last major development in Indian Buddhist \nphilosophy. Śāntarakṣita was a dynamic thinker and a \nscholar with both breadth and depth of knowledge of the Indian \nphilosophical traditions. He encouraged his readers to actively \nengage with a host of non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical \npositions as they ascended a sort of hierarchy of philosophical \nviews, a hierarchy that—in his opinion—culminates in the \nMadhyamaka view.\n\n\n\nHowever, Śāntarakṣita’s contribution to Buddhist\nphilosophy as a whole did not stop in India. He made two trips to\nTibet and ultimately spent the last fifteen years of his life there.\nŚāntarakṣita was one of the most influential figures\nin the early dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet, founding the first\nBuddhist monastery at Samyé (bsam yas), serving as its first abbot, ordaining the\nfirst seven Tibetan monks, and establishing a system of rigorous\nphilosophical study based upon the traditions of learning at the great\nIndian Buddhist monastic universities such as Nalanda and\nVikramaśīla. In affect, Śāntarakṣita (and\nlater, his disciple Kamalaśīla) taught Tibetans how to do\nphilosophy. He introduced Tibetans to a plethora of Indian\nphilosophical views, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, and taught them\nhow to study, critically analyze, and meditate upon these\nideas. Several important qualities of Śāntarakṣita’s\nthought that were unique to him in India, became a fully\nintegrated modus operandi of philosophy in Tibet including\nhis dynamic engagement with competing philosophical views and his\nintegration of Madhyamaka and logico-epistemological thought. As such\nhis influence impacted the spectrum of Tibetan philosophical\nliterature, from the earliest philosophical doxographies such as Yeshe\nDe’s (ca. 8th c.)\nDistinguishing the Views (lta ba khyad par) to the \ncommentaries and treatises of towering indigenous Tibetan \nphilosophers such as Chaba Chökyi Senge (phwya pa chos kyi \nseng ge) (1109–1169), Sakya Pandita (sa skya \npaṇḍita) (1182–1251), Tsongkhapa (tsong \nkha pa) (1357–1419) and Mipham Gyatso (mi pham rgya \nmtsho) (1846–1912).\n\n\n\nŚāntarakṣita is probably best known as one of the \ngreat Indian Madhyamaka commentators. His thought in this regard has \nseveral features that make it unique including: his integration of \nYogācāra thought, his integration of Buddhist \nlogico-epistemological developments (discussed below), and his \ndynamic engagement with other Buddhist and non-Buddhist views \n(discussed below). His Madhyamaka view is most clearly and succinctly\narticulated in his text Madhyamakālaṃkāra \n(The Ornament of the Middle Way, hereafter, MA) and his own \ncommentary on that text, \nMadhyamakālaṃkāravṛtti (The \nAuto-Commentary on The Ornament of the Middle Way, hereafter, \n MAV).[5] \n\nA presentation of the two truths is a standard way by which \nMadhyamaka philosophers explain their views on the ontological status\nof phenomena. It is seen as the most effective method for coursing a \n“middle way” between the philosophical extremes of \nasserting the absolute existence of phenomena on the one hand, and \nthe non-existence of them on the other. Thus, Mādhyamikas will \nroutinely claim that phenomena lack a certain mode of existence \nultimately, but claim that such phenomena, or objects of knowledge, \nmaintain another mode conventionally. Virtually all Indian Madhyamaka\nphilosophers will claim, in some detail, that an ultimate truth is an\nobject’s emptiness, or lack of having a truly existent essence or \nnature. This claim, which runs the danger of leading to nihilism, is \nthen tempered to some degree by claims about the conventional mode of\nexistence of those phenomena. Though phenomena do not ultimately \nexist, they do exist conventionally. The precise way in which \nindividual Madhyamaka thinkers define and describe these two truths \ngets at the core of what makes each of these important thinkers \nunique. Śāntarakṣita is famous for presenting his \nviews on ultimate truths by way of one of the most famous Buddhist \nphilosophical arguments on the ontological status of phenomena, the \nneither-one-nor-many argument. \n\nThe first two-thirds of MA comprise what is perhaps the most \nwell-known rendering of the neither-one-nor-many argument, one of the\nkey philosophical arguments used by Madhyamaka philosophers to \nestablish the emptiness, or lack of an inherent nature, in phenomena.\nIt is by way of this argument and his summary that \nŚāntarakṣita offers his presentation of the two \ntruths, ultimate truth (paramārthasatya) and \nconventional truth (saṃvṛtisatya). The two \ntruths are not only the primary means by which Mādhyamika \nphilosophers present their positions on ontology, but form the ground\nupon which issues of epistemology and logic are often discussed as \nwell. The neither-one-nor-many argument is most succinctly presented \nin the first stanza of MA when he writes: \n\nThe point that Śāntarakṣita is attempting to make \nhere is that no phenomena, including those which his philosophical \nrivals have claimed to have an inherently existent essence or nature,\nin fact do have such a nature. The reason they cannot have such a \nnature, according to the argument, is that they have neither a truly \nsingular nature, nor a truly manifold nature, the two being \nexhaustive of all possibilities for entities that have a real nature. \n\nOver the course of the next sixty stanzas in his ninety-seven stanza \ntext, MA, and accompanying auto-commentary, MAV, \nŚāntarakṣita puts all those phenomena asserted by his\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical opponents to the test of the \nneither-one-nor-many reasoning. He begins by examining each instance \nin which some phenomena is asserted to be of a truly singular nature.\nThrough an analysis that reveals that such phenomena must have parts \nand thus could not be truly singular, he makes his way through all \nsuch cases current in late eighth century Indian philosophical discourse. \nFor example, he begins his application of the argument with an \nanalysis of the claim made by the non-Buddhist Sāṃkhya \nschool that there is a Fundamental Nature (Prakṛti) or\ncreator god which is the permanent, uncaused, unobstructed absolute \ncause of all phenomena and which is of a truly singular nature. He \nargues in the second stanza of MA: \n\nAccording to Śāntarakṣita, true singularity would be \nan absurd quality to claim for something which is permanent and has \nthe ability to contribute to the periodic production of successive \neffects. If that were the case, there must be a part of the causal \nentity in moment #1 which contributes to the production of a seed, \nfor example, a part in moment #2 which contributes to the production \nof the sprout, and a part in moment #3 which contributes to the \nproduction of a flower. Since the Fundamental Nature is described as \nthe sole cause of the periodic arising of all effects, it must have \nall these parts, and more. It must have parts related with every \nentity for which it is a cause. The Fundamental Nature must include \nparts that cause entities to exist in one moment and parts that cause\nthem to cease to exist or transform into something else in another. \nThat which causes a seed to exist in moment #1 must have at least \nsome quality or qualities that distinguish it from that which causes \na sprout to exist in moment #2. At a bare minimum, his opponent must \nbe forced to admit parts to such a Fundamental Nature. Something with\nmanifold parts cannot, by definition, be truly singular. \nŚāntarakṣita thus considers that the application of \nthis sort of reasoning undermines the existence of such a truly \nsingular Fundamental Nature, as described in the Sāṃkhya \nsystem since it is illogical for there to be a permanent, truly \nsingular, unobstructed cause of the successive effects of the \nmanifold world. Arguments regarding the irrationality of asserting \nits permanence and those regarding its contradictions with our \nexperience of causality in the world, are supplied in his own MAV on \nthe above verse to strengthen his rejection of the notion of such a \nFundamental Nature.  \n\nŚāntarakṣita is not only critical of his non-Buddhist\nphilosophical opponents however. The bulk of the argument is \naddressed toward the views of philosophical opponents within in his \nown larger Buddhist camp that he feels have made errors in \ninterpretation and logic. For example, he dedicates a lengthy portion\nof the neither-one-nor-many argument to criticisms of a variety of \nBuddhist claims about the true singularity of consciousness made by \nboth Buddhists associated with the Sautrāntika schools and those\nassociated with the Yogācāra/Cittamātra schools. In a \nvariety of ways, proponents of these schools claim that consciousness\nis truly singular and yet can be a knower of a multiplicity of \nobjects. For Śāntarakṣita, such claims are fraught \nwith errors in logic. If consciousness knows a multiplicity of \nobjects, then it must not be singular by definition. There must be a \npart of the consciousness that knows object A and another than knows \nobject B. Various Buddhists who want to hold consciousness to be \ntruly singular, have attempted to avoid these faults in a variety of \nways. Some have attempted to claim they avoid the faults because they\nassert that there are an equal number of consciousnesses as objects. \nOthers claim that they avoid these problems because they claim \nconsciousness exists in a non-dual relationship with its objects. \nEach of these interpretive turns was met by \nŚāntarakṣita with logical analysis demonstrating what\nhe considered to be the inevitable contradictions that ensue by the \nvarious attempts at claiming that consciousness is truly singular. In\nthis manner, Śāntarakṣita analyzes a host of current \nclaims of true singularity over the course of the first sixty stanzas\nof the MA. \n\nHaving examined all those phenomena which his philosophical opponents\nclaim have or are of a truly singular nature and \ndetermined through reasoned analysis that they in fact, could not \npossibly have or be of a truly singular nature, \nŚāntarakṣita proceeds to consider the possibility of \nthere being a truly manifold nature in phenomena. Because a manifold \nnature would depend upon the aggregation of true singularities, he \nconcludes that just as there can be no inherently singular nature, \nthere also can be no inherently manifold nature. And since there is \nno third alternative for entities with an inherent nature, there must\nbe no phenomena that have an inherently existent nature at all. While\nelaborated upon in greater detail in his auto-commentary, MAV, his \nterse summary of the neither-one-nor many argument is found in the \nsixty-first and sixty-second stanzas of MA as follows: \n\nThe existence of an entity belonging to a class other than that which\nhas a single or manifold [nature] does not make sense because the two\nare exhaustive of all possible \n alternatives.[8] \n\nThus, an object’s lack of, or emptiness of having an inherently \nexistent nature is an ultimate truth for \nŚāntarakṣita. This position, he feels, has been \nlogically established by way of the neither-one-nor-many argument. \n\nIn a variety of ways, virtually all Mādhyamika’s reject the \nexistence of an ultimate, absolute, unchanging nature in things, as \nŚāntarakṣita has done in the first sixty-two stanzas \nof MA. This is a key component in their presentations of ultimate \ntruths. The anti-essentialist position of rejecting an ultimate \nnature in phenomena enables a Mādhyamika, such as \nŚāntarakṣita in this case, to avoid the \n“extreme” of clinging to objects as permanent, or more \nprecisely, as enduring for more than a moment. Though the arguments \nmay vary, most Mādhyamika thinkers are similar in their \ndescriptions of ultimate truths. Debates among Mādhyamikas tend \nto rise in relation to their presentations of conventional truths, \nthe means by which the “extreme” of non-existence is \navoided. \n\nAfter concluding that phenomena do not ultimately exist, \nŚāntarakṣita offers his concise summation and \ndefinition of a conventional truth in the sixty-third and sixty forth\nstanzas of MA: \n\nThose phenomena that are only agreeable when not put to the test of \n\nIn these stanzas and in his accompanying auto-commentary, MAV, \nŚāntarakṣita presents the parameters for his \ndefinition of a conventional truth. They are: \n\nIn addition, later in the text, Śāntarakṣita \ndescribes such objects in a manner previously only used by proponents\nof the Yogācāra/Cittamātra school, namely, that such \nobjects are “mere consciousness only”. (This aspect will \nbe discussed below in the section entitled \n“Yogācāra-Madhyamaka Synthesis”.)  \n\nTruths are objects of knowledge in Madhyamaka ontology, so the quality\nof being known by a mind is an imperative and to some degree a\ntautologous assertion. Being impermanent and causally efficacious\nimplies, in Buddhist thought, that they are dependently-arisen, that\nthey arise on the basis of impermanent causes and conditions that are\nthemselves, dependently-arisen. In his own commentary on these\nstanzas, MAV, Śāntarakṣita explicitly describes\nconventional truths as dependently-arisen. He goes on to state that\nconventional truths are known with conceptual thought and designated\nby worldly convention (MAV, 88–93).  Thus an object’s lack of an\ninherent nature is an ultimate truth.  Those impermanent, dependently\narisen, causally efficacious objects of knowledge that are known by\nconceptual thinking are conventional truths. This is how\nŚāntarakṣita presents his views on the ontological\nstatus of phenomena in his texts MA and MAV. \n\nIn addition to presenting the two truths as described above, a \npresentation that is not particularly out of the ordinary for a \nMadhyamaka thinker, Śāntarakṣita elaborates further, \nin ways that must have made his presentation seem unorthodox to \nmainline Mādhyamikas in eighth century India. Although there \nwere other Indian Mādhyamikas who attempted to incorporate \ndimensions of Yogācāra/Cittamātra (Mind-Only) thought \ninto their Madhyamaka perspective (including \nŚāntarakṣita’s own disciples Kamalaśīla and\nHaribhadra, as well as predecessors like Ārya Vimuktsena and \nŚrigupta), Śāntarakṣita is undoubtedly the most \nnoteworthy and most famous Yogācāra-Madhyamaka \n synthesizer.[10]\n There are two primary areas where we find Yogācāra ideas \nincorporated into Śāntarakṣita’s thought: his \npresentation of conventional truths where he describes them as being \nof the nature of consciousness, and his conventional acceptance of \nself-cognizing consciousness or reflexive awareness. \n\nOne of the fundamental tenets of the \nYogācāra/Cittamātra schools of Buddhist thought is the\nassertion that phenomena are not of an utterly distinct nature from \nconsciousness. The pan-Mahāyāna idea of emptiness is in \nfact described in this way Yogācāras/Cittamātras, by \nclaiming that emptiness refers to an object’s lack of a nature that \nis distinct from the consciousness perceiving it. This is contrasted \nwith the common Madhyamaka description of emptiness as referring to \nan object’s lack or emptiness of its own nature or essence in and of \nitself. Śāntarakṣita incorporates this \nYogācāra line of thinking into his presentation of \nconventional truths when he writes in the ninety-first stanza of MA: \n\nThis statement refers to his earlier descriptions of conventional \ntruths (cited above) where he describes conventional truths as \nphenomena that have the ability to function and which generate and \ndisintegrate. In Mādhyamika discourse, “That which is \ncause and result,” is simply another way of referring to \nconventional truths. It refers to that which is impermanent, \ndependently-arisen, and causally efficacious, the three being \nco-extensive with each other and with conventional truths in general.\nThus, by stating that, “that which is cause and result is mere \nconsciousness,” Śāntarakṣita is stating that \nconventional truths are of the nature of consciousness. This is an \nultimate description of reality for proponents of the \nYogācāra/Cittamātra systems, but for \nŚāntarakṣita here, this is part of his presentation \nof conventional truths, thus, incorporating a \nYogācāra/Cittamātra orientation for his presentation \nof conventional truths. \n\nA further development of this philosophical synthesis that \nŚāntarakṣita is putting forth is described even more \nexplicitly in the next stanza, the ninety-second: \n\nHere we find a particularly important and unique aspect of \nŚāntarakṣita’s presentation of the two truths. It is \nnot merely that he incorporates aspects of Mind-Only thinking into \nhis presentation that makes it unique. It is unique because for \nvirtually all of Śāntarakṣita’s Madhyamaka \npredecessors in India, the two truths are utilized solely as a \nvehicle for presenting the ontological status of entities. It is done\nby way of describing the mode of being for various objects of \nknowledge (ultimate truths and conventional truths). This common \nMadhyamaka way of approaching the two truths is present in \nŚāntarakṣita as well, but there is more here. In \naddition to stating the ultimate truths exist in x way and \nconventional truths exist in y way, \nŚāntarakṣita is also using his presentation of \nconventional truths as a stepping stone for his readers. A proper \nunderstanding of conventional truths takes a person part of the way \ntowards an understanding of the ultimate. Previous Madhyamaka \npresentations of conventional truths do not incorporate this \npractical dimension. For Śāntarakṣita, conventional \ntruths are not completely mistaken. By properly understanding \nconventional truths (i.e., as a follower of Cittamātra tenets \nunderstands the ultimate), one is well on the way to a proper \nunderstanding of the ultimate from his Madhyamaka \nperspective—the most subtle and accurate philosophical \npresentation of reality. There is a dynamic step at work in \nŚāntarakṣita’s presentation of the two truths; first \none understands that entities are not of a distinct nature from that \nof the mind (as Mind-Only proponents claim) and then they progress to\nrealize that nothing exists in and of itself (the Madhyamaka \nperspective), even the mind. This dynamic engagement with \nconventional truths is unique among Madhyamaka thinkers and a \ncritical innovation in the thought of Śāntarakṣita. \n\nŚāntarakṣita was a towering figure in eighth century \nIndian philosophy. It appears from the little evidence we have that \nhe was fully engaged in the philosophical arena of his day including \nthe composition of polemical tracts against his rivals. We can assume\nthat these were taken seriously by his opponents because some of his \nextant writings are only known today because they were preserved in \nJain libraries. But Śāntarakṣita’s philosophical \nstyle was richer than simple polemics. In texts like MA, he led his \nreaders through a dynamic engagement with competing views. Competing \nviews, particularly competing Buddhist philosophical views were \nutilized in his texts in ways that encouraged his readers to \ncontemplate the full impact and import of those views. In other \nwords, he seems to encourage a provisional acceptance of \ncompeting Buddhist views as he presents a philosophical hierarchy of \ntenets. This method makes for a quite dynamic engagement with those \ncompeting views where provisionally taking on the competing views \nserves to have a transformative affect on the mind of the student as \nthey ascend the philosophical hierarchy. They were not simply used as\nvehicles for illuminating his own view by contrasting it with those \nof his Buddhist rivals, though he was certainly doing that as well. \nŚāntarakṣita was doing more than that; he was \nencouraging his readers to take on those philosophical tenet systems \nhe considered to be hierarchically “lower” in order to \nfacilitate what seems to be a dynamic philosophical enterprise of \nmulti-tiered engagement with a host of philosophical positions and \nviews. In a tradition where philosophical inquiry is a form of \nreligious praxis, it appears that provisional acceptance of the \ntenets of lower schools was used to ripen the mind for increasingly \nmore subtle and accurate philosophical descriptions of reality. In \nother words, since the cultivation of experiential wisdom knowing \nreality is at the heart of what facilitates the larger tradition’s \nsoteriological goals, this dynamic method can be said to serve \nsoteriological \n aims.[13] \n\nThis process can be witnessed to a degree in \nŚāntarakṣita’s encyclopedic tenets text, \nTattvasaṃgraha, but is most clearly presented in MA. \nIn his application of the neither-one-nor-many argument in MA \n(described above), the careful reader is drawn to notice that as \nŚāntarakṣita proceeds through his examination of \ncompeting views, he does so through the shifting lens of three \nphilosophical \n perspectives.[14]\n In the first fifteen stanzas of the text, he seems to be analyzing \nnon-Buddhist and Vaibhāṣika tenets as a holder of \nSautrāntika tenets would. His criticisms of those views are of a\ntype that a Sautrāntika would utilize and his forms of reasoning\nare as well. It is as if he is encouraging his readers to adopt a \nSautrāntika outlook and all that entails. Though there may be \npolemics involved (If x view can even be refuted by \nSautrāntikas, what need is there to discuss the superiority of \nthe Madhyamaka?), it appears that what is at work in an actual \nencouragement of his readers to seriously take on a Sautrāntika \nposition, at least provisionally. \n\nWhen he begins to examine the various positions of Sautrāntikas,\nhis perspective shifts and he starts to argue as a \nYogācāra/Cittamātra would. He criticizes the varying \nSautrāntika perspectives as a Yogācāra/Cittamātra\nwould, by making criticisms about how knowledge of entities external \nto consciousness could be known. And he makes these arguments both in\nthe context of the neither-one-nor-many framework and with the types \nof reasoning Yogācāra/Cittamātra thinkers such as \nDharmakīrti, might utilize. One might think that the focus of \nhis criticisms would be solely on Madhyamaka issues about \nown-essences (svabhāva), but a major focus at this \npoint is on the separation of objects from consciousness. It is as if\nŚāntarakṣita is encouraging his readers to take on\na Yogācāra/Cittamātra perspective, for at this point \nŚāntarakṣita seems to feign acceptance of a \nYogācāra/Cittamātra perspective. He does not qualify \nhis acceptance as merely conventional. He argues against \nSautrāntika positions, as a Yogācāra/Cittamātra. \nIt is only later in the text, when he begins to discuss the two \ntruths that we come to learn that his acceptance of \nYogācāra/Cittamātra tenets is qualified and \nprovisional. Finally, beginning in the forty-fifth stanza, when \nŚāntarakṣita begins to analyze various positions \nasserted by proponents of Yogācāra/Cittamatra tenet, he \ntakes on his final position as a Mādhyamika. He then criticizes \nsuch positions from a Mādhyamika perspective and utilizes the \nsorts of reasoning a Mādhyamika would use to refute \nYogācāra/Cittamatra tenets, focusing on a rejection of \nessences. Thus, he has made his final shift in frames or scales of \nanalysis. As he concludes the neither-one-nor-many argument and \ndiscusses a host of issues of great import in the remainder of the \ntext, he maintains his final position as a Mādhyamika. \n\nIn the process of these shifting provisionalities, or scales of \nanalysis, Śāntarakṣita has led his readers through a \ndynamic engagement with a host of philosophical views. They are not \nmerely presented to be refuted (though that is certainly happening), \nbut through an apparent feigned acceptance of “lower” \ntenets as he makes his way up a hierarchical ladder of philosophical \nviews, his readers are actively encouraged to engage fully by taking \non these other views that will ultimately be rejected. Rather than \nrefute and dismiss competing views, Śāntarakṣita \nseems to recognize a utility in their engagement, one that serves the\nteleological function of leading the reader to (in his opinion) the \nhighest philosophical view, the Madhyamaka. For ultimately, the \npurpose of Buddhist philosophical inquiry has a soteriological \nfunction as well. Suffering, according to the Buddha, is caused by \nconfusion and ignorance, by a misunderstanding of the world and its \nfunctions. Thus, the duty of the Buddhist philosopher is to attempt \nto indicate for the suffering masses, as clearly as possible, the \nprecise nature of their confusions and misunderstandings that lay at \nthe heart of their suffering. For Śāntarakṣita, it is\nattachment to a fixed nature or essence in things which is at the \nroot of the problem. So a dynamic philosophical process that can \nskillfully lead readers to the Madhyamaka perspective, the one that \nboth understands and undermines all clinging to fixed natures, is a \ncritical and creative part of ascending the spiritual path. \n\nThe spearheading of the Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition \n(pramāṇavāda \n )[15]\n by Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, at first in response to Indian \nthought in the area of philosophy of language and in dialogue with \nnon-Buddhist philosophers, resulted in a tremendous impact on many \ndimensions of Buddhist philosophical discourse in the middle and late\nperiods of Indian Buddhism. Though its impact could be seen before \nŚāntarakṣita (in facets of Bhāviveka’s \nwritings), he was the first major Madhyamaka thinker who was also a \ncommentator on Dharmakīrti, a contributor to this discourse, and\nwho attempted to integrate its insights into a Madhyamaka framework. \n(Both Dignāga and Dharmakīrti are more closely associated \nwith the Mind-Only school). One can witness one dimension of the \nprofound influence Śāntarakṣita had on Tibetan \nBuddhist thought, even given the differences in the details, when \nobserving this integration of Madhyamaka and \npramāṇavāda thought in towering Tibetan \nthinkers such as Sakya Pandita and Tsongkhapa among others. \nŚāntarakṣita’s thought on logico-epistemological \nissues is primarily found in his encyclopedic doxography, \nTattvasaṃgraha and in his commentary on \nDharmakīrti’s Vādanyāya entitled \nVipañcitārthā. In order to properly situate\nŚāntarakṣita’s thought on these issues, it is \nnecessary to briefly discuss that of his two most important \npredecessors in this area: Dignāga and Dharmakīrti. \n\nCentral to the logico-epistemological tradition in general and \nŚantarakṣita in particular is the question of what \nconstitutes a means by which one accrues an instance of indubitable \nknowing. In other words, how does one justify considering a moment of\nawareness or cognitive episode as valid knowledge \n(pramāṇa)? What constitutes trustworthy \nawareness? For Śāntarakṣita, the \npramāṇa that is the means of justifying an instant\nof valid knowing is simultaneously indistinct from the instant of\nvalid knowing itself (McClintock 2002, 57).\n \n\nAs with Dharmakīrti, Śāntarakṣita describes \nvalid knowledge or valid cognitions as instants of new knowledge in \nthe sense that the cognizer knows newly something which to that point\nwas unknown. Generally speaking, Buddhist \npramāṇavāda thinkers categorize two types of\n\n pramāṇa[16]:\n perception \n (pratyakṣa)[17]\n and inference (anumāna). Objects of perception are \ncausally efficacious particulars (svalakṣaṇa), \nactual instance of things in the world with temporal and spatial \nlocation. It is only particulars that are considered to be real. \nGenerally, it would be thought that words apply to universals \n(sāmānyalakṣaṇa) which are conceptual \nconstructs that have no causal efficacy in the world. Thus the early \npramāṇavāda thinkers like Dignāga and \nDharmakīrti can be considered to hold a soft form of \nconnotationism in that they would reject a denotationist view that \nconsiders words to apply directly to actual particulars. The \nintuition that a word points to a particular would be very \nobjectionable. A word cannot express a particular because particulars\nare limitless and words have limits. Yet they are soft \nconnotationists in that via a process of elimination or exclusion, \nthey posit a way in which language is both not arbitrary and not a \nreference to particulars. Inferences are cognitions based on valid \nreasons that depend on this non-arbitrary use of \n language.[18] \n\nAmong the philosophical issues that are important here is the \nfundamental question of how, if the world is only directly accessibly\nby perception, can one come to valid knowledge by means of inference \nthat relies on words that do not directly refer to particulars? How \ndoes one link the ineffable world of particulars to language, and \nthus to an inference that could produce valid knowledge? Since words \ndo not apply to actual objects or particulars which are ineffable, \nŚāntarakṣita, like his predecessors Dharmakīrti \nand Dignāga, needs to explain how it is that we are talking \nabout the world, while at the same time making it clear that we are \nnot talking about the world, but our conceptual scheme. Yet he also \nmust make clear that all conceptual schemes are not equal in that \nsome can produce valid knowledge and some fail to do so. There must \nbe a degree of non-arbitrariness to language if inference is to be \nconsidered as a source of valid knowledge. There are true and false \nstatements and consequences for beliefs about them. So the challenge \nis: how does one link the ineffable world of particulars to language? \n\nEach of the pramāṇavāda thinkers, including \nŚāntarakṣita, begin to address these questions with \nvariations on a theory initiated by Dignāga and fine-tuned by \nDharmakīrti and his followers, known as exclusion \n(apoha) theory. Dignāga’s response to the problem \nbegins by claiming that language does not refer to universals, as one\nmight presume a Buddhist would argue, but rather, through a negative \nprocess of exclusions or apoha, eliminates that which \ncontradicts the referred object. Words talk about entities in so far \nas they are qualified by the negation of other things. Though nothing\naffirmative is said about reality, by use of exclusions, there is a \nrelationship between concepts and particulars. Apoha or \nexclusions typically involves a double negation. Because in Buddhism \nthe absence of something is a fiction in that absences are not caused\nand do not function, exclusions can be used to explain away \nuniversals as the referents of words. Because negations are fictions,\nthis lightens the ontological commitment. A distinction is drawn \nbetween entities and pseudo-entities. Only particulars are real; \nnegations are not real, but they are also not universals. Universals \nare positive or affirmative, whereas exclusions are negative. \nDignāga’s position is explained quite succinctly by Bimal \nMatilal: \n\nDignāga argues for a way in which language can be construed to \nsignify particulars, through a double negation that excludes that \nwhich contradicts the referent object while eliminating the \nphilosophical commitment to universals. Though the process of \nexclusion seems quite cumbersome, in actuality our language formation\nand conceptual processes seem to engage in it quite naturally. \n\nDharmakīrti adds several components to the thought of \nDignāga on these issues concerning valid knowledge. In defining \nperception as a source or means of valid knowledge, Dharmakīrti \ndescribes it as that cognition that is free from conceptuality \nand non-erroneous. The inclusion of the qualification of it \nbeing non-erroneous eliminates erroneous non-conceptual cognitions, \nsuch as mistakenly seeing two moons, from the category of valid \nknowledge. Dharmakīrti further distinguishes two ways of \napprehending objects: through perceptions which apprehend real \nobjects positively, as they are, through the mediation of images \n(ākāra) which perfectly reflect them, and through \nconcepts which get at their objects negatively, through the \nelimination of their opposites. Dharmakīrti’s insight is found \nin the connection he draws between reality and the conceptual realm \nof universals. For Dharmakīrti, experience and representations \nare the bridge. We construct concepts out of our experiences and \nrepresentations of functional resemblances of real entities. In other\nwords, we can validly group together representations of actually \nunique entities on the basis that they can be excluded from the class\nof things that do not perform a given function. Georges Dreyfus put \nit well: \n\nIn other words, there are several components to Dharmakīrti’s \nexclusion theory: the entity or particular, the image or \nrepresentation, and the exclusion. First there are real events of \nreal entities. Then there is a perception that has the mark of a real\nentity because it is caused by something real. It is a mirror-like \nimage of the real. This is followed by a conceptual representation \nsuperimposed on a real image. This is part real, part concept. \nFinally, after this is done, there is an assumption of commonality \nwith other conceptual representations. This assumption is unreal and \nis the basis of the exclusion or universal. It derives not from the \nreality of common characteristics, but judgments of similarity. This \nis where concepts are conceived of as representing properties that \nare thought to exist in the world, such as permanence, which in fact \ndo not. But it is through this process of exclusion that one can \nutilize positive language with the understanding that that language \nonly refers to a common negation. \n\nŚāntarakṣita’s treatment of these issues largely \nrevolves around a response to the criticisms of non-Buddhists such as\nKumārila and Uddyotakara. Kumārila levels three criticisms \nof apoha theory in particular: that it is circular, that it \nis counter-intuitive, and that it is redundant. \nŚāntarakṣita’s response to these criticisms begins by\ndescribing three primary types of negations which he equates with \nexclusions: non-implicative negations (niṣedha, med \ndgag) and two types of implicative negations \n(paryudāsa, ma yin dgag): mental exclusions and object \nexclusions. A non-implicative negation is a negation that does not \nimply the existence of some other thing. For example, the negation of\nthe existence of flowers that grows in the sky does not imply the \nexistence of other plants that grow in the sky. It is a mere negation\nwith nothing implied. On the other hand, implicative negations, while\ndenying the existence of one thing, imply the existence of another. \nAn example of an implicative negation would be if we were told that\neither my aunt or my uncle came over last night.  If my aunt did \nnot come, it implies that my uncle did.  Thus, there is \nsomething implied by the negation. Among the types of implicative \nnegations, Śāntarakṣita includes mental exclusions. \nIt is important to point out here that for \nŚāntarakṣita, negations and exclusions are virtually \nsynonymous. Mental exclusions are conceptual representations that \nrelate to the appearances or representations of entities, as \ndiscussed by Dignāga. Object exclusions are not conceptual \nrepresentations of mere appearances or representations, but rather \ncan relate to the real world. Thus, this form of exclusion is a real \nthing for Śāntarakṣita. It is these three types of \nexclusions that form the basis of Śāntarakṣita’s \nthought on this topic, the basis of his psychological interpretation \nof apoha, and the basis of his response to the critics of \nDharmakīriti’s apoha theory, such as Kumārila. \n\nIn addition to the three types of exclusions, central to \nŚāntarakṣita’s thought on the topic is his unique \npresentation of representations and the psychological dimensions to \nhis exclusion \n theory.[19]\n According to Śāntarakṣita, it is our experiences of \nunifying similarities among representations that gives rise to our \nconceptual constructs. Mental representations of objects are \nexclusions because they exclude other representations. These \nconceptual representations are misconstrued to be the actual objects \nsince the actual objects do not exist in them. For \nŚāntarakṣita, both the exclusion of that which is \nother than real particular and the exclusion of that which is other \nthan the representation are both apohas or exclusions. The \npsychological dimension to exclusion is particularly important in \nŚāntarakṣita’s apoha theory in that he \nemphasizes the role of negation in relation to mental representations\nand mental events in the conceptualizing process. For \nDharmakīrti, universals are the objects of concepts. \nŚāntarakṣita agrees with this point but stresses that\nthe concept is the mental representation or mental event and that is \nan exclusion, whereas for Dharmakīrti the representations are \nthe basis which supports the exclusions and concepts. For \nDharmakīrti, exclusions are conceptual fictions, whereas for \nŚāntarakṣita they can be real entities. \n\nŚāntarakṣita considers that he is fully able to \nrespond to the criticisms of Kumārila with his presentation of \nexclusions. For example, Kumārila charges that the Buddhist \napoha theories are counter-intuitive in that our intuition \nis not that words and concepts refer to negations or exclusions. \nŚāntarakṣita argues that Kumārila misunderstands\napoha to always be non-implicative negations. He misses the \ntwo types of implicative negations that Śāntarakṣita \nclearly specifies as included among forms of exclusions. For \nŚāntarakṣita, when we use words, the objects of such \nconceptual thoughts are the real objects. They are the indirect \nobject of the exclusion that is a form of implicative negation, which\nincludes negative aspects by implication. Thus, words can be \nindicative of positive elements. The external object implies the \nimage plus the exclusion of that which is other. The words or \nconcepts thus take external objects as their objects and imply the \nconceptual exclusions. Thus when Kumārila mistakes all \nexclusions to be non-implicative negations, he misses this key \ncomponent to the psychological functions at work and mistakes \napoha theory to be counter-intuitive. \n\nKumārila’s charge of circularity in apoha theory is one\nof the most critical for its defenders to answer. The main thrust of \nthe argument was already found in Uddyotakara’s \nNyāyavārttika, where he argues that apoha\nentails the problems of circularity and denotationism (which \napoha theorists consider it is imperative to avoid). This is\nthe case because there must be an affirmative denotation between \nwords and particulars since the negation of an object implies that \none first have a positive understanding of the object. One must first\nhave an affirmative understanding before one can negate its \nexclusion. Dreyfus summarizes Kumārila’s presentation of the \nargument succinctly as follows: \n\nIn other words, Kumārila argues that since a conceptual \nunderstanding of a cow is simply an understanding of non-non-cow \naccording to apoha theory, that in order to understand \nnon-non-cow, one must already understand cow. Thus, apoha \ntheory must resort to circularity, or perhaps even more precisely, it\nlacks a beginning point for the circle in the first place. \nUddyotakara emphasizes that the only way out is to resort to a \nlinguistic denotationism that apoha theorists want to avoid.\nKumārila stresses the interdependence of knowing cow and knowing\nnon-cow and not non-cow. Both question how a double negation is \nsomething other than a positive universal. \n\nThe crux of Śāntarakṣita’s response, again, relies on\nhis presentation of three types of exclusions, specifically the \nmental exclusion that is signified by words, a point he feels both \nUddyotakara and Kumārila fail to recognize. According to \nŚāntarakṣita, there is a conceptual image that is an \nexclusion that is generated in the mind of one who hears the words, \n“This animal is a cow,” for example, but that this idea \nis an implicative negation that only implies that this animal is not \na non-cow. According to Śāntarakṣita, the problem of \ncircularity is thus avoided by a proper understanding of implicative \nnegations: to understand cow one need not understand non-cow, but \nrather the mere idea of cow. Like Dharmakīrti, \nŚāntarakṣita relies on a judgment of similarity in \nfunctional efficacy among distinct particulars as conceptually \nconstrued to generate the idea. For Śāntarakṣita the \nemphasis is on similarity among the mental representations of them. \nŚāntarakṣita and Dharmakīrti both argue that \nthere is not a problem with grouping things as x and \nnon-x. The distinction between similar and dissimilar \nclasses is made and the word merely applied to indicate this \nunderstood distinction. For Śāntarakṣita, based on \njudgments of similarity, the classes of cows and non-cows are \nestablished. It is the word that is applied to them which is not \nestablished. It is the word that is used to indicate this judgment of\nsimilarity at the discretion of the speaker. Thus, for \nŚāntarakṣita, the perceived problem of circularity by\nUddyotakara and Kumārila is due to their misunderstanding of \nexclusions and negations. \n\nŚāntarakṣita’s response to Hindu critics of \napoha and the interpretive innovations that spring from it \nrepresent a critical juncture in Buddhist logico-epistemological \nthought. Though we see examples of integration of \npramāṇavāda thinking into the ideas of a \nMādhyamika philosopher, most notably with Bhāviveka, it is not\nuntil Śāntarakṣita that we see this marriage of ideas\nfully integrated and spelled out in a sophisticated way. It is \ndifficult to overstate the tremendous impact this marriage of two \nmajor strands of late Indian philosophical thought in \nŚāntarakṣita had on the philosophical traditions of \nTibet.
