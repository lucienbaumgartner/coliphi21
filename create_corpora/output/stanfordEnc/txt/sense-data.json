For instance, sense data theorists say that, \nupon viewing a tomato in normal conditions, one forms an image of the\ntomato in one's mind. This image is red and round. The mental image \nis an example of a “sense datum.” Many philosophers have \nrejected the notion of sense data, either because they believe that \nperception gives us direct awareness of physical phenomena, \nrather than mere mental images, or because they believe that the \nmental phenomena involved in perception do not have the \nproperties that appear to us (for instance, I might have a visual \nexperience representing a red, round tomato, but my experience is not\nitself red or round). Defenders of sense data have argued, among \nother things, that sense data are required to explain such phenomena \nas perspectival variation, illusion, and hallucination. Critics of \nsense data have objected to the theory's commitment to mind-body \ndualism, the problems it raises for our knowledge of the external \nworld, its difficulty in locating sense data in physical space, and \nits apparent commitment to the existence of objects with \nindeterminate properties. \n\n\n\nOn the most common conception, sense data (singular:\n “sense datum”) \nhave three defining characteristics:  \n\nEach of those conditions calls for clarification. \n\nFirst, condition (i): Everyone in the philosophy of perception agrees\nthat perception makes us aware of something. Most hold that there is \na distinction between the things perception makes us \ndirectly aware of, and the things it makes us \nindirectly aware of, where to be indirectly aware of \nsomething is, roughly, to be aware of it in a way that depends on the\nawareness of something else. There are at least two ways of further \nexplicating this notion. One way, adopted by Jackson (1977, pp. \n15–20), is to say that we perceive something indirectly if we \nperceive it by virtue of perceiving something else. For \nexample, consider my perception of the table in front of me. I do not\nperceive all of the table; I can only see its outer surface, and \nindeed only the portion of that surface facing me. Yet we still say \nthat I see the table. I count as seeing the table by virtue \nof seeing something else, namely, the facing surface of the \ntable. Therefore, Jackson would say that I see the table only \nindirectly. Sense data, on this view, are things that one may \nperceive not by virtue of perceiving anything else. \n\nAnother way of distinguishing direct and indirect awareness is to \nsay, roughly, that one has indirect awareness of x when \none's awareness of x is caused by one's awareness of \nsomething else (see Huemer [2001, pp. 55–7] for a more spelled-out \nversion of this approach). For instance, I might wish to determine \nthe temperature of a pot of water indirectly, by means of a \nthermometer, rather than sticking my hand in the water. In such a \ncase, I would first become aware of the reading on the thermometer, \nand this would cause me to be aware of the temperature of the water. \nThus, my awareness of the water's temperature would be indirect. On \nthis view, sense data would be things our awareness of which is not \ncausally dependent on any other awareness. \n\nSecond, condition (ii): Sense data theorists believe that the things \nwe are directly aware of in perception are dependent on the mind of \nthe perceiver — they cannot exist unperceived. Such things have\nalso sometimes been called “mental images,” \n“ideas,” “impressions,” \n“appearances,” or “percepts.” \n\nThird, condition (iii): “The properties that perceptually \nappear to us” refers to the qualities we seem to perceive \nthings around us to have. For instance, if I perceive a tomato, and \nit looks red and round to me, then redness and roundness are \nproperties that perceptually appear to me. According to those who \nbelieve in sense data, there is in this case a thing that I am \ndirectly aware of, which is both red and round, and which \ndepends on my mind for its existence. Condition (iii) holds true even\nif I am subject to a sensory illusion or hallucination. Thus, if the \ntomato is really green, but, due to some sort of color illusion, it \nlooks red to me, then my sense datum is red, not green. \nFurthermore, if there is no tomato present in reality, but I am \nhallucinating a tomato, then I will be having a tomato-like sense \ndatum. \n\nThose who accept sense data believe that sense data exist whenever a \nperson perceives anything, by any of the senses, and also whenever a \nperson has an experience qualitatively like perceiving, such\nas a hallucination. \n\nSo construed, the sense data theory contrasts with two competing \nschools of thought in the philosophy of perception. First, direct\nrealism holds that in perception, we are directly aware of \nphysical phenomena and only physical phenomena — for example, a\ntable, or a portion of a table's surface. Direct realists thus deny \nthat there is anything satisfying both conditions (i) and (ii) above,\nand therefore deny that there are sense data. Direct realism itself \ncomes in at least two varieties: a disjunctivist variety \n(McDowell 1994; Dancy 1995) and an intentionalist variety \n(Armstrong 1961; Searle 1983; Huemer 2001). \n\nSecond, the adverbial theory, in one version, holds that in \nperception, we are directly aware of a certain kind of mental state \nor occurrence, but that this mental state does not actually possess \nthe properties that appear to us (Chisholm 1977, pp. 29–30). \nAdverbialists have been known to characterize this mental state in \nsuch terms as “being appeared to redly.” When a person is\nin the mental state of being appeared to redly, say the \nadverbialists, it does not follow that anything is actually \nred. Thus, adverbialists deny that there is anything \nsatisfying all of conditions (i), (ii), and (iii), and therefore deny\nthat there are sense data. \n\nThose who accept sense data believe that sense data exist whenever a \nperson perceives anything, by any of the senses, and also whenever a \nperson has an experience qualitatively like perceiving, such\nas a hallucination. \n\nThe term “sense data” has not always been used in the\nsense described above. Indeed, when the term was first introduced by\nearly 20th-century philosophers such as H. H. Price, G. E.\nMoore, and Bertrand Russell, it was intended only to denote that which\nwe are directly aware of in perception. The term's meaning was\nsupposed to be neutral between direct and indirect realist theories of\nperception, so that it was not to be assumed either that sense data\nmust by definition be mind-dependent or that they must be\nmind-independent (Russell 1912 [1997], p. 12; Moore 1953,\np. 30). Thus, G.E.  Moore debated with himself, inconclusively, about\nwhether “sense data” were or were not typically parts of\nthe surfaces of physical objects. Broad (1925) thought sense data were\nneither mental nor physical. And more recently, Bermúdez (2000)\nhas defended what he calls a sense data theory, according to which the\nsurfaces of visually perceived physical objects are “sense\ndata.” \n\nHowever, those who have used the term “sense data” have \nso frequently concluded that what we are directly aware of in \nperception is, in fact, dependent on the mind that the term is now \nusually understood to import an assumption of mind-dependence. \n\nSense data theorists have also differed over exactly how to describe \nthe mind's relation to its sense data. Most sense data theorists have\nsaid that we perceive sense data or, in the case of visual \nsense data, that we literally see them (Jackson 1977; Ayer \n1958; O'Shaughnessy 2003). Others say only that we are aware \nof, are acquainted with, or simply sense sense\ndata (Robinson 1994; Price 1950, pp. 3–4), perhaps with the thought \nthat the terms “perceive”, “see,” and the \nlike should be reserved for our relation to the physical objects that\ncause our sense data. \n\nIn the remainder of this article, sense data are understood in the \nsense articulated in section 1.1, and the Sense Data Theory is \nunderstood simply as the theory that there are such things, that is, \nthat in perception one is directly aware of mind-dependent things \nthat have the properties that perceptually appear to us. \n\nThe sense data theory was very popular, perhaps the orthodox view in \nthe philosophy of perception, in the early twentieth century. The \ntheory was advanced by Russell (1912); Broad (1925); Price (1950); \nand Ayer (1956). Moore (1953, pp. 40–44) described the theory as \n“the accepted view,” though he neither endorsed nor \nrejected the theory himself. (Though Moore uses the term “sense\ndata,” he does not suppose that what he calls “sense \ndata” must be mental.) Since the mid-twentieth century, the \nview's popularity greatly declined, though several philosophers have \ncontinued to defend it (Jackson 1977; Robinson 1994; Casullo 1987; \nGarcia-Carpintero 2001; O'Shaughnessy 2003). \n\nWhy has this theory been popular? A variety of arguments have been \ngiven for recognizing sense data: \n\nPerspectival variation is the kind of variation in one's sensory\nexperiences that normally attends changes in one's spatial or other\nphysical relationship to the physical objects one is observing.\nPerspectival variation, in this sense, is ubiquitous. For\ninstance, suppose you are viewing a table. If you move closer to or\nfarther from the table, your sensory experience changes. If you move\nlaterally relative to the table, your sensory experience will change\nin another way (Russell 1912 [1997], pp. 8–11). In a famous\npassage, Hume sought to use this phenomenon to show that what we are\nimmediately aware of in perception cannot be the real, external\nobjects, but must instead be only images in the mind: \n\nThis argument and others like it are commonly characterized as \nversions of “the argument from illusion,” though that \nlabel can be misleading, since the phenomenon Hume appeals to in the \npassage above is one of perspectival variation rather than \nillusion. In the present article, I distinguish the argument\nfrom perspectival variation from the argument from illusion proper; \nillusions will be discussed in the following section. \n\nThough Hume does not use the term “sense data,” the \nmental images for which he contends are what 20th-century \nthinkers labeled “sense data.” Here is one way of \nunderstanding Hume's argument: \n\nOnce we have agreed that the immediate object of awareness is not the\nreal, external object, we are then meant to infer that it must be \nsome sort of image of the physical object in our minds, which we \nperhaps confused with the physical object. \n\nAs Reid (1983, pp. 178–9) observes, the argument from (1) and (2) to \n(3) is invalid, since the first premise speaks of apparent change, \nwhereas the second premise concerns actual change. There is no \ncontradiction in maintaining that the external object \nappears to change but does not in fact change.  \n\nThe argument could be made logically valid by rendering it like so: \n\nNow critics of the argument will charge that premise (4) is false or \nquestion-begging (Austin 1962, p. 30; Jackson 1977, pp. 107-8; Huemer\n2001, p. 125) — it is at least as natural to say that the thing\nwe are directly aware of (namely, the physical object) merely appears\nto change without actually changing. Perhaps this is mistaken, but \nHume has given no independent reason for rejecting this initially \nplausible description of the situation. Sense data theorists have \noften held it to be intuitively obvious that when we are directly, \nperceptually aware of something, that thing must have the properties \nthat it appears to have (Price 1950, p. 3; Robinson 1994, p. 32; \nMartin 2000, pp. 218–19). Opponents of sense data have typically \nfound this assumption unmotivated; J. L. Austin, the best-known \ncritic of the argument from illusion and related arguments for sense \ndata, is a case in point: \n\nAustin's point seems to be that, just as a church can merely look\nlike a barn without there being anything that is a \nbarn, the table that we see in Hume's example may merely \nseem to get smaller, without there being anything that \nactually gets smaller. \n\nHere is an alternate way of making out the argument from perspectival\nvariation: \n\nModifications might be made to this argument to make it more \nplausible: the first premise might be put in counterfactual terms, \nrather than in terms of actual changes; “direct \nawareness” might replace “awareness”; and one might\nspecify more carefully in what respects the properties of experience \nmust covary with those of the object of awareness. Something like \nthis argument may be what Hume had in mind, if only implicitly. \n\nCritics of this version of the argument may question either premise. \nThomas Reid seems to deny premise (8), arguing that the external \nobject changes in respect of certain relational properties. For \ninstance, when one moves farther away from a table, the table's \nangular size relative to one's own position decreases, where\nthis is the size of the angle created by connecting the extremities of\nthe table to the point in space from which the table is viewed.\nThough this property is relational, the relationship involved is a\npurely physical one, holding between physical things such as the table\nand the eye, so it might be said that there is no need to introduce\nmind-dependent sense data as objects of awareness (Reid 1983,\npp. 176–8; Huemer 2001, pp. 120–23; Cornman 1975,\npp. 58–9). \n\nThe Argument from Illusion is the best-known and most historically\ninfluential argument for the existence of sense data. An illusion is a\ncase in which one perceives an object, but the object is not the way\nit appears in some respects. For instance, when one views a straight\nstick half-submerged in water, the stick may appear bent.  Since it is\nnot in fact bent, this is an illusion. Some philosophers have argued\nthat the possibility of such sensory illusions shows that what we are\ndirectly aware of in perception is never the real, physical object\n(Ayer 1963, pp. 3–11). Using the bent-stick illusion as an\nexample, one might argue: \n\nA background assumption is that there is only one stick-like thing \nthat one sees in the example, and that thing is either an actual, \nphysical stick, or a sense datum of a stick. The argument concludes \nthat it is not the physical stick, so it must be a sense datum. \n\nStep (4) seems plausible, since one can imagine first perceiving the \nstick normally, and then moving it into the water. It would be \nimplausible to maintain that one is seeing the physical stick up to \nthe moment when it touches the water, at which point the object of \none's awareness suddenly changes to a sense datum. \n\nOpponents of sense data object to premise (1) on grounds similar to \nthose considered in section 2.1: namely, it may be that what one is \ndirectly aware of merely appears bent but is not in fact bent. Sense \ndata theorists and their opponents, again, disagree over whether an \nobject of direct awareness must have exactly the features it appears \nto have. \n\nHaving been taken to task by Austin (1962) over the argument from \nillusion, A. J. Ayer sought to defend sense data by another argument \n(though Ayer seems to think it is the same argument): \n\nBy “judgements of perception,” Ayer means beliefs about \nthe physical world that express what we seem to perceive to be the \ncase; for instance, when I see a chair, I normally make the \n“perceptual judgement” that a physical chair is present. \nAyer's central premise seems to be that all such beliefs about the \nphysical world are fallible; somehow, this is supposed to force the \nconclusion that such beliefs are inferential. That, in turn, is \nsupposed to support the sense data theory. \n\nPerhaps Ayer's implicit reasoning is this: \n\nConclusion (5) does not suffice to establish the existence of sense \ndata, but by ruling out the competing direct realist theory, it would\ntake Ayer a considerable distance towards vindicating the sense data \ntheory. If beliefs about sense data could plausibly be claimed to be \ninfallible, and if one assumes a foundationalist epistemology, \nbeliefs about sense data would be prime candidates for constituting \nnon-inferential knowledge. This would make sense data very plausible \ncandidates for objects of direct awareness. \n\nUnfortunately, Ayer gives no motivation for premise (2), which is \nrejected by most contemporary foundationalists (Audi 1983; Alston \n1976; Huemer 2001, pp. 100–101). \n\nA hallucination is a case in which one has an experience \nqualitatively like perception, but there is no external object that \none is perceiving. For instance, a large dose of LSD might cause me \nto have an experience of seeming to see a pink rat on this table, \nwhere there is in reality nothing pink-rat-like. \n\nSome believe that the possibility of hallucinations shows that even \nnormal perception always involves sense data (Robinson 1994, pp. \n151–62; Jackson 1977, pp. 50ff.). Imagine two people, Sally and Sam, \neach of whom is having an experience of seeming to see a pineapple. \nSally is simply perceiving a pineapple in the normal way. Sam, \nhowever, is having an incredibly realistic hallucination of a \npineapple, induced by brain scientists who have sophisticated \ntechnology for electrically stimulating Sam's brain. And suppose, as \nis theoretically possible, that the brain state causally relevant to \nSally's visual experience is the same as the brain state causally \nrelevant to Sam's visual experience. I will call this brain state B. \nSam would be unable to distinguish his experience from a normal \nperception of a pineapple. \n\nIn this scenario, what is Sam directly aware of? Surely not a \nphysical pineapple, since no physical pineapple is present. It seems,\nthen, that he must be aware of a mere mental image of a pineapple. \nThis mental image is caused by brain state B. \n\nNow, what about Sally? Sally's brain state was caused in a different \nway from Sam's — Sally's was caused by a real pineapple, \nwhereas Sam's was caused by the brain scientists. But that does not \nchange the fact that Sally is now in the same brain state as Sam. We \nhave already said that in Sam, brain state B caused a mental image of\na pineapple. Therefore, it seems that if someone else were to have \nstate B, it would also cause a mental image of a pineapple for them. \nTherefore, it seems that Sally must also be having a mental image of \na pineapple, since she is in state B. Therefore, normal perception \ninvolves sense data, just as hallucination does. This argument relies\non the principle that, if a causal chain of events leads to some \neffect, E, then any series of events that duplicates the last \nmember of the causal chain will also produce E, regardless of \nwhether the earlier members of the chain are duplicated. As long as \nSally and Sam get into the same brain state, regardless of how they \ngot there, both should experience whatever effects result from that \nbrain state. \n\nOne way for a critic of sense data to respond to this argument would \nbe to deny that state B causes Sam to have a mental object of \nawareness. According to the intentionalist account of \nperception, what Sam has is a mental state that falsely represents \nthere to be a pineapple. Sally also has a mental state that \nrepresents there to be a pineapple, though in her case the \nrepresentation is true. It may be held that Sam's mental state has \nno object of awareness since it is entirely false, whereas \nSally's mental state has the physical pineapple as its object of \nawareness. Thus, in neither case must we posit a mental object of \nawareness, as in the sense data theory (Huemer 2001, pp. 127–8). \n\nHume tells us that one can induce a case of double vision in oneself \nby merely pushing on one eye with one's finger. The possibility of \ndouble vision, he believes, shows that the immediate objects of \nawareness in perception are not the real, physical objects (Hume \n1739, I.IV.ii; see also Broad 1925, pp. 187–8). The intended argument\nmay be something like this:  \n\nIt would be implausible to maintain that one of the two things is a \nsense datum while the other is a real object. One reason this would \nbe implausible is that there seems to be nothing relevantly different\nbetween the two things that could make one of them the \n“real” object. Therefore, one should conclude that both \nof the things one sees are sense data, rather than physical objects. \n\nCritics might respond to this argument by claiming that in a case of \ndouble vision, rather than seeing two things, one sees a single thing\nthat merely appears to be in each of two places (Huemer \n2001, pp. 130–31). \n\nThere is always a time delay between any event in the physical world \nand our perception of it. This is most stark in the case of distant \nstars, which may burn out and yet still be “seen” \nthousands of years later, as the light continues to travel the \ndistance between the star and us.  \n\nImagine two individuals, Sally and Sam, who are each looking up at \nthe night sky and “seeing” — or seeming to see \n— qualitatively similar stars. The star responsible for Sally's\nexperience still exists. But the star ultimately responsible for \nSam's experience ceased to exist 1000 years ago. Sam still \n“sees” it because the star was over 1000 light years \naway. \n\nWhat is Sam directly aware of? Surely not an actual star, since no\nstar presently exists in the place where he is looking. It must be a\nmere mental image of a star that he is directly aware of. Just as in\nthe case of the argument from hallucination, we can now argue that\nsince Sally is in the same brain state as Sam, she must also be having\na mental image of a star. Therefore, sense data are involved in normal\nperception, even when the physical object responsible for the\nperception still exists. (Russell 1912 [1997], p. 33; Robinson 1994,\npp.  80–84. Ayer [1956, pp. 102–4] discusses the argument\nwithout endorsing it.) \n\nOne might be tempted to say that what Sam sees is light \nrays, rather than a sense datum. But if the time gap shows that \nSam does not directly perceive the star, it must also show that Sam \ndoes not directly perceive anything else outside of him either, since\nthere is some time delay, however small, between any \nexternal event and Sam's corresponding sensory experience. Sam's \nvisual experience as of a star will occur at least slightly later \nthan the light rays strike his retina. \n\nThe natural reply for theorists wishing to resist sense data is to \nclaim that one can “see into the past,” that is, that \none's perceptual experiences may represent past states of affairs, or\nrepresent objects as they were at an earlier time (Cornman 1975, pp. \n49–50; Huemer 2001, pp. 131–5). \n\nMany philosophers have held that the so-called “secondary \nqualities” — including such qualities as colors, tastes, \nsmells, and sounds — do not exist in the external world, and \nthat we must instead recognize them as properties of sense data. \nConsider the case of colors. A sense data theorist might argue:  \n\n(See Russell 1912 [1997], pp. 8–11; Jackson 1977,\npp. 120–37; Robinson 1994, pp. 59–74.) The first premise\nseems obvious on its face. The second premise may seem unbelievable,\nbut there are several arguments for it. \n\nOne of these arguments appeals to differences of color perception \namong people. Not only color blind people, but even people with \nnormal vision differ among themselves slightly in how they perceive \nthe colors of things (Hardin 1988, pp. 79–80; Byrne and Hilbert 1997,\npp. 272–4). If colors are really out there, then there would have to \nbe an answer to the question, Whose color perceptions are right? But \nnot only is there no way of determining the answer to that; it seems \nhard to think of what facts might make one person's color perceptions\nmore correct than another's. A related argument appeals to the \ndifferences of color perception among different species of animals \n(on these differences, see Jacobs 1981, chapter 5; Varela et al. \n1993). Again, there seems no answer to the question of which species \nis right. \n\nAnother argument appeals to the fact that our experiences of color \nare caused by the wavelengths of light that physical objects reflect.\nTherefore, it seems that if colors belong to physical objects, they \nmust be reducible to spectral reflectance distributions (as Byrne and\nHilbert [1997] claim). However, there is in general no single \nspectral reflectance distribution, or even a single continuous range \nof spectral reflectance distributions, corresponding to each of the \ncolors we see. Two objects with very different spectral reflectance \ndistributions may both appear orange to us in normal lighting \nconditions, for example. (This phenomenon is known as \n“metamerism.”) Some believe that this fact precludes our \nreducing colors to spectral reflectance properties (Hardin 1988, pp. \n7, 46–8). \n\nSome philosophers hold that colors are dispositions to cause certain \nkinds of sensory experiences in us, rather than dispositions to \nreflect light in certain ways. But others object that this is not so,\nbecause colors ought to be properties that we directly perceive \nthings to have, whereas we do not perceive things as having \ndispositions to cause experiences in us. \n\nThere is a good deal to be said about color, and a good deal yet to \nbe resolved. The ultimate acceptability of premise (2) of the above \nargument will turn on whether some reductive theory of the nature of \ncolors is defensible. \n\nThe sense data theory has been subjected to at least four main kinds \nof objection. \n\nOne reason the sense data theory has lost favor is no doubt the \nascendance of physicalism in the philosophy of mind. \nPhysicalists believe that the world is entirely physical; in \nparticular, they believe that mental states either do not exist or \nare reducible to physical states, such as brain states. Physicalism \nis contrasted with dualism, which holds that mental \nstates/events are distinct from physical states/events.  \n\nFor various reasons, most contemporary thinkers in philosophy of mind\nembrace some form of physicalism and reject dualism. If they are \nright to do so, then there is a reason for rejecting sense data: \nnamely, that sense data do not seem to fit into the physicalist \npicture (Martin [2000, p. 222] discusses but does not endorse this \nline of thought). \n\nSense data are supposed to have the properties that perceptually \nappear to us. But, in cases of normal perception, the only \nphysical things that have the properties that perceptually \nappear to us are the external objects that the direct realists say we\nare perceiving; and in cases of illusions and hallucinations, there \nare no physical things that have the properties that perceptually \nappear to us. In particular, our brain states manifestly do not \nordinarily have the properties that perceptually appear to us (except\nin the odd case that we happen to be looking at a brain). So sense \ndata, if they exist, must be non-physical things. \n\nO'Shaughnessy (2003, p. 186) seeks to avoid this consequence by \ndistinguishing the place where a sense-datum is from the \nplace where it “is given experientially to us”. \nPresumably he would draw a similar distinction for other properties \nof the sense-datum. His view seems to be that sense data might be \nidentical with brain states, so that the sense data one experiences \nwould in fact have the properties, such as shape, location, and \nperhaps color, of one's brain states, even though they are given \nexperientially as having different and incompatible sets of \nproperties. O'Shaughnessy does not explain what it is for a thing to \nbe given experientially as having a property, but he seems to be \nabandoning the traditional doctrine that sense data literally have \nthe features that perceptually appear to us. \n\nA more perspicuous response to the argument from physicalism is to \nsimply embrace mind-body dualism (Jackson 1982). \n\nAt least three sorts of epistemological objections to the sense data \ntheory have been raised. The first and most common charge is that the\nsense data theory leaves us vulnerable to external world skepticism. \nIf we are only ever directly aware of our own sense data and other \nnonphysical phenomena, it is said, then it is unclear what reason we \nhave for believing anything physical exists. Sense data theorists \nwill generally admit that it is logically possible that someone \nshould have exactly the same sense data that I, for example, have, \nand yet for there to be no physical objects around that person of the\nkind that I take myself to be surrounded by. Berkeley (1710, section \n20) famously took this point to show that I have no good reason for \nbelieving in such physical objects. However, as Jackson (1977, pp. \n141–2) observes, the point really shows only that we cannot validly \ndeduce the existence of physical things from facts about our\nsense data; it remains open that we might infer the existence of \nphysical things non-demonstratively. To rule this out, one may appeal\nto Hume's (1758, XII.1) skeptical argument, according to which all \nnon-demonstrative reasoning proceeds by induction, and all inductive \nreasoning consists in generalizing from past experience. On this \nview, in order to non-demonstratively infer any conclusion about \nphysical objects, one must first have past experience of physical \nobjects from which one might draw generalizations. If, as the sense \ndata theory holds, one's immediate experience only ever concerns \nsense data, then one's inductive inferences can only draw \ngeneralizations about sense data. \n\nSense data theorists can respond to this skeptical challenge by\nproposing that our beliefs about the physical world are justified by\ninference to the best explanation (Jackson 1977, pp. 142–5;\nRussell 1912 [1997], pp. 22–4). Consider an analogy: we know of\nthe existence of molecules, despite never having directly observed a\nmolecule, because the theory that posits molecules provides the best\nexplanation for certain other things we know about the behavior of\nmacroscopic bodies. Similarly, perhaps we know of the existence of\nphysical objects in general, despite never having directly observed\none, because the theory that posits physical objects provides the best\nexplanation for other things that we know about the behavior of sense\ndata. \n\nA second broadly epistemological objection claims that the sense data\ntheorist cannot account for our having the concept of physical \nobjects, or for our ability to conceive of the properties of physical\nobjects. This is because, according to the sense data theory, \nphysical objects in principle cannot be directly observed in the way \nsense data can. Thus, while a sense datum may, for example, be red \nand round, all physical objects are invisible (they cannot \nbe seen). It makes no sense to say that a color resembles something \nthat is invisible, and similar arguments could be made for all other \nobservable properties besides color; therefore, physical objects \ncannot in principle resemble sense data. Since we are supposedly \nnever directly aware of physical objects or their properties, and \nthey cannot resemble the things we are directly aware of, it is \nargued that we could have no conception of the nature of physical \nobjects (Berkeley 1710, sections 8–10; Searle 1983, pp. 59–60). \n\nSense data theorists will reply first by denying that on their view \nphysical objects are “invisible.” Rather, their view is \nthat what it is to see a physical object is to have a sense \ndatum representing that object, so physical objects are, on their \nview, often seen (O'Shaughnessy 2003, pp. 175, 178–9). Second, the \nobjection of the preceding paragraph gains undeserved plausibility \nfrom the use of the word “resemble.” The statement that A\nresembles B may be taken to mean that A looks like B. Sense \ndata theorists are not committed to claiming that sense data look\nlike physical objects. They are, however, committed to claiming \nthat sense data have at least some of the properties that \nphysical objects typically have. In particular, most sense data \ntheorists will agree that physical objects, like sense data, have \nshapes, though they will typically deny that physical objects have \ncolors or other secondary qualities (Locke 1689, II.viii; Jackson \n1977, 120–37). Pace Berkeley, it is not unintelligible to speak of an\nobject one is directly aware of having the same shape as an object \none cannot be directly aware of. No one thinks, for example, that \nbecause an individual H2O molecule cannot be seen, it is \ntherefore unintelligible to speak of the molecule's shape. \n\nA third epistemological objection derives from Wilfrid Sellars \n(2000), who questions the traditional account of foundational \nempirical knowledge (knowledge that comes immediately from \nexperience). The epistemological view traditionally taken by sense \ndata theorists has been roughly along these lines (Russell 1912): \n\nThe first epistemological objection discussed above questions step \n(d). Sellars, however, questions step (c). He poses a dilemma for \nsense data theorists: either the immediate awareness of a sense datum\nmentioned in (b) and (c) is propositional in form (that is, \nit is the awareness that the sense datum has F, where F is some \nproperty), or it is non-propositional. If the awareness is \npropositional, says Sellars, then it requires the application of \nconcepts. For instance, to be aware that a sense datum is red, one \nmust first have the concept of redness. This is problematic,\nbecause it is generally thought that perceptual awareness ought to \nprecede and be independent of concepts. On the other hand, if the \nawareness in step (b) is non-propositional, then it cannot give one \nthe knowledge posited in step (c), because that knowledge is\npropositional — it involves the knowledge that one's sense \ndatum is of a certain kind — and a non-propositional state \ncannot support a proposition (Sellars 2000, part I). \n\nOne reply on behalf of the sense data theorist is to note that \nSellars' dilemma is not particularly directed at the sense data \ntheory, despite that Sellars formulates it in those terms. That is, \nif Sellars' argument is compelling, a version of it would apply \nequally well to direct realist, idealist, or adverbial theories of \nperception. Sellars' real objection is to the idea of any \nform of direct awareness providing us with knowledge, whether it be \nawareness of sense data, physical objects, states of being appeared \nto, or anything else. Sellars' intended solution to the problem seems\nto lie in the direction of a coherence theory of justification. But \nit is unclear why a sense data theorist could not equally appeal to \nconsiderations of coherence, despite that historically all or most \nsense data theorists have in fact been foundationalists. \n\nA second reply, on behalf of the sense data foundationalist, is that \nSellars has confused propositional awareness with conceptual \nawareness. One might enjoy an immediate awareness of a sense datum as\nhaving a certain specific shade of color for which one has no \npreexisting concept. The awareness would thus be non-conceptual but \npropositional: one is aware of the fact that a is \nF, where a is the sense datum and F is the\nunconceptualized property one senses it as having (Huemer [2001, pp. \n71–7] takes a similar line, but adapted to a direct realist view). \n\nIf sense data have the properties that perceptually appear to us, \nthen among other things, visual sense data have sizes and shapes. If \nso, then they occupy space. It is therefore fair to ask where in \nspace they are located. But there does not seem to be any plausible \nanswer to this (Huemer 2001, pp. 149–68). \n\nA further objection to both answers (2) and (3) is that they conflict\nwith the special theory of relativity, since in some cases, they \nwould require one's brain state to cause a sense datum to appear \noutside one's forward light cone, and the theory of relativity \nprecludes causal relations with events so situated. \n\nAs we have noted, sense data are supposed to have precisely the \nproperties that are presented to us in perceptual experience. If one \nhas an experience of seeming to see something red, then one's sense \ndatum is red; equally importantly, if one is not having an \nexperience of seeming to see something red, then one does \nnot have a red sense datum. \n\nA problem with this is raised by the observation that it is sometimes\nindeterminate what properties objects appear to us to have. To say \nthat it is indeterminate what properties an object appears to have is\nto say that the object appears to instantiate some \ndeterminable, but there is no specific determinate \nfalling under that determinable that it appears to instantiate. For \nexample, an object might appear to fall within a certain range of \ncolors, while there is no exact shade of color that it appears to \nhave. Chisholm (1942) discusses a case in which one sees a speckled \nhen for a moment, but one is unable to say how many speckles one saw.\nAyer (1963, pp. 124–5) implies that in such a case, there is no \ndefinite number of speckles that the sense datum had. Other, perhaps \nmore convincing pieces of evidence for indeterminate appearances \ninclude our inability to say exactly how far away certain objects \nseem to be, our inability in some cases to say merely on the basis of\nappearances whether two objects are the same color, and our inability\nto read blurred or far-away words. Hardin (1985) discusses \npsychological experiments that seem to demonstrate indeterminacy of \ncolor and shape appearances: in some cases, subjects can visually \ndetect the existence of an object without being able to make out any \napparent color, can detect motion without awareness of the shape or \ncolor of the moving object, and so on. \n\nIf the apparent properties of objects of perception are sometimes \nindeterminate, then the sense data involved would have to be \nmetaphysically indeterminate — that is, they would have to \nactually lack definite characteristics. This, however, is logically \nimpossible — an object cannot be speckled but have no \nparticular number of spots; an object cannot be colored but have no \nparticular shade of color; and so on. This sort of problem only \narises when, as sense data theorists do, one analyzes appearance in \nsuch a way that there must always be an actual object that has all \nand only the properties that appear to the subject (Huemer 2001, pp. \n168–73; Armstrong 1993, pp. 218–21). \n\nA related problem is raised by cases of inconsistent appearances, as \nin the case of the waterfall illusion. This is an illusion in which \nobjects appear, at each moment during an extended time interval, to \nbe moving, yet they never change their positions in the visual field.\nThe sense data theory would seem to demand sense data with \ninconsistent properties in such a case (Hardin 1985, p. 489). \n\nSense data theorists may respond to these problems by denying, pace \nAyer, that sense data have exactly the properties they appear to \nhave. It is unclear how much of the original motivation for \nintroducing “sense data” remains after the idea has been \nthus revised."}]
