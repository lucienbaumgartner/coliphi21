Their radically anti-metaphysical stance was supported by an\nempiricist criterion of meaningfulness and a broadly logicist conception of\nmathematics. They denied that any principle or claim was synthetic\na priori. Moreover, they sought to account for the\npresuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting such theories\nwithin a logical framework so that the important role played by\nconventions, either in the form of definitions or of other analytical\nframework principles, became evident. The Vienna Circle’s\ntheories were constantly changing. In spite (or perhaps because) of\nthis, they helped to provide the blueprint for analytical philosophy\nof science as meta-theory—a “second-order”\nreflection of “first-order” sciences. While the Vienna\nCircle’s early form of logical empiricism (or logical positivism\nor neopositivism: these labels will be used interchangeably here) no\nlonger represents an active research program, recent history of\nphilosophy of science has unearthed much previously neglected variety\nand depth in the doctrines of the Circle’s protagonists, some of\nwhose positions retain relevance for contemporary analytical\nphilosophy.\n\nWhile it is in the nature of philosophical movements and their leading\ndoctrines to court controversy, the Vienna Circle and its philosophies\ndid so more than most. To begin with, its members styled themselves as\nconceptual revolutionaries who cleared the stables of academic\nphilosophy by showing metaphysics not simply to be false, but to be\ncognitively empty and meaningless. In addition, they often associated\ntheir attempt to overcome metaphysics with their public engagement for\nscientific Enlightenment reason in the ever-darkening political\nsituation of 1920s and 1930s central Europe. Small wonder then that\nthe Vienna Circle has sharply divided opinion from the start. There is\nvery little beyond the basic facts of membership and its record of\npublications and conferences that can be asserted about it without\ncourting some degree of controversy. (For English-language survey\nmonographs and articles on the Vienna Circle, see Kraft 1950,\nJorgensen 1951, Ayer 1959b, Passmore 1967, Hanfling 1981, Stadler\n1998, Richardson 2003. Particularly rich in background and\nbio-bibliographical materials is Stadler 1997 [2015]. The best short\nintroductory book has remained untranslated: Haller 1993. For popular overviews see Sigmund 2015 [2018] and Edmonds [2020].) \nFortunately, more than three decades worth of recent scholarship in\nhistory of philosophy of science now allows at least some disputes to\nbe put into perspective. (See, e.g., the following at least in part\nEnglish-language collections of articles and research monographs:\nHaller 1982, McGuinness 1985, Rescher 1985, Gower 1987, Proust 1989,\nZolo 1989, Coffa 1991, Spohn 1991, Uebel 1991, Bell and Vossenkuhl\n1992, Sarkar 1992, Uebel 1992, Oberdan 1993, Stadler 1993, Cirera\n1994, Salmon and Wolters 1994, Cartwright, Cat, Fleck and Uebel 1996,\nGiere and Richardson 1996, Nemeth and Stadler 1996, Sarkar 1996,\nRichardson 1998, Friedman 1999, Wolenski and Köhler 1999, Fetzer\n2000, Friedman 2000, Bonk 2003, Hardcastle and Richardson 2003,\nParrini, Salmon and Salmon 2003, Stadler 2003, Awodey and Klein 2004,\nReisch 2005, Galavotti 2006, Carus 2007, Creath and Friedman 2007,\nNemeth, Schmitz and Uebel 2007, Richardson and Uebel 2007, Uebel 2007,\nWagner 2009, Manninen and Stadler 2010, McGuinness 2011, Symons, Pombo\nand Torres 2011, Creath 2012, Wagner 2012, Damböck 2016,\nPihlström, Stadler and Weidtmann 2017, Schiemer 2017, Tuboly 2017, Carus 2018, Cat and Tuboly 2019, Makovec and Shapiro 2019.) What distinguishes these works from valuable\ncollections like Schilpp 1963, Hintikka 1975 and Achinstein and Barker\n1979 is that the unspoken assumption, to have understood Vienna Circle\nphilosophy correctly enough so as to consider its consequences\nstraightforward, is questioned in the more recent\nscholarship. Many other pieces of new Vienna Circle scholarship are\nspread throughout philosophical journals and essay collections with\nmore systematic or wider historical scope; important work has also\nbeen done in German, Italian and French language publications but here\nmust remain unreferenced.) \nTwo facts must be clearly recognized if a proper evaluation of the\nVienna Circle is to be attempted. The first is, that, despite its\nrelatively short existence, even some of the most central theses of\nthe Vienna Circle underwent radical changes. The second is that its\nmembers were by no means of one mind in all important matters;\noccasionally they espoused perspectives so radically at variance with\neach other that even their ostensive agreements cannot remain wholly\nunquestioned. Behind the rather thin public front, then, quite\ndifferent philosophical projects were being pursued by the leading\nparticipants with, moreover, changing alliances. One way of taking\naccount of this is by speaking (as above) explicitly of the\nphilosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle (and to avoid the\nsingular definite description) while using the expression\n“Vienna Circle philosophy” (without an article) in a\nneutral generic sense. \nRecent scholarship has provided what the received view of Viennese\nneopositivism lacks: recognition and documentation of the sometimes\nsharply differentiated positions behind the generic surface. This does\nnot invalidate all previous scholarship, including some fundamental\ncriticisms of its positions, but it restores a depth to Vienna Circle\nphilosophy that was absent from the standard histories. The value of\nthis development must not be underestimated, for the recognition of\nthe Vienna Circle’s sophisticated engagement with aspects of the\nphilosophical tradition and contemporaneous challenges calls into\nquestion unwarranted certainties of our own self-consciously\npost-positivist era. While there remains support for the view that\nphilosophical doctrines were held in the Vienna Circle that wholly\nmerited many of the standard criticisms to be cited below, there is\nnow also support for the view that in nearly all such cases, these\ndoctrines were already in their day opposed within the Circle itself.\nWhile some of the Vienna Circle philosophies are dated and may even\nbe, as John Passmore once put it, as dead as philosophies can be,\nothers show signs of surprising vitality. Which ones these are,\nhowever, remains a matter of debate. \nThe lead pursued in this article is provided by the comments of a\nlong-time associate of the Vienna Circle, C.G. Hempel, made in\n1991: \nWhile differing with Hempel’s specific claim about how\nthe two “schools” divide, the aim here is to fill out his suggestive\npicture by indicating what Schlick, Carnap and Neurath stand for\nphilosophically and why the different wings of the Vienna Circle \nrequire differentiated assessments. After reviewing the basic facts\nand providing an overall outline of Vienna Circle philosophy (in sect.\n2), this article considers various doctrines in greater detail by way\nof discussing standard criticisms with the appropriate distinctions in\nmind (in sect. 3). No comprehensive assessment of the Vienna Circle\nand the work of its members can be attempted here, but some basic\nconclusions will be drawn (in sect. 4). \nThe Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers\nand philosophically interested scientists who met under the (nominal)\nleadership of Moritz Schlick for often weekly discussions of problems\nin the philosophy of science during academic terms in the years from\n1924 to 1936. As is not uncommon with such groups, its identity is\nblurred along several edges. Not all of those who ever attended the\ndiscussions can be called members, and not all who attended did so\nover the entire period. Typically, attention is focused on long-term\nregulars who gained prominence through their philosophical\npublications, but even these do not in all cases fall into the period\nof the Vienna Circle proper. It is natural, nevertheless, to consider\nunder the heading “Vienna Circle” also the later work of\nleading members who were still active in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.\nFinally, there is the so-called periphery of international contacts\nand visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of\nanalytical philosophers of science. In the present article the\nemphasis will be placed on the long-term regulars whose contributions\nwill be followed, selectively, into the post-Schlick era. \nAccording to its unofficial manifesto (see section 2.3 below), the\nCircle had “members” and recognized others as\n“sympathetic” to its aims. It included as members, besides\nSchlick who had been appointed to Mach’s old chair in Philosophy\nof the Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922, the\nmathematician Hans Hahn, the physicist Philipp Frank, the social\nscientist Otto Neurath, his wife, the mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath,\nthe philosopher Viktor Kraft, the mathematicians Theodor Radacovic and\nGustav Bergmann and, since 1926, the philosopher and logician Rudolf\nCarnap. (Even before World War I, there existed a similarly oriented\ndiscussion circle that included Frank, Hahn and Neurath. During the\ntime of the Schlick Circle, Frank resided in Prague throughout, Carnap\ndid so from 1931.) Further members were recruited among\nSchlick’s students, like Friedrich Waismann, Herbert Feigl and\nMarcel Natkin, others were recruited among Hahn’s students, like\nKarl Menger and Kurt Gödel. Though listed as members in the\nmanifesto, Menger and Kraft later wanted to be known only as as\nsympathetic associates, like, all along, the mathematician Kurt\nReidemeister and the philosopher and historian of science Edgar\nZilsel. (Karl Popper was never a member or associate of the Circle,\nthough he studied with Hahn in the 1920s and in the early 1930s\ndiscussed its doctrines with Feigl and Carnap.) Over the years, other\nparticipants (not listed in the manifesto) included other students of\nSchlick’s and Hahn’s like Bela von Juhos, Josef\nSchächter, Walter Hollitscher, Heinrich Neider, Rose Rand, Josef\nRauscher and Käthe Steinhardt, a secondary teacher, Robert\nNeumann, and, as notable thinkers with independent connections, the\njurist and philosopher Felix Kaufmann (also a member of F.A. von\nHayek’s “Geistkreis”) and the innovative\npsychologist Egon Brunswik (coming, like the even more loosely\nassociated sociologists Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda, from the\npioneering Karl Bühler’s University Institute of\nPsychology). \nDespite its prominent position in the rich, if fragile, intellectual\nculture of inter-war Vienna and most likely due to its radical\ndoctrines, the Vienna Circle found itself virtually isolated in most\nof German speaking philosophy. The one exception was its contact and\ncooperation with the Berlin Society for Empirical (later: Scientific)\nPhilosophy (the other point of origin of logical empiricism). The\nmembers of the Berlin Society sported a broadly similar outlook and\nincluded, besides the philosopher Hans Reichenbach, the logicians Kurt\nGrelling and Walter Dubislav, the psychologist Kurt Lewin, the surgeon\nFriedrich Kraus and the mathematician Richard von Mises. (Its leading\nmembers Reichenbach, Grelling and Dubislav were listed in the\nCircle’s manifesto as sympathisers.) At the same time, members\nof the Vienna Circle also engaged directly, if selectively, with the\nWarsaw logicians (Tarski visited Vienna in 1930, Carnap later that\nyear visited Warsaw and Tarski returned to Vienna in 1935). Probably\npartly because of its firebrand reputation, the Circle attracted also\na series of visiting younger researchers and students including Carl\nGustav Hempel from Berlin, Hasso Härlen from Stuttgart, Ludovico\nGeymonat from Italy, Jørgen Jørgensen, Eino Kaila, Arne\nNaess and Ake Petzall from Scandinavia, A.J. Ayer from the UK, Albert\nBlumberg, Charles Morris, Ernest Nagel and W.V.O. Quine from the USA,\nH.A. Lindemann from Argentina and Tscha Hung from China. (The reports\nand recollections of these former visitors—e.g. Nagel\n1936—are of interest in complementing the Circle’s\nin-house histories and recollections which start with the unofficial\nmanifesto—Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929—and extend through\nNeurath 1936, Frank 1941, 1949a and Feigl 1943 to the memoirs by\nCarnap 1963, Feigl 1969a, 1969b, Bergmann 1987, Menger 1994.) \nThe aforementioned social and political engagement of members of the\nVienna Circle and of Vienna Circle philosophy for Enlightenment reason\nhad never made the advancement of its associates or protegées\neasy in Viennese academia. From 1934 onwards, with anti-semitism\ninstitutionalized and irrationalism increasingly dominating public\ndiscourse, this engagement began to cost the Circle still more dearly.\nNot only was the Verein Ernst Mach closed down early that year for\npolitical reasons, but the ongoing dispersal of Circle members by\nemigration, forced exile and death meant that after the murder of\nSchlick in 1936 only a small rump was able to continue meetings for\nanother two years in Vienna. (1931: Feigl emigrated to USA; 1934: Hahn\ndied, Neurath fled to Holland, 1940 to UK; 1935: Carnap emigrated to\nUSA; 1936: Schlick murdered; 1937: Menger emigrated to USA, Waismann\nto UK; 1938: Frank, Kaufmann, Brunswik, Bergmann emigrated to USA;\nZilsel, Rand to UK, later to USA; Hollitscher fled to Switzerland,\nlater to UK; Schächter emigrated to Palestine; 1940: Gödel\nemigrated to USA; see Dahms 1995 for a chronology of the exodus.) But\nthe end of the Vienna Circle as such did not mean the end of its\ninfluence due to the continuing development of the philosophy of\nformer members (and the work of Kraft in post-World War II Vienna; on\nthis see Stadler 2008). Particularly through their work in American\nexile (esp. Carnap at Harvard, Chicago and UCLA; Feigl at Iowa and\nMinnesota; less so Frank at Harvard) and that of earlier American\nvisitors (esp. Quine, Nagel), as well as through the work of fellow\nemigrées from the Berlin Society (esp. Reichenbach, Hempel) and\ntheir students (Hilary Putnam, Wesley Salmon), logical empiricism\nstrongly influenced the post-World War II development of analytic\nphilosophy of science. By contrast, Waismann had little influence in\nthe UK where Neurath, already marginalized, had died in 1945. (The\nfull story of logical empiricism’s acculturation in the English\nspeaking world remains to be written, but see Howard 2003, Reisch\n2005, Uebel 2005a, 2010, Douglas 2009, and Romizi 2012 for considerations of\naspects of Vienna Circle philosophy early and/or late that were neglected in the process\nand remained long forgotten.) \nAfter its formative phase which was confined to the Thursday evening\ndiscussions, the Circle went public in 1928 and 1929 when it seemed\nthat the time had come for their emerging philosophy to play a\ndistinctive role not only in the academic but also the public sphere.\nIn November 1928, at its founding session, Schlick accepted the\npresidency of the newly formed Verein Ernst Mach (Association Ernst\nMach), Hahn accepted one of its vice-presidencies and Neurath and\nCarnap joined its secretariat. Originally proposed by the Austrian\nFreidenkerbund (Free Thinker Association), the Verein Ernst Mach was\ndedicated to the dissemination of scientific ways of thought and so\nprovided a forum for popular lectures on the new scientific\nphilosophy. In the following year the Circle stepped out under its own\nname (invented by Neurath) with a manifesto and a special conference.\nThe publication of “The Scientific World Conception: The Vienna\nCircle”, signed by Carnap, Hahn and Neurath and dedicated to\nSchlick, coincided with the “First Conference for the\nEpistemology of the Exact Sciences” in mid-September 1929,\norganised jointly with the Berlin Society as an adjunct to the Fifth\nCongress of German Physicists and Mathematicians in Prague (where\nFrank played a prominent role in the local organising committee). (On\nthe production history and early reception of the manifesto see Uebel\n2008.) A distinct philosophical school appeared to be emerging, one\nthat was dedicated to ending the previous disputes of philosophical\nschools by dismissing them, controversially, as strictly speaking\nmeaningless. \nThroughout the early and mid-1930s the Circle kept a high and\nincreasingly international profile with its numerous publications and\nconferences. In 1930, the Circle took over, again together with the\nBerlin Society, the journal Annalen der Philosophie and\nrestarted it under the name of Erkenntnis with Carnap and\nReichenbach as co-editors. (Besides publishing original articles and\nsustaining lengthy debates, this journal featured selected proceedings\nof their early conferences and documented the lecture series of the\nVerein Ernst Mach and the Berlin Society as well as their\ninternational congresses.) In addition, from 1928 until 1936, Schlick\nand Frank served as editors of their book series “Schriften zur\nwissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung” (“Writings on the\nScientific World Conception”), which published major works by\nleading members and early critics like Popper, while Neurath\nedited, from 1933 until 1939, the series\n“Einheitswissenschaft” (“Unified Science”),\nwhich published more introductory essays by leading members and\nsympathisers. Conference-wise, the Circle organized, again with the\nBerlin Society, a “Second Conference for the Epistemology of the\nExact Sciences” as an adjunct to the Sixth Congress of German\nPhysicists and Mathematicians in Königsberg in September 1930\n(where Reidemeister played a prominent role in the organization and\nGödel first announced his incompleteness result in the\ndiscussion) and then began the series of International Congresses on\nthe Unity of Science with a “Pre-Conference” just prior to\nthe start of the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy in Prague\nin September 1934. This, their last conference in Central Europe, was\nfollowed by the International Congresses of various sizes in Paris\n(September 1935, July 1937), Copenhagen (June 1936), Cambridge,\nEngland (July 1938), Cambridge, Mass. (September 1939), all in the\nmain organized by Neurath; a smaller last gathering was held in\nChicago in September 1941. By 1938 their collective publication\nactivity began to centre on a monumentally planned International\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science, with Neurath as editor-in-chief\nand Carnap and Charles Morris as co-editors; by the time of\nNeurath’s death in 1945, only 10 monographs had appeared and the\nseries was wound up in 1970 numbering 20 monographs under the title\n“Foundations of the Unity of Science” (notably containing\nThomas Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions\namongst them). \nIndividually, the members of the Vienna Circle published extensively\nbefore, during and after the years of the Circle around Schlick. For\nsome (Frank, Hahn, Menger, Neurath), philosophy was only part of their\nscientific output, with numerous monographs and articles in their\nrespective disciplines (mathematics, physics and social science);\nothers (Schlick, Carnap, Feigl, Waismann) concentrated on philosophy,\nbut even their output cared relatively little for traditional concerns\nof the field. Here it must be noted that two early monographs by\nSchlick (1918/25) and Carnap (1928a), commonly associated with the\nVienna Circle, mostly predate their authors’ participation there\nand exhibit a variety of influences not typically associated with\nlogical positivism (see section 3.7 below). Moreover, important\nmonographs by Frank (1932), Neurath (1931a), Carnap (1934/37) and\nMenger (1934) in the first half of the 1930s represent moves away from\npositions that had been held in the Circle before and contradict its\northodox profile. Yet the Circle’s orthodoxy, as it were, is not\neasily pinned down either. Schlick himself was critical of the\nmanifesto of 1929 and gave a brief vision statement of his own in\n“The Turning Point in Philosophy” (1930). A long-planned\nbook by Waismann of updates on Wittgenstein’s thought, to which\nSchlick was extremely sympathetic, was never completed as originally\nplanned and only appeared posthumously (Waismann 1965; for earlier\nmaterial see Baker 2003). Comparison with rough transcripts of the\nCircle’s discussions in the early 1930s (for transcripts from\nbetween December 1930 and July 1931 see Stadler 1997 [2015,\n69–123]) suggest that Waismann’s Wittgensteinian\n“Theses”, dated\nto “around 1930” (Waismann 1967 [1979, Appendix B]), come closest\nto an elaboration of the orthodox Circle position at that time (but\nwhich remained not undisputed even then). Again, what needs to be\nstressed is that all of the Circle’s publications are to be\nunderstood as contributions to ongoing discussions among its members\nand associates. \nDespite the pluralism of the Vienna Circle’s views, there did\nexist a minimal consensus which may be put as follows. A theory of\nscientific knowledge was propagated which sought to renew empiricism\nby freeing it from the impossible task of justifying the claims of the\nformal sciences. It will be noted that this updating did not leave\nempiricism unchanged. \nFollowing the logicism of Frege and Russell, the Circle considered\nlogic and mathematics to be analytic in nature. Extending\nWittgenstein’s insight about logical truths to mathematical ones\nas well, the Circle considered both to be tautological. Like true\nstatements of logic, mathematical statements did not express factual\ntruths: devoid of empirical content they only concerned ways of\nrepresenting the world, spelling out implication relations between\nstatements. The knowledge claims of logic and mathematics gained their\njustification on purely formal grounds, by proof of their derivability\nby stated rules from stated axioms and premises. (Depending on the\nstanding of these axioms and premises, justification was conditional\nor unconditional.) Thus defanged of appeals to rational intuition, the\ncontribution of pure reason to human knowledge (in the form of logic\nand mathematics) was thought easily integrated into the empiricist\nframework. (Carnap sought to accommodate Gödel’s\nincompleteness results by separating analyticity from effective\nprovability and by postulating that arithmetic consisted of an\ninfinite series of ever richer arithmetical languages; see the\ndiscussion and references in section 3.2 below.) \nThe synthetic statements of the empirical sciences meanwhile were held\nto be cognitively meaningful if and only if they were empirically\ntestable in some sense. They derived their justification as knowledge\nclaims from successful tests. Here the Circle appealed to a criterion of meaningfulness\n(cognitive significance) the correct formulation of which was problematical and much\ndebated (and will be discussed in greater detail in section 3.1\nbelow). Roughly, if synthetic statements failed testability in\nprinciple they were considered to be cognitively meaningless and to\ngive rise only to pseudo-problems. No third category of significance\nbesides that of a priori analytical and a posteriori\nsynthetic statements was admitted: in particular, Kant’s\nsynthetic a priori was banned as having been refuted by the\nprogress of science itself. (The theory of relativity showed what had\nbeen held to be an example of the synthetic a priori, namely\nEuclidean geometry, to be false as the geometry of physical space.)\nThus the Circle rejected the knowledge claims of metaphysics as being\nneither analytic and a priori nor empirical and synthetic.\n(On related but different grounds, they also rejected the knowledge\nclaims of normative ethics: whereas conditional norms could be\ngrounded in means-ends relations, unconditional norms remained\nunprovable in empirical terms and so depended crucially on the\ndisputed substantive a priori intuition.) \nGiven their empiricism, all of the members of the Vienna Circle also\ncalled into question the principled separation of the natural and the\nhuman sciences. They were happy enough to admit to differences in\ntheir object domains, but denied the categorical difference in both\ntheir overarching methodologies and ultimate goals in inquiry, which\nthe historicist tradition in the still only emerging social sciences\nand the idealist tradition in philosophy insisted on. The\nCircle’s own methodologically monist position was sometimes\nrepresented under the heading of “unified science”.\nPrecisely how such a unification of the sciences was to be effected or\nunderstood remained a matter for further discussion (see section 3.3\nbelow). \nIt is easy to see that, combined with the rejection of rational\nintuition, the Vienna Circle’s exclusive apportionment of reason\ninto either formal a priori reasoning, issuing in analytic\ntruths (or contradictions), and substantive a posteriori\nreasoning, issuing in synthetic truths (or falsehoods), severely\nchallenged the traditional understanding of philosophy. All members of\nthe Circle hailed the end of distinctive philosophical system\nbuilding. In line with the Tractatus claim that all\nphilosophy is really a critique of language, the Vienna Circle took\nthe so-called linguistic turn, the turn to representation as the\nproper subject matter of philosophy. Philosophy itself was denied a\nseparate first-order domain of expertise and declared a second-order\ninquiry. Whether the once queen of the sciences was thereby reduced to\nthe mere handmaiden of the latter was still left open. It remained a\nmatter of disagreement what type of distinctively\nphilosophical insight, if any, would remain legitimate. Just as\nimportantly, however, the tools of modern logic were employed also for\nmetatheoretical construction, not just for the reduction of empirical\nclaims to their observational base or, more generally, for the\nderivation of their observational consequences. For the price of\nabandoning foundationalist certainty this allowed for an enormous\nexpansion of the domain of empirical discourse. Ultimately, it opened\nthe space for the still ongoing discussions of scientific realism and\nits alternatives (see section 3.4 below). \nThe Circle’s leading protagonists differed in how they\nconceptualized this reflexive second-order inquiry that the linguistic\nturn had inaugurated. Nevertheless, they all agreed broadly that the\nways of representing the world were largely determined by convention.\nA multitude of ideas hide behind this invocation of conventionality.\nOne particularly radical one is the denial of the apodicity of all\napriority, the denial of the claim that knowledge justified through\nreason alone represents truths that are unconditionally necessary.\nAnother one is the imputation of agency in the construction of the\nlogico-linguistic frameworks that make human cognition possible, the\ndenial that conventionality could only mean acquiescence in tradition.\nWhether such ideas were followed by individual members of the Circle,\nhowever, depended on their own interests and influences. It is these\noften overlooked or misunderstood differences that hold the key to\nunderstanding the interplay of occasionally incompatible positions\nthat make up Vienna Circle philosophy. (As can be seen from some of\ntheir internal disputes, moreover, these differences were also not\nalways obvious to the protagonists themselves.) \nTo see a striking example, consider their overarching conceptions of\nphilosophy itself. Some protagonists retained the idea that philosophy\npossessed a separate disciplinary identity from science and, like\nSchlick, turned philosophy into a distinctive, albeit non-formal\nactivity of meaning determination. Others, like Carnap, agreed on the\ndistinction between philosophy and science but turned philosophy into\na purely formal enterprise, the so-called logic of science. Still\nothers went even further and, like Neurath under the banner of\n“unified science”, also rejected philosophy as a separate\ndiscipline and treated what remained of it, after the rejection of\nmetaphysics, as its partly empirical meta-theory, to be set beside the logic of science. With Schlick, then,\nphilosophy became the activity of achieving a much clarified and\ndeepened understanding of the cognitive and linguistic practices\nactually already employed in science and everyday discourse. By\ncontrast, for Carnap, philosophy investigated and reconstructed\nexisting language fragments, developed new logico-linguistic\nframeworks and suggested possible formal conventions for science,\nwhile, for Neurath, the investigation of science was pursued by an\ninterdisciplinary meta-theory that encompassed empirical disciplines,\nagain with a pragmatic orientation. Thus we find in apparent\ncompetition different conceptions of post-metaphysical philosophy: the\nprojects of experiential meaning determination, of formal rational\nreconstruction and of naturalistic explications of leading theoretical\nand methodological notions. (For roughly representative early\nessay-length statements of their positions see Schlick 1930, Carnap\n1932a and Neurath 1932a; later restatements are given in Schlick 1937,\nCarnap 1936b and Neurath 1936b.) In the more detailed discussions\nbelow these differences of overall approach will figure repeatedly\n(see also section 3.6 below). \nCriticisms of the basic positions adopted in the Vienna Circle are\nlegion, though it may be questioned whether most of them took account\nof the sophisticated variations on offer. (Sometimes the\nCircle’s own writings are disregarded altogether and\n“logical positivism” is discussed only via the proxy of\nAyer’s popular exposition; see, e.g., Soames 2003.) But some\nNeo-Kantians like Ernst Cassirer may claim that they too accepted\ndevelopments like the merely relative a priori and an\nappropriate conception of the historical development of science.\nLikewise, Wittgensteinians may claim that Wittgenstein’s own\nopposition to metaphysics only concerned false attempts to render it\nintelligible: his merely ineffable but uneliminated metaphysics\nconcerned precisely what for him were essentials of ways of\nrepresenting the world. The commonest criticisms, however, concerned\nnot the uniqueness of the Vienna Circle’s doctrines, or their\nfaithfulness to their supposed sources, but whether they were tenable\nat all. Prominent objects of this type of criticism include the\nverificationist theory of meaning and its claimed anti-metaphysical\nand non-cognitivist consequences as well as its own significance; the\nreductionism in phenomenalist or physicalist guises that appeared to\nattend the Circle’s attempted operationalisation of the logical\natomism of Russell and Wittgenstein; and the Circle’s alleged\nscientism in general and their formalist and a-historical conception\nof scientific cognition in particular. These criticisms are discussed\nin some detail below in order to assess why which of the associated\ndoctrines remain of what importance. \nAs noted, the Vienna Circle did not last long: its philosophical\nrevolution came at a cost. Yet what was so socially, indeed\npolitically, explosive about what appears on first sight to be a\nparticularly arid, if not astringent, doctrine of specialist\nscientific knowledge? To a large part, precisely what made it so\ncontroversial philosophically: its claim to refute opponents not by\nproving their statements to be false but by showing them to be\n(cognitively) meaningless. Whatever the niceties of their\nphilosophical argument here, the socio-political impact of the Vienna\nCircle’s philosophies of science was obvious and profound. All\nof them opposed the increasing groundswell of radically mistaken,\nindeed irrational, ways of thinking about thought and its place in the\nworld. In their time and place, the mere demand that public discourse\nbe perspicuous, in particular, that reasoning be valid and premises\ntrue—a demand implicit in their general ideal of\nreason—placed them in the middle of crucial socio-political\nstruggles. Some members and sympathisers of the Circle also actively\nopposed the then increasingly popular völkisch\nsupra-individual holism in social science as a dangerous intellectual\naberration. Not only did such ideas support racism and fascism in\npolitics, but such ideas themselves were supported only by radically\nmistaken arguments concerning the nature and explanation of organic\nand unorganic matter. So the first thing that made all of the Vienna\nCircle philosophies politically relevant was the contingent fact that\nin their day much political discourse exhibited striking epistemic\ndeficits. That some of the members of the Circle went, without logical\nblunders, still further by arguing that socio-political considerations\ncan play a legitimate role in some instances of theory choice due to\nunderdetermination is yet another matter. This particular issue will\nnot be pursued further here (see references at the end of section 2.1\nabove), nor the general topic of the Circle’s embedding in\nmodernism and the discourse of modernity (see Putnam 1981b for a\nreductionist, Galison 1990 for a foundationalist, Uebel 1996 for a\nconstructivist reading of their modernism, Dahms 2004 for an account\nof personal relations with representatives of modernism in art and\narchitecture). \nGiven only the outlines of Vienna Circle philosophy, its controversial\ncharacter is evident. The boldness of its claims made it attractive\nbut that boldness also seemed to be its undoing. Turning to the\nquestions of how far and, if at all, which forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy stand up to some common criticisms, both the synchronic\nvariations and the diachronic trajectories of its variants must be\ntaken into account. This will be attempted in the sections below. \nBefore expectations are raised too high, however, it must also\nremembered that in this article only the views of members of the\nVienna Circle can be discussed, even though the problematic issues\nwere pervasive in logical empiricism generally. (Compare the SEP article “Logical Empiricism”; for articles on\nReichenbach see, e.g, Spohn 1991 and Salmon and Wolters 1994,\nRichardson 2005, 2006, and, for the Berlin Group as a whole, Milkov and Peckhaus 2013.) Moreover, here\nthe emphasis must lie on the main protagonists: Schlick, Carnap and\nNeurath. (Neither Hahn or Frank, nor Waismann or Feigl, for instance,\ncan be discussed here as extensively as their work deserves; see,\ne.g., Uebel 2005b, 2011b, McGuinness 2011, Haller 2003, respectively.)\nWhat will be noted, however, is that Vienna Circle philosophy was by\nno means identical with the post-World War II logical empiricism that\nhas come to be known as the “received view” of scientific\ntheories, even though it would be hard to imagine the latter without\nthe former. (For a systematic if schematic critical discussion of the\nreceived view, see Suppe 1977, for a partial defense Mormann\n2007a.) \nTo deepen the somewhat cursory overview of Vienna Circle philosophy\ngiven above, we now turn to the discussion of the following issues:\nfirst, the viability of the conceptions of empirical significance\nemployed by the Vienna Circle in its classical period; second, its uses of\nthe analytic-synthetic distinction; third, its supposedly reductionist\ndesigns and foundationalist ambitions for philosophy; fourth, its\nstances in the debate about realism or anti-realism with regard to the\ntheoretical terms in science; fifth, Carnap’s later ideas in\nresponse to some of the problems encountered; sixth, the issue of the\nstatus of the meaning criterion itself (variably referred to also as “criterion of significance” or “criterion of empirical significance”) and of the point of their\ncritique of metaphysics; seventh, the Vienna Circle’s attitude\ntowards history and of their own place in the history of\nphilosophy. \nThese topics have been chosen for the light their investigation throws\non the Circle’s own agendas and the reception of its doctrines\namongst philosophers at large, as well as for the relative ease with\nwhich their discussion allows its development and legacy to be\ncharted. There can be little doubt about the enormous impact that the\nmembers of the Vienna Circle had on the development of\ntwentieth-century philosophy. What is less clear is whether any of its\ndistinctive doctrines are left standing once the dust of their\ndiscussion has settled or whether those of its teachings that were\ndeemed defensible merged seamlessly into the broad church that\nanalytic philosophy has become (and, if so, what those surviving\ndoctrines and teachings may be). \nIt must be noted, then, that the topics chosen for this article do not\nexhaust the issues concerning which the members of the Vienna Circle\nmade significant contributions (which continue to stimulate work in\nthe history of philosophy of science). Important topics like that of\nthe theory and practice of unified science, of the nature of the\nempirical basis of science (the so-called protocol-sentence debate)\nand of the general structure of the theories of individual sciences\ncan only be touched upon selectively. Likewise, while the general\ntopic of ethical non-cognitivism receives only passing mentions, the\nCircle’s varied approaches to value theory cannot be discussed\nhere (for an overview see Rutte 1986, for detailed analyses see Siegetsleitner 2014). Other matters, like the\ncontributions made by Vienna Circle members to the development of\nprobability theory and inductive logic, the philosophy of logic and\nmathematics (apart from the guiding ideas of Carnap) and to the\nphilosophy of individual empirical sciences (physics, biology,\npsychology, social science), cannot be discussed at all (see Creath\nand Friedman 2007 and Richardson and Uebel 2007 for relevant essays with further references).\nBut it may be noted that with his “logic of science”\nCarnap counts among the pioneers of what nowadays is called\n“formal epistemology”. \nNot surprisingly, it was the Circle’s rejection of metaphysics\nby means of their seemingly devastating criterion of cognitive\nsignificance that attracted immediate opposition. (That they did not\ndeny all meaning to statements thus ruled out of court was freely\nadmitted from early on, but this “expressive” surplus was\nconsidered secondary to so-called “cognitive” meaning and\ndiscountable in science (see Carnap 1928b, 1932a).) Notwithstanding\nthe metaphysicans’ thunder, however, the most telling criticisms\nof the criterion came from within the Circle or broadly sympathetic\nphilosophers. When it was protested that failure to meet an empiricist\ncriterion of significance did not make philosophical statements\nmeaningless, members of the Circle simply asked for an account of what\nthis non-empirical and presumably non-emotive meaning consisted in and\ntypically received no convincing answer. The weakness of their\nposition was rather that their own criterion of empirical significance\nseemed to resist an acceptable formal characterization. \nTo start with, it must be noted that long before the verification\nprinciple proper entered the Circle’s discourse in the late 1920s,\nthe thought expressed by Mach’s dictum that “where neither\nconfirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not\nconcerned” (1883 [1960, 587]) was accepted as a basic precept of\ncritical reflection about science. Responsiveness to evidence for and\nagainst a claim was the hallmark of scientific discourse.\n(Particularly the group Frank-Hahn-Neurath, who formed part of a\npre-World War I discussion group (Frank 1941, 1949a) sometimes called\nthe “First Vienna Circle” (Haller 1985, Uebel 2003), can\nbe presumed to be familiar with Mach’s criterion.) Beyond this,\nstill in the 1920s, Schlick (1926) convicted metaphysics for falsely\ntrying to express as logically structured cognition what is but the\ninexpressible qualitative content of experience. Already then,\nhowever, Carnap (1928b, §7) edged towards a formal criterion by\nrequiring empirically significant statements to be such that\nexperiential support for them or for their negation is at least\nconceivable. Meaningfulness meant the possession of “factual\ncontent” which could not, on pain of rendering many scientific\nhypotheses meaningless, be reduced to actual testability. Instead, the\nempirical significance of a statement had to be conceived of as\npossession of the potential to receive direct or indirect experiential\nsupport (via deductive or inductive reasoning). \nIn 1930, considerations of this sort appeared to receive a\nconsiderable boost due to Waismann’s reports of\nWittgenstein’s meetings with him and Schlick. Wittgenstein had\ndiscussed the thesis “The sense of a proposition is [the method of] its\nverification” in conversations with Schlick and Waismann on 22\nDecember 1929 and 2 January 1930 (see Waismann 1967 [1979, 47 and 79]) and Waismann elaborated it in his “Theses” which were presented to the Circle as\nWittgenstein’s considered views. While Wittgenstein appears to have\nthought of his dictum primarily as a constitutive principle of meaning, in the Circle it was put to work mainly as a demarcation criterion against metaphysics. Whether it was always noted that Wittgenstein’s thesis and the criterion of cognitive significance must be distinguished (the former entails the latter, but not vice versa) may be doubted, but striking differences emerged all the same. Like Carnap’s criterion of significance of 1928, the version of the criterion which followed from Wittgenstein’s dictum also allowed for\nverifiability in principle (and did not demand actual\nverifiability): like Carnap’s notion of experiential support, it worked with the mere conceivability of verifiability. Yet Wittgenstein’s criterion required conclusive verifiability which Carnap’s did not. (The demand for conclusive verifiability was discussed in the meetings\nwith Wittgenstein.) By 1931, however, it had become clear to some that\nthis would not do. What Carnap later called the “liberalization\nof empiricism” was underway and different camps became\ndiscernible within the Circle. It was over this issue that the\nso-called “left wing” with Carnap, Hahn, Frank and Neurath\nfirst distinguished itself from the “more conservative\nwing” around Schlick. (See Carnap 1936–37, 422 and 1963a,\n§9. Carnap 1936–37, 37n dated the opposition to strict\nverificationism to “about 1931”.) \nIn the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of\nuniversally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to\nsalient aspects of Carnap’s 1928 conception. Everybody had noted\nthat Wittgenstein’s criterion rendered\nuniversally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus\nfollowed Wittgenstein’s own suggestion to treat “hypotheses” instead as\nrepresenting rules for the formation of verifiable singular\nstatements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated\nonly in Schlick 1936a.) By contrast, Hahn (1933, drawn from lectures\nin 1932) pointed out that hypotheses should be counted as properly\nmeaningful as well and that the criterion be weakened to allow for\nless than conclusive verifiability. But other elements played into\nthis liberalization as well. One that began to do so soon was the\nrecognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms\nto observation terms (more on this presently). A third element was\nthat disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability\nor support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was\nnomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth\nelement, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the\ncriterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it\nwas to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick\nretained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages\nthroughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological\npossibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned\nwith natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements\nmeaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a\nprocedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only,\nCarnap (1936–37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it\nwas nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation\nof disconfirmation. \nMany of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in\n1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous\ncriterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that\nwere syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were\nreducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence\nstatements of science. While Carnap’s focus on the reduction of\ndescriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some\nstatements, it must be noted that his criterion also allowed\nuniversally quantified statements to be meaningful in general, provided they were\nsyntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, §2). It was\nnot until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially\ndeclared the criterion of cognitive significance to be mere confirmability.\nCarnap’s new criterion required neither verification nor\nfalsification but only partial testability so as now to include not\nonly universal statements but also the disposition statements of\nscience (see Carnap 1936–37; the English translation of the\noriginal Paris address (1936a [1949]) combines it with extraneous\nmaterial). These disposition terms were thought to be linked to\nobservation statements by a variety of reduction postulates or longer\nreduction chains, all of which provided only partial definitions\n(despite their name they provided no eliminative reductions). Though\nplausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms\nin this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the\nsupposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters\nand analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951, 1963).\nIndependently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all\ntheoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base\nby such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for\nthe formulation of a criterion of cognitive significance: how was one to rule out\nunwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly\nabstract scientific claims? \nConsider that Carnap (1939, 1956b) admitted as legitimate theoretical\nterms that are implicitly defined in calculi that are\nonly partially interpreted by correspondence rules between\nsome select calculus terms and expressions belonging to an\nobservational language (via non-eliminative reductions). The problem\nwas that mere confirmability was simply too weak a criterion\nto rule out some putative metaphysical claims. Moreover, this problem\narose for both the statement-based approach to the criterion (taken by\nCarnap in 1928, by Wittgenstein in 1929/30, and by Ayer both in the\nfirst (1936) and the second editions (1946) of Language Truth and\nLogic) and for the term-based approach (taken by Carnap since\n1932). For the former approach, the problem was that the empirical\nlegitimacy of statements obtained via indirect testing also\ntransferred to any expressions that could be truth-functionally\nconjoined to them (for instance, by the rule of\n‘or’-introduction). Statements thus became empirically\nsignificant, however vacuous they had been on their own. For the\nterm-based approach, the problem was that, given the non-eliminability\nof dispositional and theoretical terms, empirical significance was no\nlonger ascribable to individual expressions in isolation but became a\nholistic affair, with little guarantee in turn for the empiricist\nlegitimacy of all the terms now involved. \nFor most critics (even within the ranks of logical empiricism), the\nproblem of ruling out metaphysical statements while retaining the\nterms of high theory remained unsolved. By 1950, in response to the\ntroubles of Ayer’s two attempts to account for the indirect\ntesting of theoretical statements via their consequences, Hempel\nconceded that it was “useless to continue to search for an\nadequate criterion of testability in terms of deductive relationships\nto observation sentences” (1950 [1959, 116]). The following\nyear, Hempel also abandoned the idea of using, as a criterion of\nempirical significance, Carnap’s method of translatability into\nan antecedently determined empirical language consisting only of\nobservational non-logical vocabulary. Precisely because it was\nsuitably liberalized to allow abstract scientific theories with merely\npartial interpretations, its anti-metaphysical edge was blunted: it\nallowed for combination with “some set of metaphysical\npropositions, even if the latter have no empirical interpretation at\nall” (1951, 70). Hempel drew the holistic conclusion that the\nunits of empirical significance were entire theories and that the\nmeasure of empirical significance itself was multi-criterial and,\nmoreover, allowed for degrees of significance. To many, this amounted\nto the demise of the Circle’s anti-metaphysical campaign. By\ncontrast, Feigl’s reaction (1956) was to reduce the ambition of\nthe criterion of significance to the mere provision of necessary\nconditions. \nSome further work was undertaken on rescuing and, again, debunking a\nversion of the statement-based criterion, but mostly not by (former) members\nof the Vienna Circle. However, in response to the problem of how to\nformulate a meaning criterion that suitably distinguished between\nempirically significant and insignificant non-observational terms,\nCarnap proposed a new solution in 1956. We\nwill return to discuss it separately (see section 3.5 below); for\nnow we need only note that these proposals were highly technical and\napplied only to axiomatized theories in formal languages. They too,\nhowever, found not much favor amongst philosophers. Yet whatever the\nproblems that may or may not beset them, it would seem that far more\ngeneral philosophical considerations contributed to the disappearance\nof the problem of the criterion of cognitive significance from most philosophical\ndiscussions since the early 1960s (other than as an example of\nmistaken positivism). These include the increasing opposition to the\ndistinctions between analytic and synthetic statements and\nobservational and theoretical terms as well as a general sense of\ndissatisfaction with Carnap’s approach to philosophy which began\nto seem both too formalist in execution and too deflationary in\nambition. The entire philosophical program of which the search for a\nprecise criterion of empirical significance was a part had begun to\nfall out of favor (and with it technical discussions about the\ncriterion’s latest version). \nThe widely perceived collapse of the classical Viennese project to\nfind in an empiricist meaning criterion a demarcation criterion\nagainst metaphysics—we reserve judgement about Carnap’s\nlast two proposals here—can be interpreted in a variety of ways.\nIt strongly suggests that cognitive significance cannot be reduced to\nwhat is directly observable, whether that be interpreted in\nphenomenalist or intersubjective, physicalist terms. In that important\nbut somewhat subsidiary sense, the collapse spelt the failure of many\nof the reductivist projects typically ascribed to Viennese\nneopositivism (but see section 3.3 below). Beyond that, what actually\nhad failed was the attempt to characterize for natural languages the\nclass of cognitively significant propositions by recursive definitions\nin purely logical terms, either by relations of deducibility or\ntranslatability. What failed, in other words, was the attempt to apply\na general conception of philosophical analysis as purely formal,\npursued also in other areas, to the problem of characterizing\nmeaningfulness. \nThis general conception can be considered formalist in several senses.\nIt was formalist, first, in demanding the analysis of the meaning of\nconcepts and propositions in terms of logically necessary and\nsufficient conditions: it was precise and brooked no exceptions. And\nit was formalist, second, in demanding that such analyses be given\nsolely in terms of the logical relations of these concepts and\npropositions to other concepts and propositions: it used the tools of\nformal logic. There is also a third sense that is, however, applicable\npredominantly to the philosophical project in Carnap’s hands, in\nthat it was formalist since it concentrated on the analysis of\ncontested concepts via their explication in formal languages.\n(Discussion of its viability must be deferred until sections 3.5 and\n3.6 below, since what’s at issue currently is only the formalist\nproject as applied to concepts in natural language.) The question\narises whether all Vienna Circle philosophers concerned with empirical\nsignificance in natural language were equally affected, for the\ncollapse of the formalist project may leave as yet untouched other\nways of sustaining the objection that metaphysics is, in some relevant\nsense, cognitively insignificant. (Such philosophers in turn would\nhave to answer the charge, of course, that only the formalist project\nof showing metaphysics strictly meaningless rendered the Viennese\nanti-metaphysics distinctive.) \nEven though the formalist project became identified with mainstream\nlogical empiricism generally (consider its prominence in confirmation\ntheory and in the theory of explanation), it was not universally\nsubscribed to in the Vienna Circle itself. In different ways, neither\nSchlick nor Neurath or Frank adhered to it. As noted in the overview\nabove, Schlick’s attempts to exhibit natural language meaning\nabjured efforts to characterize it in explicitly formal terms, even\nthough he accepted the demand for necessary and sufficient conditions\nof significance. In the end, moreover, Schlick turned away from his\ncolleagues’ search for a criterion of empirical significance. In\nallowing talk of life after death as meaningful (1936a), for the very\nreason that what speaks against it is only the empirical impossibility\nof verifying such talk, Schlick’s final criterion clearly left\nempiricist strictures behind. \nBy contrast, Neurath and Frank kept their focus on empirical\nsignificance. While they rarely discussed these matters explicitly,\ntheir writings give the impression that Neurath and Frank chose to\nadopt (if not retain) a contextual, exemplar-based approach to\ncharacterizing the criterion of meaninglessness and so decided to\nforego the enumeration of necessary and sufficient conditions.\nMach’s precept cited earlier is an example of such a pragmatic\napproach, as is, it should be noted, Peirce’s criterion of\nsignificance, endorsed by Quine (1969), which claims that significance\nconsists in making a discernible difference whether a proposition is\nlikely to be true or false. Mach’s pragmatic approach had been\nchampioned already before verificationism proper by Neurath, Frank and\nHahn who became, like Carnap, early opponents of conclusive\nverifiability. (Indeed, it is doubtful whether Neurath’s radical\nfallibilism, most clearly expressed already in 1913, ever wavered.)\nThis pragmatic understanding found clear expression in Neurath’s\nadoption (1935a, 1938) of K. Reach’s formulation of metaphysical\nstatements as “isolated” ones, as statements that do not\nderive from and hold no consequences for those statements that we do\naccept on the basis of empirical evidence or for logical reasons.\n(Hempel’s dismissal, in 1951, of this pragmatic indicator\npresupposes the desiderata of the formalist project.) Finally, there\nis Frank’s suggestion (1963), coupled with his longstanding\nadvice to combine logical empiricism with pragmatism, that\nCarnap’s purely logical critique of metaphysics in (1932a) was\nbound to remain ineffective as long as the actual use of metaphysics\nremained unexamined. It would be worth investigating whether—if\nthe critique of the alleged reductionist ambitions of their philosophy\ncould also be deflected (see section 3.3 below)—the impetus of\nthe anti-verificationist critique can be absorbed by those with a\npragmatic approach to the demarcation against metaphysics. Much as\nwith Quine’s Peirce, such a criterion rules out as without\ninterest for epistemic activity all concepts and propositions whose\ntruth or falsity make no appreciable difference to the sets of\nconcepts and propositions we do accept already. \nAn entirely different moral was drawn by Reichenbach (1938) and\nthinkers indebted to his probabilistic conception of meaning and his\nprobabilistic version of verificationism, which escaped the criticisms\nsurveyed above by vagaries of its own. Such theorists perceive the\nfailure of the formalist model to accommodate the empirical\nsignificance of theoretical terms to stem from its so-called deductive\nchauvinism. In place of the exclusive reliance on the\nhypothetical-deductive method these theorists employ non-demonstrative\nanalogical and causal inductive reasoning to ground theoretical\nstatements empirically. Like Salmon, these theorists adopt a form of\n“non-linguistic empiricism” which they sharply\ndifferentiate from the empiricism of the Vienna Circle (Salmon 1985,\n2003 and Parrini 1998). \nNow against both the pragmatic and the post-linguistic responses to\nthe perceived failure of the attempt to provide a precise formal\ncriterion of significance serious worries can be raised. Thus it must\nbe asked whether without a precise way of determining when a statement\n‘makes an appreciable difference’, criticism of\nmetaphysics based on such a criterion may be not be considered as a\nbiased dismissal rather than a demonstration of fact and so fall short\nof what is needed. Likewise in the case of the anti-deductivist\nresponse, it must be noted that a criterion based on analogical\nreasoning will only be as effective as the strength of the analogy\nwhich can always be criticized as inapt (and similarly for appeals to\ncausal reasoning). The very point of exact philosophy in a scientific\nspirit—for many the very point of Vienna Circle philosophy\nitself—seems threatened by such maneuvres. Acquiescence in the\nperceived failure of the proposed criteria of significance thus comes\nwith a price: if not that of abandoning Vienna Circle philosophy\naltogether, then at least that of formulating an alternative\nunderstanding to how some of its ambitions ought to be understood.\n(Recent reconstructive work on Carnap, Neurath and Frank may be\nregarded in this light.) \nA still different response—but one emblematic for the\nphilosophical public at large—is that of another of\nReichenbach’s former students, Putnam, who came to reject\nthe anti-metaphysical project that powered verificationism in its\nentirety. Repeatedly in his later years, Putnam called for a\nrefashioning of analytic philosophy as such, providing, as it were, a\nphilosophically conservative counterweight to Rorty’s turn to\npostmodernism. Putnam’s reasons (the alleged self-refutation of\nthe meaning criterion) are still different from those surveyed above\nand will be discussed when we return to reconsider the very point of\nthe Circle’s campaign against metaphysics (see section 3.6\nbelow). \nWhether the verificationist agenda was pursued in a formalist or\npragmatic vein, however, all members shared the belief that meaningful\nstatements divided exclusively into analytic and synthetic statements\nwhich, when asserted, were strictly matched with a priori and\na posteriori reasoning for their support. The Vienna Circle\nwielded this pairing of epistemic and semantic notions as a weapon not\nonly against the substantive a priori of the Schoolmen but\nalso against Kant’s synthetic a priori. Moreover, their\nnotion of analyticity comprized both logical and mathematical truths,\nthereby extending Wittgenstein’s understanding of the former as\n“tautological” in support of a broadly logicist\nprogram. \nIt is well known that this central component of the Vienna\nCircle’s arsenal, the analytic/synthetic distinction, came under\nsharp criticism from Quine in his “Two Dogmas of\nEmpiricism” (1951a), less so that the criticism can only be\nsustained by relying on objections of a type first published by\nTarski. The argument is more complex, but here is a very rough sketch.\nSo as to discard the analytic/synthetic distinction as an unwarranted\ndogma, Quine in “Two Dogmas” argued for the in-principle\nrevisability of all knowledge claims and criticised the impossibility\nof defining analyticity in a non-circular fashion. The first argument\ntells against the apodictic a priori of old (the eternal\nconceptual verities), but, as we shall see, it is unclear whether it\ntells against at least some of the notions of the a priori\nheld in the Vienna Circle. The second argument presupposes a\ncommitment to extensionalism that likewise can be argued not to have\nbeen shared by all in the Circle. By contrast, Tarski had merely\nobserved that, at a still more fundamental level, he knew of no basis\nfor a sharp distinction between logical and non-logical terms. (For\nrelevant primary source materials see also Quine 1935, 1951b, 1963,\nCarnap 1950, 1955, 1963b, their correspondence and related previously\nunpublished lectures and writings in Creath 1990, the memoir Quine\n1991, and Tarski 1936.) \nThe central role on the Vienna Circle’s side in this discussion\nfalls to Carnap and the reorientation of philosophy he sought to\neffect in Logical Syntax (1934/37). It was the notion of the\nmerely relative and therefore non-apodictic a priori that\ndeeply conditioned his notion of analyticity and allowed him to\nsidestep Quine’s fallibilist argument in a most instructive\nfashion. In doing so Carnap built on an idea behind\nReichenbach’s early attempt (1920) to comprehend the general\ntheory of relativity by means of the notion of a merely constitutive\na priori. Now Schlick had objected to the residual idealism\nof this proposal (see Oberdan 2009) and prefered talk of conventions\ninstead and Reichenbach soon followed him in this (see Coffa 1991, Ch.\n10). Carnap too did not speak of the relative a priori as\nsuch (in returning to this terminology present discussions follow\nFriedman 1994), but his pluralism of logico-linguistic frameworks\nfurnishes precisely that. \nFirst consider Schlick as a contrast class. Schlick (1934) appeared to\nshow little awareness of the language-relativity of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction and spoke of analytic truths as\nconceptual necessities that can be conclusively surveyed. This would\nsuggest that Schlick rejected Kant’s apodictic synthetic a\npriori but not the apodicity of analytic statements. Clearly, if\nthat were so, Quine’s argument from universal fallibilism would\nfind a target here. Matters are not quite so clear-cut, however.\nSchlick had long accepted the doctrine of semantic conventionalism\nthat the same facts could be captured by different conceptual systems\n(1915): this would suggest that his analytic truths were conventions that were\nframework-relative and as such necessary only in the very frameworks\nthey helped to constitute. Yet Schlick did not countenance\nthe possibility of incommensurable conceptual frameworks:\nany fact was potentially expressible in any framework (1936b). As a\nresult, Schlick did not accept the possibility that after the adoption\nof a new framework the analytic truths of the old one may be no longer\nassertable, that they could be discarded as no longer applicable even\nin translation, as it were. Herein lay a point that Quine’s\nargument could exploit: Schlick’s analytic truths remained\nunassailable despite their language-relativity. \nNow Carnap, under the banner of the principle of logical tolerance\n(1934/37, §17), abandoned the idea of the one universal logic\nwhich had informed Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein before him.\nInstead, he recognized a plurality of logics and languages whose\nconsistency was an objective matter even though axioms and logical\nrules were fixed entirely by convention. Already due to this logical\npluralism, the framework-relativity of analytic statements went deeper\nfor Carnap than it did for Schlick. But Carnap also accepted the\npossibility of incommensurability between seemingly similar\ndescriptive terms and between entire conceptual systems (1936a).\nAccepting the analytic truths of the framework of our best physical\ntheory may thus be incompatible with accepting those of an earlier\none, even if the same logic is employed in both. Carnapian\nanalyticities do not therefore express propositions that we hold to be\ntrue unconditionally, but only propositions true relative to their own\nframework: they are no longer held to be\npotentially translatable across all frameworks. Quine’s charge of\nuniversal revisability (which itself needs some modification; see\nPutnam 1978) thus misses its mark against them. (Quine, of course, also\nrejected Carnap’s ultimately intensionalist accommodation of radical\nfallibilism via the notion of language change.) \nConcerning the criticism of the circular nature of the definition of\nanalyticity, Carnap responded that it pertained primarily to the idea\nof analyticity in natural language whereas he was interested in\n“explications” as provided by the logic of science (or\nbetter, a logic of science, since there existed no unique logic of\nscience for Carnap). Explications are reconstructions in a formal\nlanguage of selected aspects of complex terms that should not be\nexpected to model the original in all respects (1950b, Ch.1).\nMoreover, Carnap held that explication of the notion of analyticity in\nformal languages yielded the kind of precision that rendered the\ncomplaint of circularity irrelevant: vague intuitions of meaning were\nno longer relied upon. Those propositions of a given language were\nanalytic that followed from its axioms and, once the syntactic\nlimitations of the Logical Syntax period had been left\nbehind, from its definitions and meaning postulates, by application of\nits rules: no ambiguity obtained. \nSo it may appear that the notion of analyticity is easily delimitable\nin Carnap’s explicational approach: analytic propositions would\nbe those that constitute a logico-linguistic framework. But\ncomplications arose from the fact that, on Carnap’s\nunderstanding, not all propositions defining a logico-linguistic\nframework need be analytic ones (1934/37, §51). It was possible\nfor a framework to consist not only of L-rules, whose entirety\ndetermines the notion of logical consequence, but also of P-rules,\nwhich represent presumed physical laws. So let analytic propositions\nbe those framework propositions whose negations are\nself-contradictory. Here a problem arose once the syntactic\nconstraints were dropped by Carnap after Logical Syntax so as\nto allow semantic reasoning and the introduction of so-called meaning\npostulates: now the class of analytic propositions was widened to\ninclude not only logical and mathematical truths but also those\nobtained by substitution of semantically equivalent expressions. How\nwas one now to explicate the idea that there can be non-analytic\nframework propositions (whose negations are not self-contradictory)?\nConsider that for opponents like Quine, responding that the negations\nof non-analytic framework propositions do not contradict meaning\npostulates, was merely to dress up a presupposed notion of meaning in\npseudo-formal garb: while it provided what looked like formal\ncriteria, Carnap’s method did not leave the circle of\nintensional notions behind and so seemed to beg the question. Meaning\npostulates (Carnap 1952), after all, could only be identified by\nappearing on a list headed “meaning postulates” (as Quine\nadded in reprints of 1951a). \nHere one must note that in Logical Syntax, Carnap also\nmodified the thesis of extensionality he had previously defended\nalongside Russell and Wittgenstein: now it merely claimed the\npossibility of purely extensional languages and no longer demanded\nthat intensional languages be reduced to them (ibid.,\n§67). Of course, the mere claim that the language of science can\nbe extensional still proves troublesome enough, given that in such a\nlanguage a distinction between laws and accidentally true universal\npropositions cannot be drawn (the notion of a counterfactual\nconditional, needed to distinguish the former, is an intensional one).\nEven so, this opening of Carnap’s towards intensionalism already\nat the height of his syntacticism—to say nothing of his explicit\nintensionalism in Meaning and Necessity (1947)—seems\nenough to thwart Quine’s second complaint in “Two\nDogmas”. Carnap did not share Quine’s extensionalist\nagenda, so the need to break out of the circle of intensional notions\nonce these were clearly defined in his formal languages did not apply.\nThat theirs were in fact different empiricist research programmes was\ninsufficiently stressed, it would appear, by Quine and Quinean critics\nof Carnap (as noted pointedly by Stein 1992; cf. Ricketts 1982, 2003, Creath 1991, 2004,\nRichardson 1997). \nTo sustain his critique, Quine had to revive his and Tarski’s\nearly doubts about Carnap’s methodological apparatus and dig\neven deeper. (Tarski also shared Quine’s misgivings about\nanalyticity when they discussed these issues with Carnap at Harvard;\nsee Mancosu 2005, Frost-Arnold 2013.) Their scepticism found its\ntarget in Carnap’s ingenious measures in Logical Syntax\ntaken to preserve the thesis that mathematics is analytic from the\nravages of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. Gödel\nproved that every formal system strong enough to represent number\ntheory contains a formula that is true but neither itself or its\nnegation is provable in that system; such formulae—known since\nas Gödel sentences—are provable in a still stronger system\nwhich, however, also contains a formula of its own that is true but\nnot provable in it (and neither is its negation). Commonly,\nGödel’s proof is taken to have undermined the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic. (For discussions of this challenge to\nCarnap’s logical syntax project, see Friedman 1988, 1999a, 2009,\nGoldfarb and Ricketts 1992, Richardson 1994, Awodey and Carus 2003,\n2004.) Carnap responded by stating that arithmetic demands an infinite\nsequence of ever richer languages and by declaring analytic statements\nto be provable by non-finite reasoning (1934/37, §60a-d). This\nlooked like fitting the bill on purely technical grounds, but it is\nquestionable whether such reasoning may still count as syntactic.\nNowadays, it is computational effectiveness that is taken to\ndistinguish purely formal from non-formal, material reasoning.\n(Carnap’s move highlights the tension within Logical\nSyntax between formal and crypto-semantic reasoning: that the rigid\nsyntacticism officially advertised there was at the same time\nundermined as its failings were being compensated—illegitimately so\nby official standards, e.g., by considering translatability a\nsyntactic notion—points ahead to his acceptance of semantics in 1935, only one\nyear after the publication of Logical Syntax and contrary to\nhis disparagement of the notion of synthetic truth there. For a discussion of Carnap’s moves, see Coffa\n1978, Ricketts 1996, Goldfarb 1997, Creath 1996, 1999.) It is no\ncriticism that Carnap’s reconstruction of arithmetic was not\nstandard logicism, but that Carnap unduly stretched the idea of formal\nreasoning is. Was he saved by his shift to semantics? \nTarski (1936) granted the language-relativity of the reconstructed\nnotion of analyticity in Logical Syntax. He also did not\nobject that Carnap’s procedure of circumventing the problem\nwhich the Gödel sentences presented to the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic was illegitimate. Tarski rather questioned\nwhether there were “objective reasons” for the sharp\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms and he pointed out\nthat Carnap’s distinction between the logical and the empirical\nwas not a hard and fast one. Since noting that the distinction between\nlogical and non-logical was not a sharp one and arguing that no\nprincipled distinction could be upheld between them are two quite\ndifferent reactions, however, Tarski’s point on its own does not\nfully support the Quinean critique. Quine’s conclusion (1940,\n§60) that the notion of logical truth itself is\n“informal” rather reflects the moral that he drew from\nTarski’s observation. It appears that what motivated him (after\na nominalistic interlude in the 1940s) to develop his naturalistic alternative to\nCarnap’s conception of philosophy was his considered rejection\nof Carnap’s accommodation of the thesis that arithmetic is\nanalytic to Gödel’s result. \nDifferent strands of Quine’s criticism of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction must thus be distinguished. While Quine’s criticisms\nin “Two Dogmas” on their own clearly did not undermine all\nforms of the distinction that were defended in the Vienna\nCircle—Carnap’s reconstructions of the notion of\nanalyticity did not express unconditionally necessary and unrevisable\npropositions—they do gain in plausibility even against\nCarnap’s once it is recognized that the deepest ground of\ncontestation lies elsewhere: not in the notion of analyticity widely\nunderstood but in that of logical truth narrowly understood. Read in\nthis way, Quine can be seen to argue that the notion of L-consequence\nas explication of analytic truth—as opposed to P-consequence as\nnon-analytic, mere framework entailments—traded not only on the\nidea of non-finitary notions of proof but also on a distinction of\nlogical from descriptive expressions that itself only proceeded on the\nbasis of a finite enumeration of the former (compare Carnap 1934/37,\n§§51–52). (This deficit was not repaired in\nCarnap’s later work either; see Awodey 2007.) What Quine\ncriticized was precisely the fact that Carnap could ground the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms no deeper than by\nthe enumeration of the former in a given framework: was the\ndistinction therefore not quite arbitrary?  \nQuine’s direct arguments against the distinction between logical\nand empirical truth (1963) have been found to beg the question against\nCarnap and his way of conceiving of philosophy (Creath 2003). This way\nof responding to Quine’s objection requires us to specify still\nmore precisely just what Carnap thought he was doing when he employed\nthe distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. To be\nsure, in (1955) he gave broadly behavioural criteria for when meaning\nascriptions could be deemed accepted in linguistic practice, but he also noted that this was not a general requirement for the\nacceptability of explicatory discourse. To repeat, explications did\nnot seek to model natural language concepts in their tension-filled\nvividness, but to make proposals for future use and to extract and\nsystematize certain aspects for constructive purposes. Thus Carnap\nclarified (1963b, §32) that he regarded the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic statements—just like the distinction\nbetween descriptive or factual and prescriptive or evaluative\nstatements—not as descriptive of natural language practices, but\nas a constructive tool for logico-linguistic analysis and theory\nconstruction. It is difficult to overstress the significance of this\nstance of Carnap’s for the evaluation of his version of the\nphilosophical project of the Vienna Circle. Carnap’s\nunderstanding of philosophy has thus been aptly described as the\n“science of possibilities” (Mormann 2000).  \nAs Carnap understood the analytic/synthetic distinction, it was a\ndistinction drawn by a logician to enable greater theoretical\nsystematicity in the reconstructive understanding of a given symbol\nsystem, typically a fragment of a historically developed one. That\nfully determinative objective criteria of what to regard as a logical\nand what as a non-logical term cannot be assumed to be pre-given does\nnot then in and of itself invalidate the use of that distinction by\nCarnap. On the contrary, it has been convincingly argued that Carnap\nhimself did not hold to a notion of what is a factual and what is a\nformal expression or statement that was independent of the\nspecification of the language in question (Ricketts 1994). The\nultimate ungroundedness of his basic semantic explicatory categories,\nthis suggests instead, was a fact that his own theories fully\nrecognized and consciously exploited. (Somewhat analogously, that we\ncannot define science independently of the practice of scientists of\n“our culture” was admitted by Neurath 1932a, Carnap 1932d\nand Hempel 1935, much to the exasperation of Zilsel 1932 and Schlick\n1935a.) \nIt remained open for Carnap then to declare his notion of analyticity\nto be only operationally defined for constructed languages and to let\nthat notion be judged entirely in terms of its utility for\nmeta-theoretical reflection. Just on that account, however, a last\nhurdle remains: finding a suitable criterion of significance for\ntheoretical terms that allows the distinction between analytic and\nsynthetic statements to be drawn in the non-observational, theoretical\nlanguages of science. (This was a problem ever since the\nnon-eliminative reducibility of disposition terms had been accepted\nand one that still held for Carnap’s 1956 criterion; see section\n3.5 below). Only if that can be done, we must therefore add, can\nCarnap claim his formalist explicationist project to emerge unscathed\nfrom the criticisms of both Tarski and Quine. \nAn important related though independently pursued line of criticism\nmay be noted here. It finds its origin in Saunders Mac Lane’s\nreview (1937) of Carnap’s Logical Syntax and focusses\nless on the analytic/synthetic distinction than on Carnap’s\nfailure to give a formally correct definition of logic. It challenges\nthe ambition to have accounted for the formal sciences but declines to\nembrace a naturalistic alternative. Further research along these lines\nhas suggested to some that by extending Carnap’s approach and\nframework it can be linked to attempts in category theory to provide\nthe missing definition (see Awodey 2012, 2017), while a different response to Mac Lane’s as well as Quine’s criticisms defends Carnap’s inability, frankly admitted in (1942, 57) to define logical terms as such in full generality (Creath 2017). \nNone of the above considerations should lead one to deny, however,\nthat one can find understandings of the term “analytic” by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle (like Schlick) that do fall victim to the\ncriticisms of Quine more easily. Nor should one discount the fact that\nCarnap’s logic of science emerges as wilfully ill-equipped to\ndeal with the problems that exercise the traditional metaphysics or\nepistemologies that deal in analyticities. (Of course, unlike his\ndetractors, Carnap considered this to be a merit of his approach.)\nLastly, it must be noted that Carnap’s intensionalist logic of\nscience holds out the promise of practical utility only for the price\nof a pragmatic story that remains to be told. Of what nature are the\npractical considerations and decisions that, as Carnap so freely\nconceded (1950a), are called for when choosing logico-linguistic\nframeworks? (Such conventional choices do not respond to truth or\nfalsity, but instead to whatever is taken to measure convenience.)\nThat Carnap rightly may have considered such pragmatic questions\nbeyond his own specific brief as a logician of science does not\nobviate the need for an answer to the question itself. (Carus 2007\nargues that in this broadly pragmatic dimension lies the very point of\nCarnap’s explicationism.) On this issue, too, it would have been\nhelpful if there had been more collaboration with Neurath and Frank,\nwho were sympathetic to Carnap’s explication of analyticity but\ndid not refer to it much in their own, more practice-oriented\ninvestigations (see section 3.6 below). \nAs it happens, anti-verificationism has two aspects: opposition to\nmeaning reductionism and opposition to the formalist project. Turning\nto the former, we must distinguish two forms of reductionism,\nphenomenalist and physicalist reductionism. Phenomenalism holds\nstatements to be cognitively significant if they can be reduced to\nstatements about one’s experience, be it outer (senses) or inner\n(introspection). Physicalism holds statements to be cognitively\nsignificant if they can be reduced or evidentially related to\nstatements about physical states of affairs. Here it must be noted not\nonly that the Vienna Circle is typically remembered in terms of the\napparently phenomenalist ambitions of Carnap’s Aufbau\nof 1928, but also that already by the early 1930s some form of\nphysicalism was favoured by some leading members including Carnap\n(1932b) and that already in the Aufbau the possibility of a\ndifferent basis for a conceptual genealogy than the phenomenal one actually chosen had been indicated. Thus one\nmust not only ask about the reductionism in the Aufbau but\nalso consider just how reductivist in intent the physicalism was meant\nto be. \nConsiderations can begin with an early critique that has given rise in\nsome quarters to a sharp distinction between Viennese logical\npositivism and German logical empiricism, with the former accused of\nreductionism and the latter praised for their anti-reductionism, a\ndistinction which falsely discounts the changing nature and variety of\nVienna Circle doctrines. Reichenbach’s defense of empiricism\n(1938) turned on the replacement of the criterion of strict\nverifiability with one demanding only that the degree of probability\nof meaningful statements be determinable. This involved opposition\nalso to demands for the eliminative reduction of non-observational to\nobservational statements: both phenomenalism and reductive physicalism\nwere viewed as untenable and a correspondentist realism was advanced\nin their stead. Now it is true that of the members of the Vienna\nCircle only Feigl ever showed sympathies for scientific realism, but\nit is incorrect that all opposition to it in the Circle depended on\nthe naive semantics of early verificationism. Again, of course, some\nVienna Circle positions were liable to Reichenbach’s\ncriticism. \nAnother misunderstanding to guard against is that the Vienna\nCircle’s ongoing concern with “foundational issues”\nand the “foundations of science” does in itself betoken\nfoundationalism. (In the Vienna Circle’s days, foundationalism\nhad it that the basic items of knowledge upon which all others\ndepended were independent of each other, concerned phenomenal states\nof affairs and were infallible; nowadays, foundationalists drop\nphenomenalism and infallibility.) Already the manifesto sought to make\nclear the Circle’s opposition when it claimed that “the\nwork of ‘philosophic’ or ‘foundational’\ninvestigations remains important in accord with the scientific world\nconception. For the logical clarification of scientific concepts,\nstatements and methods liberates one from inhibiting prejudices.\nLogical and epistemological analysis does not wish to set barriers to\nscientific enquiry; on the contrary, analysis provides science with as\ncomplete a range of formal possibilities as is possible, from which to\nselect what best fits each empirical finding (example: non-Euclidean\ngeometries and the theory of relativity).” (Carnap-Hahn-Neurath\n1929 [1973, 316]) This passage can be read as an early articulation of\nthe project of a critical-constructivist meta-theory of science that\nabjures a special authority of its own beyond that stemming from the\napplication of the methods of the empirical and formal sciences to\nscience itself, but instead remains open to what the actual practice\nof these sciences demands. \nHow then can Vienna Circle philosophy be absolved of foundationalism? As\nnoted, it is the Aufbau (and echoes of it in the manifesto)\nthat invites the charge of phenomenalist reductionism. To begin with,\none must distinguish between the strategy of reductionism and the\nambition of foundationalism. Concerning the Aufbau it has\nbeen argued that its strategy of reconstructing empirical knowledge\nfrom the position of methodological solipsism (phenomenalism without\nits ontological commitments and some of its epistemological ambitions)\nis owed not to foundationalist aims but to the ease by which this\nposition seemed to allow the demonstration of the interlocking and\nstructural nature of our system of empirical concepts, a system that\nexhibited unity and afforded objectivity, which was Carnap’s\nmain concern. (See Friedman’s path-breaking 1987 and 1992, and Richardson 1990, 1998, Ryckman\n1991, Pincock 2002, 2005. For the wide variety of influences on the\nAufbau more generally, see Damböck 2016.) However, it is\nhard to deny categorically that Carnap ever harbored foundationalist\nambitions. Not only did Carnap locate his Aufbau very close\nto foundationalism in retrospect (1963a), but a passage in his (1930)\nled Uebel (2007, Ch.6) to claim that around 1929/30 Carnap was motivated by\nfoundationalist principles and reinterpreted his own Aufbau\nalong these lines (around the same time that Wittgenstein\nentertained a psychologistic reinterpretation of his own\nTractatus that was reported back to the Circle by Waismann).\nTo correct this foundationalist aberration was the task of the\nCircle’s subsequent protocol-sentence debate about the content,\nform and status of the evidence statements of science. \nThis concession to the foundationalist misinterpretation of Vienna\nCircle philosophies generally must not, however, be taken to tell\nagainst the new reading of the Aufbau or the epistemologies\ndeveloped from 1930 onwards on the physicalist wing of the Circle. In fact, the Aufbau itself fails when it is read as\na foundationalist project, as it was by Quine (1951a) who pointed out\nthat no eliminative definition of the relation ‘is at’ was\nprovided (required for locating objects of consciousness in physical\nspace). Yet other failures of reduction were detected by Richardson (1998, Ch.3), further questioning the Aufbau’s supposed foundationalist intent. Ultimately it was a still different failure of reduction that prompted Carnap to abandon as\nmistaken reconstructions of the scientific language on the basis of\nmethodological solipsism (though not logical investigations of such languages for their own sake, as noted in his 1961a). Initially Carnap had not been prepared to draw this conclusion even though Neurath (1931b, 1932a) argued that such a type of\nrational reconstruction traded on objectionable\ncounterfactual presuppositions (methodological solipsism did not\nprovide a correct description of the reasoning involved in cognitive\ncommerce with the world around us). At the time Carnap\nmerely conceded that it was more “convenient” to\nreconstruct the language of science on a physicalistic basis (1932e). Only the failure of reducing dispositional predicates to observational ones convinced him to abandon the methodologically solipsist approach (1936–37, 464 and 10) and to adopt an exclusively physicalist basis for his reconstructions of the language of science from then on (a decision explicitly reaffirmed in 1963b). \nCarnap’s initial reluctance to draw this conclusion is best interpreted, not as hankering after epistemological foundations, but as indicating the growing conviction that philosophical methodology had to be built on logical reasons and should not be “entangled with psychological\nquestions” (1934/37, §72). Moreover, already Carnap’s initial hope for a phenomenalist reduction in the Aufbau as well as his decision in (1932e) to loosen the methodologically solipsist claim on epistemology were motivated by logical considerations, the former by mistaken ideas in Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Axiomatik (2000, unpublished at the time) and the latter partly as a consequence of Gödel’s advice on a faulty definition of analyticity in a draft of Logical Syntax (see Ricketts 2010 and Awodey and Carus 2007 respectively). \nIt could likewise be asked concerning physicalism whether it represented, on a different basis, the pursuit of a\nfoundationalist agenda. But that Carnap later in\n(1936/37) called his non-eliminative definitions of disposition\nterms “reduction sentences” already indicates that it was enough\nfor him to provide a basis for the applicability of these terms by\nmerely sufficient but not necessary conditions. Likewise,\nCarnap’s proposal (1939) to conceive of theoretical terms as\ndefined by implicit definition in a non-interpreted language, selected terms of which were, however, linked via non-eliminative\nreductive chain to the observational language, suggests that what concerned him\nprimarily was the capture of indicator relations to sustain in\nprinciple testability of statements containing the terms in question.\nThis is best understood as an attempt to preserve the empirical\napplicability of the formal languages constructed for high-level theory, but\nnot as reductivism with regard to some foundational given. \nBy contrast, Neurath never advocated methodological solipsism. Consider that his\ncomplex conception of the form of protocol statements (1932b)\nexplicated the concept of observational evidence in terms that\nexpressly reflected debts to empirical assumptions which called for\ntheoretical elaboration in turn. For unlike the logician of science\nCarnap, who left it to psychology and brain science to determine more\nprecisely what the class observational predicates were that could\nfeature in protocol statements (1936/37), the empirically oriented\nmeta-theoretician of science Neurath was concerned to encompass and\ncomprehend the practical complexities of reliance on scientific\ntestimony: the different clauses (embeddings) of his proposed protocol\nstatements stand for conditions on the acceptance of such testimony\n(see Uebel 2009). In addition, Neurath’s theory of protocol\nstatements also makes clear that his understanding of physicalism did\nnot entail the eliminative reduction of the phenomenon of\nintentionality but, like Carnap (1932c), merely sought its integration\ninto empiricist discourse. \nGiven these different emphases of their respective physicalisms,\nmention must also be made of the significant differences between\nCarnap’s and Neurath’s conceptions of unified science:\nwhere the formalist Carnap once preferred a hierarchical ordering of\nfinitely axiomatized theoretical languages that allowed at least\npartial cross-language definitions and derivations—these\nrequirements were liberalized over the years (1936b), (1938),\n(1939)—the pragmatist Neurath opted from the start to demand\nonly the interconnectability of predictions made in the different\nindividual sciences (1935a), (1936c), (1944). (Metereology, botany and\nsociology must be combinable to predict the consequences of a forest\nfire, say, even though each may have its own autonomous theoretical\nvocabulary.) Here too it must be remembered that, unlike Carnap,\nNeurath only rarely addressed issues in the formal logic of science\nbut mainly concerned himself with the partly contextually fixed\npragmatics of science. (One exception is his 1935b, a coda to his\nprevious contributions to the socialist calculation debate with Ludwig\nvon Mises and others.) Not surprisingly, at times the priorities set\nby Neurath for the pragmatics of science seemed to conflict with those\nof Carnap’s logic of science. (These tensions often were\npalpable in the grand publication project undertaken by Carnap and\nNeurath in conjunction with Morris, the International Encyclopedia of\nthe Unity of Science; see Reisch 2003.) That said, however, note that\nCarnap’s more hierarchical approach to the unity of science also\ndoes not support the attribution of foundationalist ambitions. \nBut for a brief lapse around 1929/30 and perhaps in some pre-Vienna years, then,\nCarnap fully represents the position of Vienna Circle\nanti-foundationalism. In this he joined Neurath whose long-standing\nanti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile, first used in\n1913, that likens scientists to sailors who have to repair their boat\nwithout ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions\ncontrasted at least prima facie with that of Schlick (1934)\nwho explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle’s\nprotocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all\nscientific statements were fallible ones, so his position on\nfoundationalism was by no means the traditional one. The point of his\n“foundations” remained less than wholly clear and\ndifferent interpretation of it have been put forward (e.g., Oberdan 1998, Uebel 1996, 2020). (On the protocol\nsentence debate as a whole, which included not only the debate between\nCarnap and Neurath but also debates between the physicalists and Schlick and other occasional participants,\nsee, e.g., the differently centered accounts of Uebel 1992, 2007,\nOberdan 1993, Cirera 1994.) While all in the Circle thus recognized as\nfutile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge\nclaims, not all members embraced positions that rejected\nfoundationalism tout court. Clearly, however, attributing\nfoundationalist ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total\nmisunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development,\nif it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist\nfaction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left\nwing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both\nthe empirical and formal sciences. \nYet even if it be conceded that the members of the Vienna Circle did\nnot harbour undue reductionist-foundationalist ambitions, the question\nremains open whether they were able to deal with the complexities of\nscientific theory building. \nHere the prominent role of Schlick must be mentioned, whose\nGeneral Theory of Knowledge (1918, second edition 1925) was\none of the first publications by (future) members of the Vienna Circle\nto introduce the so-called two-languages model of scientific theories.\nAccording to this model, scientific theories comprised an\nobservational part formulated with observational predicates as\ncustomarily interpreted, in which observations and experiential laws\nwere stated, and a theoretical part which consisted of theoretical\nlaws the terms of which were merely implicitly defined, namely, in\nterms of the roles they played in the laws in which they figured. Both\nparts were connected in virtue of a correlation that could be\nestablished between selected terms of the theoretical part and\nobservational terms. In the second half of the 1920s, however,\nSchlick’s model, involving separate conceptual systems, was put\naside in favor of a more streamlined conception of scientific theories\nalong lines as suggested by the Aufbau. Clearly, however,\nSchlick’s model represents an early form of the conception of\nscientific theories as uninterpreted calculi connected to observation\nby potentially complicated correspondence rules that Carnap\nreintroduced in (1939) and that became standard in the “received\nview”. (Another, albeit faint precursor was the idea contained\nin a 1910 remark of Frank’s pointing out the applicability of\nHilbert’s method of implicit definition to the reconstruction\nempirical scientific theories as conceived, also along the lines of\ntwo distinct languages, by the French conventionalists Rey and Duhem;\nsee Uebel 2003.) \nEven granted the model in outline, questions arise both concerning its\nobservational base as well as its theoretical superstructure. We\nalready discussed one aspect of the former topic, the issue of\nprotocols, in the previous section; let’s here turn to the\nlatter topic. Talk of correspondence rules only masks the problem that\nis raised by theoretical terms. One of the pressing issues concerns\ntheir so-called surplus meaning over and above their observational\nconsequences. This issue is closely related to the problem of\nscientific realism: are there truth-evaluatable matters of fact for\nscientific theories beyond their empirical, observational adequacy?\nEven though the moniker “neo-positivism” would seem to\nprescribe an easy answer as to what the Vienna Circle’s position\nwas, it must be noted that just as there is no consensus discernible\ntoday there was none in the Circle beyond certain basics that left the\nmatter undecided. \nAll in the Vienna Circle followed Carnap’s judgement in\nPseudoproblems of Philosophy (1928b) and Schlick’s\ncontention in his response to Planck’s renewal of anti-Machian\npolemics (1932) that questions like that of the reality of the\nexternal world were not well-formed ones but only constituted\npseudo-questions. While this left the observables of empirical reality\nclearly in place, theoretical entities remained problematical: were\nthey really only computational fictions introduced for the ease with\nwhich they they allowed complex predictive reasoning, as Frank (1932)\nheld? This hardly seems to do justice to the surplus meaning of\ntheoretical terms over and above their computational utility: theories\nemploying them seem to tell us about non-observable features of the\nworld. This indeed was Feigl’s complaint (1950) in what must\ncount as the first of very few forays into “semantical\nrealism” (scientific realism by another word) by a former member\nof the Vienna Circle—and one that was quickly opposed by\nFrank’s instrumentalist rejoinder (1950). Carnap sought to remain\naloof on this as on other ontological questions. So while in the\nheyday of the Vienna Circle itself the issue had not yet come into\nclear focus, by mid-century one could distinguish amongst its\nsurviving members both realists (Feigl) and anti-realists (Frank) as\nwell as ontological deflationists (Carnap). \nCarnap’s general recipe for avoiding undue commitments (while\npursuing his investigations of various language forms, including the\nintensional ones Quine frowned upon) was given in terms of the\ndistinction between so-called internal and external questions (1950a).\nGiven the adoption of a logico-linguistic framework, we can state the\nfacts in accordance with what that framework allows us to say. Given\nany of the languages of arithmetic, say, we can state as arithmetical\nfact whatever we can prove in them; to say that there are\nnumbers, however, is at best to express the fact that numbers are a\nbasic category of that framework (irrespective of whether they are\nlogically derived from a still more basic category). As to whether\ncertain special types of numbers exist (in the deflated sense), that\ndepends on the expressive power of the framework at hand and on\nwhether the relevant facts can be proven. Analogous considerations\napply to the existence of physical things (the external world) given\nthe logico-linguistic frameworks of everyday discourse and empirical\nscience. (The near-tautologous nature of these categorical claims in\nCarnap’s hands echoes his earlier diagnosis of metaphysical\nclaims as pseudo-statements; see also 1934/37, Part V.A.) Unlike such\ninternal questions, however, external questions, questions whether\nnumbers or electrons “really exist” irrespective of any\nframework, are ruled out as illegitimate and meaningless. The only way\nin which sense could be given to them was to read them as pragmatic\nquestions concerned with the utility of talk about numbers or\nelectrons, of adopting certain frameworks. Carnap clearly retained his\nbasic position: existence claims remain the\nprovince of science and there must be seen as mediated by the\navailable conceptual tools of inquiry. Logicians of science are in no\nposition to double-guess the scientists in their own proper\ndomain. (Needless to say, Quine 1951b opposed the internal/external distinction as much as his 1951a opposed the analytic/synthetic distinction.) \nMatters came to a head with the discovery of a proof (see Craig 1956)\nthat the theoretical terms of a scientific theory are dispensable in\nthe sense of it being possible to devise a functionally equivalent\ntheory that does not make use of them. Did this not rob theoretical\nterms of their distinctive role and so support instrumentalism? The\nnegative answer was twofold. As regards defending their utility,\nCarnap (1963b, §24) agreed with Hempel (1958) that in practice\ntheoretical terms were indispensible in facilitating inductive\nrelations between observational data. As regards the defense of their\ncognitive legitimacy, Carnap held that this demanded determining what\nhe called their “experiential import”, namely, determining\nwhat specifically their empirical significance consisted in. It was\nfor this purpose that Carnap came to employ Ramsey’s method of\nregimenting theoretical terms. Nowadays this so-called ramseyfication\nis often discussed as a means for expressing a position of\n“structural realism”, a position midway between\nfully-blown scientific realism and anti-realism and so sometimes\nthought to be of interest to Carnap. Carnap’s own concern with\nramseyfication throws into relief not only the question of the\nviability of one of the Vienna Circle’s most forward-looking\nstances in the debate about theoretical terms—intending to avoid\nboth realism and anti-realism—but also several other issues that\nbear on the question of which, if any, forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy remain viable. \nNote that the issue of realism vis-à-vis theoretical terms is\nclosely related to two other issues central to the development of\nVienna Circle philosophy: Carnap’s further attempts to develop a\ncriterion of empiricist significance for the terms of the theoretical\nlanguages of science and his attempts to defend the distinction\nbetween synthetic and analytic statements with regard to such\ntheoretical languages. \nIn 1956 Carnap introduced a new criterion of significance specifically\nfor theoretical terms (1956b). This criterion was explicitly\ntheory-relative. Roughly, Carnap first defined the concept of the\n“relative significance” of a theoretical term. A term is\nrelatively significant if and only if there exists a statement in the\ntheoretical language that contains it as the only non-logical term and\nfrom which, in conjunction with another theoretical statement and the\nsets of theoretical postulates and correspondence rules, an\nobservational statement is derivable that is not derivable from that\nother theoretical statement and the sets of theoretical postulates and\ncorrespondence rules alone. Then Carnap defined the\n“significance” of a theoretical term in terms of it\nbelonging to a sequence of such terms such that each is relatively\nsignificant to the class of those terms that precede it in the\nsequence. Now those theoretical statements were legitimate and\ncognitively significant that were well-formed and whose descriptive\nconstants were significant the sense just specified. It is clear that\nby the stepwise introduction of theoretical terms as specified, Carnap\nsought to avoid the deleterious situations that rendered Ayer’s\ncriterion false (and his own of 1928). Nevertheless, this proposal too\nwas subjected to criticism (e.g., Rozeboom 1960, Kaplan 1975a). A\ncommon impression amongst philosophers appears to be that this\ncriterion failed as well, but this judgement is by no means\nuniversally shared (for the majority view see Glymour 1980, for a\ncontrary assessment see Sarkar 2001). Thus it has been argued that\nsubject to some further refinements, Carnap’s proposal can be\nmade to work (see for discussion Creath 1976, Justus 2014, Lutz 2017)—as long as the sharp\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms can be\nsustained. (In light of the objections to the latter distinction one\nwants to add: or by a dichotomy of terms functionally equivalent to\nit.) \nCarnap’s own position on his 1956 criterion appears somewhat\nambiguous. While he is reported to have accepted one set of criticisms\n(Kaplan 1975b), he also asserted even after they had been put to him\nthat he thought his 1956 criterion remained adequate (1963b,\n§24b). Yet Carnap there also advised investigation of\nwhether still another, then entirely new approach to theoretical terms\nthat he was developing would allow for an improved criterion of significance\nfor them. So when Carnap offered “the Ramsey method” as a\nmethod of characterizing the “empirical meaning of theoretical\nterms” it was not their empirical significance as such but the\nspecific empirical import of theoretical terms that he considered\n(1966, Ch. 26). What prompted him to undertake his investigations of\nramseyfications was not dissatisfaction with his 1956 proposal as a\ncriterion of significance for theoretical terms, but the fact that it still proved\nimpossible with this model to draw the distinction between synthetic and analytic\nstatements in the theoretical language. The reason for this was that\nthe postulates for the theoretical language also specify factual\nrelations between phenomena that fall under the concepts that are\nimplicitly defined by them. (As noted, a similar problem already had\nplagued Carnap’s analyses of disposition terms ever since he\nallowed for non-eliminative reduction chains.) \nCarnap’s attempt to address this problem by ramseyfication was\npublished in several places from 1958 onwards. (See Carnap 1958, 1963,\n§24C-D and the popular exposition 1966, Chs. 26 and 28; compare\nRamsey 1929 and see Psillos 1999, Ch.3. This proposal and a variant of\nit (1961b) were both presented in his 1959 Santa Barbara lecture\n(published in Psillos 2000a); as it happened, Kaplan presented his\ncriticism (1975a) of Carnap’s 1956 criterion at the same\nconference.) With ramseyfication Carnap adverted again to entire\ntheories as the unit of assessment. Ramseyfication consists in the\nreplacement of the theoretical terms of a finitely axiomatized theory\nby bound higher-order variables. This involves combining all the\ntheoretical postulates which define theoretical terms (call this\nconjunction T) and correspondence rules of a theory which\nlink some of these theoretical terms with observational ones (call\nthis C) in one long sentence (call this TC) and then\nreplacing all the theoretical predicates that occur in it by bound\nhigher-order variables (call this RTC). This is\nthe so-called Ramsey-sentence of the entire theory; in it no\ntheoretical terms appear, but it possesses the same explanatory and\npredictive power as the original theory: it has the same observational\nconsequences. However, Carnap stressed that the Ramsey sentence cannot\nbe said to be expressed in a “simple” but only an\n“extended” observational language, for due to its\nhigher-order quantificational apparatus it includes “an advanced\ncomplicated logic embracing virtually the whole of mathematics”\n(1966, [1996, 253]). \nTo distinguish between analytic and synthetic statements in the\ntheoretical language Carnap made the following proposal. Let the\nRamsey sentence of the conjunction of all theoretical postulates and\nthe conjunction of all correspondence rules of that theory be\nconsidered as expressing the entire factual, synthetic content of the\nscientific theory and its terms in their entirety. By contrast, the\nstatement “RTC → TC”\nexpressed the purely analytic component of the theory, its\n“A-postulate” (or so-called Carnap sentence). This\n“A-postulate states that if entities exist (referred to by the\nexistential quantifiers of the Ramsey sentence) that are of a kind\nbound together by all the relations expressed in the theoretical\npostulates of the theory and that are related to observational\nentities by all the relations specified by the correspondence\npostulates of the theory, then the theory itself is true.” Or\ndifferently put, the A-postulate “says only that if the world is\nthis way, then the theoretical terms must be understood as satisfying\nthe theory” (1966 [1996, 271]). With RTC\n→ TC expressing a meaning postulate Carnap\nclaimed to have separated the analytic and synthetic components of a\nscientific theory. \nCarnap’s adoption of the Ramsey method met mainly with criticism\n(Psillos 1999, ch.3, 2000b, Demopoulos 2003, 2017), even though\nramseyfications continue to be discussed as a method of characterizing\ntheoretical terms in a realist vein (albeit with conditions not yet\nintroduced by Carnap, as in Lewis 1970, Papineau 1996). With\nCarnap’s ramseyfications, however, we do not get the answer that what exists is the structure that the ramseyfication at hand\nidentifies. Given the absence of a clause requiring unique\nrealizability, ramseyfications counseled modesty: the structure that\nis identified remains indeterminate to just that degree to which\ntheoretical terms remain incompletely interpreted (Carnap 1961b). To\nthis we must add that for Carnap ramseyfications of theoretical terms\ncan support only internal existence claims: he explicitly reaffirmed\nhis confidence in the distinction between internal and external\nquestion to defuse the realism/anti-realism issue (1966 [1996, 256]).\nThis strongly suggests that with these proposals Carnap did not intend\nto deviate from his deflationist approach to ontology. \nWhat must be considered, however, is that Carnap’s proposal to\nreconstruct the contribution of theoretical terms by ramseyfication\nfalls foul of arguments deriving from M.H.A. Newman’s objection\nto Russell’s structuralism in Analysis of Matter (see\nDemopoulos and Friedman 1985). This objection says that once they are\nempirically adequate, ramseyfied theories are trivially true, given\nthe nature of their reconstruction of original theories. Russell held\nthat “nothing but the structure of the external world is\nknown”. But if nothing is known about the generating relation\nthat produces the structure, then the claim that there exists such a\nstructure is vacuous, Newman claimed. “Any collection of things\ncan be organised so as to have the structure W, provided\nthere are the right number of them.” (Newman 1928, 144) To see\nhow this so-called cardinality constraint applies to ramseyfications\nof theories, note that in Carnap’s hands, the non-observational\npart of reconstructed theories, their theoretical entities, were\nrepresented by “purely logico-mathematical entities, e.g.\nnatural numbers, classes of such, classes of classes, etc.” For\nhim the Ramsey sentence asserted that “observable events in the\nworld are such that there are numbers, classes of such, etc., which\nare correlated with events in a prescribed way and which have among\nthemselves certain relations”, this being “clearly a\nfactual statement about the world” (Carnap 1963b, 963). Carnap\nhere had mathematical physics in mind where space-time points are\nrepresented by quadruples of real numbers and physical properties like\nelectrical charge-density or mass-density are represented as functions\nof such quadruples of real numbers. \nThe problem that arises from this for Carnap is not the\nfailure to single out the intended interpretation of the theory: as\nnoted, Carnap clearly thought it an advantage of the method that it\nremained suitably indeterminate. The problem for Carnap is rather\nthat, subject to its empirical adequacy, the truth conditions of the\nRamsey-sentences are fulfilled trivially on logico-mathematical\ngrounds alone. As he stated, Ramsey-sentences demand that there be a\nstructure of entities that is correlated with observable events in the\nway described. Yet given the amount of mathematics that went into the\nramseyfied theory—“virtually the whole of\nmathematics”—some such structure as demanded by the\nRamsey-sentence is bound to be found among those entities presupposed\nby its representational apparatus. (Here the cardinality constraint is no\nconstraint at all.) That any theory is trivially true for purely\nformal reasons (as long as it is empirically adequate) therefore is held against\nCarnap’s proposal to use Ramsey sentences as reconstructions of\nthe synthetic content of the theoretical part of empirical scientific\ntheories. Given that with ramseyfications “the truth of physical\ntheory reduces to the truth of its observational consequences”\n(Demopoulos and Friedman 1985, 635), this is a problem for\nCarnap’s project on its own terms: any surplus empirical meaning\nof theoretical terms that Carnap sought to capture simply evaporates\n(Demopoulos 2003). \nThis result casts its shadow over Carnap’s last treatment of\ntheoretical terms in its entirety and threatens further consequences.\nIf the reconstruction of empirical theories by ramseyfication in\nCarnap’s fashion is unacceptable, then all explications that\nbuild on this are called into question: explications of theoretical\nanalyticity as much as explications of the experiential import of\ntheories. If no justice has been done to the experiential\nimport of theoretical terms, then one must ask whether\nthe analytic components of a theoretical language have been correctly\nidentified. If they have not, then the meta-theoretical utility of the\nsynthetic/analytic distinction is once again be called into\nquestion. \nOne is lead to wonder whether Carnap would not be well advised to\nreturn to his 1956 position. This allowed for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance for theoretical terms but not for the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction to be sustained with regard to the theoretical language.\nAccording to Carnap’s fall-back position before he hit upon\nramseyfication, it was thought possible to distinguish narrow logical\ntruth from factual truth in the theoretical language (1966, Ch. 28).\nYet it is difficult to silence the suspicion that an\nanalytic/synthetic distinction that applies only to observational\nlanguages—and admits inescapable semantical holism for\ntheoretical languages—is not what the debate between Carnap and\nQuine was all about. Attempts have thus been undertaken\nto provide interpretations of Carnap’s\nramseyfications that contain or mitigate the effects of the Newman\nobjection (Friedman 2008, 2011, Uebel 2011b, Creath 2012). What has become clear, in any case,\nis that much is at stake for Carnap’s formal explicationism,\nindeed for the standard logical empiricist model of scientific\ntheories (see below). \nWe are now in a position to return to a final criticism of the search\nfor a criterion of empiricist significance. Much has been made of the\nvery status of the criterion itself (however it may be put in the\nend): was it empirically testable? It is common to claim that it is\nnot and therefore to consign it to insignificance in turn, following\nPutnam (1981a, 1981b). The question arises whether this is to overlook the fact \nthat the criterion of significance was put forward not as an empirical\nclaim but as a meta-theoretical proposal for how to delimit empiricist\nlanguages from non-empiricist ones. Again, pursuing this line of\ninquiry is not to deny that the meaning\ncriterion may have been understood by some members of the Circle in such a way that it became liable\nto charges of self-refutation. Even if that were the case, the reason\nfor this may be found not in the very idea of such a criterion, but\nin the contradictory status of the Tractarian “elucidations” to which\nthe criterion was likened. (The legitimacy of these elucidations was\nat issue already in the debates that divided the Circle in the early\n1930s; see, e.g., Neurath 1932a.) What will be considered here is primarily the view of Carnap, who from 1932 onwards put his\nphilosophical theses in the form of “proposals” for\nalternative language forms, but how the pragmatist alternative fares\nwill also be considered. Finally, we will consider where this does\nleave neopositivist anti-metaphysics. \nFor Carnap, the empiricist criterion of significance was an analytic\nprinciple, but in a very special sense. As a convention, the criterion\nhad the standing of an analytic statement, but it was not a formally\nspecifiable framework principle of the language Ln\nto which it pertained. Properly formulated, it was a semantic\nprinciple concerning Ln that was statable only in\nits meta-language Ln+1. To argue that the\ncriterion itself is meaningless because it has no standing in\nLn is to commit a category mistake, for\nmeta-linguistic assertions need not have counterparts in their object\nlanguages (Goldfarb 1997, Creath 2004, Richardson 2004). Nor would it\nbe correct to claim that the criterion hides circular reasoning,\nallegedly because its rejection of the meaningless depends on an\nunquestioned notion of experiential fact as self-explanatory (when\nsuch fact is still to be constituted). Importantly, Carnap’s\nlanguage constructor does not start with fixed notions of what is\nempirical (rather than formal) or what is given (rather than assumed\nor inferred), but from the beginning allows a plurality of\nperspectives on these distinctions (Ricketts 1994). Carnap’s\nempiricist criterion of significance is precisely this: an\nexplication, a proposal for how empiricists may wish to speak. It is\nnot an explanation of how meaning arises from what is not meaningful\nin itself. Unlike theorists who wish to explain how meaning itself is\nconstituted, explicationists can remain untroubled by the regress of\nformal semantics with Tarskian strictures. For them, the lack of\nformal closure (the incompleteness of arithmetic and the\ninapplicability of the truth predicate to its own language) only\nbetokens the fact that our very own home languages cannot ever be\nfully explicated. \nIt may be wondered whether such considerations have not become\npointless, given the troubles that attempts to provide a criterion of\nsignificance ran into. However, as we saw, Carnap’s 1956\ncriterion for constructed languages remains in play. Moreover, there\nalso remains the informal, pragmatic approach that can be applied even\nmore widely. Thus it is not without importance to see that pragmatic\nprinciples delineating empirical significance (like Mach’s or\nQuine’s Peircean insight) are not ruled out from the start\neither. The reason for this is different however. For pragmatists, the\nanti-metaphysical demarcation criterion is not strictly speaking a\nmeaning criterion. The pragmatic criterion of significance is\nexpressly epistemic, not semantic: it speaks of relevance with regard\nto an established cognitive practice, not in-principle\ntruth-evaluability. This criterion is most easily expressed as a\nconditional norm, alongside other methodological maxims. (If you want\nyour reasoning to be responsible to evidence, then avoid statements\nthat experience can neither confirm or disconfirm, however\nindirectly.) So the suggestion that the criterion of empirical\nsignificance can be regarded as a proposal for how to treat the\nlanguage of science cannot be brushed aside but for the persistent\nneglect of the philosophical projects of Carnap or the non-formalist\nleft Vienna Circle. \nStill, some readers may wonder whether in the course of responding to\nthe various counter-criticisms, the Vienna Circle’s position has\nnot shifted considerably. This indeed is true: the attempt to show\nmetaphysics strictly meaningless once and for all did not succeed. For\neven if Carnap’s 1956 criterion and the pragmatic approach work,\nthey do not achieve that: Carnap’s criterion only works for\nconstructed languages and the pragmatic one does not address the\nsemantic issue and only works case by case. But it can be argued that\nwhile this debilitates the Vienna Circle’s most notorious claim\n(if understood without qualifications), it does not debilitate their\nentire program. That was, we recall, to defend Enlightenment reason\nand to counter the abuse of possibly empty but certainly\nill-understood deep-sounding language in science and in public life.\nTheir program was, to put it somewhat anachronistically, to promote\nepistemic empowerment. This program would have been helped by an\nacross-the-board criterion to show metaphysics meaningless, but it can\nalso proceed in its absence. \nBut now the suspicion may be that if all that is meant to be excluded\nis speculative reason without due regard to empirical and\nlogico-linguistic evidence, the program’s success appears too\neasy. Few contemporary philosophers would confess to such reckless\npractices. Still, even the rejection of speculative reason is by no\nmeans uncontroversial, as shown by the unresolved status of the appeal\nto intuitions that characterizes much of contemporary analytical\nmetaphysics and epistemology. Moreover, much depends on what’s\nconsidered to be “due regard”: is merely bad science\n“metaphysics”? Or only appeals to the supernatural? And\nwhat about de re necessities? Or the seeming commitments of\nexistential quantification? The promotion of anti-metaphysics may be\napplauded in principle as an exercise in intellectual hygiene, the\nobjection goes, but in practice it excludes either too much or too\nlittle: it either cripples our understanding of theoretical science or\nnormalizes away the Vienna Circle’s most notorious claim. \nIn response it is helpful to consider the conception of metaphysics\nthat can be seen to be motivating much of the Circle’s ethical\nnon-cognitivism. What did Carnap (1935) and Neurath (1932a) dismiss\nwhen they dismissed normative ethics as metaphysical and cognitively\nmeaningless? One may concede that due to the brusque way in which they\nput their broadly Humean point, they opened themselves up to\nsignificant criticism, but it is very important to see also what they\ndid not do. Most notably, they did not dismiss as meaningless all\nconcern with how to live. Conditional prescriptions remained\nstraight-forwardly truth-evaluable in instrumental terms and so\ncognitively meaningful. In addition, their own active engagement for\nEnlightenment values in public life showed that they took these\nmatters very seriously themselves. (In fact, their engagement as\npublic intellectuals compares strikingly with that of most\ncontemporary philosophers of science.) But neither did they fall\nvictim to the naturalistic fallacy nor were they simply inconsistent.\nIn the determination of basic values they rather saw acts of personal\nself-definition, but, characteristically, Carnap showed a more\nindividualistic and Neurath a more collectively oriented approach to the\nmatter. What needs to be borne in mind, then, is the meaning that they\nattached to the epithet “metaphysical” in this and other\nareas: the arrogation of unique and fully determined objective insight\ninto matters beyond scientific reason. It was in the ambition of\nproviding such unconditional prescriptions that they saw philosophical\nethics being the heir of theology. (Compare Carnap 1935 and 1963b,\n§32 and Neurath 1932a and 1944, §19.) Needless to say, it\nremains contentious to claim those types of philosophical ethics to be\ncognitively meaningless that seek to derive determinate sets of codes\nfrom some indisputable principle or other. But the ongoing discussion\nof non-cognitivism and its persistent defense in analytical ethics as “expressivism”\nsuggest that, understood as outlined, the Circle’s\nnon-cognitivism was by no means absurd or contradictory. \nIt may be noted here that a newly discovered fragment of\nCarnap’s writing (2017) has given fresh impetus to explorations\nof the model of ethical reasoning in terms of optatives that Carnap\noutlined (1963b, §32) in response to A. Kaplan’s criticism\n(1963) of his earlier position. What emerges is that Carnap was\nprepared to integrate ethical desiderata among non-ethical ones within\nthe network of means and ends that decision theory as a normative\ntheory of rational action seeks to systematize and regiment. Moral\nreasoning is assimilated to practical reasoning and no longer suffers\nfrom a deficit of significance—albeit at the cost of not being\nable to exclude appeals to certain types of intrinsic value on the ground their being beyond the pale (see Carus 2017). Carnap\nmay reasonably respond here that as a theorist of science he is not\nrequired to account for normative ethics beyond providing a framework\nfor understanding its undeniable role in a generic theory of human\nbehavior. What was rightly objected against his earlier position was\nthat it made such understanding impossible. \nWhatever the details, their non-cognitivism supports the idea that the\nleft wing’s anti-metaphysics was primarily deflationist. They opposed all claims to have a categorically deeper\ninsight into reality than either empirical or formal science, such\nthat philosophy would stand in judgement of these sciences as to their\nreality content or that mere science would stand in need of\nphilosophical interpretations. (Concerned with practical problems,\nthey likewise opposed philosophical claims to stand above the\ncontestations of mere mortals.) Importantly, such deflationism need\nnot remain general and vague, but can be given precise content. For\ninstance, it has been argued (Carus 1999) that Carnap was correct to understand Tarski’s theory of truth not as a traditional\ncorrespondence theory such that truth consisted in some kind of\nagreement of statements or judgements and facts or the world where the\nlatter make true the former. In Carnap’s unchanged opposition to\nthe classical correspondence theory of truth in turn lies not only the\ncontinuity between his own syntactic and semantic phases, but also the\nkey to his and the entire left Vienna Circle’s understanding of\ntheir anti-metaphysical campaign. (On various occasions in the early\n30s, Hahn, Frank and Neurath opposed correspondence truth very\nexplicitly, while, in later years, Neurath resisted Tarskian semantics\nprecisely because he wrongly suspected it of resurrecting\ncorrespondentism and Frank continued to castigate correspondentism\nwhenever required. On this tangled issue, see Mormann 1999, Uebel\n2004, Mancosu 2008.) \nThis suggests that a hard core of Viennese anti-metaphysics survives\nthe criticism and subsequent qualifications of early claims made for\ntheir criteria of empirical significance, yet retains sufficient\nphilosophical teeth to remain of contemporary interest. The\nmetaphysics which the left wing attacked, besides everyday\nsupernaturalism and the supra-scientific essentialism of old, was the\ncorrespondence conception of truth and associated realist conceptions\nof knowledge. These notions were deemed attackable directly on\nepistemological grounds, without any diversion through the theory of\nmeaning: how could such correspondences or likenesses ever be\nestablished? As Neurath liked to put it (1930), we cannot step outside\nof our thinking to see whether a correspondence obtains between what\nwe think and how the world is. (Against defenses of the correspondence\ntheory by arguments from analogy it would be argued that the\nanalogy is overextended.) Against the counter that this is merely an\nepistemic argument that does not touch the ontological issue Neurath\nis likely to have argued that doing without an epistemic account is a\nrecipe for uncontrollable metaphysics. \nImportantly, the left wing’s deflationary anti-metaphysics was\naccompanied by a distinctively constructivist attitude. Here one must\nhasten to add, of course, that what was constructed were not the\nobjects of first-order discourse (tables, chairs, electrons and black\nholes) but concepts, be they concepts associated with technical terms for observables, theoretical terms or terms needed for reflection\nabout the cognitive enterprise of science (ideas like evidence and its\ndegrees and presuppositions). As meta-theorists of science they\ndeveloped explications: different types of explications were\nenvisaged, ranging from analytic definitions giving necessary and\nsufficient conditions in formal languages all the way to pragmatic,\nexemplar-based criterial delimitations of the central applications of\ncontested concepts or practices. Two branches of the Circle’s\nconstructivist tendency can thus be distinguished: Carnap’s\nrational reconstructions and formalist explications and\nNeurath’s and Frank’s empirically informed and\npractice-oriented reconceptualizations. The difference between these\ntwo approaches can be understood as a division\nof labor between the tasks of exploring logico-linguistic\npossibilities of conceptual reconstruction and considering the\nefficacy of particular scientific practices. In principle, the\nconstructivist tendency in Vienna Circle philosophy was able to\nembrace both (compare Carnap 1934/37, §72 and Neurath 1936b).\nHowever, in its own day, this two-track approach remained\nincompletely realized as philosophical relations between Carnap and\nNeurath soured over disputes stemming from mutual misunderstandings.\nFrank’s final paper (1963) was a terse reminder that the logic\nof science was not the sole successor or replacement of traditional\nphilosophy and Carnap’s response (1963b, §3) again acknowledged the compatibility in principle of his logic of science and what Frank called the “pragmatics of science” (1957).  \nConsidering the Vienna Circle as a whole in the light of this reading\nof its anti-metaphysical philosophy, we find the most striking\ndivision within it yet. Unlike Carnap and the left wing, Schlick had\nlittle problem with a correspondence theory of truth once it was\ncleansed of psychologistic and intuitive accretions and centered on\nthe idea of unique coordination of statement and fact. In this lay the\nstrongest sense of continuity between his pre-Vienna Circle\nGeneral Theory of Knowledge (1918/25) and his post-Tractarian\nepistemology (1935a, 1935b). (Schlick also showed little enthusiasm\nfor the constructivist tendencies which already the manifesto of 1929\nhad celebrated.) Allowing for some simplification, it must be noted\nthat Schlick’s attack on metaphysics (which gradually weakened\nanyway) presupposed a non-constructivist reading of the criterion of\nsignificance. Whether his conception can escape the charge\nself-refutation must be left open here. \nMuch confusion exists concerning the Vienna Circle and history, that\nis, both concerning the Vienna Circle’s attitude towards the\nhistory of philosophy and science and concerning its own place in that\nhistory. As more has been learnt about the history of the Vienna\nCircle itself—the development and variety of its doctrines as\nwell as its own prehistory as a philosophical forum—this\nconfusion can be addressed more adequately. \nAs the unnamed villain of the opening sentences of Kuhn’s\ninfluential Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962),\nlogical empiricism is often accused of lacking historical\nconsciousness and any sense of the embedding of philosophy and science\nin the wider culture of the day. Again it can hardly be denied that\nmuch logical empiricist philosophy, especially after World War II, was\nahistorical in outlook and asocial in its orientation.\nReichenbach’s distinction (1938) between the contexts of\ndiscovery and justification—which echoed distinctions made since\nKant (Hoyningen-Huene 1987) and was already observed under a different\nname by Carnap in the Aufbau—was often employed to\nshield philosophy not only from contact with the sciences as practiced\nbut also culture at large. But this was not the case for the Vienna\nCircle generally. On the one hand, unlike Reichenbach, who drew a\nsharp break between traditional philosophy and the new philosophy of\nlogical empiricism in his popular The Rise of Scientific\nPhilosophy (1951), Schlick was very much concerned to stress the\nremaining continuities with traditional philosophy and its cultural\nmission in his last paper (1938). On the other hand, on the left wing\nof the Circle scientific meta-theory was opened to the empirical\nsciences. To be sure, Carnap for his own part was happy to withdraw to\nthe “icy slopes” of the logic of science and showed no\nresearch interest of his own in the history of science or philosophy,\nlet alone its social history. By way of the division of labor he left\nit to Neurath and Frank to pursue the historical and practice-related\nsociological questions that the pure logic of science had to leave\nunaddressed. (See, e.g., Neurath’s studies of the history of\noptics (1915, 1916), Frank’s homage to Mach (1917), his\npedagogical papers in (1949b) and his concern with the practice of\ntheory acceptance and change in (1956); cf. Uebel 2000 and Nemeth\n2007.) Moreover, it must be noted that Neurath himself all along had\nplanned a volume on the history of science for the International\nEncyclopedia of Science, a volume that in the end became Kuhn’s\nStructure. Its publication in this series is often regarded as supremely ironical, given\nhow Kuhn’s book is commonly read. But this is not only to\noverlook that the surviving editors of that series, Carnap and Morris\nwere happy to accept the manuscript, but also that Carnap found himself in\npositive agreement with Kuhn (Reisch 1991, Irzik and\nGrunberg 1995; cf. Friedman 2001). Finally, one look at the 1929\nmanifesto shows that its authors were very aware of and promoted the\nlinks between their philosophy of science and the socio-political and\ncultural issues of the day. \nTurning to the historical influences on the Vienna Circle itself, the\nscholarship of recent decades has unearthed a much greater variety\nthan was previously recognized. Scientifically, the strongest\ninfluences belonged to the physicists Helmholtz, Mach and Boltzmann,\nthe mathematicians Hilbert and Klein and the logicians Frege and\nRussell; amongst contemporaries, Einstein was revered above all\nothers. The Circle’s philosophical influences extend far beyond\nthat of the British empiricists (especially Hume), to include the\nFrench conventionalists Henri Poincaré, Pierre Duhem and Abel\nRey, American pragmatists like James and, in German-language\nphilosophy, the Neo-Kantianism of both the Heidelberg and the Marburg\nvariety, even the early phenomenology of Husserl as well as the\nAustrian tradition of Bolzano’s logic and the Brentano school.\n(See Frank 1949a for the influence of the French conventionalists; for the importance of\nNeo-Kantianism for Carnap, see Friedman 1987, 1992, Sauer 1989,\nRichardson 1998, Mormann 2007; for Neo-Kantianism in Schlick, see\nCoffa 1991, Ch. 9 and Gower 2000; for the significance of Husserl for\nCarnap, see Sarkar 2004, Ryckman 2007, Carus 2016, Damböck 2018; for the influence of and sympathies for pragmatism see Frank 1949a and Uebel 2016; the Bolzano-Brentano\nconnection is explored in Haller 1986.) It is against this very wide\nbackground of influences that the seminal force must be assessed that\ntheir contemporary Wittgenstein exerted. The literature on the\nrelation between Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle is vast but very\noften suffers from an over-simplified conception of the latter. (See\nStern 2007 for an attempt by a Wittgenstein scholar to redress the\nbalance.) Needless to say, different wings of the Circle show these\ninfluences to different degrees. German Neo-Kantianism was important\nfor Schlick and particularly so for Carnap, whereas the Austrian\nnaturalist-pragmatist influences were particularly strong on Hahn,\nFrank and Neurath. Frege was of great importance for Carnap, less so\nfor Hahn who looked to Russell. Most importantly, by no means all\nmembers of the Vienna Circle sought to emulate Wittgenstein—thus\nthe division between the faction around Schlick and the left wing (see Uebel 2017). \nWhile these findings leave numerous questions open, they nevertheless refute the standard picture of Vienna Circle philosophy which confuses A.J. Ayer’s\nLanguage, Truth and Logic with the real thing. Ayer offered a version of British empiricism (Berkeley’s epistemic phenomenalism updated with Russellian logic) and paid no attention, for instance, to the Circle’s overarching concern with establishing\nthe objectivity claim of science. Ayer’s remark in the\npreface to his later anthology Logical Positivism that his own Language, Truth and Logic “did\nsomething to popularize what may be called the classical position of\nthe Vienna Circle” (1959b, 8) is highly misleading therefore. What he\ncalled “the classical position” was at best a partial characterisation of the starting\nposition of some—by no means all—of its members, a position which by 1932 the left\nwing as a whole rejected and even Schlick had no reason to\nendorse any longer. \nAll that said by way of embedding the Vienna Circle’s philosophy\nin its time, one must also ask whether its members understood their\nown position correctly. Here one issue in particular has become\nincreasingly prominent and raises questions that are of importance for\nphilosophy of science still today. That is whether, after all, logical\nempiricism did have the resources to understand correctly the then\nparadigm modern science, the general theory of relativity. According\nto the standard logical empiricist story (Schlick 1915, 1917, 1921,\n1922), their theory conclusively refuted the Kantian conception of the\nsynthetic a priori: Euclidean geometry was not only one\ngeometry amongst many, it also was not the one that characterized\nempirical reality. With one of its most prominent exemplars refuted,\nthe synthetic a priori was deemed overthrown altogether. As\nnoted, Schlick convinced the young Reichenbach to drop his residually\nKantian talk of constitutive principles and speak of conventions\ninstead. Likewise Schlick rejected efforts by Ernst Cassirer (see his\n1921, developing themes from his 1910) to make do with a merely\nrelative a priori in helping along scientific\nself-reflection. Even though much later, and on the independent\ngrounds of quantum physics, Frank attested to the increased proximity\nof his and Cassirer’s understanding of scientific theories\n(1938), Schlick’s disregard of Cassirer’s efforts remains\nnotable. \nMost controversial is how the issue of general relativity as a\ntouchstone for competing philosophies of science was framed: having\ndismissed Kant’s own synthetic a priori for its\nmistaken apodicity, no time was spared for discussion of its then\ncontemporary development in Neo-Kantianism as a merely relative but\nstill constitutive a priori. Now in the philosophy of\nphysics, this omission—committed both by Schlick and\nReichenbach—has recently come back to haunt logical empiricists\nwith considerable vengeance. Thus it has been argued that the\nSchlick-Reichenbach reading of general relativity as embodying the\nstandard logical empiricist model of scientific theories, with high\ntheory linked to its observational strata by purely conventional\ncoordinative definitions, is deeply mistaken in representing the local\nmetric of space-time not to be empirically but conventionally\ndetermined as in special relativity (Ryckman 1992) and that\nit is instead only the tradition of transcendental idealism that\npossesses the resources to understand the achievements of mathematical\nphysics (Ryckman 2005; cf. Friedman 2001). It is tempting to speak of\nthe return of the repressed Neo-Kantian opposition. But it is tempting\ntoo to note that Schlick’s and Reichenbach’s mistake was\nalready corrected quietly and without fanfare by Carnap (see the\nexample in his 1934/37, §50). Clearly then, the mistake was not\ninevitable and inherent in logical empiricist theorizing about\nscience as such. (For discussion of different criticism of the Circle’s reading of Einstein, especially his relation to Mach, see DiSalle 2006, Ch.4.) \nThe charge of a constitutive failing would rather seem to come from\nDemopoulos’s challenge to the two-languages model (nearly)\nuniversally adopted in logical empiricism (forthcoming). Importantly,\nthis challenge does not proceed, as some previous ones have, from the\nimpossibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the observational and the theoretical (Putnam\n1962). Rather, the two-languages model falsely supposes that the\nprocess of testing scientific hypotheses must only advert to\ntheoretically uncontaminated facts and so results in misunderstanding\nthe empirical import of theoretical claims (as in the Newman problem).\nInstead, a conception of theory-mediated measurement and testing is\nsuggested that extends responsiveness to observational data to\ntheoretical claims by showing them to be essentially implicated in the\nproduction of observed experimental consequences. Hoping to advance\nbeyond the stalemate between realism and instrumentalism without\nappealing to question-begging semantics, Demopoulos here breaks with a\nsupposition upheld by Carnap throughout, namely that the theoretical\nlanguage be regarded as an essentially uninterpreted, at best partially\ninterpreted calculus. Whatever the outcome of this challenge, it is\nremarkable how on this far-reaching and fundamental issue contemporary\nphilosophy of science intersects with the history of philosophy of\nscience. \nIn conclusion, the results of the discussions in section 3 can be\nbriefly summarised. To start with, the dominant popular picture of the\nVienna Circle as a monolithic group of simple-minded verificationists\nwho pursued a blandly reductivist philosophy with foundationalist\nambitions is widely off the mark. Instead, the Vienna Circle must be\nseen as a forum in which widely divergent ideas about how empiricism\ncan cope with modern empirical and formal science were discussed.\nWhile by no means all of the philosophical initiatives started by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle have born fruit, it is neither the case\nthat all of them have remained fruitless. Nor is it the case that\neverything once distinctive of Vienna Circle philosophy has to be\ndiscarded. \nConsider verificationism. While the idea to show metaphysics\nonce-and-for-all and across-the-board to be not false but\nmeaningless—arguably the most distinctive thesis associated with\nthe Vienna Circle—did indeed have to be abandoned, two elements\nof that program remain so far unrefuted. On the one hand, it remains\nan option to pursue the search for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance in terms of constructed, formal languages further along\nthe lines opened by Carnap with his theory-relative proposal of 1956\n(and its later defense against critics). On the other\nhand—albeit at the cost of merging with the pragmatist tradition\nand losing the apparent Viennese distinctiveness—the option to\nneglect as cognitively irrelevant, and in this sense metaphysical, all\nassertions whose truth or falsity would not make a difference remains\nas open as it always was. In addition it must be noted that, properly\nformulated, neither the formalist version of the criterion of\nempirical significance for constructed languages nor the pragmatist\nversion of the criterion for natural languages are threatened by\nself-refutation. \nConsider analyticity. Here again, the traditional idea—sometimes\ndefended by some members—did show itself indefensible, but this\nleaves Carnap’s framework-relative interpretation of analyticity\nand the understanding of the a priori as equally relative\nto be explored. As noted, if Carnap’s ramseyfications can be\ndefended, an analytic/synthetic distinction could be upheld also for\nthe theoretical languages of science. In any case, however, the\ndistinction between framework principles and content continues to be\ndrawable on a case by case basis. \nConsider reductionism and foundationalism. While it cannot be denied\nthat various reductionist projects were at one time or another\nundertaken by members of the Vienna Circle and that not all of its\nmembers were epistemological anti-foundationalists either from the\nstart or at the end, it is clearly false to paint all of them with\nreductivist and/or foundationalist brushes. This is particularly true\nof the members of the so-called left wing of the Circle, all of whom\nended up with anti-foundationalist and anti-reductionist positions\n(even though this did involve instrumentalism for some). \nConsider also, however, the challenges mentioned above to the\nfundamental tenets of logical empiricism that remain issues of intense\ndiscussion: challenges to its conception of the nature of empirical\ntheory and of what is distinctive about the formal sciences. That to\nthis day no agreement has been reached about how its proposals are to\nbe replaced is not something that is unique to logical empiricism as a\nphilosophical movement, but that they remain on the table, as it were,\nshows the ongoing relevance and centrality of its work for philosophy\nof science. \nWhether the indicated qualifications and/or modifications count as\ndefeats of the original project depends at least in part on what\nprecisely is meant to be rejected when metaphysics is rejected and\nthat in turn depends on what the positive vision for philosophy\nconsists in. Here again one must differentiate. While some members\nended with considerable more sympathy for traditional philosophy than\nthey displayed in the Circle’s heyday—and may thus be\ncharged with partial surrender—others stuck to their guns. For\nthem, what remained of philosophy stayed squarely in the deflationist\nvein established by the linguistic turn. They offered explications of\ncontested concepts or practices that, they hoped, would prove useful.\nImportantly, the explications given can be of two sorts: the formal\nexplications of the logic of science by means of exemplary models of\nconstructed languages, and the more informal explications of the\nempirical theory of science given by spelling out how certain\ntheoretical desiderata can be attained more or less under practical\nconstraints. This has been designated as the bipartite metatheory\nconception of scientific philosophy and ascribed to the left wing of\nthe Circle as an ideal unifying its diverse methodologies (Uebel 2007,\nCh. 12, 2015). Readers will note therefore that despite his enormous\ncontribution to the development of Vienna Circle philosophy, it is not\nSchlick’s version of it that appears to this reviewer to be of\ncontinuing relevance to contemporary philosophy—unlike, in their\nvery different but not incompatible ways, Carnap’s and\nNeurath’s and Frank’s. This may be taken as a partial\nendorsement of Hempel’s 1991 judgement (quoted in sect. 1\nabove), against which, however, Carnap has here been re-claimed for\nthe Neurathian wing. \nNeedless to say, recent work on Vienna Circle philosophies continues\nto inspire a variety of approaches to the legacy they constitute\n(besides prompting continuing excavations of other members’\nnon-standard variants; e.g., on Feigl see Neuber 2011). There is\nMichael Friedman’s extremely wide-ranging project (2001, 2010,\n2012) to use the shortcomings of Vienna Circle philosophies as a\nspringboard for developing a renewed Kantian philosophy that also\novercomes the failings of neo-Kantianism and provides a\nphilosophy-cum-history fit for our post-Kuhnian times. Then there is\nRichardson’s proposal (2008) to turn the ambition to develop a\nscientific philosophy into a research programme for the history of\nscience, so as to reveal more clearly the real world dynamics and\nlimitations of philosophy as a scientific metatheory. And there is\nCarus’s suggestion (2007) that Carnap’s minimalist\nexplicationism be placed in the service of a renewed Enlightenment\nagenda (continuing the task of the “scientific world\nconception”). This connects with the current metaphilosophical interest in conceptual engineering, the relevance of Carnap’s work to which becoming increasingly recognised (Justus 2012, Wagner 2012, Brun 2016, Reck and Dutilh Novaes 2017, Dutilh Novaes forthcoming, Lutz forthcoming). All along, of course, Vienna Circle philosophies\nalso continue to serve as foils for alternative and self-consciously\npost-positivist programs, fruitfully so when informed by the results of recent\nscholarship (e.g. Ebbs 2017). \nIt would appear then that despite continued resistance to recent\nrevisionist scholarship—a resistance that consists not so much\nin contesting but in ignoring its results—the fortune of Vienna\nCircle philosophy has turned again. Restored from the numerous\ndistortions of its teachings that accrued over generations of acolytes\nand opponents, the Vienna Circle is being recognized again as a force\nof considerable philosophical sophistication. Not only is it the case\nthat its members profoundly influenced the actual development of\nanalytical philosophy of science with conceptual initiatives that,\ntypically, were seen through to their bitter end. It is also the case\nthat some of its members offered proposals and suggested approaches\nthat were not taken up widely at the time (if at all), but that are\nrelevant again today. Much like its precursors Frege, Russell and\nWittgenstein, the conventionalists Poincaré and Duhem, the\npragmatists Peirce and Dewey—and like its contemporaries from\nReichenbach’s Berlin Group and the Warsaw-Lvov school of logic\nto the Neo-Kantian Cassirer—the Vienna Circle affords a valuable\nvantage point on contemporary philosophy of empirical and formal\nscience.","contact.mail":"Thomas.Uebel@manchester.ac.uk","contact.domain":"manchester.ac.uk"}]
