One popular approach regards the notion of a possible object\nas intertwined with the notion of a possible world. There are two\nwidely discussed types of theory concerning the nature of possible\nworlds: actualist representationism and possibilist realism. They\nsupport two opposing views about possible objects. Examination of the\nways in which they do so reveals difficulties on both sides. There is\nanother popular approach, which has been influenced by the philosophy\nof Alexius Meinong. The Meinongian approach is relevant to theorizing\nabout possible objects because it attempts to construct a general\ntheory of objects other than ordinary concrete existing objects.\nIndependently of the debate about the nature of possible worlds or\nabout Meinongianism, it is not always as straightforward as it may at\nfirst appear to determine whether putative possible objects are indeed\npossible. Another category of object similar to that of a possible\nobject is the category of a fictional object. Although initially\nattractive, the idea that fictional objects are possible objects\nshould not be accepted blindly. An important instance of theoretical\nusefulness of possible objects is their central role in the validation\nof two controversial theorems of a simple quantified modal logic. \n\nPossible objects—possibilia (sing.\npossibile)—are objects that are possible. What it is to\nbe an object—which is a basic and universal metaphysical\ncategory—will not be discussed but will be simply assumed as\nunderstood. What it is to be possible is the focus. Possibility of an\nobject should be understood in tandem with another notion, namely,\nactuality. The two notions are related at least in the following way:\n(i) every actual object is a possible object. A more controversial\nrelation between the two notions is expressed as follows: (ii) not\nevery possible object is an actual object, that is, some possible\nobject is a non-actual object. \nThere is a wide-spread conservative view on objects, which says that\nany object is an actual object. In other words, the adjective\n‘actual’ is redundant, for it excludes no object. From\nthis it follows that non-actual possible objects are not objects, that\nis, they are nothing. Thus on this view, the adjective\n‘possible’ is equivalent to ‘actual’ when\napplied to objects and (ii) is false. This makes the notion of a\npossible object, or equivalently the notion of an actual object,\nuninteresting. The notion of an object is the basic notion and does\nall the work. There is another conservative view on objects, which\ndoes not deal in actuality or possibility directly. It deals in\nexistence instead. It is the view that any object is an existing\nobject. On this view, the following analog of (ii) is false: not every\nobject is an existing object, that is, some object is a non-existing\nobject. This view makes the notion of an existing object equivalent to\nthat of an object; existence adds nothing to objecthood. If we combine\ntalk of actuality and talk of existence, we obtain five alternative\nconservative views with varying degrees of conservatism: \n(1) Any object is an actual existing object; \n(2) Any object is an actual object, that is, it is either an actual\nexisting object or an actual non-existing object; \n(3) Any object is an existing object, that is, it is either an actual\nexisting object or a non-actual existing object; \n(4) Any object that is actual is an existing object; \n(5) Any object that exists is an actual object. \n(1) is a stronger claim than the other four. (2) and (3) are stronger\nthan (5) and (4), respectively. (1)-(3) give characterizations of all\nobjects, whereas (4) and (5) are more limited in scope. When the verb\n‘exists’ is understood with the most comprehensive domain\nof discourse (assuming the availability of such a domain), (5) is\nknown as actualism. If the domain of discourse for\n‘exists’ is stipulated to consist only of actual objects,\n(5) is trivial and compatible with possibilism, the position\nwhich says that some object is outside the domain consisting of all\nactual objects; cf. (ii). Most of those who advertise their\npositions as actualist hold not only (5) with the most comprehensive\ndomain of discourse in mind but also (1), and therefore (2)-(4) as\nwell. There are some theorists who hold (5), or at least do not deny\n(5), but deny (1). They do so by denying (3), that is, by maintaining\nthat some object is a non-existing object. Such a view is one version\nof Meinongianism. But let us start with actualism and possibilism.\n \nWe shall first examine possibilism. It is superficially the most\ncommonsensical position. It is superficially commonsensical to hold\nthat some objects are not actual: e.g., Santa Claus, the Fountain of\nYouth. If we understand this view in terms of existence, that is, as\nthe claim that there are—that is, there exist—some objects\nthat are not actual, we have possibilism. As we have noted,\n‘exist’ here should not mean “actually exist”\nbut should be understood with a larger domain of discourse in mind.\nSuch a domain is the domain containing not only actual objects but\nalso non-actual possible objects as genuine objects. To flesh out the\nidea of such a domain as proposed by the best-known version of\npossibilism, it is necessary to start with the idea of a possible\nworld. After we articulate and examine possibilism as couched in the\npossible-worlds framework, we shall discuss versions of actualism also\ncouched in the possible-worlds framework. We shall then examine other\ntheories outside the possible-worlds framework. \nAccording to the framework of possible worlds, all alethic modal\nstatements involving possibility are existential quantifications over\npossible worlds and all alethic modal statements involving actuality\nare singular statements about a particular possible world, namely, the\nactual world (Kripke 1959, 1963a, 1963b). For example, to say that\nJulius Caesar was possibly not assassinated is to say that Julius\nCaesar was not assassinated at some possible world, and to say that\nJulius Caesar was actually assassinated is to say that Julius Caesar\nwas assassinated at the actual world. Likewise with existence: to say\nthat Julius Caesar possibly existed is to say that Julius Caesar\nexisted at some possible world, and to say that Julius Caesar actually\nexisted is to say that Julius Caesar existed at the actual world.\nAssuming that the actual world is a possible world, it follows that if\nJulius Caesar actually existed, he possibly existed. \nIn general, any object that actually exists possibly exists. Assuming\nthat actuality (of an object) is nothing but actual existence and\npossibility (of an object) is nothing but possible existence, this\ngrounds the plausible conceptual connection between actuality and\npossibility noted earlier: (i) every actual object is a possible\nobject. The overall philosophical merit of the possible-worlds\nframework cannot be judged without close scrutiny of its metaphysical\nfoundations. Specifically, the two key questions which need to be\nasked are: “What are possible worlds in general?” and\n“What is the actual world in particular?” Metaphysical\ntheorizing about possible worlds goes back at least to Leibniz, but\nthe contemporary theorizing is pursued largely on two distinct fronts;\npossibilist realism and actualist representationism.  \nPossibilist realism takes non-actual possible objects to be (real,\ngenuine) objects; it takes their metaphysical status to be on a par\nwith that of actual objects. When possibilist realists assert,\n“Non-actual possible objects exist”, their word\n‘exist’ has the same linguistic meaning as when actualists\nassert, “Actual objects exist”. Possibilist realists\nbelieve that some domains of discourse with respect to which\n‘exist’ may be understood include more than actual\nobjects, whereas actualists deny it. Thus according to possibilist\nrealism, to call an object non-actually possibly existent is merely to\ndeny its inclusion in a particular realm—call it\n‘actuality’—and affirm its inclusion in some other\nrealm. That other realm is no less a realm of existence than actuality\nis a realm of existence. All realms of existence are metaphysically on\na par with one another. Every token use of the existence predicate is\nto be understood with respect to some realm of existence, either\nexplicitly or implicitly. \nWhat distinguishes actuality from all other realms? The leading answer\nis due to David Lewis, who is the proponent of the best-known version\nof possibilist realism, namely, modal counterpart theory.\nLewis’s view on actuality is known as the indexical theory of\nactuality (Lewis 1970). The basic idea is that actuality for us is the\nrealm which includes us, and more generally, actuality for x\nis the realm which includes x. But there are many different\nrealms which include us: this room, this building, this town, this\ncontinent, this planet, this galaxy, this minute, this hour, this day,\nthis month, this year, this century, etc. So, to fix our actuality as\na unique realm which includes us, Lewis takes the largest\nspatiotemporal whole which includes us. More precisely, actuality for\nus is the maximal spatiotemporally related whole of which we are\n(mereological) part. In general, actuality for x is the\nmaximal spatiotemporally related whole of which x is part.\nFor anything to exist non-actually-for-x but possibly is for\nit to be part of some realm outside actuality for x, that is,\nto be part of some maximal spatiotemporally related whole of which\nx is not part. Note that this is a reductionist view of\nexistence, both actual and non-actual possible. Existence is first\nrelativized to a maximal spatiotemporally related whole, and then\nexistence in such a whole is defined reductively in terms of\n(mereological) parthood. Lewis characterizes possible worlds as\nmaximal spatiotemporally related wholes. Actuality is the actual\nworld, and all other maximal spatiotemporally related wholes are\nnon-actual possible worlds. \nA possible object is simply a part of a maximal spatiotemporally\nrelated whole (Lewis 1986). (Strictly speaking Lewis prefers to say\n“analogically spatiotemporal” instead of\n“spatiotemporal” but we shall let that pass.) By most\ncriteria, Lewis’s possible worlds, hence also his possible\nobjects, fall under the label ‘concrete’ rather than\n‘abstract’. Every non-actual possible object (apart from\npure Cartesian egos, perhaps) is a spatiotemporal object and bears no\nspatiotemporal relation to any actual object, or to any possible\nobject exiting at any possible world at which it does not exist. This\nmakes non-actual possible objects as real as non-actual possible\nworlds. It is worth while to remind ourselves that this does not make\nit automatically true to say that non-actual possible objects exist,\neven if we accept non-actual possible worlds. Whether it is true to\nsay so depends on the domain of discourse with respect to which the\nexistence predicate is to be understood. \nOn Lewis’s modal counterpart theory, every possible object is\nconfined to one possible world. Indeed, Lewis defines a possible\nobject as an object all of whose parts exist at some single possible\nworld (Lewis 1986: 211). This conception of a possible object forces\nLewis to resort to his counterpart theoretic account of modality\nde re (Lewis 1968). According to any possible-worlds theory\nof modality, to say that you could have been the leader of a religious\ncult is to say that at some possible world you are the leader of a\nreligious cult. According to Lewis, to say that at a possible world\nyou are the leader of a religious cult is to say that at that possible\nworld there is a counterpart of you, that is, someone who resembles\nyou to sufficient degrees in relevant respects, who is the leader of a\nreligious cult. The counterpart relation is a similarity relation in\nmost cases (but arguably not in all cases). As such, it is not an\nequivalence relation. This affords Lewis ample theoretical\nmaneuverability but at the same time causes him some theoretical\ntrouble. For example, as Lewis himself admits, his counterpart\ntheoretic account of modality either yields the consequence that every\nactual object necessarily exists or yields the consequence that some\nactual object is not identical to itself (Lewis 1983: 32). There is\nalso a famous complaint voiced by Saul Kripke (Kripke 1972:\n344–45, note 13). It in effect says that whether someone other\nthan you is the leader of a religious cult at some possible world is\nirrelevant to whether you could have been the leader of a religious\ncult. Lewis’s reply to this is that the de re character\nof the possibility is preserved by the stipulation that the person who\nis the cult leader is the counterpart of you, rather than the\ncounterpart of someone else, at an appropriate possible world. For an\nattempt to avoid counterparts and still retain a broadly Lewisian\nrealistic framework, see McDaniel 2004.  \nA significantly different counterpart theory is proposed by Delia\nGraff Fara (Fara 2008, 2012). Fara analyzes modality de re in\nterms of sortal sameness rather than similarity. She clearly\ndistinguishes sortal sameness (e.g., “is the same boat\nas”) from identity (“is identical with”), and this\nqualifies her analysis as a version of counterpart theory: a given\nboat is F at a world if and only if at that world something that is\nthe same boat as--rather than identical with--that given boat is F.\nThis also somewhat alleviates Kripke’s famous complaint against\ncounterpart theory. Suppose that a boat B is actually made up\nof a hunk of wood W and a small plank P is a proper\npart of W. It is intuitively sensible to hold that B\nis identical with W, that B could have lacked\nP as a part, and that W could not have lacked\nP as a part. But this intuitive view appears internally\nincoherent. If B is identical with W and W\ncould not have lacked P as a part, then it appears that\nB also could not have lacked P as a part; in other\nwords, B without P appears to be an impossible\nobject. On Fara’s analysis, B could have lacked\nP if and only if at some possible world, some x is\nsuch that x is the same boat as B and x\nlacks P, and W could have lacked P if and\nonly if at some possible world, some y is such that\ny is the same hunk of wood as W and y lacks\nP. Since y may not be the same boat as x\n(e.g., y may not be a boat at all), there is not even an\nappearance of inconsistency with the latter lacking (a counterpart of)\nP and the former not lacking it. Thus, even if B is\nidentical with W and W could not have lacked\nP, B could have lacked P, i.e., B\nwithout P is a possible object even though W without\nP is not. Whereas Lewis invokes similarity, which is relative\nto contextually shifting respects, Fara invokes sortal sameness, which\nis less shifty. Fara’s counterpart theory also interestingly\navoids denying the necessity of identity.  \nIndependently of his counterpart theory, Lewis’s definition of a\npossible object has some peculiar consequences, given that existence\nin general is understood as bearing of the part-of relation to the\nwhole that constitutes the domain of discourse. Take any two possible\nworlds w1 and w2. Lewis wants\nto assert that both w1 and w2\nexist in some sense. So for the assertion to be true, it must be true\nrelative to a domain of discourse which contains as a sub-domain some\nwhole of which both w1 and w2\nare part. Not both are part of a single possible world or of its part.\nThe smallest whole of which they both are part is the (mereological)\nsum of w1 and w2. So, some\ndomain D containing such a sum as a sub-domain must count as\nan acceptable domain of discourse for the evaluation of an existence\nclaim. Consider a proper part p1 of\nw1 and a proper part p2 of\nw2. Let Gerry be the sum of p1\nand p2. Then it is true to say that Gerry exists\nwhen the domain of discourse is D. So, there is a sense in\nwhich Gerry exists. In fact it is the same sense in which\nw1 and w2 exist. But Gerry is\nnot a possible object, according to Lewis’s conception, for\nGerry does not have all of its parts at a single possible world. This\nis peculiar. Gerry is an object which exists in the same sense in\nwhich possible worlds exist but Gerry is not a possible object.\nSince—as sanctioned by the universality of mereological\nsummation, which Lewis accepts—Gerry is an object, Gerry is an\nimpossible object. But there is nothing impossible about Gerry any\nmore than there is about the sum of w1 and\nw2. Perhaps the sum of w1 and\nw2 is an impossible object, too. But this idea\nflouts the initially plausible principle of recombination for\npossibility of objects, which says that if x is a possible\nobject and y is a possible object independent of x,\nthen the totality consisting exactly of x and y is a\npossible object. Defenders of Lewis’s theory may take this to\nmean that the principle of recombination, despite its initial\nplausibility, is to be rejected. There is another unexpected\nconsequence of Lewis’s theory. If the sum of\nw1 and w2 is an impossible\nobject, then the sum of all possible worlds is an impossible object,\nfor the former is part of the latter and no impossible object is part\nof a possible object. But this makes the domain in which all possible\nworlds reside, or “logical space”, an impossible object.\nThis appears unwelcome. Lewis does consider an alternative conception\nof a possible object, which says that a possible object is an object\nevery part of which exists at some possible world or other (Lewis\n1986: 211). This allows a possible object to have parts at different\npossible worlds. Lewis, who accepts the universality of mereological\nsummation, does not deny that possible objects in this sense are as\nreal as possible objects in his preferred sense. He however dismisses\nthem as unimportant on the ground that we do not normally name them,\nspeak of them, or quantify over them. But given that sets of possible\nworlds and sets of possible objects figure in important philosophical\ndiscussions concerning the identity of propositions and properties,\nthese sets seem important. If the sum of the members of an important\nset is important, then Lewis’s dismissal appears hasty. Again,\ndefenders of Lewis may stand this line of reasoning on its head and\nconclude that the sum of the members of an important set is not always\nimportant. \nA useful overview of various issues concerning Lewis’s\npossibilist realism, as well as actualist representationism, is found\nin Divers 2002, which is the first systematic attempt to defend parts\nof Lewis’s theory since Lewis 1986. Cameron 2012 presents a\ndefense of Lewis’s reductive analysis of modality. Loux 1979 is\nthe standard anthology of classical writings in modal metaphysics in\n1963–79. \nLewis’s is the most developed version of possibilist realism\nbased on possible worlds. As a result, discussion of possibilist\nrealism almost always focuses exclusively on Lewis’s version.\nThere are, however, other versions of possible-worlds-based\npossibilist realism, and one of them deserves a brief mention. Assume\nthat the universe is spread out in three-dimensional space and\npersists through one-dimensional time. The non-Lewisian version of\npossibilist realism in question may then be called\n‘modal–dimensionalism’. It says that in addition to\nthe four physical (spatiotemporal) dimensions, the universe has modal\ndimensions. Possible worlds are points in modal space as defined by\nthe modal axes just as physical spatiotemporal points are points in\nphysical spacetime as defined by the four physical spatiotemporal\naxes, and possible objects “persist” through possible\nworlds. A version of modal–dimensionalism is what W. V. Quine\nargued against when he took himself to be arguing against a typical\npossibilist realism (Quine 1976), and it is arguably the view many\npossible-worlds theorists adumbrated, however vaguely and inchoately,\nas the representative possibilist realist theory before Lewis\nforcefully articulated his own version.  \nModal–dimensionalism differs from Lewis’s theory in a\nnumber of important respects but the most striking is the absence of\ncounterpart theory. Modal–dimensionalism eschews counterparts\nand proposes that to say that you are the leader of a religious cult\nat a possible world is to say that you yourself exist at that world\nand are the leader of a religious cult at that world. Another\ndifference between modal–dimensionalism and Lewis’s theory\nis that unlike the latter, the former avoids the merelogical\nconception of the existence of a possible object at a possible world.\nAccording to modal–dimensionalism, just as a temporally or\nspatially persisting object is (arguably) not part of the temporal or\nspatial points or regions at which it exists, a modally persisting\nobject is not part of the possible worlds at which it exists.\nModal–dimensionalism also differs from Lewis’s theory in\nnot being a thoroughly reductionist theory. It does not analyze the\nnotion of a possible world in mereological terms but leaves it as\nlargely primitive (Yagisawa 2002, 2010, 2017). This enables\nmodal–dimensionalists to allow the possibility of there being no\nconcrete object, whereas on Lewis’ theory, if there is no\nconcrete object, there is no possible world. For a different attempt\nto reconcile possibilist realism with the possibility of the\nnon-existence of anything concrete, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2004. \nThough free from some difficulties inherent in Lewis’s\ntheoretical machinery, modal–dimensionalism has its own\nobstacles to overcome, not the least of which is to make substantive\nsense of the idea of an object’s persisting not just in physical\nspace and time but in modal space. One idea is to mimic the\n“endurantist” approach to temporal persistence and say\nthat a possible object persists through many possible worlds by having\nall of its parts existing at each of those worlds. Another idea is to\nmimic the “perdurantist” approach to temporal persistence\nand say that a possible object persists through many possible worlds\nby having different parts (world stages) at different possible worlds\nand being the modal-dimensional “worm” consisting of those\nworld stages. Note that this does not make the object mereological\npart of a possible world at which it exists. It only makes each of the\nobject’s world stages part of the object. Lewis, in contrast,\nhas it that a possible object has all of its parts at a single\npossible world (where they are merelogical part of that world) and\ntherefore does not persist through different worlds at all. Despite\nthese differences, Lewis, speaking of the “perdurantist”\nversion of modal–dimensionalism, says that it is but a\nnotational variant of his own theory. He then proceeds to criticize it\n(Lewis 1968: 40–2). Lewis formulates his opposition to\nmodal–dimensionalism more carefully in Lewis 1986: 213–20.\nAchille Varzi derives Lewis’s theory from a theory similar to\nmodal–dimensionalism (Varzi 2001). Unlike\nmodal–dimensionalism, the theory he uses follows Lewis and\ndefines the existence of a possible object at a possible world in\nterms of the object being mereological part of the world. Varzi notes\nsome differences between this theory and Lewis’s. Vacek 2017\ndefends modal-dimensionalism from some objections. \nIt is well known that Quine fiercely objects against the ontology of\nnon-actual possible objects. Referring to an unoccupied doorway, he\nasks whether the possible fat man in the doorway and the possible bald\nman in the doorway are one possible man or two possible men (Quine,\n1948). The point of this rhetorical question is that there is no\nserious issue here because we have no non-trivial criterion of\nidentity for non-actual possible objects. No respectable ontology\nshould embrace objects for which we have no non-trivial criterion of\nidentity. Quine encapsulates this in his famous slogan: “No\nentity without identity”. Actual ordinary mid-sized objects have\nvague boundaries, so the sorites argument may be used to show\nthat we have no coherent non-trivial criterion of identity for them.\nQuine’s slogan then appears to apply to such objects. Some take\nthis to be good reason against the ontology of actual ordinary\nmid-sized objects, whereas others take this to be good reason against\nQuine’s slogan. Whatever the ultimate fate of Quine’s\nslogan may be, there is an objection against possibilist realism\nwhich, while not explicitly invoking Quine’s slogan, is at least\nQuinean in spirit. It goes as follows:  \nLewis’s possibilist realism faces the problem of specifying\nnon-actual possible objects. Take Vulcan, the innermost planet between\nSun and Mercury erroneously believed to exist by some astronomers in\nthe nineteenth century, when the universe was assumed to be Newtonian.\nVulcan is not actually between Sun and Mercury or actually anywhere at\nall. Vulcan also does not actually have any mass, shape, or chemical\ncomposition. Still it is possible that Vulcan be a unique planet\nbetween Sun and Mercury and have a particular mass m, a\nparticular shape s, and a particular chemical composition\nc. Or so it seems. It is also possible, it seems, that Vulcan\nbe a unique planet between Sun and Mercury and have a slightly\ndifferent particular mass m′, a slightly different\nparticular shape s′, and a slightly different\nparticular chemical composition c′, where the slight\ndifferences in question lie within the range of deviations the\noriginal astronomers would have tolerated. So at some possible world\nw Vulcan is a unique planet between Sun and Mercury and has\nm, s, and c, and at some possible world\nw′ Vulcan is a unique planet between Sun and Mercury\nand has m′, s′, and c′.\nClearly w and w′ are different worlds. On\nLewis’s theory, every possible object exists at only one world.\nSo either the planet in question at w is not Vulcan or the\nplanet at w′ is not Vulcan. Whichever planet that is\nnot Vulcan is Vulcan’s counterpart at best. Is either planet\nVulcan? If so, which one? If neither is, where is Vulcan? What\npossible world hosts Vulcan? There seems to be no non-arbitrary way to\nanswer these questions within Lewis’s theory. \nThe modal-dimensionalist version of possibilist realism is capable of\noffering the ready answer, “The planet at w and the\nplanet at w′ are both (world stages of) Vulcan”,\nbut faces an only slightly different challenge of its own. It seems\nintuitive to say that there is a possible world at which Vulcan exists\nbetween Sun and Mercury and some remote heavenly body distinct from\nVulcan but qualitatively identical with it in relevant respects (such\nas mass, shape, size, chemical composition, etc.) also exists. Let\nw1 be such a world and call Vulcan’s double\nat w1 ‘Nacluv’. Thus at\nw1, Vulcan and Nacluv exist, Vulcan is between Sun\nand Mercury, and Nacluv is somewhere far away. It is possible for\nVulcan and Nacluv to switch positions. So there is a possible world,\nw2, which is exactly like w1\nexcept that at w2 Nacluv is between Sun and\nMercury and Vulcan is far away. Since Vulcan and Nacluv are two\ndistinct objects, w1 and w2\nare two distinct worlds. But this difference seems empty. Given that\nw1 and w2 are exact\nqualitative duplicates of each other, on what ground can we say that\nthe object between Sun and Mercury at w1 and far\naway at w2 is Vulcan and the object far away at\nw1 and between Sun and Mercury at\nw2 is Nacluv, rather than the other way around? It\nis unhelpful to say that Vulcan and Nacluv are distinguished by the\nfact that Vulcan possesses Vulcan’s haecceity and Nacluv does\nnot. An object’s haecceity is the property of being that very\nobject (Kaplan 1975, Adams 1979, Lewis 1986: 220–48). Since what\nis at issue is the question of which object is Vulcan, it does not\nhelp to be told that Vulcan is the object possessing the property of\nbeing that very object, unless the property of being that very object\nis clarified independently. To say that it is the property of being\nthat very object which is Vulcan is clearly uninformative. It is not\nobvious that there is any way to clarify it independently. \nAlternatively, one might choose to insist that if anything at any\npossible world is Vulcan, it has to possess at that world the\nproperties relevant to the introduction of the name\n‘Vulcan’, such as being the heavenly body with\nsuch-and-such mass and orbit and other astrophysical characteristics\nand being between Sun and Mercury in a Newtonian universe. This is\nsupported by descriptionism concerning the semantics of proper names,\naccording to which ‘Vulcan’ is a proper name which is\nsemantically equivalent to a definite description (‘the heavenly\nbody with such-and-such mass and ...’). But forceful criticisms\nof descriptionism for proper names were launched in the early 1970s\n(Donnellan 1972, Kripke 1972). Kripke’s criticism has been\nespecially influential. The kernel of Kripke’s criticism rests\non the intuitive idea that a sentence containing a referring proper\nname expresses a singular proposition about the referent independently\nof any qualitative characterization of the referent but that a\ncorresponding sentence containing a description does not so express a\nsingular proposition. If Kripke’s criticism applies to\n‘Vulcan’, it is difficult to defend descriptionism for\n‘Vulcan’. But ‘Vulcan’ and other apparent\nproper names of non-actual possible objects may not be as readily\namenable to the Kripkean considerations as proper names of actual\nobjects are. The so-called “problem of empty names” is the\nproblem of providing a semantic theory for “empty names”\nlike ‘Vulcan’ as non-descriptional designators. For some\nrecent contributions to the project of solving this problem, see Braun\n1993, 2005, Everett & Hofweber 2000, Brock 2004, Piccinini &\nScott 2010, Cullison & Caplan 2011, Kripke 2013. \nAccording to actualist representationism, which is also known under\nLewis’s tendentious label ersatzism, a possible world\nis an actual maximally consistent representation of how the universe\ncould possibly have been, and the actual world is the representation\nof how the universe actually is. A representation r is\nmaximally consistent if and only if r is consistent and for\nany representation r′, either r &\nnot-r′ is not consistent or r &\nr′ is not consistent (assuming the appropriate\nconceptions of the negation and conjunction of representations).\nDifferent actualist representationists employ different actual items\nto play the role of the maximally consistent representations, such as\nsentences, propositions, states of affairs, properties, etc. (Adams\n1974, Armstrong 1989, Bigelow and Pargetter 1990, Carnap 1947,\nCresswell 1972, Forrest 1986, Hintikka 1962, Jeffrey 1965, Lycan 1979,\nLycan & Shapiro 1986, Plantinga 1974, 1987, Prior & Fine 1977,\nQuine 1968, Roper 1982, Skyrms 1981, Stalnaker 1976). Note that the\nnotion of consistency of a representation is not ultimately eliminated\nin actualist representationism. Most actualist representationists\naccept consistency as a modal notion, for they doubt it can be reduced\nto a non-modal notion, such as a proof-theoretic notion or a\nmodel-theoretic notion. If those actualist representationists are\nright and consistency is indeed a modal notion, then actualist\nrepresentationism is not a reductionist theory of modality. This,\nhowever, should not automatically be taken to be a serious challenge\nto actualist representationism, for a thoroughly reductionist theory\nof modality may or may not be feasible. Not even every possibilist\nrealist believes in thorough reduction; cf.\nmodal–dimensionalists. \nIt is important to note that according to most versions of actualist\nrepresentationism, the universe, as it (actually) is, is not the\nactual world. Since the actual world is a possible world and every\npossibly world is a representation, the actual world is a\nrepresentation. The universe, as it (actually) is, is not a\nrepresentation but includes all representations, along with everything\nelse. But it does not include non-actual possible objects. The\nuniverse includes all and only those objects which exist. \nIn actualist representationism, existence is conceptually prior to\nactual existence. This is in concert with the priority of the truth of\nany proposition P over the actual truth of P.\nP is actually true if and only if P is true at the\nactual world, which in turn is so if and only if the actual world\nrepresents P as true. And by definition, the actual world is\nthe possible world which represents P as true if and only if\nP is true. Likewise, for an object to exist at the actual\nworld is for the actual world to represent it as existing; the actual\nworld represents an object as existing if and only if the object\nexists. Actual existence is thus reducible to existence\nsimpliciter. \nNon-actual possible existence is defined as existence at some possible\nworld other than the actual world, which in turn is defined in terms\nof existence simpliciter as follows: x exists at a\npossible world w not identical with the actual world if and\nonly if x would exist if w were actual, that is, if\nthe universe were as w represents it to be. According to this\npicture, non-actual possible existence is not a special mode of\nexistence completely separate from actual existence. It is not\nexistence simpliciter, but instead “would-be”\nexistence simpliciter on a counterfactual supposition. There\nis no room for non-actual possible objects in this picture. Many\nrepresentations which are possible worlds other than the actual world\ninclude representations of the existence of non-actual possible\nobjects, but non-actual possible objects are not mereological part of\nthose possible worlds. Neither are they set-theoretic members, or\nconstituents in any other sense, of those possible worlds. For them to\nexist at those possible worlds is for the worlds to say (represent)\nthat they exist; nothing more, nothing less. This is a non-realist\npicture of the existence of the non-actual. Non-actual possible\nobjects are thus nothing at all. This is the conservative view\n(1). \nLet us examine how actualist representationists handle apparent modal\ntruths asserting the possibility of non-actual objects. There are two\ntypes of such truth and the first type is easy to handle. It is\npossible that Julius Caesar (congenitally) had a sixth finger on his\nright hand (whereas, we assume, he actually had only five fingers).\nThis possibility only calls for a possible world to represent Julius\nCaesar as having had a sixth finger on his right hand, which may\neasily be done by means of, say, the (interpreted English) sentence,\n‘Julius Caesar had a sixth finger on his right hand’. \nThe second type of apparent modal truth, however, is more challenging.\nJulius Caesar could have had a sixth right finger which was never\nburnt but which could have been burnt. This involves a nested\npossibility, which is troublesome to actualist representationism\n(McMichael 1983). To reveal the nesting clearly, let us articulate the\npossibility in question in a more pedantic and rigorous way. The\nfollowing is possible: Julius Caesar had a sixth right finger such\nthat (a) it was never burnt, and (b) the following is possible: it was\nburnt. The trouble for actualist representationism is that there is no\nobvious way to make sense of the pronoun ‘it’ in (b). The\npossibility of Julius Caesar having had a sixth right finger which was\nnever burnt is, as before, easily representable by, say, the sentence,\n‘Julius Caesar had a sixth right finger which was never\nburnt’. This means that the pronoun ‘it’ in (a) is\nunproblematic; it is replaceable by ‘Julius Caesar’s sixth\nright finger’. How about the pronoun ‘it’ in (b)? It\nshould designate the sixth right finger Julius Caesar is said to have\nhad within the scope of the first possibility operator. It should\ntherefore be bound by the appropriate existential quantifier, just\nlike the pronoun ‘it’ in (a). But unlike the pronoun\n‘it’ in (a), the pronoun ‘it’ in (b) occurs\nseparated from the quantifier by the intervening second possibility\noperator, ‘the following is possible’. This\n“quantifying in” from outside the possibility operator\nforces the sentence representing the possibility specified in (b) to\nretain the pronoun ‘it’: ‘it was burnt’. Thus,\nunlike the pronoun ‘it’ in (a), the pronoun\n‘it’ in (b) is not eliminable in the representation of the\npossibility in question. But no part of the representation that is the\npossible world in question, or any other possible world, may serve as\nthe object which the pronoun ‘it’ in (b) designates, as\nthe pronoun needs to designate something that is said to be a human\nfinger but no part of any such representation is said to be a human\nfinger. Notice that Lewis has no corresponding difficulty here. On his\ntheory, the modal statement in question is true if and only if at some\npossible world there is a counterpart of Julius Caesar who had a sixth\nright finger f such that f was never burnt and at\nsome possible world there is a counterpart of f which was\nburnt. Julius Caesar, his counterpart, and the counterpart’s\nsixth finger f are all real objects, and the pronoun\n‘it’ in (b) designates f. (Note that the pronoun\n‘it’ in (b) does not designate the counterpart of\nf any more than ‘it’ in (a) does.) \nOne way to handle this without postulating a non-actual possible\nobject is to say that there was an actual finger belonging to someone\nelse and that it could have belonged to Julius Caesar’s right\nhand as his extra finger (congenitally). If this sounds biologically\ntoo bizarre, actualist representationists may say instead that there\nare actual elementary particles none of which was part of Julius\nCaesar’s body but which collectively could have constituted his\nsixth right finger. This is along the lines of David Kaplan’s\npossible automobile (Kaplan 1973: 517, note 19) and Nathan\nSalmon’s Noman (Salmon 1981: 39, footnote 41). Kaplan imagines a\ncomplete set of automobile parts laid out on a factory floor ready for\nassembly. If the parts are assembled, a particular automobile will be\ncreated; if not, not. Suppose that the parts are destroyed before they\nare assembled. Then the particular automobile which would have been\ncreated if the parts had been assembled is in fact not created. It is\na non-actual possible automobile. Salmon, taking a cue from\nKripke’s suggestion of the necessity of origin (Kripke 1972),\nimagines a particular human egg and a particular human sperm which\ncould merge into a particular human zygote and develop into a\nparticular human being. Suppose that the egg and the sperm in fact\nfail to merge, hence fail to develop into a human being. The\nparticular human being, Noman, who would have been created if the egg\nand the sperm had merged and developed normally is in fact not\ncreated. Noman is a non-actual possible human being. These lines of\nthought afford actualist representationists a powerful means to\naccommodate many apparently recalcitrant modal truths about non-actual\npossible objects, provided that these non-actual possible objects can\nbe individuated uniquely by means of actually existing potential parts\nor origin. In fact, it may even be taken further to afford actualist\nrepresentationists a way to maintain that Kaplan’s automobile is\nnot only possible but is an actual object after all. This can be done\nby not only individuating Kaplan’s automobile uniquely by means\nof the collection of the automobile parts but also identifying it with\nthe collection. Call Kaplan’s automobile\n‘k’. Suppose that k is identical with\nthe collection. Then there exists an actual object, namely k,\nwhich actually is not an automobile but is a collection of automobile\nparts and which is possibly an automobile. That is, k is\nrepresented as an unassembled collection of automobile parts by the\nactual world and is represented as an automobile by some possible\nworld. Similarly, actualist representationists may identify Noman with\nthe collection of the egg and the sperm. Noman is an actual object\nwhich actually is not a human being but is a collection of an egg and\na sperm and which is possibly a human being. The case of Julius\nCaesar’s sixth finger can be handled likewise. There exists an\nactual object which actually is not a finger but is a (widely\nscattered) collection of particles and which is possibly Julius\nCaesar’s sixth right finger. \nBut now consider the planet Vulcan. There is no collection of actual\nparticles which were supposed to constitute Vulcan. So, if Vulcan is a\nnon-actual possible object, which it apparently is, it seems possible\nfor Vulcan to exist and not be constituted by any actual particles\ndifferently located and arranged. Likewise, it seems perfectly\npossible that Julius Caesar had a sixth finger which was not\nconstituted by any actually existing particles and satisfied (a) and\n(b). Despite initial plausibility, actualist representationists may\nchoose to deny such a possibility. To do so is, in effect, to commit\noneself to the position that the universe, as it actually is, already\ncontains maximally possible constituents of any possible state of the\nuniverse, that is, it is impossible for the universe to contain even a\nsingle constituent object not already in the universe as it actually\nis. To make this plausible is not an easy task. If, on the other hand,\nactualist representationists choose not to deny the possibility in\nquestion, they appear to have to say that Julius Caesar’s\nentirely new sixth finger is not an object but is possibly an object.\nBut then the problem is to make sense of the finger’s being\nnothing yet possibly something. How can there be a true predication of\nany kind, including “is possibly an object”, of nothing?\n(Oliver & Smiley 2013 offers the beginning of a partial answer to\nthis question.) \nAlvin Plantinga is responsible for a widely-discussed actualist\nrepresentationist response to this problem. He invokes unactualized\nindividual essences (Plantinga 1974, 2003). Every object is said to\nhave an individual essence. An individual essence of a given object is\na property which that object necessarily has and everything else\nnecessarily lacks. Moreover, and this is crucial to the solution of\nthe problem at hand, individual essences are independent of the\nobjects which have them, whether the objects are actual or non-actual.\nThat is, an individual essence can exist without being an individual\nessence of any existing object. The problematic pronoun\n‘it’ in (b) is then said to designate such an individual\nessence, and the rest of the characterization of the possibility in\nquestion is appropriately and systematically reinterpreted. For\nexample, ‘it was burnt’ in (b) is reinterpreted to mean\nthat the individual essence in question is an individual essence of\nsomething that was burnt.  \nOne difficulty with this view is the failure to produce a single\nplausible example of such an essence. We saw that possibilist realism\nfaces the problem of specifying non-actual possible objects.\nPlantinga’s version of actualist representationism faces its own\nversion of the Quinean challenge, namely, the problem of specifying\nthe individual essences which are supposed to replace non-actual\npossible objects. What individual essence did Julius Caesar have? What\nreadily comes to mind is the property of being Julius Caesar. As Ruth\nBarcan Marcus and Kripke have forcefully argued (Barcan 1947, Marcus\n1961, Kripke 1972), identity is necessary; that is, if an object\nx is identical with an object y, it is necessarily\nthe case that x is identical with y. Given this, it\nis easy to see that Julius Caesar necessarily had the property of\nbeing Julilus Caesar and everything other than Julius Caesar\nnecessarily lacks it. However, it is implausible to suggest that this\nproperty is independent of Julius Caesar. Our canonical specification\nof it by means of the noun phrase ‘the property of being Julius\nCaesar’ certainly is not independent of our canonical\nspecification of Julius Caesar by means of the name ‘Julius\nCaesar’, and this does not seem to be an accidental fact merely\nindicative of the paucity of our language devoid of deep metaphysical\nunderpinnings. Kaplan’s automobile and Salmon’s Noman\nmerely push the dependence of the individual essence to the level of\nthe constituent parts or origin of the object of which it is an\nindividual essence. This difficulty is magnified when we ask for a\nspecification of an individual essence of Vulcan or Julius\nCaesar’s entirely new finger. For more on individual essence,\nsee Adams 1981, McMichael 1983, Fine 1985, Menzel 1990, Lycan 1994,\nLinsky & Zalta 1994, Plantinga 2003. \nTheodore Sider proposes a different solution to the nesting problem\n(Sider 2002). According to his proposal, we should not regard\ndifferent non-actual possible worlds as achieving their representation\nmore or less independently of one another. Instead, we should regard\nall possible worlds as representations which are given all at once in\nconcert with one another so that cross references to non-actual\npossible objects by different possible worlds are guaranteed from the\noutset. \nReina Hayaki proposes yet another solution (Hayaki 2003). When we say\nthat Julius Caesar had an unburnt sixth right finger at some possible\nworld w1, we take w1 to\nrepresent Julius Caesar as having an unburnt sixth right finger. When\nwe say further that that finger at w1 was burnt at\na different possible world w2, we should likewise\ntake w2 to represent that finger as having been\nburnt. According to Hayaki, this requires a hierarchical arrangement\nof possible worlds in which the representation of the finger by\nw2 is parasitic on the representation by\nw1. \nOther solutions to the nesting problem include the claim that despite\nstrong appearance to the contrary, there are no modal statements about\nobjects which do not actually exist; see Adams 1981, Fitch 1996. \nSome important theories concerning possible objects and related issues\ndo not invoke possible worlds as a theoretical cornerstone. Most\nprominent among them are so-called Meinongian theories. But before\nturning to them, let us briefly take note of two non-Meinongian\napproaches outside the framework of possible worlds: Kit Fine’s\nand Michael Jubien’s.  \nLike Plantinga, Fine takes individual essences seriously but he\nregards the notion of necessity as prior to the notion of a possible\nworld, and the notion of an individual essence as prior to the notion\nof necessity (Fine 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 2000). Fine’s modal\ntheory is based on the broadly Aristotelian idea that alethic modality\nstems from natures of things. Understanding of actual or non-actual\npossible objects should therefore be firmly grounded on understanding\nof natures of things. Fine believes that ‘There is a possible\nobject x’ is reducible to ‘Possibly there is an\nobject x’ (Prior and Fine 1977: 130–9, Fine 1979,\n1981, 2003). For a similar reductive proposal, see Peacocke 1978,\n2002. For some difficulties with such a project, see Hazen 1976. \nJubien builds his modal theory out of properties and their relations\n(Jubien 1996, 2009). The possibility of Julius Caesar’s having\nhad an entirely new sixth right finger satisfying (a) and (b) is\nanalyzed roughly as follows: the property of being a particular sixth\nfinger on Julius Caesar’s right hand is simultaneously\ncompatible with the properties of existing, being composed of\nnon-actual stuff, and being never burnt, and also simultaneously\ncompatible with the properties of existing, being composed of\nnon-actual stuff, and being burnt. The underlying idea is to start\nwith the ontology of stuff and use properties and relations, including\nmodal properties and relations, as the fundamental metaphysical items\nto account for all statements about objects, including all modal\nstatements about possible objects. It specifically avoids talk of\nnon-actual possible objects. It, however, does not avoid talk of\nnon-actual possible stuff. So it does embrace the ontology of the\nnon-actual possible in a broad sense.  \nAlexius Meinong’s theory of objects has had much influence on\nsome contemporary theorists, resulting in a variety of proposals.\nThese proposals are known broadly as Meinongian. According to Meinong,\na subject term in any true sentence stands for an object (Meinong\n1904). So the subject term in the sentence, ‘The sixth right\nfinger of Julius Caesar is a finger’, stands for an object,\nassuming that the sentence is true. (Such an assumption is strongly\ndisputed in Salmon 1987.) Even though the exact respects in which\ncontemporary Meinongian proposals are Meinongian and the extent of\ntheir Meinongianism differ from one proposal to another, all of them\ninherit this claim by Meinong in some form. They are thus united in\nresisting Bertrand Russell’s criticism of Meinong, which\nmandates analyzing sentences containing a definite description, like\nthe one above concerning the sixth right finger of Julius Caesar, as\ngeneral statements rather than singular statements (Russell 1905); see\n3.1.2 for a particularly famous piece of Russell’s criticism and\nhow two leading Meinongian theories handle it.  \nMeinong distinguishes two ontological notions: subsistence and\nexistence. Subsistence is a broad ontological category, encompassing\nboth concrete objects and abstract objects. Concrete objects are said\nto exist and subsist. Abstract objects are said not to exist but to\nsubsist. The talk of abstract objects may be vaguely reminiscent of\nactualist representationism, which employs representations, which are\nactual abstract objects. At the same time, for Meinong, the nature of\nan object does not depend on its being actual. This seems to give\nobjects reality that is independent of actuality. Another interesting\nfeature of Meinong’s theory is that it sanctions the postulation\nnot only of non-actual possible objects but also of impossible\nobjects, for it says that ‘The round square is round’ is a\ntrue sentence and therefore its subject term stands for an object.\nThis aspect of Meinong’s theory has been widely pointed out, but\nnon-trivial treatment of impossibility is not confined to\nMeinongianism (Lycan & Shapiro 1986). For more on Meinong’s\ntheory, see Chisholm 1960, Findlay 1963, Grossmann 1974, Lambert 1983,\nZalta 1988: sec.8. For some pioneering work in contemporary\nMeinongianism, see Castañeda 1974, Rapaport 1978, Routley 1980.\nWe shall examine the theories of two leading Meinongians: Terence\nParsons and Edward Zalta. We shall take note of some other Meinongians\nlater in the section on fictional objects, as their focus is primarily\non fiction. Parsons and Zalta not only propose accounts of fictional\nobjects but offer comprehensive Meinongian theories of objects in\ngeneral. \nQuine thought it curious that the ontological problem was so simple as\nto be put in three monosyllables: “What is there?” He\nfamously answered this simple question equally simply:\n“Everything” (Quine 1948). Parsons rejects Quine’s\nclaim that every object exists, and asserts that some objects do not\nexist. Parsons proposes a theory of all objects, both existent and\nnon-existent (Parsons 1980). He uses the word ‘actual’ as\na synonym for ‘existent’, so he rejects (1), (2), and (3),\nbut accepts (4) and (5) as trivialities. It would be a mistake to\nclassify him as an actualist simply because he accepts (5). On the\ncontrary, he has much in common with possibilists in claiming that\nsome objects are not actual, that is, in denying (2). He, however,\nadmits only one sense of existence and claims that some objects do not\nexist in that sense. If this sole sense of existence corresponds to\nthe possibilist conception of existence relativized to any domain of\ndiscourse smaller than the largest available domain, then Parsons is\nin agreement with possibilists. But if it corresponds to the\npossibilist conception of existence relativized to the largest\navailable domain, then Parsons’ ontology goes beyond that of\npossibilists. There is good evidence that the latter is the case, for\nParsons’ ontology, as a typically Meinongian ontology, includes\nthe round square and other impossible objects, which the possibilist\nontology does not include. Lewis’s discussion (Lewis 1990) of\nhow the non-Meinongian should understand “noneism”, which\nis the view that some things do not exist, held by another Meinongian,\nRichard Routley (later Richard Sylvan), is helpful in this connection.\nFor differences between Routley’s theory and Parsons’, see\nParsons 1983. A sympathizer of Routley, Graham Priest, uses\ndialetheism (the thesis that some contradictions are true) and\nparaconsistent logic, along with the (possible- and impossible-)\nworlds framework, to bolster noneism (Priest 2005, 2016). \nParsons’ theory is based on the Meinongian distinction between\nnuclear and extra-nuclear properties. Nuclear properties include all\nordinary properties, such as being blue, being tall, being kicked by\nSocrates, being a mountain, and so on. Extra-nuclear properties\ninclude ontological properties such as existence and being fictional,\nmodal properties such as being possible, intentional properties such\nas being thought of by Socrates, and technical properties such as\nbeing complete. See Parsons 1980: 24–27, 166–74 for more\non nuclear and extra-nuclear properties and a test for distinguishing\nbetween them. Parsons’ theory can be encapsulated in the\nfollowing two principles: \n(P1) No two objects have exactly the same nuclear properties; \n(P2) For any set of nuclear properties, some object has all the\nnuclear properties in the set and no other nuclear properties. \nTake the set of nuclear properties, {being golden, being a mountain}.\nBy (P1) and (P2), some unique object has exactly the two nuclear\nproperties in the set. That object is the golden mountain. Take\nanother set of nuclear properties, {being square, being round}, and\nthe two principles give us the round square. Both of these objects are\nradically incomplete; they have no weight, height, shape, or size, for\nexample. The need for distinguishing nuclear properties from\nextra-nuclear properties is readily seen by considering the set,\n{being golden, being a mountain, being existent}. If (P2) is to apply\nto such a set, it should yield an object having the three properties\nin the set. Such an object is golden, a mountain, and existent, that\nis, it is a golden mountain which exists. So it should be true that a\ngolden mountain exists, but it is in fact not true. Parsons defines a\npossible object as an object such that it is possible that there exist\nan object having all of its nuclear properties. On this conception,\nall existing objects are possible objects, some golden mountains are\npossible objects, and the round square is not a possible object. It is\nworth noting that in Parsons’ theory, negation needs to be\nhandled delicately (Parsons 1980: 19–20, 105–06, Zalta\n1988: 131–34). Take the set, {being round, being non-round}. By\n(P2), we have an object, x, which is round and non-round. So,\nx is non-round. If we can infer from this that it is not the\ncase that x is round, then we should be entitled to say that\nx is round and it is not the case that x is round,\nwhich is a contradiction. Thus, we should not be allowed to infer\n‘It is not the case that x is round’ from\n‘x is non-round’.  \nIf Julius Caesar’s entirely new right finger satisfying (a) and\n(b) is to be a Meinongian object of Parsons’ theory, the best\ncandidate appears to be a non-existent incomplete object corresponding\nto the set of properties, {being a finger, belonging to Julius\nCaesar’s right hand, being never burnt}. This set includes\nneither the property of being constituted by particles which do not\n(actually) exist nor the property of being possibly burnt. Both of\nthese properties are extra-nuclear properties, hence ineligible to be\nincluded in a set to which (P2) applies. So (P2) does not confer them\non the object corresponding to the set. How then does the object come\nto have the properties? It is not obvious how this question should be\nanswered (Parsons 1980: 21, note 4, where Parsons says, “The\npresent theory is very neutral about de re\nmodalities”), but we should at least note that on\nParsons’s theory, objects are allowed to have properties not\nincluded in their corresponding sets of nuclear properties: e.g., the\nround square, whose corresponding set only includes roundness and\nsquareness, has the property of being non-existent and the property of\nbeing incomplete. Also, Parsons allows nuclear properties which are\n“watered-down” versions of extra-nuclear properties. So\nthe set may include the “watered-down” versions of the two\nextra-nuclear properties in question and that may be enough. For more\non these and related issues in Parsons’ theory, see Howell 1983,\nFine 1984. \nZalta’s theory is based on the distinction made by\nMeinong’s student, Ernst Mally, between two kinds of\npredication: exemplification and encoding (Mally 1912, Zalta 1983,\n1988). The idea is to maintain the Meinongian claim that the round\nsquare is a genuine object while avoiding contradicting oneself.\nRussell argues that since the round square is round and square, and\nsince if an object is square it is not the case that it is round, it\nfollows that the round square is such that both it is round and it is\nnot the case that it is round, which is a contradiction. Parsons\navoids the contradiction by refusing the inference from\n‘x is square’ to ‘it is not the case that\nx is round’, where ‘x’ ranges over\nall objects. In contrast, Zalta accepts the inference for all objects\nand avoids the contradiction by refusing to interpret the predication,\n‘is round and square’, of the round square as\nexemplification. He instead interprets it as encoding; the round\nsquare encodes roundness and squareness. Encoding squareness is not\nincompatible with encoding roundness, even though exemplifying\nsquareness is incompatible with exemplifying roundness. Predication as\nunderstood as encoding follows a different logic from predication as\nunderstood as exemplification. The crux of Zalta’s theory is\nencapsulated in the following two principles: \n(Z1) Objects which could sometimes have a spatial location do not, and\ncannot, encode properties; \n(Z2) For any condition on properties, some object that could never\nhave a spatial location encodes exactly those properties which satisfy\nthe condition. \nSome object is the round square, for, by (Z2), among objects which\ncould never have a spatial location is an object which encodes\nroundness and squareness. The noun phrase, ‘the round\nsquare’, unambiguously denotes such a necessarily non-spatial\nobject. Other noun phrases of the same kind include those which denote\nnumbers, sets, Platonic forms, and so on. There are, however, many\nnoun phrases which are ambiguous. They allow an interpretation under\nwhich they denote an object that is necessarily non-spatial, and also\nallow an interpretation under which they denote an object that is\npossibly spatial and possibly non-spatial. The phrase, ‘the\ngolden mountain’, is an example. The golden mountain in one\nsense is an object which is necessarily non-spatial and which encodes\ngoldenness and mountainhood. The golden mountain in the other sense is\nan object which actually is non-spatial but could be spatial. When we\nsay that the golden mountain in the second sense is golden, it means\nthat necessarily if the golden mountain is spatial, it is golden.\nSince, by (Z1), such an object cannot encode properties, all\npredications in the preceding sentence have to be understood as\nexemplification. Similarly with Julilus Caesar’s entirely new\nfinger satisfying (a) and (b).  \nZalta endorses the claim that some objects are non-actual possible\nobjects, so he appears to side with possibilists. But he defines a\nnon-actual possible object as an object which could have a spatial\nlocation but does not (Zalta 1988: 67). So the claim means for Zalta\nthat some objects could have a spatial location but do not. This is\ncompatible with actualism, provided that all such objects are actual\nin the sense of actually existing (Linsky & Zalta 1994, also\nWilliamson 1998, 2002, 2013; it is noteworthy that Timothy Williamson\nindependently argues for what he calls necessitism, which\nsays [in a nutshell] that every possible object is a necessary\nobject). If we understand Zalta’s theory this way, we have the\nfollowing actualist picture: all objects are actual and existing, some\nobjects are necessarily non-spatial, and other objects are possibly\nspatial and possibly non-spatial. (For an alternative interpretation\nof Zalta’s formal theory, according to which some objects do not\nexist, see Zalta 1983: 50–52, 1988: 102–04, Linsky &\nZalta 1996: note 8.) Among the latter type of objects are those which\nare actually spatial but possibly not, like you and me, and those\nwhich are possibly spatial but actually not, like the golden mountain\nin the appropriate sense. The distinction between the golden mountain\nin this (exemplification) sense and the golden mountain in the other\n(encoding) sense is key to overcoming some objections (Linsky &\nZalta 1996). See Bennett 2006 for the claim that the Linsky-Zalta view\nis not actualist, and Nelson & Zalta 2009 for a response. Hayaki\n2006 critiques both Linsky-Zalta and Williamson. \nIf we confine our attention to necessarily non-spatial objects, a\ndefinition of a possible object which corresponds to Parsons’\ndefinition is easily available to Zalta: a possible (necessarily\nnon-spatial) object is a (necessarily non-spatial) object such that\nsome object could exemplify exactly the properties it encodes. In this\nsense, some object which encodes goldenness and mountainhood, among\nother properties, is a possible object but the object which encodes\nsquareness and roundness is not. Julilus Caesar’s entirely new\nfinger satisfying (a) and (b) can be treated in the same way as the\ngolden mountain. Complications similar to those which arise for\nParsons’ theory do not arise for Zalta’s theory, for all\nproperties are equally subject to encoding, including those properties\nParsons regards as extra-nuclear. For a comparison of the\ntwo-kinds-of-property approach and the two-kinds-of-predication\napproach, see Rapaport 1985. \nIf anything is a non-actual possible object, a unicorn is. Or so it\nappears. But Kripke vigorously argues against such a view in the 1980\nversion of Kripke 1972: 24, 156–58. His argument starts with the\nassumption that the unicorn is (intended to be) an animal species if\nanything. This excludes the possibility that a horse with a horn\nartificially attached to its forehead is a unicorn. Kripke assumes\nobviously that there are actually no unicorns and that unicorns are\npurely mythical creatures. Also assumed is the absence in the relevant\nmyth of any specification of the genetic structure, evolutionary\nhistory, or other potentially defining essential features of the\nunicorn. (Possession of a horn is not a defining essential feature of\nthe unicorn any more than having tawny stripes is a defining feature\nof the tiger.) The myth describes the unicorn only in stereotypical\nterms: looking like a horse, having a horn protruding from its\nforehead, etc. Suppose that there are objects with all such\nstereotypical features of the unicorn. This seems perfectly possible\nand Kripke accepts such a possibility. But he rejects its sufficiency\nfor establishing the possibility of unicorns. Suppose that among the\nobjects with the stereotypical unicorn features, some have a genetic\nmakeup, an evolutionary history, or some other potentially defining\nessential unicorn characteristic which is radically different from the\ncorresponding characteristic had by the others with the same\nstereotypical unicorn features. Which ones among those with the\nstereotypical unicorn features would then be real unicorns and which\nones fool’s unicorns (à la fool’s gold)?\nThere is no fact of the matter. Given that the unicorn is an animal\nspecies, not everything that looks and behaves like a unicorn is\nguaranteed to be a unicorn. To be a unicorn, an object has to possess\nthe defining essential characteristics of the unicorn. But there are\nno defining characteristics of the unicorn; the myth does not specify\nthem, and the universe does not instantiate them. This surprising\nargument has convinced many philosophers of the impossibility of\nunicorns, but others have raised doubt by arguing that the notion of a\nbiological kind, such as a species, is far more malleable than Kripke\nassumes (Dupré 1993).  \nThe line of argument Kripke uses, if successful, is applicable to all\nnon-actual natural kinds and their analogs (except for natural-kind\nanalogs of Kaplan’s automobile or Salmon’s Noman). It is\nunclear that it or something like it is successfully applicable to\nindividuals like Vulcan, but if it is, then we must say that such\nindividuals are impossible objects. Some theorists liken Vulcan to\nfictional objects, as we will see in the next section, and some\ntheorists argue that fictional objects are impossible objects (Kaplan\n1973, 1980 version of Kripke 1972: 157–58, Fine 1984:\n126–28, Yagisawa 2010: 271–77). If Vulcan is an impossible\nobject, the problem of uniquely specifying Vulcan, as opposed to\nNacluv, becomes less urgent, for it is not evident that we should be\nable to specify an impossible object uniquely and non-trivially. \nLet us shift our attention from mythological creatures to fictional\nobjects. Fictional objects include fictional characters but not all\nfictional objects are fictional characters. Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object and a fictional character. His liver is a fictional\nobject but not a fictional character. It may be tempting to think that\nfictional objects are non-actual possible objects, even though it is\nobvious that not all non-actual possible objects are fictional\nobjects.  \nThere are two main problems with the claim that fictional objects are\npossible objects. One is the problem of impossible fictional objects.\nSome fictional objects are ascribed incompatible properties in their\nhome fiction by their original author (usually inadvertently). This\nseems to be sufficient for them to have those properties according to\ntheir home fiction, for what the author says in the fiction\n(inadvertently or not) seems to hold the highest authority on truth in\nthat fiction. On the assumption that a fictional object has a given\nproperty if it has that property according to its home fiction, those\nfictional objects are impossible objects, for no possible object has\nincompatible properties. The other problem is the failure of\nuniqueness. It may be viewed as the problem of meeting the Quinean\ndemand for clear identity conditions. Holmes is a particular fictional\nobject. So if we are to identify Holmes with a possible object, we\nshould identify Holmes with a particular possible object. But there\nare many particular possible objects that are equally suited for the\nidentification with Holmes. One of them has n-many hairs,\nwhereas another has (n+1)-many hairs. No fictional story\nabout a particular fictional object written or told by a human being\nis detailed enough to exclude all possible objects but one to be\nidentified with that fictional object, unless it is a fiction about an\nactual object or a non-actual possible object analogous to\nKaplan’s automobile or Salmon’s Noman. \nStrangely enough, there is also a problem with the claim that\nfictional objects are non-actual objects. That is, there is some\nplausible consideration in support of the claim that fictional objects\nare actual objects. We make various assertions about fictional objects\noutside the stories in which they occur and some of them are true: for\nexample, that Sherlock Holmes is admired by many readers of the Holmes\nstories. The simplest and most systematic explanation appears to be to\npostulate Holmes as an actual object possessing the properties such\ntrue assertions ascribe to him. Fictional objects may then be said to\nbe theoretical objects of literary criticism as much as electrons are\ntheoretical objects of physics. This type of view enjoys surprisingly\nwide acceptance. (Searle 1974, van Inwagen 1977, 1983, Fine 1982,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999). The theorists in this camp, except van\nInwagen (van Inwagen 2003: 153–55), also think that fictional\nobjects are brought into existence by their authors as actual objects.\nEven if this type of view is to be followed, it must still be denied\nthat Holmes is actually a detective, for if we enumerate all\nindividuals who are actually detectives, Holmes will not be among\nthem. By the same token, Holmes is not actually a resident of Baker\nStreet or even a human being. Though actual, Holmes is actually hardly\nany of those things Conan Doyle’s stories describe him as being.\nHolmes must not be a concrete object at all but instead an abstract\nobject which has the property of being a detective according to\nDoyle’s stories, the property of being a resident of Baker\nStreet according to Doyle’s stories, and so on. \nMeinongian theories overcome the problems of impossibility and\nnon-uniqueness in a straightforward way. According to Parsons’\ntheory, a fictional object x which originates in a certain\nstory is the object that has exactly the nuclear properties F\nsuch that according to the story, Fx (Parsons 1980:\n49–60, 228–23). A fictional object to which the story\nascribes incompatible properties is simply an impossible object, but\nsuch an object is harmless because it does not exist. As for the\nproblem of non-uniqueness, Sherlock Holmes is not identified as a\ncomplete object. Instead Holmes is said to be the object having just\nthe nuclear properties Holmes has according to the stories. There is\nno number n such that Holmes has exactly n-many\nhairs according to the stories. So Parsons’ Holmes does not have\nn-many hairs, for any n. It is an incomplete\nobject. \nZalta offers a similar picture of fictional objects which is subsumed\nunder his general theory of encoding. According to him, a fictional\nobject x which originates in a certain story is the object\nthat encodes exactly the properties F such that according to\nthe story, Fx (Zalta 1988: 123–29). Zalta’s\ntreatment of the problem of impossibility is similar to\nParsons’. A fictional object to which the story ascribes\nincompatible properties is an object which encodes those properties,\namong others. Such an object is harmless because it does not exemplify\nthe incompatible properties. Zalta’s solution to the problem of\nnon-uniqueness is equally similar to Parsons’. Sherlock Holmes,\nfor Zalta, is simply an incomplete object which does not encode the\nproperty of having exactly n-many hairs, for any\nn. \nThough not meant to be a fictional object, Vulcan may be given the\nsame treatment as explicitly fictional objects. According to Parsons,\nthe word ‘Vulcan’ is ambiguous. In one sense, it is the\nname of a fictional object which originates in a false astronomical\nstory. In the other sense, it does not refer to anything. Zalta does\nnot recognize Parsons’ second sense and simply regards\n‘Vulcan’ as the name of a fictional object. \nFor another Meinongian approach to fictional objects, see\nCastañeda 1979. Charles Crittenden offers a view in a\nMeinongian spirit but with a later-Wittgensteinian twist (Crittenden\n1991). Like Parsons, Crittenden maintains that some objects do not\nexist and that fictional objects are such objects. Following later\nWittgenstein, however, he sees no need to go beyond describing the\n“language game” we play in our fictional discourse and\ndismisses all metaphysical theorizing. Robert Howell criticizes\nParsons’ theory, among others, and recommends an approach which\nconstrues fictional objects as non-actual objects in fictional worlds,\nwhere fictional worlds include not just possible but impossible worlds\n(Howell 1979). Nicholas Wolterstorff argues for the view that\nfictional objects are kinds (Wolterstorff 1980). For criticism of this\nview, see Walton 1983. Van Inwagen 2003 contains useful compact\ndiscussions of some Meinongian and non-Meinongian theories of\nfictional objects. \nGregory Currie denies that fictional names like ‘Sherlock\nHolmes’ are proper names or even singular terms (Currie 1990).\nHe claims that sentences of fiction in which ‘Sherlock\nHolmes’ occurs should be regarded as jointly forming a long\nconjunction in which every occurrence of ‘Sherlock Holmes’\nis replaced with a variable bound by an initial existential quantifier\nin the way suggested by Frank Ramsey (Ramsey 1931). \nKendall Walton urges that we should take seriously the element of\nmake-believe, or pretense, inherent in the telling of a fictional\nstory by the author and the listening to it by the audience (Walton\n1990, also Evans 1982: 353–68, Kripke 2013). According to this\npretense theory, the pretense involved in the language game of\nfictional discourse shields the whole language game from a separate\nlanguage game aimed at non-fictional reality, and it is in the latter\nlanguage game that we seek theories of objects of various kinds as\nreal objects. If this is right, any search for the real ontological\nstatus of fictional objects appears to be misguided. For the view that\nthe pretense theory is compatible with a theory of fictional objects\nas real objects, see Zalta 2000. \nOne important theoretical use of non-actual possible objects is to\nbolster the most straightforward quantified modal logic (Scott 1970,\nParsons 1995). If we add a modal sentential operator meaning “it\nis possible that” or “it is necessary that” to\nclassical first-order quantificational logic, along with appropriate\naxioms and an appropriate rule of inference catering to the added\noperator, the resulting system yields a sentence meaning the following\nas a theorem:  \nIf it is possible that something is F, then something is such\nthat it is possible that it is F.\n \nThe formal logical sentence with this meaning is known as the\nBarcan Formula, after Ruth C. Barcan, who published the first\nsystematic treatment of quantified modal logic, in which she\npostulated the formula as an axiom (Barcan 1946), and who has\npublished under the name ‘Ruth Barcan Marcus’ since 1950.\nIf we read ‘F’ as meaning “non-identical\nwith every actual object”, the Barcan Formula says that if it is\npossible that something is non-identical with every actual object,\nthen something x is such that it is possible that x\nis non-identical with every actual object. The antecedent is plausibly\ntrue, for there could have been more objects than the actual ones. But\nif so, the consequent is true as well, assuming the truth of the\nBarcan Formula. But no actual object is non-identical with every\nactual object, for every actual object is identical with itself, an\nactual object. Assuming the necessity of identity, if an object\ny is identical with an object z, it is not possible\nthat y is non-identical with z. So, no actual object\nis such that it is possible that it is non-identical with every actual\nobject. Therefore, any object x such that it is possible that\nx is non-identical with every actual object must be a\nnon-actual possible object.  \nThe converse of the Barcan Formula is also a theorem along with the\nBarcan Formula in classical logic augmented with a possibility or\nnecessity operator, and is as interesting. The Converse Barcan\nFormula, as it is known, says the following: \nIf something is such that it is possible that it is F, then\nit is possible that something is F.\n \nThe ontology of non-actual possible objects is an integral part of the\npossibilist view that quantifiers in quantified modal logic range over\nall possible objects, non-actual as well as actual. This possibilist\nview validates the Converse Barcan Formula. If we read\n‘F’ as meaning “does not exist”, the\nConverse Barcan Formula says that if something x is such that\nit is possible that x does not exist, then it is possible\nthat something does not exist. The antecedent is plausibly true, for\nany one of us, actual people, could have failed to exist. But if so,\nthe consequent is true as well, assuming the truth of the Converse\nBarcan Formula. But on actualist representationism, no possible world\ncontains a representation which says that something does not exist,\nfor it is contradictory provided that ‘something’ means\n“some existing thing”. So if the consequent is to be true\non actualist representationism, ‘something’ should not\nmean “some existing thing” but rather should mean\n“some thing, irrespective of whether it exists”. That is,\nthe existential quantifier in the consequent needs to have a free\nrange independently of the possibility operator in whose scope it\noccurs, which is hard to fathom on actualist representationism but\nwhich the possibilist view allows. The consequent does not even appear\nto be threatened with contradiction if we assume the possibilist view\nand let the existential quantifier range over all possible objects,\nincluding non-actual ones. \nIn classical logic, the domain for quantification is assumed to be\nnon-empty and every individual constant is assumed to refer to\nsomething in the domain. In free logic, neither of these\nassumptions is made. Thus free logic appears to be particularly suited\nto theorizing about non-existent objects; see Lambert 1991, Jacquette\n1996. For a criticism of the free-logical approach to fictional\ndiscourse, see Woods 1974: 68–91. Interestingly, the Barcan\nFormula and the Converse Barcan Formula are not derivable in free\nlogic. \nMarcus herself proposes the substitutional reading of quantification\nto skirt the need for non-actual possible objects (Marcus 1976), and\nlater suggests combining it with objectual quantification over actual\nobjects (Marcus 1985/86). \nWilliamson 2013 contains a detailed and useful discussion of the\nBarcan Formula and the Converse Barcan Formula.","contact.mail":"takashi.yagisawa@csun.edu","contact.domain":"csun.edu"}]
