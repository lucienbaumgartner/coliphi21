Although Hartshorne often\ncriticized the metaphysics of substance found in medieval philosophy,\nhe was very much like medieval thinkers in developing a philosophy\nthat was theocentric.  Throughout his career he defended the\nrationality of theism and for several decades was almost alone in\ndoing so among English-language philosophers. Hartshorne was also one\nof the thinkers responsible for the rediscovery of St. Anselm’s\nontological argument. But his most influential contribution to\nphilosophical theism did not concern arguments for\nthe existence of God, but rather was related to a theory of\nthe actuality of God, i.e., how God exists. In\ntraditional or classical theism, God was seen as the supreme,\nunchanging being, but in Hartshorne’s process-based or neoclassical\nconception, God is seen as supreme becoming in which there is a factor\nof supreme being. That is, we humans change for a while, whereas\nGod always changes, Hartshorne maintains. The neoclassical\nview of Hartshorne has influenced the way many philosophers understand\nthe concept of God. In fact, a small number of scholars—some\nphilosophers and some theologians—think of him as the greatest\nmetaphysician of the second half of the twentieth century, yet, with a\nfew exceptions to be treated below, his work has not been very\ninfluential among analytic philosophers who are theists.\n\n\n\n\nCharles Hartshorne was born in the nineteenth century and lived to\nphilosophize in the twenty-first. He was born in Kittanning,\nPennsylvania (U.S.A.) on June 5, 1897. He was, like Alfred North\nWhitehead, the son of an Anglican minister, although many of his\nancestors were Quakers. After attending Haverford College he served in\nWorld War One in France as a medic, taking a box of philosophy books\nwith him to the front. After the war Hartshorne received his doctorate\nin philosophy at Harvard, and there he met Whitehead. Most of the\nmajor elements of Hartshorne’s philosophy were already apparent by the\ntime he became familiar with Whitehead’s thought, contrary to a\npopular misconception. From 1923–1925 a postdoctoral fellowship took\nhim to Germany, where he had classes with both Husserl and\nHeidegger. But neither of these thinkers influenced his philosophy as\nmuch as C.S.  Peirce, whose collected papers he edited with Paul\nWeiss. In addition to many visiting appointments, Hartshorne spent his\nteaching career at three institutions. From 1928–1955 he taught at the\nUniversity of Chicago, where he was a dominant intellectual force in\nthe School of Divinity, despite the fact that he was housed in the\nPhilosophy Department, where he was not nearly as influential. He was\nat Emory University from 1955 until 1962, when he moved to the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. Hartshorne eventually became a\nlong-term emeritus professor at Austin and lived there until his death\non October 9, 2000.  His wife, Dorothy, was as colorful as her husband\nand was mentioned often in his writings. Hartshorne never owned an\nautomobile, nor did he smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine; he had a\npassion for birdsong and became an internationally known expert in the\nfield. \n\nThree primary methodological devices or procedures are at work in\nHartshorne’s metaphysics. First, he very often uses a systematic\nexhaustion of theoretical options—or the development of position\nmatrices, sometimes containing thirty-two alternatives(!)—in\nconsidering philosophical problems. This procedure is evident\nthroughout his philosophy, but it is most apparent in his various\ntreatments of the ontological argument. To take another example, he\nthinks it important to notice that regarding the mind-body problem\nthere are three options available to us, not two, as is usually\nassumed: some form of dualism, some form of the materialist view that\npsyche is reducible to body, and some form of the panpsychist\n(or, as he terms it, psychicalist) view that body is in some way\nreducible to psyche if all concrete singulars (e.g., cells or\nelectrons) in some way show signs of self-motion or activity. Thomas\nNagel famously considers this third option, but Hartshorne actually\ndefends it. The recent surge of interest in panpsychism indicates that Hartshorne was ahead of his time in his ideas in philosophy of mind. \n\nSecond, Hartshorne frequently uses the history of philosophy to see\nwhich of the logically possible options made available by position\nmatrices have been defended before so as to avail ourselves of the\ninsights of others in the effort to examine in detail the consistency\nof these positions and to assess their consequences. Nonetheless,\nthose logically possible options that have not historically found\nsupport should be analyzed both in terms of internal consistency and\npractical ramifications. It should be noted that Hartshorne’s use of\nthe history of philosophy often involves lesser known views of famous\nthinkers (like Plato’s belief in God as the soul for the body of the\nwhole natural world, or Leibniz’s defense of panpsychism) as well as\nthe thought of lesser known thinkers (such as Faustus Socinus,\nNicholas Berdyaev, or Jules Lecquier). \n\nThird, after a careful reading of the history of philosophy has\nfacilitated the conceptual and pragmatic examination of all the\navailable options made explicit by a position matrix, the (Greek)\nprinciple of moderation is used by Hartshorne as a guide to negotiate\nthe way between extreme views on either side. For example, regarding\nthe issue of personal identity, the view of Hume (and of Bertrand\nRussell at one stage in his career) is that, strictly speaking, there\nis no personal identity in that each event in “a person’s life” is\nexternally related to the others. This is just as disastrous,\nHartshorne thinks, as Leibniz’s view that all such events are\ninternally related to the others, so that implicit in the fetus are\nall the experiences of the adult. (This Leibnizian view relies on the\nclassical theistic, strong notion of omniscience, wherein God knows in\nminute detail and with absolute assurance what will happen in the\nfuture.) The Humean view fails to explain the continuity we experience\nin our lives and the Leibnizian view fails to explain the\nindeterminateness we experience when considering the future. The truth\nlies between these two extremes, Hartshorne thinks. His view of\npersonal identity is based on a conception of time as asymmetrical in\nwhich later events in a person’s life are internally related to former\nevents, but they are externally related to those that follow, thus\nleading to a position that is at once partially deterministic and\npartially indeterministic. That is, the past supplies necessary but\nnot sufficient conditions for human identity in the present, which\nalways faces a partially indeterminate future. \n\nOnly the first of these methodological devices or procedures supports\nthe widely held claim that Hartshorne is a rationalist. His overall\nmethod is a complex one that involves the other two methods or\nprocedures, where he does borrow from the rationalists, but also from\nthe pragmatists and the Greeks. It must be admitted, however, that\nHartshorne was educated in a philosophic world still heavily\ninfluenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth century\nidealism. \n\nPhilosophers commonly use a metaphor that suggests that the chain of\nan argument, say for the existence of God, is only as strong as its\nweakest link. Hartshorne rejects this metaphor on Peircian grounds. He\nreplaces it by suggesting that various arguments for the existence of\nGod—ontological, cosmological, design, etc.—are like\nmutually reinforcing strands in a cable. \n\nHe argues that Hume’s and Kant’s criticisms of the ontological\nargument of St. Anselm are not directed at the strongest version of\nhis argument found in Proslogion, chapter 3. Here, he thinks,\nthere is a modal distinction implied between existing necessarily and\nexisting contingently. Hartshorne’s view is that existence alone might\nnot be a real predicate, but existing necessarily certainly is.  To\nsay that something exists without the possibility of not existing is\nto say something significant about the being in question. That is,\ncontra Kant and others, Hartshorne believes that there are necessary\ntruths concerning existence. To say that absolute nonexistence in some\nfashion exists is to contradict oneself; hence he thinks that absolute\nnonexistence is unintelligible. It is necessarily the case that\nsomething exists, he thinks, and, relying on the ontological\nargument, he also thinks it true that God necessarily exists. \n\nOn Hartshorne’s view, metaphysics does not deal with realities beyond\nthe physical, but rather with those features of reality that are\nubiquitous or that would exist in any possible world. And he does not\nthink that it is possible to think of a preeminent being that\nexisted only contingently since if it did exist contingently rather than\nnecessarily, it would not be preeminent. That is, God’s existence is\neither impossible (positivism) or possible, and, if possible, then\nnecessary (theism). He is assuming here that there are three\nalternatives for us to consider: (1) God is impossible; (2) God is\npossible, but may or may not exist; (3) God exists necessarily. The\nontological argument shows that the second alternative makes no sense.\nHence, he thinks that the prime task for the philosophical theist is\nto show that God is not impossible. \n\nIn addition, Hartshorne’s detailed treatment of the argument from\ndesign is connected to his view of biology. It is hard to reconcile the idea of an\nomnipotent, classical theistic God with the fact of the monstrosities and\nchance mutations produced in nature, but the general orderliness of\nthe natural world is just as difficult to reconcile with there being\nno Orderer or Persuader at all. Belief in God as omnipotent, he\nthinks, has three problems: (1) it is at odds with the disorderliness\nin nature; (2) it yields the acutest form of the theodicy problem; and\n(3) it conflicts with the notion from Plato’s Sophist,\ndefended by Hartshorne, that being is dynamic power\n(dynamis). An omnipotent being would ultimately have\nall power over others, who would ultimately be powerless. But any\nbeing-in-becoming, according to Hartshorne, has some power to\nbe affected by others and to affect others; this power, however\nslight, provides counterevidence to a belief in divine omnipotence. In\ncontrast, God is ideally powerful, on the Hartshornian view. That is,\nGod is as powerful as it is possible to be, given the partial freedom\nand power of creatures. \n\nHartshorne’s dispute with traditional or classical philosophical\ntheism concerns not so much the existence of God, but rather\nits assumption that the actuality of God (i.e., how\nGod exists) could be described in the same terms as the existence of\nGod. A God who exists necessarily is not necessary or unchanging in\nevery other respect (e.g., in terms of divine responsiveness to\ncreaturely changes), he thinks. Although Hartshorne believes that the\nmedieval thinkers were correct in trying to think through the logic of\nperfection, he also thinks that this logic has traditionally been\nmisapplied in the effort to articulate the attributes of a being\ncalled “God,” roughly defined as the greatest conceivable\nbeing. The traditional or classical theistic logic of perfection sees\nGod as monopolar in that regarding various contrasts\n(permanence-change, one-many, activity-passivity, etc.) the\ntraditional or classical philosophical theist has chosen one element\nin each pair as a divine attribute (the former element of each pair)\nand denigrated the other. \n\nBy way of contrast, Hartshorne’s logic of perfection is dipolar.\nWithin each element of these pairs there are good features that should\nbe attributed in the preeminent sense to God (e.g., excellent\npermanence in the sense of steadfastness, excellent change in the\nsense of preeminent ability to respond to the sufferings of\ncreatures). In each element in these pairs there are also invidious\nfeatures (e.g., pigheaded stubbornness, fickleness). The task for the\nphilosophical theist, he thinks, is to attribute the excellences of\nboth elements of these pairs to God and to eschew the invidious\naspects of both elements. However, it should be noted that\nsome contrasts are not fit for dipolar analysis (e.g.,\ngood-evil) in that “good good” is a redundancy and\n“evil good” is a contradiction. The greatest conceivable\nbeing, he thinks, cannot be evil in any sense whatsoever. \n\nHartshorne does not claim to believe in two gods, nor does he wish to\ndefend a cosmological dualism. In fact, we can see that the opposite\nis the case when we consider that, in addition to calling his theism\ndipolar, he refers to it as a type of panentheism,\nwhich literally means that all is in the one God. This inclusion of the world in God occurs by means of\nomniscience (as Hartshorne defines the term) and omnibenevolence. All\ncreaturely feelings, especially feelings of suffering, are included in\nthe divine life. God is seen by Hartshorne as the mind or soul for the\nwhole body of the natural world (see above regarding Plato’s World\nSoul), although he thinks of God as distinguishable from the\ncreatures.  Another way to categorize Hartshorne’s theism is to see it\nas neoclassical in the sense that he relies on the classical\nor traditional theistic arguments for the existence of God and on the\nclassical theistic metaphysics of being as first steps in the\neffort to think through properly the logic of perfection. However,\nthese efforts need to be supplemented, he thinks, by the efforts of\nthose who see becoming as more inclusive than being. God is not\noutside of time, as in the Boethian view that is influential among\ntraditional philosophical theists, but rather exists through all of\ntime, on Hartshorne’s view. On the neoclassical view, God’s permanent\n“being” consists in steadfast benevolence exhibited through\neverlasting becoming. \n\nGod is omniscient, on Hartshorne’s view, but “omniscience” here refers\nto the divine ability to know everything that is knowable: past\nactualities as already actualized; present realities to the extent\nthat they are knowable according to the laws of physics (e.g., what is\npresent epistemically may very well be the most recent past, given the\nspeed of light); and future possibilities or probabilities as\npossibilities or probabilities. On the traditional or classical\nconception of omniscience, however, God has knowledge of future\npossibilities or probabilities as already actualized. According to\nHartshorne, this is not an example of supreme knowledge, but is rather\nan example of ignorance of the (at least partially) indeterminate\ncharacter of the future. \n\nThe asymmetrical view of time, common to process thinkers in general\n(e.g., Bergson, Whitehead, Hartshorne), in which the relationship\nbetween the present and the past is radically different from the\nrelationship between the present and the future, also has implications\nfor Hartshorne’s theodicy. A plurality of partially free agents,\nincluding nonhuman ones, facing a future that is neither completely\ndetermined nor foreknown in detail, makes it not only possible, but\nlikely, that these agents will get in each other’s way, clash, and\ncause each other to suffer. On this view, God is the fellow sufferer\nwho understands. \n\nHartshorne views the cosmos as a “metaphysical monarchy,”\nwith God as the presiding, but not omnipotent, head, and he sees human\nsociety as a “metaphysical democracy,” with each member as\nan equal. This makes him a liberal in politics if\n“liberalism” refers to the egalitarian belief that none of\nus is God. That is, due to the fact of pervasive pluralism of comprehensive doctrines that citizens affirm, none of us should presume to act like the classical theistic God by unreasonably imposing our view of the world on others. Although Hartshorne and Whitehead are both political\nliberals, Hartshorne is, despite his view of panpsychist reality as\nthoroughly social, more of a libertarian liberal and Whitehead more of\na redistributive liberal. In axiology as well as in\nmetaphysics/theodicy, freedom is crucial, on Hartshorne’s view. \n\nHartshorne’s panpsychism (or psychicalism) entails the belief that\neach active singular in nature, even those like electrons and plant\ncells that do not exhibit mentality, is nonetheless a center of\nintrinsic, and not merely instrumental, value. As a result,\nHartshorne’s metaphysics is meant to provide a basis for both an\naesthetic appreciation of the value in nature, as well as for an\nenvironmental ethics where intrinsic and instrumental values in nature\nare weighed. \n\nAs a published expert on bird song, Hartshorne is the first\nphilosopher since Aristotle to be an expert in both metaphysics and\nornithology. He writes specifically of the aesthetic categories\nrequired to explain why birds sing outside of mating season and when\nterritory is not threatened—two occasions for bird song that are\ncrucial to the behaviorists’ account. Birds like to sing, he\nconcludes. Hartshorne’s ornithology thus serves to highlight the crucial role that aesthetic categories play in Hartshorne’s philosophy (from the ancient Greek word for feeling: aesthesis), from the miniscule feelings of microscopic reality to divine feelings.  \n\nHartshorne’s criticism of anthropocentrism is due not only to his\nconcern for God, but also for beings-in-becoming who experience in a\nless sophisticated way than humans. To say that all active singulars\nfeel—leaving out of the picture abstractions like\n“twoness” or insentient composites of active singulars\nthat do not themselves feel as wholes—is not to say that they\nare self-conscious or that they think. As before, however,\nHartshorne’s axiology is ultimately theocentric in character. \n\nIt seems fair to say that analytic philosophers, in general, even\nanalytic philosophers who are theists, have largely ignored\nHartshorne’s philosophy.  (The point is debateable.  There has been a\nmove among many analytic philosophers who are theists, as in Richard\nSwinburne, away from the eternal, Boethian God who is outside of time\naltogether.  Might it be that Hartshorne’s influence is greater than\ninitially appears to be the case when the temporality, or the\nsempiternity, of the God of many analytic philosophers is concerned?)\nThis is in contrast to his wide influence among theologians, which is\nodd when it is considered that he is not a theologian and does not\nrely on sacred scripture or religious authority for his\ninsights. Another oddity is the fact that Hartshorne’s influence among\ntheologians is due to the defense he offers of\nthe rationality of belief in a neoclassical God. \n\nThere is at least one important philosopher whose work indicates the\nsort of debate that has occurred between Hartshorne and analytic\ntheists, who tend to rely on traditional or classical versions of the\nconcept of God. That is William Alston. There are two reasons why an\nevaluation of Hartshorne’s philosophy is facilitated by a\nconsideration of Alston’s critique. First, Alston is as important a\ntheist as any among analytic philosophers and his criticisms of\nHartshorne’s thought are like those of other analytic philosophers\nlike Thomas Morris, Richard Creel, Michael Durrant, and\nothers. And second, Alston is a former student of Hartshorne’s and is\nthoroughly familiar with Hartshorne’s arguments. Alston is a\nphilosopher who is not scandalized by Hartshorne’s panentheism, nor by\nhis neoclassical theism. But Alston thinks that the contrast that\nHartshorne draws between his neoclassical theism and the classical\ntheism of Thomas Aquinas is too sharp. \n\nAlston thinks that Hartshorne presents neoclassical theism and\nclassical theism as complete packages, whereas it would be better to\nbe able to pick and choose among individual items within these\npackages.  Alston seeks some sort of rapprochement between Thomism and\nneoclassical theism, a rapprochement that Hartshorne himself would\nlike to bring about to the extent that he is a neoclassical\nthinker, but that is difficult to accomplish to the extent that he is\nneoclassical. \n\nA consideration of ten contrasting attributes will best facilitate an\ninitial understanding of Hartshorne’s view of God. Consider the first\ngroup of attributes treated by Alston. \n Alston distinguishes two lines of argument regarding absoluteness and\nrelativity, which he sees as the key contrast. Alston thinks that only\none of these is successful. As indicated in the diagram above, what\nHartshorne means by absoluteness is absence of internal relatedness. A\nrelation is internal to a term of a relation just in case that term\nwould not be exactly as it is if it were not in that relationship.\nHartshorne’s view is that God has internal relations to creatures by\nway of knowing and acting towards them and receiving influence from them.  \n\nOn Alston’s interpretation, Hartshorne’s first line of argument is to\nsay that if the relation of the absolute to the world really fell\noutside the absolute, then this relation would necessarily fall within\nsome further and genuinely single entity that embraced both the\nabsolute and the world and the relations between them. Thus, we must\nhold, according to Hartshorne, that the God-creature relation is\ninternal to God; otherwise we will have to admit that there is\nsomething greater or more inclusive than God. Alston does not find\nthis argument convincing because it includes the claim that God\n“contains” the world due to the internal relations God has with the\nworld.  Alston’s view is that the entity to which a relation is\ninternal contains the terms only in the minimal sense that those terms enter\ninto a description of the entity, but it does not follow from this\nthat those terms are contained in that entity in an organic way. \n\nDivine inclusiveness, for Hartshorne, is sometimes like the\ninclusion of thoughts in a mind, but usually it is described as like\nthe inclusion of cells within a living body. It is never like the\ninclusion of marbles in a box. The inorganic and insentient character\nof a box is inadequate as a model for divinity, he thinks, and divine\ninclusiveness is never like the inclusion of theorems in a set of\naxioms, as it might be for certain idealists. Divine inclusiveness in\nHartshorne is organic inclusiveness. \n\nHartshorne’s second argument against absoluteness fares much better,\naccording to Alston. He agrees with Hartshorne’s stance regarding the\ncognitive relation God has with the world; in any case of knowledge,\nthe knowledge relation is internal to the subject, external to the\nobject. When a human being knows something, the fact that she knows it\nis part of what makes her the concrete being that she is. If she\nrecognizes a certain tree she is different from the being she might\nhave been if she had not recognized the tree. But the tree is\nunaffected by her recognition. Likewise, according to Alston, one\ncannot maintain that God has perfect knowledge of everything knowable\nand still hold that God is not qualified to any degree by relations\nwith other beings. \n\nOne might respond to Alston and Hartshorne on this point by saying\nthat since creatures depend for their existence on God, their\nrelations to God affect them, but not God. Richard Creel\nseems to make this very point. But even if beings other than God\ndepend for their existence on God, it still remains true that if God\nhad created a different world from the one that exists at present,\nthen God would be somewhat different from the way God is at present:\nGod’s knowledge would have been of that world and not this\none, according to both Alston and Hartshorne. \n\nAlston’s concessions to Hartshorne’s concept of God extend to\ncontrasts 2–4. The above argument for the internal relatedness of God\n(as cognitive subject) to the world presupposes that there are\nalternative possibilities for God, and if there are alternative\npossibilities for divine knowledge then this implies that there are\nunrealized potentialities for God. Pure actuality and\ntotal necessity cannot be defended as divine attributes,\naccording to Alston and Hartshorne. Alston’s version of Hartshorne’s\nargument goes as follows: \n\n(2) If (a) were necessary, (b) would be necessary. \n\n(3) But (b) is contingent. \n\n(4) Hence (a) is contingent. \n\nWe can totally exclude contingency from God only by denying God any\nknowledge of anything contingent, a step that not even traditional or\nclassical theists wish to take. Contrast 4 must also be treated in a\ndipolar way in that the main support for a doctrine of pure divine\nsimplicity is the absence of any unrealized potentialities in God.  \n\nIn sum, Alston and Hartshorne agree on contrasts 1–4, except for the\nfact that Hartshorne’s concept of divine inclusiveness, in contrast to\nAlston’s, is organic in character. \n\nRegarding a second group of attributes, however, Alston and many other\ntheists who are analytic philosophers diverge from Hartshorne rather\nsignificantly: \n\nConcerning contrast 5, Alston takes creation ex nihilo to be\nfundamental to theism because it has deep roots in religious\nexperience. He thinks that to say that God has unrealized\npotentialities and contingent properties is not to say that God\nmust be in relation with some world of entities other than\nGod. Alston admits that Hartshorne legitimately points out some of the\ninternal contradictions contained in the classical theistic version of\ncreation ex nihilo, but he claims that there is no connection\ndrawn by Hartshorne between divine creation and metaphysical\nprinciples regarding relativity, contingency, and\npotentiality. Alston’s belief seems to be that those who accept\ncreation ex nihilo are not saying that there is absolutely\nnothing at any stage: there is God.  Rather, creation ex\nnihilo only means that there is nothing out of which God creates\nthe universe. Here Alston seems to agree with Norman Kretzmann,\nEleonore Stump, and most other theists who are analytic philosophers. \n\nAlston’s stance here is problematic for two reasons, from Hartshorne’s\npoint of view. First, although belief in some sort of divine\ncreativity has deep roots in the history of religious experience, it\nis not clear that these roots have to tap into creation ex\nnihilo. For example, it is not clear that creation ex\nnihilo is the sort of creation described in Genesis, in that when\nthe Bible starts with the statement that the spirit of God hovered\nabove the waters, one gets the impression that both God and the\naqueous muck had been around forever. If one believes in creation\nex nihilo, however, as Alston does, one might nonetheless\nclaim that creation ex nihilo does not necessarily mean a\ntemporal beginning to the act of creation. But even on this hypothesis\nthere are problems, and this would seem to be Hartshorne’s second\npoint. If Plato and Hartshorne are correct that being is\ndynamic power, then the sort of unlimited power implied by creation\nex nihilo is impossible. Hartshorne would argue, contra\nAlston, that there is a connection between belief in creation ex\nhyle (as opposed to creation ex nihilo) and the\nmetaphysical principle that being is dynamic power. Creation ex\nnihilo, Hartshorne thinks, is a convenient fiction invented in\nthe first centuries B.C.E. and C.E. in order to exalt divine power,\nbut it is not the only sort of creation that religious believers have\ndefended, nor is it defensible if being is dynamic power. \n\nConcerning contrast 6, Alston claims that belief in creation ex\nnihilo and belief in divine omnipotence are separate beliefs such\nthat to argue against the former is not necessarily to argue against\nthe latter. Hartshorne tries to do too much, he thinks, with the claim\nthat being is power when he uses this claim to argue against divine\nomnipotence. According to Alston, God can have unlimited\npower, power to do anything that God wills to do, without having\nall power in that, if being is power, the creatures also have\nsome power. \n\nOn Hartshorne’s interpretation of Alston, however, God can have\nunlimited power, but not all power, because God delegates some power to\nothers. Although God does not have all power, Hartshorne thinks that on\nAlston’s view God could have all power. In effect, what Alston\nhas done, according to Hartshorne, is reduce his stance regarding\ndivine omnipotence to that regarding creation ex nihilo in\nthat the claim that God could have all power is due to the prior belief\nthat God brings everything into existence out of absolutely nothing, a\nbelief that Alston thinks has to be the traditional one and in point of\nfact is intelligible. It is not quite clear to Hartshorne, however,\nthat it is unquestionably the traditional one, nor is it clear to him\nthat we can develop an intelligible concept of “absolutely\nnothing.” \n\nHartshorne’s Platonic or Bergsonian argument against creation ex\nnihilo, in simplified form, looks something like this: one can in\nfact imagine the nonexistence of this or that, or even of this or that\nclass of things, a fact that gives some the confidence to\n(erroneously) think that this process can go on infinitely such that\none could imagine a state in which there was “absolutely nothing.”\nHowever, not every verbally possible statement is made conceptually\ncogent by even the most generous notion of “conceptual,” according to\nHartshorne. At the specific, ordinary, empirical level negative\ninstances are possible (e.g., this corkscrew is not a dog), but at the generic, metaphysical level only\npositive instances are possible (e.g., something must exist), on this view. The sheer absence of\nreality cannot conceivably be experienced, he thinks, for if it were\nexperienced an existing experiencer would be presupposed. \n\nContrast 7 deals with divine embodiment. Alston is willing to grant\nthat God is embodied in two senses: (1) God is aware, with maximal\nimmediacy, of what goes on in the world; and (2) God can directly\naffect what happens in the world. That is, Alston defends a limited\nversion of divine embodiment, similar to that defended by Richard\nSwinburne. However, Alston is sceptical regarding a stronger version\nof divine embodiment wherein the world exists by metaphysical\nnecessity such that God must animate it. Alston is willing to\naccept the idea that God has a body, but only if having such\na body is on God’s terms. It seems that this weaker version of divine\nembodiment defended by Alston, as opposed to Hartshorne’s stronger\nversion wherein there is essential corporeality in God, stands or\nfalls with the defense of creation ex nihilo. In fact,\ndespite Alston’s desire to examine each contrast individually, as\nopposed to Hartshorne’s stark contrast between classical theistic\nattributes (all ten of them) and neoclassical attributes (all ten of\nthem), he ends up linking his criticisms of Hartshorne regarding\ncontrasts 5–7, at the very least. All three of these classical\ntheistic attributes stand together only with a defensible version of\ncreation ex nihilo. \n\nContrasts 8–9, concerning nontemporality and immutability, are also\nlinked by Alston. He concedes that if God is temporal, Hartshorne has\noffered us the best version to date of what divine temporality and\ndivine mutability would be like. Alston dismisses as idle the view\nthat God could remain completely unchanged through a succession of\ntemporal moments, but this admission still leaves us, he thinks, with\nthe following conditional statement: “God undergoes change if\nGod is in time.” Alston’s critique of Hartshorne’s view also consists\nin a refusal to grant that contingency and temporality are coextensive\nin the way mutability and temporality are. Alston believes, contra\nHartshorne, that God can be in some way contingent (that any relation\nin which God stands to the world might have been otherwise) and still\nbe nontemporal. \n\nAlston knows that the notion of a nontemporal God who is nonetheless qualified by\nrelation to temporal beings will strike Hartshorne as\nunintelligible. Alston’s attempt to make his position intelligible\nrests on his own Thomistic-Whiteheadian stance, or better, on his\nThomistic or Boethian interpretation of Whitehead (strange as this\nseems); Alston is also influenced here by Eleanore Stump and Norman Kretzmann. We should not think of God as involved in process or becoming\nof any sort. The best temporal analogy, he thinks, for this conception\nis an unextended instant or an “eternal now.” For Alston\nthis does not commit one, however, as Hartshorne would allege, to a\nstatic deity frozen in immobility. On the contrary, according to\nAlston, God is eternally active in ways that do not require temporal\nsuccession. God’s acts can be complete in an instant. Alston includes\nGod’s acts of knowledge, a stance that at least seems to conflict with\none of the concessions he made to Hartshorne regarding the first group\nof attributes. \n\nThe Boethian-Thomistic notion of the specious present for God, on the\nanalogue of a human being’s perceiving some temporally extended\nstretch of a process in one temporally indivisible act, is also\ndefended by Alston. For example, one can perceive the flight of a bee\n“all at once” without first perceiving the first half of\nthe stretch of flight and then perceiving the second. One’s perception\ncan be without temporal succession even if the object of one’s\nperception is, in fact, temporally successive. All we have to do, on\nAlston’s view, is expand our specious present to cover all of time and\nwe have a model for God’s awareness of the world. This is a much more\ndifficult project for Hartshorne to imagine than it is for\nAlston. Apparently Alston thinks that it is easy to conceptualize God\n“seeing” Neanderthal man (or Adam), Moses, Jesus, and\nDorothy Day all at once in their immediacy.  Here Alston has a view\nsimilar to that of William Mann. \n\nBut even if it were possible to have nonsuccessive awareness\nof a vast succession, which Hartshorne would deny, it is even more\nimplausible, from Hartshorne’s point of view, to claim, as does\nAlston, that God could have nonsuccessive responses to stages\nof that succession. It might make more sense for Alston to say\n“indesponses” or “presponses” rather than\n“responses,” as Creel would urge. \n\nIt is correct of Alston to notice that there is no loss in God, but\nthis is not incompatible with God’s temporality, according to\nHartshorne. There can be succession in God without there being loss or\nperishing due to the fact that God’s inheritance of what happens in\nthe world and God’s memory are ideal. Hartshorne thinks that the\nfuture is incomplete and indeterminate for God as well as from our\nlimited perspective. Alston, by way of contrast, wants to defend a God\nwho is not strictly necessary in actuality, but is contingent,\ndespite the fact that God does not undergo temporal change,\nnor is God fluent.  Hartshorne’s defenders, by way of contrast, think\nthat one of the greatest virtues of process thinking is its effort to\neliminate what they see as such self-contradiction in philosophical\ntheology. \n\nAlston’s treatment of contrast 10, concerning absolute versus relative\nperfection, follows from what he has said regarding contrasts\n8–9. Relative perfection in God, as opposed to absolute perfection,\nhas a point only for a temporal being; hence God is absolutely\nperfect, according to Alston. A being that does not successively\nassume different states could not possibly surpass itself. Here, once\nagain, Alston engages in linkage, thereby, at the very least,\nconfirming Hartshorne’s belief that we need both to consider the\ndivine attributes together and to determine whether the classical\ntheist’s linkage or the neoclassical theist’s linkage is more\ndefensible. For the most past, Alston opts for classical theism. Or\nmore precisely, he thinks that the strongest concept of God is\nacquired when we take a modified version of the neoclassical\nattributes in contrasts 1–4 and combine them with the classical\nattributes in contrasts 5–10. \n\nThis rapproachement in Alston between classical theism and\nneoclassical theism is a step beyond James Ross’s belief that these\nare two competing descriptions of God at an impasse. Hartshorne seems\nto agree with Ross. Neoclassical, dipolar theism already\nincludes the best insights of classical theism, he thinks. \n\nFrom Hartshorne’s point of view the linkage of attributes\nwithin the first group and within the second group\nneeds to be corrected by a greater concern for reticulating the\nattributes in these two groups. He thinks that an explanation is\nneeded regarding how Alston can be committed to both monopolar and\ndipolar theism. For example, Alston ends up defending the view that\nGod is changed by the objects God knows (pace the neoclassical,\ndipolar attributes), but these are not changes that occur in time\n(pace the classical, monopolar attributes). It is one thing,\nHartshorne thinks, to say that God exists in a nontemporal specious\npresent, and it is another to say that God is changed by temporal\nbeings in a nontemporal specious present. The former view is at least\nproblematic, he thinks, and the latter seems to be part of the\ntraditional classical theistic view wherein, from a Hartshornian\nperspective, inconsistency goes in the guise of mystery.","contact.mail":"ddombrow@seattleu.edu","contact.domain":"seattleu.edu"}]
