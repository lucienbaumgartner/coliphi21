But unlike predecessors who\nwere content to define God's mastery as foundational to human lordship\nin non-metaphysical terms, Wyclif made ready use of his realist\nontology to argue that God's dominium functions as a\nuniversal by causality for all instances of just human\ndominium. For medieval political theorists, this was not\ncommon practice; some, like\n Aquinas,\n can be argued to present unified systems of metaphysics, political\nthought, and ecclesiology, but many others, including\n Ockham,\n Marsilius of Padua, John of Paris, and\n Giles of Rome,\n did not. If, like Ockham or Giles, they had metaphysical positions,\nit is impossible to argue persuasively that their ontologies affected\ntheir politics. This makes Wyclif's political and ecclesiological\nthought notable, for it is one of the few cases where a distinguished\nmetaphysician used his ontology as a foundation for a detailed\nexamination of the just arrangement of authority in church and\nstate. An immediate corrollary to Wyclif's axiomatic position that all\njust human dominium derives from God is that no private\nproperty relations, which serve as the underpinnings for all human\nmastery, are just without grace. Because, following\n Augustine,\n private property is a direct result of the Fall of man, the ideal\nstate is one of communal ownership. Since the Church is the\nre-established ideal state, grace does not provide for its just\nownership of any property whatsoever. Because Wyclif saw the\nfourteenth-century church enjoying the lion's share of property\nownership in England, he argued that the king was bound by God to\nrelieve the church of its property, and to rule over it as a divinely\nappointed steward. The substance of this argument was realized by\nHenry VIII, and so Wyclif has been associated, if only as prophetic\nforerunner, with Tudor reformation. The form of Wyclif's arguments are\nin no way comparable to modern arguments, though, and are more\ndirectly associated with earlier Franciscan positions, like those of\n Ockham,\n than they are with later political theory. In this essay, the Latin\nterm dominium will be used to distinguish Wyclif's\ntheologically medieval view from its modern English correlate\n'dominion', which connotes absolute mastery.\n\n\n\nGovernment and the relation of divine justice to human law, both\nsecular and ecclesiastical, figure as occasional themes throughout the\ntreatises of the Summa de Ente. After receiving his doctorate\nin theology in 1373, his attention began to focus more completely on\nthese topics, and his realism continued to undergird his thought at\nleast through 1381, during which period he wrote the treatises that\nmake up the second of his great Summae, the Summa\nTheologie. In late 1373, he began De Dominio Divino,\nwhich serves as bridge from the later, formal theological treatises of\nthe Summa de Ente to the political, social, and\necclesiological subject matter of the Summa Theologie. He\nbegan royal service during this period, participating in an embassy to\nBruges for negotiations with papal envoys in 1374. Wyclif remained in\nthe service of John of Gaunt for the rest of his life; the Duke\nprotected him from the formal prosecution prompted by five bulls of\npapal condemnation in 1377. After being condemned for his views on the\nEucharist at Oxford in 1381, Wyclif withdrew to Lutterworth, where he\nremained until his death in December 1384. Though still protected by\nJohn of Gaunt, he was no longer in active service after 1379. During\nthese tumultuous years, Wyclif wrote the ten treatises of the\nSumma Theologie: four on just human government, two on the\nstructure and government of the church, one on scriptural\nhermeneutics, and three on specific problems afflicting the\nChurch. Our interest lies in De Mandatis Divinis (1375–76),\nDe Statu Innocencie (1376), and De Civili\nDominio (1375–76), where he provides the theological foundation\nfor the radical transformation of the church he prescribes in De\nEcclesia (1378–79) De Potestate Pape (1379), and De\nOfficio Regis (1379). Towards the end of his life, Wyclif\nsummarized his entire theological vision in Trialogus\n(1382–83), reiterating the connections between his earlier\nphilosophical works and later political treatises in a three-way\ndialogue written in language that would appeal to members of the royal\ncourt.   \n\n Dominium and its generally accepted translation, 'lordship',\nsuggest the sovereignty exercised by one individual over another, but\nRoman law allowed for complexity in distinguishing between property\nownership, its primary referent, and jurisdiction, governance, and\npolitical power. When twelfth-century canon lawyers resurrected Roman\nlaw as the foundation for the ascendant papal monarchy, it was common\nto distinguish between jurisdictive authority, secular power, and the\nuse and possession of private\n property.[1]\n By the beginning of the fourteenth century, dominium largely\nconnoted property ownership, though this usually entailed jurisdictive\nauthority. Most political theorists agreed with Thomas Aquinas in saying that a civil lord who\nsupposed that his jurisdictive authority arose from property ownership\nrather than from a constitution would be a tyrant (Summa\nTheologiae IaIIae, Q.56, a.5; Q.58, a.2). Given that the legal\nuse of dominium referred to property ownership and not to the\nauthority to govern, it seems odd that Wyclif used the term to do so\nmuch more. The reason may be found in the connection of Augustinian\ntheology to theories of the justice of property ownership.  As the\npapal monarchy developed, its theorists, such as\n Giles of Rome,\n found it useful to identify all earthly justice, including just\nproperty ownership, with the source of justice in creation. \n\n Augustine's\n De Civitate Dei was the basis for relating property\nownership and secular justice to divine authority. Here the division\nbetween two classes of men is clear: some are members of the City of\nMan, motivated by love of self, while others are motivated by the love\nof God and a contempt for self, placing them in the City of\n God.[2]\n There is really only one true Lord in creation.  Mastery of one man\nover another is the result of Original Sin and is therefore unnatural\nexcept in the case of paternity, which is founded on parental love for\na child. Among members of the City of God, the relation of prince and\nsubject is not political and does not entail the sort of mastery we\nsee in the City of Man, but rather involves service and sacrifice, as\nexemplified by the parent/child relationship. \n\nProperty ownership has been united to mastery in the City of Man\nbecause of Original Sin, whereby man turned away from God in the\nmistaken belief that he could make claims of exclusive ownership on\ncreated beings. This is not to say that Augustine thought that all\nprivate property relations are wrong; indeed, he is famous for having\nargued that all things belong to the just (De Civitate Dei\n14, ch. 28). But people who own things are not de facto\njust.  Those for whom ownership is not an end in itself but a means by\nwhich to do God's will are freed from the bondage of selfishness\nimposed by the Fall. They easily recognize the truth of the dictum\nthat one should abstain from the possession of private things, or if\none cannot do so, then at least from the love of property\n(Enarratio in Psalmam 132, ch.4). \n\nAugustine's thought on the relation of ownership to political\nauthority is open to interpretation. One can easily read him as\narguing that the Church, as the Body of Christ and earthly\ninstantiation of the City of God, can best exemplify loving\nlord/subject relations through its ecclesiastical structure, thereby\njustifying a top-down papal monarchy. Likewise, one can read him as\nhaving so separated secular political authority from the rule of love\nas to make political and ecclesiastical jurisdictive authority utterly\ndistinct. Again, one could interpret Augustine's 'all things belong to\nthe just' as meaning that the Church is the arbiter of all property\nownership in virtue of being the Body of Christ and seat of all\ncreated justice, or one could argue that the Church should abandon all\nclaims to property ownership, just as the Apostles abstained from the\npossession of private property. This ambiguity in interpretation was\nthe source of some of the competing theories that influenced Wyclif's\nposition. \n\nDuring the conflict between Philip IV of France and Pope Boniface VIII\nin 1301, Giles of Rome wrote De Ecclesiastica Potestate,\nestablishing the absolute secular superiority of the papacy. Giles'\nmaster Boniface VIII was responsible for the two famous Bulls,\nClericos laicos (1296), which forbade clergy to give up\nproperty without papal approval, and Unam sanctam (1302),\nwhich declared that secular power is in the service of, and subject\nto, papal authority. De Ecclesiastica Potestate is an\narticulation of the concept of power underlying these two Bulls and\narising from one of the two interpretations of Augustine described\nabove. In it, Giles describes all power “spiritual and secular” as\nrooted in the papacy, likening its structure to a papal river from\nwhich smaller, secular streams branch out. The source of this river,\nhe continues, is the sea, which is God: “God is a kind of font and a\nkind of sea of force and power, from which sea all forces and all\npowers are derived like\n streams.”[3]\n  Not only is secular power reliant on papal authority; all property\nownership, insofar as it is just, is similarly dependent on an\necclesiastical foundation. The key element in just secular power and\nproperty ownership, he continues, is grace: without God's will\ndirectly moving in creation through the sacraments of the Church,\npower and ownership are empty claims, devoid of justice. Although\nGiles did not explicitly call the combination of ownership and\ntemporal power dominium, his uniting the two in a consistent,\nAugustinian fashion was sufficient for the next generation of\nAugustinian theorists. \n\nThirty years earlier, in Bonaventure's\nApologia pauperum of 1269, the Franciscans had defined any\nproperty ownership, communal or individual, as inimical to the ideals\nof their Order. The Fall from paradise and the introduction of\nselfishness to human nature makes property ownership of any type,\nprivate or communal, an abberation. For the Franciscans, “all things\nbelong to the just” only in the sense that “belonging” entails\nnon-exclusive sharing (usus pauper), not ownership. Within\nthree decades, the Franciscans were divided on this issue: one party,\nthe Spirituals, demanded that the friars adopt usus pauper as\ntheir ideal of spiritual perfection, while the other, the Conventuals,\nargued for a more lenient interpretation of the Rule. The Spirituals,\nunder the guidance of the philosopher\n John Peter Olivi\n and his follower Ubertino de Casale, outnumbered the Conventuals by\ncentury's end, and had become sufficiently vocal to attract the\nattention of the\n pope.[4]\n John XXII was deeply suspicious of the Spiritual Franciscans'\narguments, perhaps fearing a reappearance of the communitarian\nWaldensian heresy. Private ownership, John argued, was not the result\nof Original Sin, but a gift from God that Adam enjoyed in Paradise and\nwhich the blessed still can enjoy, secure in the knowledge that their\nownership is sanctioned by God's dominium. This argument was\nto have notable consequences. John's eventual controversy with the\nSpiritual's champion,\n William Ockham,\n led to the first important use of the concept of natural right.  But\nfor our analysis, the important thing is that iurisdictio and\nproprietas were united in the concept of\ndominium. Wyclif would make use of the Franciscans' arguments\nfor apostolic poverty, as well as of John XXII's idea that divine\ndominium provides the basis for all human dominium,\nthough in a way that would certainly have displeased both\n parties.[5] \n\nBy the 1350s, opponents of the Franciscans had broadened their range\nof criticism to question the legitimacy of the Order itself. Richard\nFitzralph, (d. 1360) wrote De Pauperie Salvatoris, a\nsustained examination of the Franciscans' claim to function without\nsupervision by diocesan bishop in which he argues that if the friars\nrely on the justice of the owners of what they use, they are bound by\nthe same laws that bind the owners.  Thus, if the owners of what the\nfriars use are ecclesiastical, it follows that the friars must obey\necclesiastical\n authority.[6]\n  Fitzralph's position is important here because it argues that grace\nalone is the justification for any instance of dominium in\ncreation, and that all just dominium ultimately relies on\nGod's dominium.  Both serve as cornerstones of Wyclif's\nposition. God's dominium is a natural consequence of the act\nof creating, and with it comes divine governance and conservation of\ncreated being. The rational beings in creation, angels and human\nbeings, enjoy the loan of elements of God's created universe, but this\nis not a divine abdication of ultimate authority since everything is\nstill directly subject to divine dominium.   \n\nWhen the nature of the dominium lent to Adam changed with the\nFall, the love defining our natural dominium was affected,\nbut not eradicated. Men devised political dominium to\nregulate property relations, and although sin keeps them from\nrecognizing the borrowed nature of any dominium, it does not\npreclude there being grace-justified property ownership. In some\ncases, God infuses the artificial property-relations that we call\ndominium with sufficient grace to make them generally\nequivalent to prelapsarian dominium. These grace-favored\ncases of human dominium do not replicate the authority of God's\ndominium, but can exhibit the love that characterizes\nit. Fitzralph's expression of the Augustinian papal position makes\ngrace the deciding factor in ownership relations and ultimately in\npolitical authority, both of which had become nested in the term\ndominium. Wyclif's interpretation of the Augustinian position\nwould stretch past arguments about papal authority and the friars,\neven past arguments between popes and kings, to stir the very nature\nof the church as Christ's earthly body. All of this begins, he would\nargue, with an understanding of God's dominium as the causal\nexemplar of created lordship.   \n\nThe relation of universal to particular defines Wyclif's conception of\nhow God's dominium causes all instances of dominium\nin creation. Divine dominium is “the standard prior to and\npresupposition of all other dominium; if a creature has\ndominium over anything, God already has dominium\nover it, so any created dominium follows upon divine\ndominium” (De Dominio Divino I, ch. 3,\np.16.18–22). This relation exceeds mere exemplarity, where human\ndominium only imitates God's dominium without divine\ncausal determination. God's dominium has causal efficacy over\nall instances of human mastery such that no true created\ndominium is possible without direct participation in and\nconstant reliance upon God's dominium. The instrument through\nwhich divine dominium moves is grace, which instills in human\nrulers an essential love defining their every ruling action. Thus,\nevery case of just human dominium entails a constant reliance\nupon grace as the hallmark of its being an instantiation of God's\nuniversal dominium.   \n\nGod's dominium has six aspects, three identifiable with\nlordship's ruling element (creation, sustenance, and governance), and\nthree that define lordship's proprietary nature (giving, receiving,\nand lending) (De Dominio Divino III, ch. 1,\n p.198.9).7\n The necessary precondition for an act of dominium is\ncreation, of which no created being is capable. This makes God's\ndominium the only true instance of dominium and the\nsource of all created instances of dominium. Because the\nDivine Ideas and their created correlates, the universals, are\nontologically prior to particular created beings, God's\ndominium over universals is prior to His dominium\nover particulars. This means that God creates, sustains, and governs\nthe human species prior to ruling over — and knowing —\nindividual people. This led to questions about determinism that served\nas a starting point for many refutations of Wyclif's theology.   \n\nThe second set of acts that define dominium — giving,\nreceiving, and lending — provides the foundation for Wyclif's\nargument that all created dominium necessarily requires\ngrace. God's giving of the divine essence in creating is the truest\nform of giving because God is giving of Himself through Himself, which\nno created being can do. Nor can any created being receive as God\nreceives; God truly receives only from Himself through His giving. God\ngives up nothing in His giving, and acquires nothing in His receiving;\ncreation is God's self-expression, an act in which the divine essence\nis neither decreased nor increased. The crucial act from the created\nstandpoint is God's lending, for here there is real interaction\nbetween Lord and subjects. What human beings as conscious participants\nin God's lending relation can claim as their own is lent to them by\ndivine authority, which they enjoy through grace.   \n\nIt is easy to confuse giving with lending because a lord who has only\nbeen “lent” a gift of God for use during his lifetime appears to have\nbeen “given” that gift. God's giving is communicative, not\ntranslative. For us, most giving is translative in that it involves\nthe giver's surrender of every connection to the gift, making it\nnatural for us to suppose that God renounces His authority over what\nHe gives us. In fact, God's giving is communicative, which does not\ninvolve surrender of the gift. Because all that God gives to creation\nwill ultimately return to Him, it makes more sense to speak of God's\ngiving as lending.  With any instance of lending, Wyclif explains, the lender seeks\nassurance that the borrower truly deserves what is to be lent. Human\ndesert of the dominium they are lent is a matter of some\ncomplexity involving examination of the theological concept of grace.\nWhen a temporal lord lends his subject according to the subject's\nworthiness, the subject's merit is commensurable with the lord's, and\nthe mutual agreement defining the loan can be made according to the\nrespective merit of each party. The merit that allows the subject\ndesert of consideration for the loan is “condigna”, i.e.,\ngrounded in the dignitas shared by lender and\nsubject. Condign merit implies that the meritorious truly deserve the\nreward, requiring the giver to give it to the merited as something\ndue, as when an olympic athelete earns a gold medal by besting all her\nopponents.  Such a loan is impossible between Creator and creature,\nbecause there is no way of placing a creature's merit on the same\nscale as God's perfect nature; all the creature has, including its\nworth, is from God, whereas God's perfection is per se.  There is no\nway in which a creature can be considered to deserve anything from God\nin such a relation.  Congruent merit obtains when the meritorious does\nnot have the power to require anything of the giver. In instances of\ncongruent merit, the goodness of the act does not require the giver to\nreward the agent, though it does provide sufficient cause for the\nreward to be given, as when one receives an Academy Award: although\nmany of the audience members may deserve an Oscar, the winner receives\nit because something about her performance is somehow pleasing to the\nAcademy. Still, Wyclif holds that “It is the invariable law of God\nthat nobody is awarded blessedness unless they first deserve it”\n(De Dominio Divino III, ch. 4, p.229.18). We can move our\nwills to the good, and from this, Wyclif says, grace may — but need\nnot — follow. Thus, we merit congruently thanks to God's generosity\ntowards a will in accord with His own. In effect, God lends merit. \n\nWyclif's theology of grace is the key to understanding how his theory\nof human dominium relates to divine dominium, its\ncausal paradigm. Man's lordship is at once ownership and jurisdictive\nmastery, but when a human lord governs, or gives, or receives, or\nlends, these acts are only just insofar as the lord recognizes that\nhis authority is that of a steward: “Any rational creature is only\nimproperly called a lord, and is rather a minister or steward of the\nsupreme Lord, and whatever he has to distribute, he has purely by\ngrace” ([De Dominio Divino III, ch. 6, p.250.25–29). The\nessential characteristic of every instance of human dominium\nis the grace God lends to the individual lord, which itself is\ngrounded in the grace of the Holy Spirit. The human lord appears to\nhave proprietary and juristictive authority by virtue of his own\nexcellence, but this is really only an instantiation of divine\ndominium, a grace-realized agent of God's lordship. This\nmakes the human lord both master and servant; from the divine\nperspective, the lord is God's servant, but from the viewpoint of the\nsubject, he is master. Wyclif is tireless in his emphasis on the\nillusory nature of this mastery; grace allows the human lord to\nrecognize that he is, in fact, the servant of his subjects,\nministering to them as a nurturing steward, not lording over them as\nwould a powerful sovereign.   \n\nDe Civili Dominio begins with the motto, “Civil justice\npresupposes divine justice; civil dominium presupposes\nnatural dominium.” Man's dominium is threefold —\nnatural, civil, and evangelical — but comprehensible as an\ninstantiation of the justice of God's dominium. As he moved\ninto his general analysis of human dominium, Wyclif's\nthoughts turned to the most fundamental instance of God's loving\ngovernance, the Scriptural commandments. The foundation of all that is\nright (ius) in creation, he explains, is divine justice\n(iustitia), so we cannot begin to understand right and wrong\nin creation without understanding God's uncreated right. This was a\nsignificant departure from the Aristotelian position that unaided\nhuman reason is capable of justice, and Wyclif explicitly rejects any\nconception of justice that does not rely on uncreated\n right.[8]\n The laws of Scripture are the purest expression of uncreated right\navailable to human eyes, he explains, and are most clearly expressed\nin the Ten Commandments of Exodus 20, and again in the two greatest\ncommandments of Matthew 22: 37–40. Wyclif's analysis of Christ's law\nof love and of the Ten Commandments proceeds directly from his\ndisquisition on the relation of earthly justice to eternal right in\nDe Mandatis Divinis. That Wyclif uses the same title\n Robert Grosseteste\n had used in his analysis of the decalogue is no accident; Wyclif's\ndebt to Grosseteste's conceptions of sin, love of God, idolatry, and\nthe substance of true faith is obvious throughout the treatise. In\nDe Statu Innocencie, the innocence into which we were created\nbefore the Fall, he says, is the optimal condition for any rational\nbeing. In our prelapsarian state, our wills would have been in perfect\nconcord with the divine will, so that all human action would be just,\neffortlessly aligned with the natural order of creation. In this\ncondition, there would be no need for civil or criminal law, since we\nunderstood what is right naturally. \n\nThis denial of the need for human law is of special import, for Wyclif\nlater argues that the evangelical lord, or priest, as heir of Christ's\nrestoration of the possibility of natural dominium, should\nnever be concerned with such matters. In such a state, private\nproperty ownership was unknown. The natural dominium\ndescribed in Genesis 1:26 is characterized by lack of selfishness,\nownership, or any distinction between 'mine' and 'thine'. The true\nsense of Augustine's “All things belong to the just” is most fully\napparent in the prelapsarian natural disposition to share in the use\nof creation while acting as faithful steward to its perfect lord. The\nFall was brought about by the first sin, which Wyclif characterizes as\na privation of God's right in man's soul. We are left with wills prone\nto value the physical, material world above spiritual concerns, and\nthe unavoidable result is private property ownership. We no longer\nunderstand a given created good as a gift on loan from God, but can\nonly see it in terms of our own self-interest, and the unfortunate\nresult is civil dominium, an enslavement to material goods.\n \n\nWyclif's definition of civil dominium as “proprietary\nlordship in a viator over the goods of fortune fully\naccording to human law” is centered not on legislative authority, but\non the private property ownership enjoyed by the viator, or\nwayfarer, along life's path (De Civili Dominio III ch. 11,\n p.178.9–17).[9]\n This is because all civil dominium is based on the use of\ngoods owned, which is the basis for all postlapsarian conceptions of\njustice (recall that for Wyclif, only God truly owns created things\nbecause creating a thing is necessary for owning it; hence, human\nbeings are only lent created things and can use them justly, or\nunjustly in case they appropriate them for themselves). Before the\nFall, our use of created goods was communal, unencumbered by the\ncomplexity that follows upon selfishness.  But now, Wyclif explains,\nthere are three types of use: that directly consequent upon civil\nownership, civil use without ownership, and evangelical use. The first\ntwo are natural results of the Fall, and the third is the result of\nChrist's Incarnation. Before the Incarnation, civil ownership and\ncivil use were grounded in man-made laws designed primarily to\nregulate property ownership. These legal systems tended to have two\ngeneral structures: they were either monarchies, as in most cases, or\nelse they were aristocratic polities. The harmony of the aristocratic\npolity is certainly preferable because it most resembles the state\nenjoyed before the Fall; the benevolent aristocracy, as evidenced in\nthe time of the Biblical judges, would foster the contemplative life,\ncommunalism, and an absence of corruptible governmental apparatus.\n \n\nThe most common species of civil dominium is monarchy, in\nwhich a chief executive power holds ultimate legislative\nauthority. This centralized authority in one man is necessary to\nimplement order; there is no real possibility that the many are\ncapable of ruling on behalf of the many, given the prevalence of\nsin. The point of civil dominium is not, as with\n Aristotle,\n the sustenance of individual virtuous activity. Civil\ndominium is a phenomenon based on Original Sin, and is\ntherefore unlikely to produce justice per se. If the government of\nCaesar is occasionally just, it is because it has accidentally\nrealized divine justice. But if civil dominium that is not\ngrounded directly in divine dominium is incapable of\nsustained just governance, and if natural dominium is the\ninstantiation of divine dominium for which man was created,\nhow can any talk of just civil dominium be possible? To\nreturn to the opening dictum of De Civili Dominio, if natural\ndominium is free from private property ownership, how can\ncivil dominium rely upon it in any way?  \n\nBefore resolving this problem, we will need to address evangelical\ndominium as yet another factor in Wyclif's conception of\nman's postlapsarian state.   \n\nChrist restores the possibility of gaining our lost natural\ndominium both through His apostolic poverty and His\nredemptive sacrifice as described in Holy Scripture. Because of\nChrist's sinless nature, He was the first man since Adam capable of\nexhibiting the purity of natural dominium. This Christ shared\nwith His disciples, who were able to renounce all exclusive claims to\ncreated goods in a recreation of the communal caritas lost in\nthe Fall (De Civili Dominio III, 4, p. 51.17–24). This\npoverty is not simply the state of not owning things; one can live\nsinfully as easily in squalor as one can in luxury. The apostolic\npoverty of the early Church is a spiritual state, not an economic\nrejection of civil dominium. The similarity between Wyclif's\nconception of spiritual poverty as the ideal state for Christians and\nthe Franciscan ideal is noteworthy. Wyclif seems to make a case\nsimilar to the Spiritual Franciscans: Christ's life was exemplary for\nall Christians and Christ lived in apostolic poverty; therefore, all\nChristians ought follow His example, or at the least have that option\nopen to them. Wyclif's consonance with the Franciscan tradition is\nalso suggested in his use of\n Bonaventure's\n definition of apostolic poverty in the third book of De Civili\nDominio, but Wyclif's motives are distinctly different from the\nFriars' (De Civili Dominio III, 8, pp. 119–120). While the\nFranciscans argued that their rule allowed them to regain the\nownership-free purity enjoyed by the early Apostolic church, Wyclif\ncontended that Christ's redemptive sacrifice enabled all Christians to\nregain natural dominium itself, not just its purity. This\nsuggested that the Franciscan life was a pale imitation of true\nChristianity, which Wyclif's Franciscan colleagues were quick to point\nout. One of the first critics of Wyclif's dominium thought\nwas William Woodford, O.F.M., who argued that Wyclif had gone too far\nin equating apostolic, spiritual poverty with prelapsarian purity. The\nextensive third book of De Civili Dominio is Wyclif's\nresponse to Franciscan critics like Woodford, and in which lie the\nseeds of the antifraternalism that would characterize his later\nwritings.   \n\nWyclif describes apostolic poverty as a mode of having with love,\ncomprehensible in terms of the individual's use of a thing for the\ngreatest spiritual benefit. God alone can bring about the love\ninstantiating divine dominium, making grace necessary for\napostolic poverty. Because the church is founded not on the\nmaterially-based laws of man, but on the spiritually-grounded lex\nChristi, it must be absolutely free of property ownership, the\nbetter to realize the spiritual purity required by apostolic\npoverty. Any material riches that the church comes upon as “goods of\nfortune” must be distributed as alms for the poor, following the\npractice of Christ and the disciples, and the apostolic church. This\nis the ideal to which the Church must aspire through the example of\nChrist, and some of the harshest invective in Wyclif's prose is\ndirected against the Church's refusal to return to this apostolic\nstate. The turning point in Church history was the Donation of\nConstantine, on the basis of which the Church claimed to have the\ncivil dominium of a Caesar. Wyclif was vigorous in his\ncondemnation of the Donation, and would likely have been pleased had\nhe lived into the early fifteenth century, when\n Nicholas of Cusa\n argued persuasively that the document was a ninth-century forgery.\n \n\nGiven the deleterious influence civil dominium has had on the\nevangelical dominium of Christ's law, it is difficult to\nimagine how Wyclif would set aside some civil lords as capable of\ninstantiating divine justice. But apostolic poverty is not identical\nwith an absence of property ownership; it is having with love. While\nthe clergy as spiritual lords ought to follow Christ's example of\nmaterial poverty, it does not follow that all ownership precludes\nlove. God can certainly bestow grace on those whom He wills to be\nstewards of created goods. Wyclif envisions the just civil lord or\nking as the means by which the Church is relieved of its accumulated\nburden of property ownership. So long as the Church exists in\npostlapsarian society, it must be protected from thieves, heresy, and\ninfidels. Certainly no evangelical lord ought to be concerned with\nsuch matters, given their higher responsibility for the welfare of\nChristian souls. As a result, the Church needs a guardian to ward off\nenemies while caring for its own weel-being and administering alms to\nthe poor. This allows Wyclif to describe just, grace-favored civil\ndominium as different in kind from the civil lordship\npredicated on materialistic human concerns: “It is right for God to\nhave two vicars in His church, namely a king in temporal affairs, and\na priest in spiritual. The king should strongly check rebellion, as\ndid God in the Old Testament, while priests ought minister the\nprecepts mildly, as did Christ, who was at once priest and king.” When\nhe raises conventional topics in political thought, like the\nparticulars of just rule, the responsibilities of royal councillors to\ntheir king, the nature of just war, and royal jurisdiction in\ncommerce, his advice is priestly: “[A] lord ought not treat his\nsubjects in a way other than he would rationally wish to be treated in\nsimilar circumstances; the Christian lord should not desire subjects\nfor love of dominating, but for the correction and spiritual\nimprovement of his subjects, and so to the efficacy of the church”\n(De Officio Regis ch. 1, p. 13.4–8). The king ought provide\nfew and just laws wisely and accurately administered, and live subject\nto these laws, since just law is more necessary for the community than\nthe king. Also, the king should strive to protect the lower classes'\nclaims on temporal goods in the interests of social order, for\n“nothing is more destructive in a kingdom in its political life than\nimmoderately to deprive the lower classes of the goods of fortune”\n(De Officio Regis ch. 5, p.\n 96.9–27).[10]\n On occasion he discusses the king's need of reliable councillors,\ngenerally when discussing the king's need for sacerdotal advice in\ndirecting church reform, but he never mentions Parliament as a\nsignificant aspect of civil rule.   \n\nThe most immediate concern of a civil lord living in an age when the\nChurch is being poisoned by avarice should be the radical divestment\nof all ecclesiastical ownership. Wyclif is tireless in arguing for the\nking's right to take all land and goods, and indeed, even the\nbuildings themselves, away from the Church. Should the clergy protest\nagainst royal divestment, threatening the king with excommunication or\ninterdict, the king should proceed as a physician applies his lancet\nto an infected boil. No grace-favored civil lord will be disposed to\nsave up the divested goods of the Church for his own enrichment,\ndespite the obvious temptation. He will distribute the Church's\nill-gotten lands and goods to the people. This, Wyclif explains, will\nbe his continued responsibility even after the Church has been purged,\nfor he is the Church's custodian as well as its protector.   \n\nThe hereditary succession by which civil lordship passes from father\nto son is a problem for Wyclif. People cannot inherit the grace needed\nto ensure just ownership and jurisdiction. Primogeniture imperils\ngrace-founded civil lordship, making lords prone to rule on behalf of\ntheir own familial interests rather than in the interests of their\nsubjects. The only means by which Wyclif can envision hereditary\nsuccession operating is through spiritual filiation, in which a civil\nlord instructs a worthy successor. He suggests adoption as the basis\nfor the spiritual primogeniture by which lordship is passed on, which\nwould be preferable to general election, for Wyclif is clear about the\nimpossibility of widespread recognition of grace in a potential civil\nlord: “It does not follow, if all the people want Peter to be their\ncivil lord, that therefore it is just” (De Civili Dominio I,\n18, p. 130.6). Central to his ecclesiology is the impossibility of\ndetermining the presence of grace in another's soul, which militates\nagainst identifying members of the elect with certainty, and therefore\nagainst excommunicating any of them from the Church, as well as ruling\nout popular election as a means of instituting just civil\ndominium.  Grants in perpetuity, commonly employed by civil\nlords to guarantee the ongoing obligation of subjects in return for a\ngift of land or political authority, are as impossible as hereditary\ninheritance. A lord might reward someone with a grant while acting as\nGod's steward, but he certainly cannot thereby make his subject's\nprogeny deserve the gift.   \n\nHistory is rich with examples of kings who, wittingly or unwittingly,\nlose sight of their ministerial position and wield secular authority\nin their own interests, cruelly using the land and church for their\nown gain. Such tyrants cause Wyclif some problems, for in many cases\nit is difficult for the subjects to determine whether their lord is\nacting viciously as a crowned brigand, or sternly, as a physician\npurging a patient. For the same reason that Wyclif denies the\nsuitability of popular elections, he is cautious regarding tyranny: it\nis impossible for human minds to gauge the absence of grace in\nanother. What may look like cruel persecution of a subject may in fact\nbe just punishment, while what may appear to be benign, permissive\nrule may in fact be the lassitude of misrule. Certainly no priest is\nin a position to assess the justice of a civil lord, given his\ndedication to apostolic ideals foreign to civil dominium. In\nsome cases, Wyclif advises that one must suffer tyrannical rule as a\ndivine punishment, particularly when a king deprives His subjects of\nmaterial wealth. In other cases, especially when a civil lord fosters\necclesiastical decay by not persecuting heretics or regulating the\nChurch's goods, Wyclif suggests that resistance to tyranny may be\njustifiable: better to focus on the greater danger of priestly\ntyranny; after all, a tyrannical civil lord can only do damage to\none's material well-being, but a tyrannical priest can endanger one's\neternal soul. The guardian against priestly tyranny must be the civil\nlord, whose responsibility to the Church requires him to monitor the\nclergy's execution of its spiritual duties. Those who argue that a\ncivil lord has no business interfering with spiritual concerns\noverlook the fundamental relation holding between just civil law and\ndivine law: because the civil lord's responsibility is to God, his\nfirst concern must be to ensure that nothing will impede obedience to\ndivine law. The canon law that has built up over the centuries like\nbarnacles on a ship's hull is held up as the means by which the Church\nregulates spiritual affairs, but this, Wyclif explains, is a\nsuperfluous creation of priests, ultimately hindering the Church by\nintroducing material structure to what should be a purely spiritual\nenterprise.   \n\nThe king uses bishops, an office justly instituted by the early\nchurch, to monitor the spiritual offices of priests to counteract\nproblems like simony, pluralism, absenteeism, and heresy. These\nbishops ought also to act as royal theological advisors, helping the\ncivil lord to understand how Christ's law is best implemented in his\nown legislation. Just as a civil lord is God's steward and a servant\nto his subjects, a bishop is not superior to the laity or the priests,\nbut a steward whose responsibility is to God and the divine law, which\nordains subservience to the grace-favored civil lord. Wyclif continued\nto argue for the centrality of episcopal office throughout his life,\ndespite his own troubles with the Bishop of London and the Archbishop\nof Canterbury.  "}]
