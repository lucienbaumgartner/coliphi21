Though the dispute is multi-faceted, it centers on\ndisagreement concerning the interpretation of Kant’s conception\nof the contribution made by the higher cognitive faculties (or the\n“intellect” in the broadest sense of that term) to a\nsubject’s sensory apprehension of the world around it. The\nstatus of Kant’s distinction has been repeatedly questioned. In\nthe immediate reception of Kant’s critical philosophy, major\nworks by figures such as Solomon Maimon (Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, 1790) and G.W.F. Hegel (Faith and Knowledge,\n1802) criticized the coherence of construing sensibility and intellect\nas independent faculties. The issue has also seen significant\ndiscussion in the latter half of the twentieth-century by Anglophone\nphilosophers such as P.F. Strawson, Wilfrid Sellars, and John\nMcDowell. Their work takes up Kant’s distinction between\nintuition and concept as an important vehicle for asking and answering\nquestions regarding the relation between thought and reality. Such\nquestions include both the issue of how thought could be so much as\nabout an objective reality (Strawson 1959: ch. 2; McDowell\n1994a; Ginsborg 2006b), and the issue of how sense experiences caused\nby a subject’s environment could have a normative, rather than\nmerely causal, significance for the subject’s thinking (Sellars\n1968; McDowell 1994b).\n\n\nHence, the debate over the relation between intuition and concept is\nof significant historical and philosophical interest for at least two\nreasons. First, because it promises to provide answers to central\nquestions in Kant’s conception of experience, such as those\nconcerning the acquisition of the content of thought and the\nwarrant for holding such thoughts as true. Second, because it\nserves as proxy for a related, and perhaps even more fundamental,\ndispute concerning Kant’s conception of the nature of\nrationality and its manifestation in animal life, particularly insofar\nas rationality is conceived as requiring sensitivity to norms or\nreasons as such (McDowell 2009, 2010; Korsgaard 2011: §6).\n\n\nDespite, and perhaps because of, the foundational nature of the\ninterpretive and philosophical issues involved here, a significant\nnumber of the interpretive issues regarding Kant’s view turn\nsimply on the way in which the dispute is framed. Indeed, much of the\ngood work in the last twenty-five years or so concerning the relation\nbetween intuition and concept has served largely to clarify the terms\nand fundamental points at issue between disputants. To that end, this\nentry surveys both the basic framing assumptions of the dispute\n(§§1–4) and various loci of disagreement within it\n(§5).\n\nOne of the goals of Kant’s critical philosophy is to articulate\nthe conditions of the possibility of what he calls\n“experience” (Erfahrung). As we’ll see\nbelow, Kant’s use of the term is rather more technical than is\ntypically meant in English by talk of, e.g., a subject’s\n“experience” of the color red. Indeed, Kant sometimes\nspeaks of there being only a single or universal experience (A110,\nA493/B521), which at least strongly suggests that he is not construing\nexperience in a purely subjective or phenomenological manner. Rather,\nin talking of the conditions of “experience” in this way,\nKant is most obviously concerned with the conditions under which\nobjective empirical knowledge is possible—including knowledge\nthat Kant’s thinks we actually have, such as is exemplified in\nthe sciences of mathematics and physics. Kant’s hope is that by\narticulating the conditions under which such knowledge is possible, he\nwill be able to indicate how it is that metaphysics itself could\nbecome a science. He pursues this goal via an examination of those\nfeatures of the mind relevant to the conditions of\n“experience” so construed. This amounts to an examination\nof the conditions for “cognition” (Erkenntnis),\nor the mind’s “relation to an object” (B137). There\nis some controversy about the best way to understand Kant’s use\nof this phrase, but for the moment we’ll understand it as\ninvolving relation to a possible object of experience, and as being a\nnecessary condition for the positive substantive knowledge\n(Wissen) characteristic of a proper science (i.e., a\nWissenschaft). \nAt the most basic explanatory level, Kant conceives of the mind as\nconstituted by two fundamental capacities (Fähigkeiten),\nor powers, which he labels “receptivity”\n(Receptivität) and “spontaneity”\n(Spontaneität). Receptivity, as the name suggests,\nconstitutes the mind’s capacity to be affected, whether by\nitself (i.e., one “part” or capacity of the mind affecting\nanother) or something else (i.e., something distinct from the mind).\nFor Kant, any exercise of the mind’s receptive power essentially\nrequires some external prompting in order to engage in the production\nof representations. In contrast, the power of spontaneity needs no\nsuch prompting. It is able to initiate its activity from itself,\nwithout any external influence. \nKant thus construes all mental activity either in terms of its\nresulting from affection (receptivity) or from the mind’s\nself-prompted activity (spontaneity). From these two very general\naspects of the mind Kant then derives three basic cognitive faculties\n(Vermögen), termed by Kant “sensibility”\n(Sinnlichkeit), “understanding”\n(Verstand), and “reason” (Vernunft).\nThese faculties characterize specific cognitive powers, none of which\nis reducible to any of the others, and to each of which is assigned a\nparticular cognitive task and a specific kind of characteristic\nrepresentational output. In the case of sensibility the characteristic\nrepresentations are sensation (Empfindung) and intuition\n(Anschauung). In the case of the understanding and reason (or\nthe ‘intellect’ more broadly), concepts\n(Begriffe), judgment (Urteil), and inference\n(Schluß). \nKant characterizes intuition in terms of two basic\ncharacteristics—viz. immediacy (Unmittelbarkeit) and\nparticularity (Einzelheit) (cf. A19/B33, A68/B93; JL 9:91).\nThis is in contrast to the mediacy and generality\n(Allgemeinheit) characteristic of conceptual representation\n(A68/B93; JL 9:91). Kant’s distinction between these two sorts\nof representation might at first pass be taken as a kind of\nphenomenological distinction between how things seem to a perceiving\nsubject independently of thought about what is so experienced, and\nthis is indeed how at least some interpreters have construed Kant\n(e.g., Prichard 1909; Russell 1913; Broad 1978; Parsons 1992b).\nHowever, as others have noted (e.g., Paton 1936: 98), Kant’s\nmethod for distinguishing the various contributions made by our\ncognitive faculties proceeds not by appeal to phenomenology but rather\nphilosophical abstraction (e.g., A20-1/B34-5). Moreover, Kant at least\nsometimes seems to deny that a representation (or its content) could\nbe present to consciousness at all—i.e., be something\n“for” the subject—without conceptualization (e.g.,\nA116-17, B132). Hence Kant seems concerned not so much with the\nphenomenology of conceptual vs. non-conceptual experience as he is\nwith the role sense experience plays in facilitating cognition and\nknowledge. \nIn discursive rational beings such as ourselves, intuition and concept\ncooperate in the generation of what Kant calls\n“cognition”. Kant employs the term “cognition”\n(Erkenntnis) in different ways (Smit 2000, 2009; Schafer\nforthcoming-a, forthcoming-b; Gomes and Stephenson 2016; Tolley 2017; Willaschek and\nWatkins 2017; Watkins and Willaschek 2017b). In the\n‘Stepladder’ passage from the first Critique Kant\nprovides a very general definition of cognition as a conscious\nrepresentation of an object (A320/B376; see also JL 9:91). In this\nsense both intuitions and concepts may be cognitions. Kant also has a\nnarrower sense of cognition “in the proper sense”\n(A78/B103), which in finite discursive beings like us concerns only\nthose states that are the outcome of a synthesis of concepts and an\nintuited manifold. Proper cognition satisfies three conditions: (i)\nconsciousness; (ii) “agreement”\n(Übereinstimmung) or truth-aptness; (iii) real\npossibility. The consciousness condition is clearly stated in\nKant’s “Stepladder” passage. Cognition must be a\nconscious relation to an object. Kant indicates the\n“agreement” or “conformity”\n(Übereinstimmung) of a cognition with its object in his\ndiscussion of truth in the first Critique. He says that the\n“nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of\ncognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed”\n(A58/B82). Since Kant allows for false cognition, his view must be\nthat representations that are cognitions are such as to be\nable to agree or conform with their objects, and Kant construes\nsuch agreement as truth. Kant regards judgment (i.e., a specific sort\nof non-associative unity of concepts) as the bearer of truth, while\ndenying that intuition is the sort of thing that can be true or false\n(see Heis 2013: 277–8; McLear 2016b). Finally, Kant construes\ncognition as always needing to be of a really—i.e.,\nmetaphysically—possible subject matter. As Kant states in a\nfamous footnote in the B-preface of the first Critique: \nTo cognize an object, it is required that I be able to prove\nits possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its\nactuality or a priori through reason). (Bxxvin.) \nProper cognition may be pure, as when synthesizing a manifold of pure\nintuition (e.g., the pure intuition of space or time) with a concept\n(e.g., the concept of space as discussed in the Metaphysical\nExposition of Space in the Transcendental Aesthetic). Proper cognition\nmay also be empirical, as when synthesizing an empirical intuition\n(e.g., of touch or vision) with a concept. Kant often describes\nempirical cognition as “experience” (Erfahrung;\nsee, e.g., B166, A176/B218, A189/B234), though empirical intuition and\nconcepts are also related in what Kant calls “perception”\n(Wahrnehmung). \nKant takes the terms “intuition” (Anschauung),\n“perception” (Wahrnehmung), and\n“experience” (Erfahrung) to designate different\nthings (McLear 2014b: 771–772; Allais 2016: 2–5; Tolley\n2016a: 86–91, 2017, 2019). For example, in the headings to the\nfirst three chapters of the Principles of the first Critique\nKant distinguishes between the “Axioms of Intuition,” the\n“Anticipations of Perception,” and the “Analogies of\nExperience.” If Kant weren’t thinking that the terms\n“intuition”, “perception”, and\n“experience” designated distinct mental states, then it\nwould be difficult to understand why he ordered a central part of his\narchitectonic around them. All three are forms of representation of\nobjects. Insofar as each is a conscious representations of an object\nthey are all forms of “cognition” in the broad (though not\nnecessarily the “proper”) sense of that term. Let’s\nlook at each representational kind in a bit more detail. \nIntuition is a relation to an “undetermined”\n(unbestimmt) object or an “appearance”\n(Erscheinung). Kant uses this phrase to characterize the\nobject of intuition both in the opening of the Transcendental\nAesthetic (A20/B34) in the first Critique, and in later\ndiscussion in both the Analytic (A69/B94, B154, B163, A141/B180, B309)\nand the Dialectic (A310/B367, B422n, A443/B471, A718/B746)). Though\ninterpretation of these texts is controversial, the sense in which the\nobject of intuition is “undetermined” seems to\nspecifically involve its lack of conceptual determination,\neither explicitly in judgment (see, e.g., A69/B94) or via a rule of\n“figurative” synthesis that guides the imagination (e.g.,\nA141/B180). \nPerception, like intuition, is also sometimes described as\nrepresentation of an undetermined object (e.g., B422n). However,\nperception also involves a consciousness of the “manifold”\nor “content” (Inhalt; more on this notion of\n“content” below) of the intuition (A99, A119–20,\nB160, B162, B202–3; Pr 4:300). What Kant means by this is not\nentirely obvious. However, Kant is clear that perception necessarily\nrequires the activity of the imagination in combining together the\ncontent of the intuition into what Kant calls an “image”\n(Bild), which yields or constitutes consciousness of the\ncontent of intuition itself (A120, B160; see Sellars 1978; Young 1988;\nAllison 2015: 254–264; Matherne 2015; Tolley 2017, 2019). Kant\nalso indicates that in perception the “mathematical”\ncategories of quality and quantity are employed, though not the\nrelational or modal categories, which are constitutive of experience\nonly (A161-2/B201; see Allison 2015: 414–426). \nFinally, “experience” (Erfahrung) involves the\ncombination or “synthesis” of these perceptions\n(Wahrnehmungen) by the categories, particularly the\ncategories of relation (i.e., substance, cause, community). As Kant\nputs it, “experience is cognition through connected perceptions\n(durch verknüpfte Wahrnehmungen)” (B161; cf. B218;\nPr 4:300). Experience is thus the most cognitively demanding and\nsophisticated form of having a cognitive relation to an object. \nGiven these distinctions we’ll next look at how to understand\nthe proper locus of debate concerning the intellect’s\ncontribution to sense experience. \nWhen inquiring about the nature of the relationship between the\nintellect and sense experience it is important to keep in mind the\ntechnical sense with which Kant uses various terms, as introduced\nabove. There are at least two reasons for doing so. First, to be as\nclear as we can regarding Kant’s understanding of his own\ntheory. Second, to avoid confusion regarding the relation between\nKant’s conception of such terms and our modern Anglophone\ntradition of use. This latter issue is especially significant since it\nis not at all clear that Kant’s conception of\n“experience” admits of straightforward translation into\nour modern notion. For example, Kant is clear that\n“experience,” in his sense of an “empirical\ncognition” (empirische Erkenntnis), includes conceptual\nsynthesis, since such synthesis is what binds the various elements of\nan empirical cognition together such that they are non-arbitrarily\nconnected (see, e.g., B12, B161, B201, B218, and B233). As a result,\nall should concede that his usage of “experience”\n(Erfahrung) and “empirical cognition”\n(empirische Erkenntnis) typically is meant in a way that\nassumes a cognitive contribution in the form of conceptual synthesis\nby the understanding (Allais 2016: 4). Thus, and rather confusingly,\nif there is a debate to be had concerning Kant’s view of the\nconceptual or intellectual character of “experience” in\nits contemporary English sense of a kind of phenomenally conscious\nstate, it may well be located at somewhere other than the level of\n“experience” in Kant’s technical sense (though for\nworries about our contemporary philosophical usage of\n“experience” see Byrne 2009). \nMore controversial is the issue of whether “perception”\n(Wahrnehmung) in Kant’s technical sense constitutively\ninvolves concepts or otherwise depends on conceptual synthesis. There\nis at least some evidence for thinking it does. For example, Kant says\nin the second version of the Transcendental Deduction, that “all\nsynthesis, through which even perception itself becomes possible,\nstands under the categories” (B161). It may be that Kant’s\nuse of “perception” (Wahrnehmung) here is largely\nin line with preceding German usage (e.g., in Wolff, Baumgarten,\nMeier, and Tetens) to mean the becoming conscious of a sensory\nrepresentation in the mind (alternatively, becoming conscious of that\nwhich is presented via such representation), rather than either the\nmere occurrence of such a representation, or the occurrence of a\njudgment concerning the representation (Tolley 2016b, 2017). In this\nway perception, as empirical consciousness of a representation (or\nwhat is presented through it; B207) is intermediate between the mere\noccurrence of an intuition in a subject’s mind and experience or\nempirical cognition, which Kant describes as involving judgment.\nKant’s claim concerning perception in the Deduction could then\nbe read as a claim concerning how categorial synthesis is necessary\nfor empirical consciousness (perception) of the objects that are given\nto the mind in intuition, prior to making any judgment (in experience)\nconcerning those objects. \nHowever, Kant’s position concerning perception, understood in\nterms of conscious sensory representation, is complicated by various\nremarks he makes concerning non-human animal (hereafter\n“animal”) consciousness. For example, in various\ndescriptions of the “ladder” of cognition in the logic\nlectures, Kant allows that animals have representations with\nconsciousness and consciously discriminate between objects on that\nbasis. Moreover, Kant allows for such representational capacities in\nanimals even though, lacking an intellect, animals thereby fail to\nhave any capacity for cognition (at least in its narrow sense),\nunderstanding, or comprehension (Jäsche Logik\n9:64–5; see also Dohna-Wundlacken Logik (c. 1792)\n24:730–1; Wiener Logik (1780) 24:846; Blomberg\nLogik (c. 1771) 24:132-3, 134–5, 136). Kant also says of\nanimals that they may be conscious of individual representations,\nwhile lacking any consciousness of the “unity” of those\nrepresentations (letter to Herz, 26 May 1789, C 11:52). Such texts\nsuggest that animals are conscious of their representations but lack\nany self-consciousness with respect to those representations\n(Paton 1936: 332–5; Naragon 1990; Ameriks 2000: ch. 7; Allais\n2009; McLear 2011; Tolley 2016a; Golob forthcoming). Moreover,\nKant’s description of consciousness as necessary for making\ndistinctions, and as coming in degrees (B414-15), also suggests that\nanimals must be conscious of their representations to a degree\nsufficient for explaining how they make the distinctions between\nobjects in their environment that they obviously do. However,\ninterpreting these texts, and the significance of Kant’s remarks\non animals, remains contested (Kemp Smith 2003: lii–liv;\nGrüne 2014b: §2; Fisher 2017; Land 2018; Leland 2018a,b;;\nCallanan forthcoming). Thus it remains contested as to whether\nperception, in Kant’s sense, is possible without intellectual\ncapacities involving conceptual representation. \nIf there is some question whether perception is possible without an\nintellect and conceptual capacities, the issue is even more fraught\nwith respect to intuition, and this is indeed where much of the\ncontemporary discussion has focused (e.g., Sellars 1968: ch. 1;\nMcDowell 1996; Hanna 2001: ch. 4; Hanna 2005; Ginsborg 2008; Allais\n2009; Grüne 2009; Friedman 2012; Tolley 2013; McLear 2015).\nMoreover, since intuition is the most basic object-related\nrepresentation, if Kant construes intuition as inextricably linked\nwith conceptual representation then he would clearly also be committed\nto thinking so of perception and experience. Conversely, however, if\nKant denies any intrinsic connection between intuition and\nconceptualization he is nevertheless free to argue that conceptual\ncapacities play an important role at the level of perception or\nexperience. \nIn what follows this entry assumes that intuition and its faculty of\nsensibility is the relevant locus of debate. It also assumes that\nKant’s notion of intuition has some correlation with our\ncontemporary conception of what is described by the English term\n“experience”, though this entry will largely leave the\nnature of that connection open in what follows. Given this locus of\ndiscussion, the next section examines two frameworks within which to\nthink about the dependence of intuition on conceptualization. \nThe reception of Kant’s philosophy in the latter half of the\ntwentieth century (e.g., Sellars 1968; McDowell 1996; Hanna 2005;\nGinsborg 2006b; Haag 2007; Allais 2009) typically presents him as\neither accepting or rejecting the view that experience has\n“conceptual content.” One way to frame this dispute is in\nterms of the acceptance or rejection of the following statement of\n‘Conceptualism’: \nConceptualism:\n\nThe ‘content’ (Inhalt) of an intuition is\nconceptual, and constitutes its cognitive relation to a (putatively)\nmind-independent object \nConceptualist readings of Kant thus claim that there is a relevant\nsense in which (i) intuitions have content; (ii) the content of the\nintuition is conceptual; (iii) it is this conceptual content that\nconstitutes or determines the cognitive relation of the intuition (as\na mental state) to a mind-independent object (or in the case of inner\nsense, to the object that is oneself). According to the contrasting\nposition, ‘Nonconceptualism’: \nNonconceptualism:\n\nThe ‘content’ of an intuition is at least partly\nnonconceptual, and is sufficient to constitute a cognitive relation to\na (putatively) mind-independent object \nOne caveat worth noting: the qualification concerning\n“putatively” mind-independent objects is meant to allow\nfor hallucination and illusion (see Allais 2010, 2011a; Roche 2011;\nStephenson 2015, 2017; Grüne 2017a; McLear 2017). This\nqualification also provides leeway concerning exactly what is meant by\n“mind-independent”, especially since Kant’s\narticulation of Transcendental Idealism entails that finite beings\nintuit (in some sense) mind-dependent appearances and not (in some\nsense) mind-independent things as they are in themselves (Allais 2015;\nsee also the entry on Kant’s\n transcendental idealism). \nOne might argue that Kant articulates an endorsement of Conceptualism\nin §17 of B-Deduction of the first Critique, where he\nsays that \nThe understanding is, to speak generally, the faculty of cognitions.\nThis consists in the determinate relation of given representations to\nan object. But an object is that in the concept of which the manifold\nof a given intuition is united. Now, all unification of\nrepresentations requires the unity of consciousness in the synthesis\nof the same [i.e., the representations]. It follows that the unity of\nconsciousness alone establishes [ausmacht] the relation of\nrepresentations to an object, their objective validity, and thus their\nbecoming cognitions. (B137; cf. A197/B242-3) \nThe language used here has seemed to many to indicate that the unity\nof consciousness achieved via categorial synthesis is necessary for\nany cognitive relation to an object (e.g., Bird 1962: 130–131;\nGuyer 1987: 11–24; Pereboom 2006: 160; Pereboom 2009; cf. Land\n2012). Put another way, intuitions must have conceptual content if\nthey are to have cognitive relation to an object. \nWhile there may be a variety of reasons for reading Kant as endorsing\nConceptualism, so understood, two stand out. The first is\nphilosophically motivated by the position that sense experience can\nplay a rational or justificatory role with respect to belief or\njudgment only if such experience possesses conceptual content (see\n §5.1\n for discussion). Second, many think that the only plausible way of\ninterpreting Kant’s argument in the Transcendental Deduction of\nthe Critique of Pure Reason requires that he endorse\nConceptualism (see\n §5.5\n for discussion). \nHence, interpreters endorsing some form or another of\n‘Nonconceptualism’ typically take a contrasting stance\nregarding Kant’s position concerning either the justificatory\nrelationship between sense experience and belief or judgment, or the\nproper interpretation of his argument in the Deduction. \nHowever, the framing of the dispute between Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism as one concerning conceptual content faces\nstraightforward interpretive challenges, independently of where one\nstands as to the justificatory role of experience or the best way to\ninterpret the argument of the Deduction. These challenges concern each\nelement of the Conceptualist thesis. First\n (§3.1),\n it seems that when close attention is paid to Kant’s notion of\n‘content’ (Inhalt) it cannot be the case that\nintuitions have conceptual content. Second\n (§3.2),\n Kant’s conception of concepts as always employed in judgment\nappears incompatible with the claim that concepts provide intuition\nwith cognitive relation to an object. Third\n (§3.3),\n attempts to avoid these challenges by attributing a conception of\n‘content’ to Kant in line with our contemporary notion of\nrepresentational content do not obviously cohere with his\nview of the contribution of intuition to cognition. The next three\nsubsections detail these challenges. Again, it is important to note\nthat though these challenges are often raised by advocates of some\nform or another of Nonconceptualism, the challenges themselves are\nindependent of any specific answer concerning, first, whether and how\nintuition justifies judgment, and second, how Kant proceeds in the\nargument of the Deduction. After discussing these three challenges to\nthe conceptual content frame regarding its plausibility as an\ninterpretation of Kant (this entry shall largely prescind from\ndiscussing Conceptualism’s independent philosophical\nplausibility),\n §4\n then examines an alternative way of framing the debate that does not\nraise these concerns. \nOne straightforward challenge to the Conceptualism thesis comes from\nclose examination of Kant’s conception of ‘content’\n(Inhalt), which he understands in terms of the relation of a\nrepresentation to an object (Tolley 2011, 2013). As we have see in\nB137 above, Kant often construes the content of cognition in terms of\na relation to an object (see also B79, B83, B87), and he also says of\nsensory intuition that it  \ncontain[s] [enthalten] in its representation only the\nrelation [Verhältniß] of an object to the subject,\nand not that which is internal to the object in itself. (B67)  \nMoreover, Kant describes intuition and concept as having opposing\nkinds of relation to the object they represent. Intuitions are\nimmediately related to their objects while concepts are only mediately\nso related (B93; see also B33, B41, A109, B3767; Prolegomena, §8\n(4: 281); What Real Progress, 20: 266). This gives us the material for\nthe following argument. \nThis argument, if sound, shows that intuition cannot be related to an\nobject (and thus have ‘content’) by virtue of a\nconceptual content. Thus, one initial worry about\nConceptualism is that its framing of its position in terms of\n‘content’ does not obviously cohere with how Kant thinks\nof content. However, the above argument fails to show that concepts\n(or conceptual synthesis, or the capacity for concept employment) do\nnot play any other role in the constitution of an\nintuition’s relation to an object—perhaps concepts are not\nthe contents of intuitions but are nevertheless necessary for an\nintuition’s having a relation to an object. Let’s turn\nthen to discussion of how conceptual synthesis could constitute this\nrelation. \nAccording to Conceptualism, the cognitive relation of an intuition to\nan object is, in some sense, conceptual. A version of this claim is\nseemingly articulated by Kant at B137, quoted above, in which it is a\nsynthesis by concepts that constitutes what Kant calls a\n“determinate relation” (bestimmten Beziehung) to\nan object. After first discussing what Kant means by\n“synthesis” here we’ll go on to address the\nprospects and problems facing an account of intuition as dependent on\nconceptual synthesis. \nKant distinguishes between two basic classes of mental processing. The\nfirst is association, which is carried out by sensibility, and\nspecifically the imagination. Association is primarily a passive\nprocess by which the mind comes to connect representations due to the\nrepeated exposure of the subject to certain kinds of regularities. One\nmight (e.g.) associate chicken soup with being ill, because one only\never had chicken soup when one was ill. Association is thus capable of\nengendering content-sensitive connections between a subject’s\nmental states, though such connections depend entirely on the local\nand contingent circumstances in which the subject comes to have such\nstates. This is part of why Kant denies that association could ever\naccount for our ability to represent universality or necessity. \nThe second kind of mental processing is “combination”\n(Verbindung) or “synthesis”, carried out by the\nintellect broadly conceived (i.e., the “higher” cognitive\nfaculties of understanding, judgment, and reason). Kant characterizes\nsynthesis as that activity by which the understanding “runs\nthrough” and “gathers together” representations\ngiven to it by sensibility in order to form concepts, judgments, and\nultimately, for any cognition (in its “proper” sense) at\nall to take place (A77-8/B102-3). Synthesis is not something we are\nalways, or even typically, aware of doing. As Kant says, it is\n“a blind though indispensable function of the soul…of\nwhich we are only seldom even conscious (A78/B103).” Kant\ntypically contrasts synthesis with other ways in which representations\nmight be related, most importantly, by association (e.g., B139-40). In\ncontrast with association, synthesis is a fundamentally active\nprocess, dependent upon the mind’s spontaneity, and is the means\nby which genuine judgment is possible. Moreover, at least by the time\nof Kant’s writing of the B-Deduction of the first\nCritique, he is clear that judgments, as outcomes of\nsynthesis, are unique in our mental economy in that they are complex\nrepresentations that possess the capacity to be true or false. As\nKant’s discussion in §19 of the B-Deduction shows, a\njudgment isn’t simply a “representation of a relation\nbetween two concepts” (B140), which doesn’t rule out mere\nassociation between concepts, but is rather a representation of an\nobjectively valid relationship in virtue of which the judgment may be\nseen as an objective claim to truth (B142). \nSynthesis is carried out by the unitary subject of representation on\nrepresentations that are either given to it in sensibility (i.e.,\nintuition and/or sensation) or produced by it via the intellect (e.g.,\nin an act of judgment). When synthesis is carried out on\nrepresentations forming the content of a concept or judgment, it is\ncalled “intellectual” synthesis; when carried out by the\nimagination on material provided by sensibility (i.e., on intuition\nand sensation), it is called “figurative” synthesis\n(B150-1). In the Critique of Pure Reason Kant discusses in\nsome depth the synthesis performed on representations provided by\nsensibility, and discusses three central kinds of synthesis—viz.\napprehension, reproduction (or imagination), and recognition (or\nconceptualization) (A98-110/B159-61). Though Kant discusses these\nforms of synthesis in a way that suggests they are discrete types of\nmental acts, it is also plausible that they always go together (Paton\n1936: 271–272; Kemp Smith 2003: 245–246), or at least that\nthe first two forms must always occur together, with the third being\n(perhaps) an optional addition (Brook 1997; Allais 2009). \nGiven that Kant distinguishes between intellectual and figurative\nsynthesis, what does it then mean to claim that an intuition\nconstitutively depends on conceptual synthesis for its relation to an\nobject? \nKant describes a concept as a “function”\n(Funktion), which he characterizes as “the unity of the\nact through which different representations are ordered under a common\none” (A68/B93). Concepts are merely “predicates of\npossible judgments” (A69/B94) “grounded on the spontaneity\nof thinking” and the faculty of understanding “can make no\nother use of these concepts than that of judging by means of\nthem” (A68/B93). \nFrom these passages we can conclude that concepts are (i)\nactualizations of the spontaneity of (the power of) thought through\nwhich (ii) different representations are ordered under a common one.\nThis ordering is carried out specifically by means of (iii) a\njudgment. Hence, an act of conceptualization is an act of\nsubordinating one representation “under” another, as a\nspecies (or the members thereof) is to its genus (or the members\nthereof), and it is this subordination relation that is captured in\nthe cognitive activity of judging (Paton 1936: 285; Strawson 1966: 94;\nPippin 1982: 33; Longuenesse 1998: ch. 4; Engstrom 2019:\n245–252). \nHow, on this view of conceptual activity in judgment, is the\nconceptualization of sensory material in intuition supposed to work?\nAccording to one prominent interpretation—call this\n‘judgmentalism’ (Land 2015b)—intuition requires a\njudgment on the part of the subject, that things are experientially\nthus-and-so (Strawson 1970; Carl 1992: 165). However, this\ninterpretation of Kant generates some straightforward problems\n(Grüne 2009: §2.2; Land 2015b). First, Kant’s\nconception of judgment seems to require predication (and in this sense\nconcepts are predicates of possible judgments). However, a sensible\nsynthesis carried out by concepts does not seem equivalent to the\nmaking of a judgment, rather it seems that Kant has in mind something\nlike the formation of a sensory image (e.g., B154, B162). Indeed, in a\n1791 letter Kant explicitly denies that intuitions are related to\nobjects via an act of judgment or, relatedly, by the subsumption of\nthe intuition under a concept (C 11:311). Second, Kant emphasizes that\nthere are two distinctively different kinds of synthesis—viz.\nthe “intellectual” synthesis generative of conceptual\njudgment, and the “figurative” synthesis generative of\nexperience (in Kant’s sense of “experience”; see\nB151). If the judgmentalist view were correct, then it is difficult to\nsee how Kant could maintain such a distinction between varieties of\nsynthesis. Third, there is at least a prima facie circularity\nto the judgmentalist account, which construes conceptual judgment as a\nnecessary condition of the generation of intuition, and Kant’s\naccount of concept formation, which construes all concepts (even the a\npriori categories) as the result of reflection, which itself\npresupposes sensory intuition (Ginsborg 2006b; Grüne 2009;\nAnderson 2015: ch. 13). \nSuch problems have lead some (e.g., Sellars 1968; McDowell 1996;\nLonguenesse 1998; Haag 2007; Grüne 2009) to argue that the\ndependence of intuition on conceptual representation must be\nunderstood in a way other than that of application of a concept in\njudgment (or the subordination of an intuition under a concept). This\nentry examines below one way such an alternative view might proceed\n(and challenges it faces) before discussing further extensions of it\nin the context of the second way of framing the debate about the\nrelation between intuition and concept. \nConceptualism states that concepts or conceptual synthesis determine\nthe cognitive relation an intuition has to its object. How should we\nunderstand this notion of a ‘cognitive relation’ to the\nobject? Conceptualism typically understands this in terms of the\ncorrectness conditions possessed by the intuition and in virtue of\nwhich the intuition represents a (putatively) mind-independent object\nand its properties (Sellars 1968: ch. 1; McDowell 1996; Ginsborg\n2008). This constitutes the attribution to Kant, in more or less\nexplicit terms, of what is now called the ‘Content View’,\nwhich, in contemporary terms, understands perceptual experience to\npresent or convey information about a subject’s environment to\nthe subject of that experience in virtue of the experience’s\nhaving content (Siegel 2010: §1; 2011: ch. 2). Thus, according to the Content\nView, part of what it is for a mental state to count as an\nobjective experience is that it can be evaluated for its\ncorrectness, and the conditions of its correctness are determined by\nits content. \nIt is important that the content attributed to a sensory state by the\nContent View requires more than the state’s merely being\nnon-arbitrarily associated with a representational content.\nFor one might plausibly agree that there are non-arbitrary conditions\nfor associating experiences with particular correctness conditions,\nwithout thereby thinking that experience is something that is had in\nvirtue of a relation to a content that sets such a correctness\ncondition. It is this ‘in virtue of’ claim that I take to\nbe the distinctive claim of the Content View. \nWhat does it mean to say that a sensory experience has\n‘content’ in the sense relevant to the Content View?\nContemporary philosophy typically construes the phrase “mental\ncontent” as referring to that thing which fulfills a certain set\nof functional roles—namely, it is that which (i) may be the\nobject of different cognitive states within the same subject (e.g., of\nbelief and desire), (ii) which may be the object of the same (or a\ndifferent) cognitive state in other subjects (e.g., that you and I\nmight be able to believe the same thing and thus communicate), and\n(iii) which has veridicality conditions (e.g., that which you and I\nboth believe is true or both perceive correctly) (see, e.g., Frege\n1956; McGinn 1982; Searle 1983; Fodor 1987; Peacocke 1992; McDowell\n1996; Heck 2000, 2007; Byrne 2005; McGrath 2005 [2014]; Hanks 2009;\nChalmers 2011). \nTypically, when contemporary philosophers ask about the content of a\nmental state, they are asking about something which is supposed to\nfulfil these three roles. The traditional satisfier for this\nfunctional specification is an abstract entity—a proposition.\nAccording to this propositionalist view I might, e.g., both see\nthat there is snow on Mt Washington and (thereby) believe\nthat there is snow on Mt Washington. Moreover, you and I may\nboth see that there is snow on Mt Washington, and the\ncontents of our visual experiences may well be accurate. In any case,\nwhether the satisfier of these functional roles for mental content is\na proposition or something else, it must be the kind of thing to which\na mental state can be related, and in virtue of which a sensory state\ncounts as an experience of something (typically, something in the\nexperiencer’s environment). \nSticking with the propositional notion of content, for simplicity, we\ncan also note the different kinds of “vehicles” through\nwhich that content can be conveyed. For example a particular token\nsentence “There is snow on Mt. Washington” conveys the\ncontent there is snow on Mt. Washington. But there may be\nother vehicles for such content as well, including mental vehicles,\nsuch as the act of judging that there is snow on Mt.\nWashington, or the event of seeing that there is snow on Mt.\nWashington. For the purposes of our toy example, all of these\ndifferent vehicles convey the same abstract propositional content,\nwhich sets the correctness conditions for each instance. \nHence, in asking whether it is correct to understand Kant as endorsing\nthe Content View, we first need to know whether it is even coherent to\nascribe to him a notion of “content”, conceptual or not\n(and irrespective of whether he would use the corresponding German\nword “Inhalt” for this notion), in the terms set\nout above. \nIt seems highly plausible that Kant did accept the existence of\ncontent as it is functionally specified above. This is his notion of a\n“judgment” (Urteil). The vehicles for judgment\nare mental states—“representations”\n(Vorstellungen). Judgments (or equivalently for Kant,\nthoughts) are the product of “relating” representations,\nin the act of judging, in one consciousness (Prol §22, 4:304; cf.\nJL §17, 9:101; V-Lo/Wiener, 24:928) \nIn addition to serving as the content of psychological vehicles (i.e.,\nmental states) and the bearers of truth, Kant also considers\njudgements to be the objects of different epistemic attitudes. For\nexample, he distinguishes between varieties of\n“holding-for-true” or “assent”\n(Fürwahrhalten) in the Canon of Pure Reason at the end\nof the First Critique (A820/B848; see Stevenson 2003;\nChignell 2007b; Pasternack 2014). \nHence, Kant seems to acknowledge the existence of content in the\nrelevant sense. There is something—judgement—that is\ncarried or expressed by psychological states, which can be the object\nof different epistemic attitudes, and which is the bearer of truth and\nfalsity. Furthermore, since judgements are constituted by concepts,\nKant obviously accepts that at least some mental states—i.e.,\nacts of judging—have conceptual content. \nThe next question is whether Kant allows that any other mental state\nis also a bearer of conceptual ‘content’ in the\nrelevant sense. Plausibly, Kant’s conception of\n‘experience’ (Erfahrung), insofar as\nthis is a mental state, possesses conceptual content in some sense.\nSince Kant often characterizes experience as a complex state\nconsisting of both intuition and judgment, it may be that experience\npossesses conceptual content simply in virtue of being partly\nconstituted by a conceptual judgment. It is somewhat less clear, given\nthe discussion above, whether there is conceptual content in what Kant\ncalls “perception” (Wahrnehmung). But since\nintuition is the primary locus of the contemporary debate, our\nquestion here is whether the Content View is true of intuition. \nSome advocates of Conceptualism (e.g., McDowell 1996, 1998; Ginsborg\n2006b; Grüne 2009: 53–71) think that it is at least\npartially constitutive of intuition that it have correctness\nconditions. However, this view is also shared by nonconceptualist\ninterpreters (e.g., Hanna 2005). In this way, both Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism typically agree that an intuition’s cognitive\nrelation to an object depends on correctness conditions constituting\nits ‘content’ (in the contemporary sense), but disagree as\nto whether that content is conceptual.But, if Kant rejects the Content\nView, and so rejects the claim that it is in virtue of having content\nthat intuition counts as related to an object, a central means for\nframing the dispute between Conceptualism and Nonconceptualism’s\nunderstanding of intuition is undermined. \nWhy think that Kant rejects the Content View? McLear (2016b) provides\nthree arguments against the applicability of the Content View to\nKant’s conception of intuition: \nAccording to the first argument, Kant denies that error due to\nhallucination or illusion may be traced to misrepresentation by\nintuition. As Kant says,  \ntruth and illusion are not in the object in so far as it is intuited,\nbut are in the judgment made about the object in so far as it is\nthought. (A293–4/B350)  \nThis would be a surprising thing to say if Kant endorsed the Content\nView, for one of the central reasons for endorsing the Content View\nstems from the straightforward manner in which misleading experience\n(i.e., illusion and hallucination) is explained by erroneous\nrepresentational content in the experience. \nThe second argument points out the connection Kant draws between\npossession of a correctness condition and combination or synthesis. As\nKant says at the beginning of the B-edition of the Transcendental\nDeduction,  \na manifold’s combination as such can never come to us through\nthe senses; nor, therefore, can it already be part of what is\ncontained in the pure form of sensible intuition. (B129–30)  \nHence, correctness conditions must depend on the intellect, and cannot\nbe given as part of sensible intuition. If the first argument gives us\nreason to doubt that intuition can have ‘content’ in the\nsense required by the Content View, the second argument explains\nwhy—viz. only intellectual representations can have\n‘content’ in the relevant sense. \nFinally, the third argument presses the claim that the cognitive\ncontribution of intuition lies not in the possession of correctness\nconditions concerning some perceived object, but rather in the\ncontribution the intuition makes to proving the real possibility of\nthe object, as is required for cognition (Bxxvi). Intuition, in\nrelating a cognizer to an actual being, provides the ground necessary\nto prove its real possibility as an object of thought, and thereby\nprovides the ground necessary for its cognition (more on this point in\n §5.8\n below). \nGomes (2017a) raises further considerations against the applicability\nof the Content View to intuition—viz. that (i) representational\ncontent is inherently general in a way that is in marked tension with\nKant’s characterization of intuition as the way in which the\nmind represents particulars (A19/B33; A68/B93; A320/B376-7; JL 9:91);\n(ii) proper consideration of Kant’s argument in the Fourth\nParalogism and Refutation of Idealism militates against the Content\nView. \nIn Gomes’ first argument, he appeals to a conception of\nrepresentational content as “specificational” and thus as\nrequiring  \na selection from amongst the ways the world could be in order to fix\nthe way which determines the truth conditions for the representational\nstate. (Gomes 2017a: 545; see also McLear 2016b: 129–130)  \nThe particularity of intuition seems to be such that it singularly and\nimmediately relates us to particular objects without adverting to\ngeneral marks common to all such objects, and which are constitutive\nof conceptual representation (A19/B33). \nIn Gomes’ second argument, he points out that Kant rejects any\ninterpretation of the relation of intuition to its object solely in\nterms of the intuition as the causal result of the inferred\nobject’s effect on the subject’s senses. Kant instead\nclaims that in perceptual experience I have “an immediate\nconsciousness of the existence of other things outside me”\n(B276). Gomes elucidates how this point has been picked up and\ndeveloped in contemporary literature on the nature of perceptual\nexperience (Gomes 2017a: 549; see also Child 1994: 147–149;\nCampbell 2002: 132–133). \nIf McLear and Gomes are correct much of the contemporary debate\nconcerning Kant’s conception of the content of intuition has\npresupposed a notion of “content” that Kant rejects.\nRecall that Conceptualist readings of Kant claim that there is a\nrelevant sense in which (i) intuitions have content; (ii) the content\nof the intuition is conceptual; (iii) it is this conceptual content\nthat constitutes or determines the cognitive relation of the intuition\n(as a mental state or act) to a mind-independent object (or in the\ncase of inner sense, to the object that is oneself). It was seen above\nthat (ii) is problematic because intuition plausibly lacks conceptual\ncontent in Kant’s sense of the term “content”\n(Inhalt). With regard to (iii) the standard conception of an\nintuition’s cognitive relation to an object as requiring\njudgment is also problematic. This might seem to indicate that\nConceptualism is false and Nonconceptualism true. However, if Kant\nalso rejects (i), and so the idea that intuitions have content in the\nsense required by the Content View, then even\nNonconceptualist readings of Kant that construe Kant’s\nnonconceptualism in terms of an intuition’s having a\nnonconceptual representational content (e.g., Hanna 2005) are going to\nbe problematic, because that content is still understood in terms of a\nversion of the rejected Content View. \nIf these points are all correct then there is a danger that the\ndispute between Conceptualism and Nonconceptualism has simply failed\nto connect with Kant’s views. The next section examines an\nalternative frame from that of the content-centric one. This\nalternative frames the dispute in terms of the presence or absence of\nparticular kinds of cognitive abilities and the dependence relations\nthat may or may not hold between such abilities and the occurrence or\ngeneration of intuition. An advantage of this frame is that it avoids\nthe challenges raised above to the claims constituting the first\nframe. \nThe alternative frame for understanding the relation between intuition\n(and ultimately perception and experience as well) and concept eschews\nany focus on representational content per se. Instead, it frames the\ndebate in terms of various cognitive abilities a subject might\npossesses and the way in which intuition is or is not dependent upon\nsuch abilities either for its generation or for the kind of structure\nit possesses. \nThe alternative frame distinguishes two broad camps, each of which\nconstrues these dependence conditions differently (see McLear 2015,\n2016a; Gomes 2017a). On the one side is “Intellectualism”\n(see, e.g., McDowell 1996; Longuenesse 1998; Grüne 2009; Friedman\n2015; Conant 2016; Indregard forthcoming) and on the other is\n“Nonintellectualism” or “Sensibilism” (Rohs\n2001; Hanna 2005; McLear 2015; Allais 2015: 148ff, 2017a; Tolley\n2019). \nIntellectualism: the generation of intuition is at\nleast partly dependent on the intellect. \nSensibilism: at least some intuitions are generated\nindependently of the intellect itself \nAccording to Sensibilism at least some objective sensory states,\nincluding the “pure” representations of space and time,\npossess structure which is not the product of the activity of the\n“intellect” so construed, and so do not depend for their\nstructure or unity on the pure apperceptive power or downstream\nmanifestations of that power in conceptualization, judgment, or\ninference. \nHere, as above, “intellect” is understood as the generic\nterm for the “higher” cognitive faculties which include\nunderstanding, judgment, and reason. Kant often characterizes these\nfaculties as “spontaneous” or essentially\n“active”, in contrast to the “receptive” or\nessentially “passive” character of sensibility (e.g.,\nA50-1/B74-5). How exactly these distinctions should be understood is\ncontroversial. Part of the problem comes in determining how to\nconstrue activity of the mind that is not overtly\n“conceptual”, in the sense that it does not consist in\napplication of concepts in judgment, but nevertheless still involves a\nrule-governed synthesis, or is otherwise dependent on a spontaneous\npower for combining representations that is not present in sensibility\n(B129–30). There does not yet seem to be a settled consensus on\nthis point. \nHowever, one potential means of explaining what “dependence on\nthe intellect” comes to is dependence on the power of (pure)\napperception. Kant consistently characterizes the power of\napperception and the unity it brings about as the\n“original” or unconditioned condition of all employment of\nconcepts, including the categories (B131, B133-4n, A401-2). Indeed,\nKant explicitly states that “the possibility of the logical form\nof all cognition necessarily rests on the relationship to this\napperception as a faculty” (A117n) and that even the\n“possibility of the understanding itself” rests on the\npure unity of consciousness made possible by the power of apperception\n(B137; see also Metaphysik Mrongovius 29:889\n(1782–1783)). \nKant does occasionally say that the actualization of the apperceptive\npower, in the synthetic unity of understanding, depends on the use of\nthe categories (e.g., B145-6). This might make Kant’s account\nseem circular, with the understanding depending on apperception which\nin turn depends on the understanding, as the faculty of synthesis. But\nKant can hold that while the power or faculty of pure apperception is\ndistinct from any of its actualizations, when it is so actualized it\nentails a synthetic combination via the categories (B143, B144). Thus\nthe fact that apperception does not occur without the categorial\nsynthesis doesn’t mean that apperception is grounded in such\nsynthesis. This way Kant can both say that the understanding is made\npossible by the power of apperception, and that apperception (as\nactualized unity) depends on—in the sense that it cannot\nactualize without—conceptual/categorial synthesis. \nThis dependence of the understanding (and hence the logical form of\nall cognition) on the power of apperception contrasts with the\nreceptive faculty of sensibility, whose activities, at least in their\ngeneric conception, are not defined as depending on the existence of\nan apperceptive power capable of bringing about such a unity of\nconsciousness. Thus to say that the generation of intuition is at\nleast partially dependent on the intellect is, on the current\nproposal, to say one of two things. Either, that the intuition depends\non the exercise of the power or capacity for apperception itself, or\nthat intuition depends on the exercise of one or more capacities whose\npossibility rests on the pure power of apperception. This allows for\nsignificant flexibility in the way in which the Intellectualist might\nexpress their position, while still providing unity to the overall\napproach. \nAccording to this framing, Sensibilism and Intellectualism can agree\nthat sensing and thinking involve distinct (and distinctive) cognitive\nabilities. In this regard, Sensibilism is not to be confused with a\ncrude empiricism. Moreover, both Sensibilism and Intellectualism\nexplain the generation and structure of representations or mental\nstates at least partly in terms of the relevant cognitive capacity or\nfaculty. The key difference is that Intellectualism construes the\nstructure and generation of intuitive representations as dependent not\nonly on sensibility but also on some intellectual capacity. For the\nIntellectualist, the only representations which do not admit of this\ndependence are the simple sensations that are the supposed initial\nproduct of sensibility (e.g., the sensations of “sheer\nreceptivity” in Sellars 1968: ch. 1). \nProponents of the second frame have argued that there are a variety of\nbenefits of recasting the concept-intuition debate in this way. First,\nit avoids requiring any attribution to Kant of the controversial\nassumption that intuition essentially has a correctness condition that\ncould be the object of epistemic attitudes. Of course, a proponent of\nIntellectualism might argue to the conclusion that intuitions\nessentially have correctness conditions as a result of their\ngeneration by acts of synthesis. But such a position would be an\noutcome of the Intellectualist’s argument, rather than as an\nassumption thereof. \nSecond, the framework allows for a wide plurality of nevertheless\nrelated ways in which intuition, perception, and experience might\ndepend on (or be independent from) the intellect. For example,\nintuition might depend on a pre-conceptual pure apperceptive\npower to unify one’s representations (e.g., Waxman 2014), while\nperception depends on the recognition of what is so unified in a\nconcept, though not yet in an explicit judgment (e.g., Gomes 2017a),\nand experience on the predication of that concept in an act of\njudgment (e.g., Strawson 1970). Now, instead of thinking of this\nseries as three distinct positions, two of which are\n“conceptualist”, and one of which is\n“judgmentalist”, we can construe them as each developments\nof a single Intellectualist position. The Intellectualism/Sensibilism\nframe thus provides a way of unifying a variety of different\napproaches around a single central “bright line”\ndistinction (McLear 2015, 2016a; Gomes 2017a; Indregard\nforthcoming). \nEven with respect to the single issue of the generation of intuition,\nwe can see a plurality of ways in which an Intellectualist view might\nbe developed, in increasing order of demandingness. First, we have\nthose that construe the dependence of intuition on the power of\napperception itself, prior to how that power is manifested in\ndiscursive acts of conceptualization, judgment, and inference (e.g.,\nWaxman 1991, 2014; Longuenesse 1998; Messina 2014; Friedman 2015).\nSecond, we have positions according to which intuition depends on the\napplication of a concept, but not in judgment (e.g., Grüne 2009;\nLand 2015a; McDowell 1998). Third, we have positions according to\nwhich intuition depends on overt acts of judgment (e.g., Strawson\n1970; Pippin 1982: 28). While there are obvious and important\ndifferences between these views, they are all united by a commitment\nto construing intuition as the outcome of a process that depends upon\nthe intellectual capacity to unify one’s mental states as one\nand all states of single self-conscious individual. \nSimilarly, positions that might be grouped together as\n“nonconceptualist” according to the first frame are, on\nthis frame, organized quite differently. For example, a variety of\ninterpreters reject the position that pure intuition depends on a\nconceptual synthesis (e.g., Longuenesse 1998: ch. 8; Waxman 2014;\nAllais 2015: ch. 7; McLear 2015; Friedman 2015; Golob 2016a).\nAccording to the Conceptualism frame, one might thus think of these\npositions as all in agreement concerning a basic (and controversial)\nelement of Kant’s view, and thus all as forms of\n‘Nonconceptualism’. However, these positions in fact\nradically disagree concerning whether intuition is dependent\non the intellect. Their disagreement hinges on the issue of the\ndependence of intuition on intellectual acts per se rather\nthan on conceptual content or conceptual synthesis (for further\ndiscussion see\n §5\n below). So, according to the second frame, interpreters who consider\nintuition to depend on nonconceptual but still\nintellectual acts (e.g., Longuenesse 1998; Waxman 2014;\nIndregard forthcoming) will be put on the Intellectualist side while\nthose who reject such dependence (e.g., Allais 2015; McLear 2015) will\nbe put on the Nonintellectualist or Sensibilist side. Within\nSensibilism there may be significant differences between how different\ninterpreters construe the manner in which intuition gives an object\nfor cognition, or in the manner in which perception and experience are\ngenerated from mental acts performed on intuition (compare, e.g.,\nAllais 2017a and Tolley 2019), but all will agree on the fundamental\npoint that intuition may be generated independently of any\nintellectual act. \nIntellectualism thus captures much of what seems to have originally\nmotivated Conceptualism, but without appealing to problematic\nconceptions of ‘content’, and allowing that there may be a\nway that the intellect plays a role in sense experience apart from\novert conceptual judgment concerning that experience. Recall that two\nmotivations underlying the dispute between Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism concerned, first the justificatory or broader\nrational role of sense experience with respect to belief or judgment\nand, second, the most plausible way of interpreting Kant’s\nargument in the Transcendental Deduction. These motivations remain\npresent in the dispute between Sensibilism and Intellectualism. Hence,\nthe substantive motivations of Conceptualism remain even if the\nframing regarding representational content is dropped in favor of\nfocus on dependence on the intellect. \nThus, the division between Intellectualism and Sensibilism concerning\nthe dependence of intuition on the pure apperceptive power and/or\nthose intellectual capacities downstream from it captures a central\npoint (and perhaps the central point) of contention between\nan otherwise large plurality of views, and in this way helps to\norganize a dispute that might otherwise seem to lack unity. In the\nnext section we look at what have emerged as the most promising,\ncentral, or stubborn points of dispute between these two camps. \nThis section canvasses eight different areas of dispute between\ncontemporary interpreters of Kant concerning the contributions of\nsensibility and intellect to cognition. Each dispute is presented in\nterms of the second, dependence, frame (i.e Intellectualism vs.\nSensibilism). However, proponents of the first, content, frame (i.e.,\nConceptualism vs. Nonconceptualism) will also see these different\nareas of dispute as relevant, given that many of their concerns remain\nin the motivation for holding one form or another of Intellectualism.\nThat said, particularly important points of discrepancy between the\ntwo frames’ approaches to the issues will be noted below. \nA central reason for pursuing an Intellectualist reading of Kant is\nthat such a reading is taken (most notably by Sellars and McDowell) to\nbe the best or even only way to secure an explanation of how\nperception can play a justificatory rather than merely causal role in\nthe adoption of empirical belief. If intuition is autonomous of\nintellectual capacities, so the objection goes, it cannot play a\njustificatory role in the acquisition or adoption of empirical belief.\nVersions of this objection have often, since Wilfred Sellars’\nfamous paper (Sellars 1956, reprinted in Sellars 1963), gone under the\nmoniker of the “Myth of the Given” (McDowell 1996, 1998,\n2007b, 2008). While it is not straightforward as to how Kant’s\ntexts or arguments yield any substantive connection with the concerns\narticulated by Sellars and McDowell, this entry examines three\npossible ways of understanding such a connection. \nThe exact nature of objections to a supposedly mythical\n“Given” vary, as do their putative connections to\nKant’s arguments (Watkins 2008, 2012). One objection made by\nSellars is that justifiers for belief must have a compositional,\nfact-like structure that mirrors the propositional structure of\nbelief. Sensory experiences (understood as sensations), on\nSellars’ view, are particulars rather than facts and so cannot\nplay any justificatory role (Sellars 1963: 128; cf. BonJour 1985: ch.\n4). Thus, the view goes, if the belief caused by an experience (such\nas the belief you might have that there is a computer screen before\nyou) and thereby adopted by you is also to be justified by that\nexperience, then the experience itself must be able to function as a\npremise in an argument for which the relevant belief is the\nconclusion. This is the “premise principle,” as it has\nbeen called in contemporary epistemology (Pryor 2005). Acceptance of\nthe premise principle thus plays a significant role in motivating the\nposition that sensory experience without propositional (i.e.,\nconceptual) content cannot justify belief. \nA passage in Kant typically adduced in support of this point is the\n“same function” passage at A79/B104–5 (e.g., Sellars\n1968: 4–5; McDowell 2003: 79; Haag 2007: 150–151, 199, and\nch. 8; Kalderon 2011: 235–236; cf. Pippin 1982: 99–101;\nHeidegger 1997: 45–46; Longuenesse 1998: 200; Grüne 2009:\n107–111). On this reading of Kant, sense experience would have\nthe requisite proposition-like structure, and thus be capable of\nstanding in justificatory relations to beliefs, only if the same\ncapacities that structure the contents of judgment for Kant (viz. the\nlogical forms) would also structure sensory experience (via\napplication of the categories). While such interpreters are surely\ncorrect that Kant’s aim, as exemplified in that passage, is to\nshow that the very same cognitive capacities that connect\nrepresentations in a mental act of judging are also in play in the\nconnection of representations in a sensory experience, it is not\nobvious how the passage directly supports any argument concerning the\nepistemic significance of sensory experience to empirical belief and\nknowledge. What is particularly unclear is whether Kant endorses the\npremise principle in the substantive manner required for the\nSellars/McDowell position. Hence, further work needs to be done to\nshow that Kant actually (or even counterfactually) endorses the\npremise principle. \nA second objection against the Given, which might also be attributed\nto Kant, is that the mere occurrence of a sensory experience cannot\njustify any particular belief that is the causal result of that\nexperience. Instead, sensory experience can only play its\njustificatory role against a background of concepts possessed by the\nexperiencing subject (Sellars 1963: 170; McDowell 1998:\n435–436). Though this position is often taken to support some\nform of Intellectualism (e.g., McDowell 1996; Ginsborg 2006b), it is\nalso compatible with forms of Sensibilism that construe the conditions\nfor empirical knowledge as resting at least in part on the possession\nof intellectual capacities, even if such capacities are not necessary\nfor perceptual intentionality as such (e.g., Hanna 2001: 46–65;\n2005: 256–257; Bird 2006: 193–207; Watkins 2008, 2012;\nAllais 2009: 392–394; Tolley 2013: 125–127; McLear 2015:\n98–106, forthcoming-a; Golob 2016a, forthcoming). \nThird, both Sellars and McDowell claim that it is simply a mistake to\nthink that mental states that are purely the upshot of causal\ninteractions with the world could themselves stand as reasons for\nempirical belief. Sellars (1963) remarks that such a mistake is\n“of a piece with the so-called ‘naturalistic\nfallacy’ in ethics” (146). Sellars himself gives no clear\nargument for this claim. McDowell focuses on the distinction between\nthe kind of mental state for which its bearer is in some way\nresponsible, such as a belief, and the kind of state that simply\nhappens to one, like a headache (McDowell 1996: chs. 1–2; 1998:\n433–434; 2003: 80–85; cf. Engstrom 2006: 8–13). The\nsuggested parallel in an Intellectualist reading of Kant is that if\nintellectual capacities are necessary for the occurrence of perceptual\nexperience, then experience is not merely something that causally\nhappens to the subject but rather is something for which the subject\nherself is at least partially responsible, in much the same way that\nshe is responsible for her endorsement in belief of the content of a\npropositional judgment. It is certainly a centrally held tenet of\nKant’s critical view that the intellect, including understanding\nand reason, actively contributes to the content of cognition and the\nacquisition of knowledge (Paton 1947: 218; Pippin 1987; Allison 1990,\n1996: chs. 4, 7 and 9; Willaschek 2006; McLear forthcoming-b). As Kant\nfamously says, \n[O]ne cannot possibly think of a reason that would consciously receive\ndirection from any other quarter with respect to its judgments; since\nthe subject would then attribute the determination of his judgment,\nnot to his reason but to an impulse. Reason must regard itself as the\nauthor of its principles independently of alien influences.\n(Groundwork 4:448) \nBut it is not at all clear whether appreciation of this point requires\nIntellectualism. For example, perhaps sensory experiences do not\nthemselves stand as reasons on Kant’s view, but rather provide\naccess to the reasons or evidence for holding a particular\nbelief (McLear 2016a: §8.5), knowledge of the successful\nreference of the concepts constituting the content of that belief\n(McLear 2016b: 127–134), or reference überhaupt\n(Allais 2015: ch. 11). Moreover, if Kant does not accept the premise\nprinciple or something like it then there is even more potential for\nSensibilism to maneuver. \nIn the discussion of perception in\n §2\n we saw that the case of non-rational animals raises a variety of\ninterpretive challenges. But the animal case also raises special\nchallenges for Intellectualism, for it is not clear how\nIntellectualism is compatible with attributing representations of\nany sort to non-rational beings. \nKant is extremely clear on the point that non-rational animals lack an\nintellect, in the sense that they lack the capacity for use of the\nfirst-person concept, and with it any of the ‘higher’\ncognitive faculties of understanding, judgment, or reason (An\n7:127; LM 28:277 (c. 1777–80); LA 25:1215 (c. 1784/5)). Hence,\nif one were to deny that, according to Kant, sensibility alone is\ncapable of producing mental states that were cognitively significant\nin character, then it would seem that any animal that lacks a faculty\nof understanding, and thus the capacity for any intellectual or\nconceptual synthesis, would thereby lack not only a capacity for\nthought but also any capacity for perceptual experience. The mental\nlives of non-rational animals would thus, at best, consist of\nessentially unconscious, non-cognitive sensory states that causally\ncorrelate with changes in the animal’s environment. It is not\nclear that we should characterize such states as representations, in\nKant’s sense, at all. \nAside from what we now consider to be a straightforwardly false\ncharacterization of the cognitive capacities of animals, this\nnon-cognitive reading faces textual hurdles. Kant claims that animals\nenjoy mental representations, and that postulating such\nrepresentations is necessary for explaining sophisticated animal\nbehavior. Kant is on record in various places as saying that animals\nhave sensory representations of their environment (CPJ 5:464; cf. An\n7:212), that they have intuitions (LM 28:449 (c. 1784/85); LM 28:594\n(c. 1790/91); LL 24:702 (c. 1792); OP 21:82), and that they are\nacquainted with objects though they do not cognize them (JL\n9:64–5; see also Notes on Logic 16:342–4 (c.\nmid/late 1760s); LL 24:845ff (c. 1780–1); LL 24:730–1 (c.\n1792)). However, interpretation of these texts, and others, is not\nuncontested (e.g., Fisher 2017; van den Berg 2018; see also the\nsources cited in\n §2\n above). It is also not entirely clear that Kant’s views on this\nmatter remain consistent throughout his career, with some arguing that\nat least his pre-critical views are clearly incompatible with a\ncognitivist position regarding animal minds (Leland 2018a,b). \nIf it is correct to read Kant as at least entertaining the possibility\nof a cognitivist position regarding animal minds, then Intellectualism\nfaces a challenge. Intellectualism construes Kant as claiming that\nsynthetic acts carried out by the intellect are necessary for the\ncognitive standing of a mental state. But if this is correct\nthen—on the cognitivist reading of the animal mind—Kant is\ncontradicting fundamental elements of his own position in crediting\nintuitions (or their possibility) to non-rational animals. In contrast\nSensibilism has no problem accommodating the possibility that animals\nhave representations of their environment, and that these\nrepresentations are (potentially) conscious and thus count as\nintuitions. \nOne way of replying to this challenge that may not require endorsing\nnon-cognitivism with respect to animal minds is to allow that\nnon-rational minds may well have some way of representing the world,\nbut posit that rational minds constitute an altogether different\nkind of mind than their non-rational counterparts. On this view,\nrational and non-rational animality are conceived as two completely\ndifferent species of animality whose generic similarity does not\nrequire that there share any of the same fundamental mental capacities\n(Herder 1772 [2002: 81–87]; Hegel 1830/1991: §2; McDowell\n1996: ch. 6; Boyle 2012, 2016, 2017; Conant 2016; Land 2018). On this\nview, “rational” does not specify some characteristic\namong others of a creature, but rather its “distinctive manner\nof having characteristics” (Boyle 2012: 410). Thus rationality\n“transforms” the manner in which a rational creature has\nother kinds of mental state (e.g., experience and desire) and is not\nmerely added to an otherwise independently characterizable stock of\nthe creature’s mental powers. \nMoreover, according to its proponents, a central reason for holding\nthis “transformative” view of rationality is that it is\nthe only way to explain how sensory experience and desire can play\nproperly rationalizing roles in our cognition and action (Boyle 2016;\nsee also\n §5.1).\n And since rational and non-rational minds are construed as radically\ndifferent, this view allows that non-rational minds might have their\nown sorts of (non-rational) intuitive representations, thus avoiding\nany attribution of contradictory claims to Kant. \nPerhaps the most obvious objection to the Sensibilist reading of\nintuition as autonomous from the intellect stems from Kant’s\nfamous statement that \nIntuition and concepts therefore constitute the elements of all our\ncognition [Erkenntnis] … Thoughts without content\n[Inhalt] are empty, intuitions without concepts are\nblind… The understanding is not capable of intuiting anything,\nand the senses are not capable of thinking anything. Only from their\nunification can cognition arise. (A50–51/B74–75) \nThe so-called “blindness” problem raises two issues:\nfirst, that intuitions without concepts or conceptual synthesis are\nnot intentional states (George 1981; Pereboom 1988; Grüne 2009)\nand so cannot provide the mind with relation to an object and, second,\nthat we cannot even identify the cognitive contribution made\nby sensory experience independent of its conceptualization\n(Falkenstein 1995; McDowell 1996: 51; Pippin 2005; cf. Bird 2006: ch.\n7.2). \nConcerning the first point, one question is whether Kant is really\nconcerned with the conditions of intentionality per se (Van\nCleve 1999: 95–97), or merely with the conditions under which a\ncertain kind of rational relation to objects is possible, one that\ncould support rational cognition and the acquisition of scientific\nknowledge. On this latter reading Kant’s talk of “relation\nto an object” takes on a specific and technical significance\nthat should not be confused with intentionality per se (Hanna\n2005; Allais 2015: ch. 7; McLear forthcoming-a). There is no settled\nconsensus on this issue, but the fact that intuition is\n“blind” does not seem to entail the strong position that\nintuition fails to provide any awareness of a\nmind-independent object. \nAllais (2009: 393–4; 2015: ch. 7) has argued against both the\nfirst and second points, pointing out that if we take Kant’s\ndefinition of intuition (and likewise of concepts) seriously, then we\nmust be able to identify an independent contribution of sensibility to\ncognition—viz. singular and immediate representation of an\nobject—lest we fail to make sense of Kant’s division\nbetween intuition and concept (cf. Kolb 1986; Falkenstein 1995: 63).\nRelatedly, others have remarked on the oddness of denying the\npossibility of articulating the distinct contribution made by\nsensibility given that Kant goes so far as to organize the structure\nof argument in the first Critique around the distinction\nbetween those contributions made by sensibility (the Transcendental\nAesthetic) and those made by the understanding (the Transcendental\nLogic, and in particular, the Analytic) (e.g., Bird 2006: 127; but cf.\nBauer 2012; Conant 2016). The claim of “blindness,” it is\nthus argued, should not be interpreted as so extreme as to render\nunintelligible fundamental aspects of Kant’s architectonic, or\nof his repeated statements concerning the individual cognitive roles\nof the faculties of sensibility and understanding. \nOn an alternative and much weaker conception of the blindness problem,\nthe “blindness” of intuition might well only concern the\ndifficulties involved in articulating the nature of sensory content\nwithout drawing on concepts in the process of providing the\narticulation. As Bird (2006: 129–130) notes however, this can be\nconceded without thereby admitting that there is no sensory content\n(or positive cognitive contribution) independent of conceptual\narticulation. \nThere has been extensive discussion of the non-conceptuality of\nintuition in the secondary literature on Kant’s philosophy of\nmathematics. For example, Michael Friedman has argued that the\nexpressive limitations of the prevailing logic in Kant’s time\nrequired the postulation of intuition as a form of singular,\nnon-conceptual representation (Friedman 1992: ch. 2). Charles Parsons\n(1964, 1992a) and Emily Carson (1997, 1999) have argued that space\nmust be given in a phenomenological manner as an original,\nnon-conceptual representation in order that we be able to demonstrate\nthe real possibility of constructed mathematical objects as required\nfor geometric knowledge (cf. Shabel 2010: 100–102). All of this\nat least suggests that Kant’s conception of mathematical\nconstruction includes an important nonconceptual element. \nUltimately, however, there are difficulties in assessing whether\nKant’s philosophy of mathematics can be decisive for the debate\nconcerning the dependence of intuition on the intellect. One issue is\nthat the sense in which intuition must be nonconceptual in accounting\nfor mathematical knowledge is not obviously incompatible with claiming\nthat intuitions themselves (including pure intuition; see\n §5.6\n below) are dependent upon a conceptually guided synthesis (e.g., Land\n2014). A second issue is that one might agree that intuitions are in\nsome sense “nonconceptual” while holding that the pure\nforms of intuition (as discussed in the relevant Metaphysical\nExpositions in the Transcendental Aesthetic) are themselves generated\nby a non- or pre-conceptual synthesis by the intellect, or the\nimagination as a function thereof (e.g., Waxman 1991; Longuenesse\n1998: ch. 8; Friedman 2012, 2015, 2019). Such views are forms of\nIntellectualism even if they reject the claim that intuition, in\nmaking synthetic a priori knowledge in mathematics possible, possesses\nconceptual content or is otherwise conceptually dependent. \nHence, the sense in which the dependence relation alluded to by Kant\nin claiming that mathematical principles are “derived\nfrom” (A160/B199) pure intuition is one that seems open to both\nIntellectualist and Sensibilist interpretations (cf. Shabel 2017).\nThus it is unclear whether mathematical considerations could be\ndecisive in adjudicating the debate between Intellectualism and\nSensibilism. \nThe argument of the Transcendental Deduction, and its relation to the\nTranscendental Aesthetic (and thus to Kant’s philosophy of\nMathematics), is a central area of dispute between Sensibilism and\nIntellectualism (Waxman 1991; Longuenesse 1998; Allais 2016:\n§1.5; Golob 2016b; Allais 2017b). Critics charge that Sensibilism\nat best renders ineffectual Kant’s apparent strategy for\ndemonstrating the legitimacy of the categories in the argument of the\nTranscendental Deduction and at worst shows Kant to be totally\nconfused in his argumentative strategy (Ginsborg 2008: 68–69;\nGriffith 2012; Gomes 2014; Land 2015a; cf. Hegel 1977: 69–72;\nPippin 1989: 29–31; Keller 1998: 107–112, 254; McDowell\n2003, 2007a). However, since interpretation of the argument of the\nDeduction is at least as controversial as any claim made by either\nside of the dispute, dialectical traction on the basis of the text of\nthe Deduction itself is difficult to come by. \nThe basic approach required by Intellectualism sees Kant’s\nstrategy for legitimating the categories, however else the details are\nconstrued, as culminating in the argument that even the pure\nintuitions of space and time (i.e., the representations that are the\ntopic of their respective Metaphysical Expositions in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic) depend for their generation on intellectual,\nthough not obviously conceptual, activity. \nIntellectualism interprets Kant as providing this argument in a\nnotoriously difficult footnote in §26: \nSpace, presented as object (as we are actually required to represent\nit in geometry), contains more than [the] mere form of\nintuition—viz. it contains also the gathering together\n[Zusammenfassung] of the manifold given according to the form\nof sensibility, in an intuitive representation—so that the form\nof intuition gives us merely a manifold, but formal intuition gives us\nunity of representation. In the Transcendental Aesthetic I had merely\nincluded this unity with sensibility, wanting only to point out that\nit precedes any concept. But this unity indeed presupposes a synthesis\nwhich does not belong to the senses, through which all concepts of\nspace and time first become possible. For through this unity (inasmuch\nas understanding determines sensibility), space or time is first given\nas intuitions, and hence, the unity of this intuition belongs a priori\nto space and time, and not to the concept of understanding (§24).\n(B160–1, note) \nLorne Falkenstein describes this footnote as “so obscure that it\ncan be made to serve the needs of any interpretation whatsoever”\nbecause the text is “close enough to exhibiting a contradiction\nthat it makes it possible to get virtually any conclusion one pleases\nout of the passage with only minor effort” (Falkenstein 1995:\n91). \nDespite the difficulties presented by the text, the Intellectualist\ntakes the very intelligibility of Kant’s strategy in the\nDeduction to hinge on the dependence of pure intuition on the\nintellect (Cohen 1871, 1907; Longuenesse 1998: ch. 8; Dufour 2003;\nGinsborg 2008: 69; Bowman 2011: 421; Grüne 2011: 465–466;\nFriedman 2015; McDowell 2016: 318; Conant 2016: 110). The idea here is\nthat, by making the pure intuitions of space and time themselves\ndepend on intellectual activity, along with some further connection of\nthat intellectual activity to categorial synthesis, Kant assures his\ndesired conclusion for the Deduction overall—viz. that any\npossible empirical intuition must depend on the categories and thus\nthat all possible objects of empirical intuition must fall under the\ncategories. The Intellectualist thus construes any approach to reading\nthe Deduction that doesn’t posit such a dependence relation as\nrendering the argument there hopeless and Kant’s strategy deeply\nconfused. Of note here is the fact that when Kant says that the unity\nof intuition “precedes any concept” one might plausibly\nread him as endorsing a form of Nonconceptualism—viz. that the\npure intuitions are prior to any conceptual content. However, this\nnonceptualist point is compatible with Intellectualism since it is\npossible that the unity of intuition lacks conceptual content but is\nnevertheless dependent on the intellect in some other sense (e.g.,\nWaxman 1991, 2014; Longuenesse 1998; Messina 2014; Freidman 2015;\nIndregard forthcoming). \nOne issue for the Intellectualist interpretation is that it seems to\nmake the success conditions of the Deduction too easy. If Kant’s\nproject in the Deduction is to show that all intuition, or perhaps\nmore generally “everything that may ever come before our\nsenses” (B160) must stand under the categories (Guyer 2010a;\nAllison 2015: 407–408), then it cannot be the case the intuition\nis defined in terms of its dependence on the intellect. If intuition\nwere so defined, it would be unclear why anything more than a trivial\ninference would be needed to show that intuition depends on the\nintellect. To avoid this Intellectualism must advocate either for a\nreading of “intuition” that allows for at least two\ndifferent senses of the term (Sellars 1968: ch. 1) or a\n“re-reading” of Kant’s initial presentation of the\nnature of sensibility and the intuitions it provides (Longuenesse\n1998: ch. 8; Bauer 2012; Conant 2016). \nCertainly, very basic aspects of the argument of the Deduction, even\nsuch as its method and aims (beyond, in some sense, showing the\nlegitimacy of the categories), much less the details and cogency of\nits specific arguments, are open to significant dispute (e.g., Henrich\n1989; Pereboom 1995; Hatfield 2003; Guyer 2010a; Allais 2015: ch. 11).\nSuch dispute naturally includes whether Kant’s strategy in the\nDeduction might well be intelligible in some fashion that does not\npresuppose or otherwise require Intellectualism. For example,\naccording to various Sensibilist readings, the Deduction might be\nconcerned with conditions governing referential thought (Allais 2015:\nch. 11) or the representation of a privileged set of spatial and\ntemporal relations beyond those required for objective representation\nin its most primitive form (Golob 2016b), or the conditions for\nrelating particular property instantiations to some underlying entity\n(McLear 2015: §3; forthcoming-a). In each such case, the Deduction\nis intelligible as attempting to legitimize the categories without\nadverting to Intellectualism. \nThe Sensibilist case for an alternative reading of the Deduction is\nabetted by a significant problem with the Intellectualist proposal\nthat the pure intuitions depend on an intellectual unity. This will be\nexamined in the next subsection. \nThe problem with construing the pure forms of intuition as the product\nof acts of synthesis is that Kant’s characterization of the\nmereological structure of a representation produced by such a\nsynthesis is at odds with his characterization of the mereological\nstructure of the pure intuitions. One version or other of this point\nhas been noted by a variety of scholars (Wilson 1975; Aquila 1994;\nFalkenstein 1995: 139; Mohr 1998: 112–113; Aquila 2001; Bell\n2001; Fichant 2004; Banham 2005: ch.6; Messina 2014; McLear 2015;\nAllison 2015, 410ff; Onof and Schulting 2015; Guyer 2018; Roche 2018).\nHere, in brief, is the most straightforward version of the argument\nchallenging Intellectualism: \nThe evidence for premise (1) comes in part from the third argument in\nthe Metaphysical Exposition of space (fourth in the case of time): \n[I]f one speaks of many spaces, one understands by that only parts of\none and the same unique space. And these parts cannot as it were\nprecede the single all-encompassing space as its components (from\nwhich its composition would be possible), but rather are only thought\nin it. It is essentially single [einig]; the manifold in it,\nthus also the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on\nlimitations. (A24–5/B39) \nEvidence for premise (2) comes in consideration of both Kant’s\npositive characterization of our intellectual activity (this is meant\nto include the activity of the productive imagination) and his\ncontrast of our intellectual forms of representation with God’s\nintuitive intellect. \nKant characterizes our intellectual activity as\n‘discursive’ to denote the manner in which the\nunderstanding acts—viz. moving to and fro, from part to\npart—rather than merely as a synonym for\n‘conceptual’, ‘linguistic’, or\n‘rational’. It is this notion he means to indicate in his\ntalk of “running through” and “gathering\ntogether” (A99) representations. \nIt is this activity of moving from part to part in the connection of\nrepresentations that also informs Kant’s general\ncharacterization of synthesis: \nBy synthesis in the most general sense, however, I understand the\naction of putting different representations together with each other\nand comprehending their manifoldness in one cognition. (A77/B103) \nAdditional support for both premises comes in reflecting on the\nmereological manner in which Kant contrasts our discursive intellect\nwith God’s intuitive intellect: \n[W]e can also conceive of an understanding which, since it is not\ndiscursive like ours but is intuitive, goes from the\nsynthetically universal (of the intuition of a whole\nas such) to the particular, i.e., from the whole to the parts, in\nwhich, therefore, and in whose representation of the whole, there is\nno contingency in the combination of the parts, in\norder to make possible a determinate form of the whole, which is\nneeded by our understanding, which must progress from the parts, as\nuniversally conceived grounds, to the different possible forms, as\nconsequences, that can be subsumed under it. (KU, 5:407) \nThus, if the content of pure intuition is such that the (intuited)\nwhole is prior to its parts, and synthesis is a process that\nessentially moves from part to part, resulting in the reverse\nmereological relation, it cannot be the case that the pure intuitions\nresult from a synthesis. \nHere an Intellectualist might deny that all ‘higher’\ncognitive activity should be understood as ‘discursive’ in\nthe above sense. Hence, a central issue concerns whether it makes\nsense to say that there is a form of synthesis that is non-discursive\nin a manner that does not threaten Kant’s characterization of\nthe structure of pure intuition (Williams 2018). Now, it certainly is\npossible for Intellectualism to defend a more limited claim,\nconcerning only empirical intuition (McLear 2015: 93–95;\nGrüne 2016). But such a restricted version gives up the\ndialectically central motivation that Intellectualism, in claiming a\ndependence of the pure forms of intuition on the intellect, is the\nonly means of making intelligible the argument of the Deduction. Thus,\nretreat to a restricted form of Intellectualism claiming merely that\nparticular empirical intuitions depend on the intellect undermines one\nof the central pillars sustaining the Intellectualist interpretation\n(McLear 2015: 94). \nKant famously describes the imagination (Einbildungskraft) as\na necessary ingredient of perception itself (A120n). This claim has\nplayed an important role in several contemporary interpretations of\nKant’s theory of experience, in both his sense (Young 1988,\n1992; Makkreel 1990; Gibbons 2002; Kneller 2007; Horstmann 2018;\nTolley 2019) and in our modern English sense (see Strawson 1970;\nSellars 1978; Matherne 2015). \nThere are at least three important questions regarding the Imagination\nthat are of particular note with respect to the debate between\nIntellectualism and Sensibilism. First, how imagination is to be\nunderstood as a faculty—i.e., as spontaneous or receptive, as\nsensory or intellectual (Hanna 2008: 62). Second, whether imaginative\nactivity is a form of mental activity that does not require synthesis\nin the “part-to-whole” sense (see especially Waxman 1991,\n2014; Land 2014; Williams 2018). Third, whether the role of\nimagination in the formation of images, and the necessary role of such\nimage formation in cognition (A121) indicates a way in which an\nIntellectualist conception of perception (as opposed to\nintuition) might find a plausible footing (Matherne 2015; Gomes 2017a;\nStephenson 2017; Tolley 2019). \nDiscussion of imagination’s role in perception (in Kant’s\nsense) and image formation is an area which could stand further\nattention. In particular, it seems clear that Kant conceives of images\nas, in some sense, sensory representations. But what kind of sensory\nrepresentations? Are they intuitions? If so, how do images differ from\n‘immediately given’ intuitions? If, as Kant sometimes\nsuggests (e.g., A120-1), image formation is a necessary intermediate\nstage between given sensory states and constructed intellectual\nstates, how might the structure or content of an image possess\nfeatures that make it more than a “mere” sensory state,\nwhile being nevertheless different from judgment (Tracz forthcoming)?\nMoreover, in what sense does image formation require a\n“schema” and in what sense does such schematization\npresent an intermediary between the sensible and the intellectual?\nKant’s notion of a schema is itself much contested, but it seems\nclearly relevant to the case of perception (Longuenesse 2000;\nGrüne 2009; Dunlop 2012; Williams 2012; Matherne 2015; Tolley\n2019). \nAs we saw in\n §1,\n Kant uses the term ‘cognition’ (Erkenntnis) in\ndifferent ways. But the sense of “proper cognition” is\noften that with which he is most concerned, as it marks out the way in\nwhich both stems of our cognitive capacity (i.e., sensibility and\nintellect) must cooperate for cognition, and ultimately substantive\nscientific knowledge, of objects to occur. \nKant construes such cognition as always of a really—i.e.,\nmetaphysically—possible subject matter. As Kant states in a\nfamous footnote in the B-preface of the first Critique: \nTo cognize an object, it is required that I be able to prove\nits possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its\nactuality or a priori through reason). But I can\nthink whatever I like, as long as I do not contradict myself,\ni.e., as long as my concept is a possible thought, even if I cannot\ngive any assurance whether or not there is a corresponding object\nsomewhere within the sum total of all possibilities. But in order to\nascribe objective validity to such a concept (real possibility, for\nthe first sort of possibility was merely logical) something more is\nrequired. (Bxxvi, note) \nIn finite discursive beings the structure of thought is governed\nultimately by the rule of non-contradiction, and in this way concerns\nwhat is logically possible. But an analysis of the contents and laws\nof thought tells us nothing as to whether there really could be an\nobject such as the thought specifies. Thus the real possibility of an\nobject for theoretical cognition can only be determined from an actual\nground provided via experience or via a priori transcendental\nreflection (Chignell 2010; McLear 2016a). And as Kant goes on to note,\nthe “more” that is required for a thought to achieve\ncognition need not always come from theoretical sources, as there may\nbe practical sources of cognition as well (Chignell 2007a; Kain 2010;\nSchafer forthcoming-b). \nA challenge for Intellectualism is to explain how the modal condition\non cognition may be satisfied if intuition is itself the outcome of\nsome synthetic intellectual process (Gomes and Stephenson 2016; McLear\n2016b: §4.3; 2016a: §8.5; cf. Parsons 1964, 1992b; Carson\n1997). There are at least two issues here. The first is that it seems\nthat such intellectual processes could supply only logical as opposed\nto “real” representational constraints. The second (and\nrelated issue) is that Kant’s emphasis on the “the\ntestimony of experience from [the object’s] actuality” is\nat least some evidence for thinking that intuition—as the\nsensory component of empirical cognition or\n“experience”—provides the needed “real”\nconstraint on cognition by giving proof of the real possibility of the\nsubject matter of cognition. This real constraint intuition provides\nvia its presentation of some actuality that grounds this\npossibility. \nReplies to these two challenges dispute the emphasis on the actuality\nof what is presented through intuition, and instead interpret the\nmodal condition fairly weakly, as saying simply that a really possible\nobject must be one that can have spatio-temporal structure (Gomes and\nStephenson 2016: §3.4.1; Grüne 2017a), and so the\n‘proof’ provided through experience is compatible with the\nnon-actuality of the object of experience. According to this proposal,\nevery object of experience or intuition conforms to the conceptual\nformal conditions of experience, namely the categories, because every\nintuition is generated by a synthesis that takes place in accordance\nwith the categories. Thus, every intuition, regardless of whether the\nobject it represents is actual or not, conforms to the formal\nconditions of experience, and is therefore the representation of an\nobject that is really possible. \nMcLear (2016a) has argued against such a response in two ways. First,\nif the representations of space and time, as Intellectualism typically\nargues, are dependent on the intellect, then it is unclear how space\nand time operate as formal but “real” constraints,\nindependent of the intellect, on what is really possible. Second, any\nIntellectualist position that construes the modal condition as\nsatisfied merely by the formal conditions of experience commits itself\nto at least two problematic positions. First, imagined and\nhallucinated experiences will count as cognitions (cf. Beck 1978).\nSecond, Kant’s emphasis on actuality in the Bxxvi note, quoted\nabove, is left unexplained. \nHowever, a corresponding challenge for the Sensibilist position lies\nin explaining how intuitions could be relations to actualities even in\nthe “pure” case of the intuitions of space and\ntime—i.e., those a priori intuitions whose features are\ndescribed in their respective Metaphysical Expositions of space and\ntime in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant is quite clear that the\npure intuitions are intuitions of “ens\nimaginaria” or imaginary beings (see Amphiboly, A291/B347).\nAs imaginary beings, they do not exist. If that is correct then it\ncannot be the case that intuition as such is existentially\ndependent on its relata, since a priori intuitions are certainly\nintuitions, and they lack existing relata. So it would seem that\neither it is false to construe intuitions as always relations to\nactualities or Kant is inconsistent in his treatment of intuition\nacross pure and empirical cases. \nHere, however, the Sensibilist can pursue a strategy of distinguishing\nactuality from existence (Stang 2016a: 34 and 322; McLear 2017: 91\nn10). Kant makes two explicit discussions of this point.\nFirst he is reported as having explicitly distinguished the concept of\nactuality (Wirklichkeit) from existence (Existenz)\nin a lecture from the mid 1790s (Metaphysik K3,\n29:986). Second, in reflexion R6324, 18:647 (between 1790 and\n1793), Kant specifically names time and space as actual but not\nexisting things. \nIf Sensibilism can make good on the plausibility of a distinction\nbetween actuality and existence then it can interpret all intuition as\na relation to an actuality, even if not always to an existent\nactuality, and thus give a straightforward explanation of why\nintuition in especially suited to satisfying the modal condition on\ncognition. \nThis article has examined the ongoing interpretive debate concerning\nKant’s conception of the contribution of the sensible and\nintellectual faculties of the mind to a subject’s sensory\nexperience of the world around it. Two central motivations of the\ndebate are, on the one hand, philosophical concerns about the\nepistemological relationship between sensory experience (broadly\nconstrued) and empirical judgment or belief, and on the other hand,\ninterpretive questions concerning Kant’s conception of the\ncognitive role of intuition and his strategy of argument in the\nTranscendental Deduction. We have seen that there are multiple ways of\nframing the debate, and that even basic issues, such as the central\nlocus of dispute (whether it be intuition, perception, or experience)\nadmit of multiple approaches. Moreover, we saw that the framing of the\ndispute in terms of conceptual content yields various problems, and\nperhaps in part because of such problems current debate seems to have\ncoalesced (either implicitly or explicitly) around an alternative\nframe—viz. whether the generation of intuition depends on, or is\notherwise an expression of, intellectual capacities of one sort or\nanother. Resolution of this question requires navigation of some of\nthe thorniest and most contentious areas of Kant’s philosophy.\nFor this reason, at least, it seems unlikely that we will soon see any\nwidespread convergence on an answer.","contact.mail":"mclear@unl.edu","contact.domain":"unl.edu"}]
