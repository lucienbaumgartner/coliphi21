Adorno was one of the most important philosophers and\nsocial critics in Germany after World War II. Although less well known\namong anglophone philosophers than his contemporary Hans-Georg\nGadamer, Adorno had even greater influence on scholars and\nintellectuals in postwar Germany. In the 1960s he was the most\nprominent challenger to both Sir Karl Popper's philosophy of science\nand Martin Heidegger's philosophy of existence. Jürgen Habermas,\nGermany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's student\nand assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from the\ninterdisciplinary character of his research and of the Frankfurt\nSchool to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness with\nwhich he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially from\nKant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporary\nWestern society. He was a seminal social philosopher and a leading\nmember of the first generation of Critical Theory.\n\n\n\nUnreliable translations hampered the initial reception of Adorno's\npublished work in English speaking countries. Since the 1990s,\nhowever, better translations have appeared, along with newly\ntranslated lectures and other posthumous works that are still being\npublished. These materials not only facilitate an emerging assessment\nof his work in epistemology and ethics but also strengthen an already\nadvanced reception of his work in aesthetics and cultural theory.\n\n\n\nBorn on September 11, 1903 as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund, Adorno lived\nin Frankfurt am Main for the first three decades of his life and the\nlast two (Müller-Doohm 2005, Claussen 2008). He was the only son\nof a wealthy German wine merchant of assimilated Jewish background and\nan accomplished musician of Corsican Catholic descent. Adorno studied\nphilosophy with the neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius and music composition\nwith Alban Berg. He completed his Habilitationsschrift on\nKierkegaard's aesthetics in 1931, under the supervision of the\nChristian socialist Paul Tillich. After just two years as a university\ninstructor (Privatdozent), he was expelled by the Nazis,\nalong with other professors of Jewish heritage or on the political\nleft. A few years later he turned his father's surname into a middle\ninitial and adopted “Adorno,” the maternal surname by which he is best\nknown. \n\nAdorno left Germany in the spring of 1934. During the Nazi era he\nresided in Oxford, New York City, and southern California. There he\nwrote several books for which he later became famous, including\nDialectic of Enlightenment (with Max Horkheimer),\nPhilosophy of New Music, The Authoritarian\nPersonality (a collaborative project), and Minima\nMoralia. From these years come his provocative critiques of mass\nculture and the culture industry. Returning to Frankfurt in 1949 to\ntake up a position in the philosophy department, Adorno quickly\nestablished himself as a leading German intellectual and a central\nfigure in the Institute of Social Research. Founded as a free-standing\ncenter for Marxist scholarship in 1923, the Institute had been led by\nMax Horkheimer since 1930. It provided the hub to what has come to be\nknown as the Frankfurt School. Adorno became the Institute's director\nin 1958. From the 1950s stem In Search of Wagner, Adorno's\nideology-critique of the Nazi's favorite composer; Prisms, a\ncollection of social and cultural studies; Against\nEpistemology, an antifoundationalist critique of Husserlian\nphenomenology; and the first volume of Notes to Literature, a\ncollection of essays in literary criticism.  \n\nConflict and consolidation marked the last decade of Adorno's life.\nA leading figure in the “positivism dispute” in German sociology,\nAdorno was a key player in debates about restructuring German\nuniversities and a lightning rod for both student activists and their\nright-wing critics. These controversies did not prevent him from\npublishing numerous volumes of music criticism, two more volumes of\nNotes to Literature, books on Hegel and on existential\nphilosophy, and collected essays in sociology and in aesthetics.\nNegative Dialectics, Adorno's magnum opus on epistemology and\nmetaphysics, appeared in 1966. Aesthetic Theory, the other\nmagnum opus on which he had worked throughout the 1960s, appeared\nposthumously in 1970. He died of a heart attack on August\n6, 1969, one month shy of his sixty-sixth birthday. \n\nLong before “postmodernism” became fashionable, Adorno and Horkheimer\nwrote one of the most searching critiques of modernity to have emerged\namong progressive European intellectuals. Dialectic of\nEnlightenment is a product of their wartime exile. It first\nappeared as a mimeograph titled Philosophical Fragments in\n1944. This title became the subtitle when the book was published in\n1947. Their book opens with a grim assessment of the modern West:\n“Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of\nthought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and\ninstalling them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates\nunder the sign of disaster triumphant” (DE 1, translation\nmodified). How can this be, the authors ask. How can the progress of\nmodern science and medicine and industry promise to liberate people\nfrom ignorance, disease, and brutal, mind-numbing work, yet help\ncreate a world where people willingly swallow fascist ideology,\nknowingly practice deliberate genocide, and energetically develop\nlethal weapons of mass destruction? Reason, they answer, has become\nirrational. \n\nAlthough they cite Francis Bacon as a leading spokesman for an\ninstrumentalized reason that becomes irrational, Horkheimer and Adorno\ndo not think that modern science and scientism are the sole culprits.\nThe tendency of rational progress to become irrational regress arises\nmuch earlier. Indeed, they cite both the Hebrew scriptures and Greek\nphilosophers as contributing to regressive tendencies. If Horkheimer\nand Adorno are right, then a critique of modernity must also be a\ncritique of premodernity, and a turn toward the postmodern cannot\nsimply be a return to the premodern. Otherwise the failures of\nmodernity will continue in a new guise under contemporary conditions.\nSociety as a whole needs to be transformed. \n\nHorkheimer and Adorno believe that society and culture form a\nhistorical totality, such that the pursuit of freedom in society is\ninseparable from the pursuit of enlightenment in culture (DE xvi).\nThere is a flip side to this: a lack or loss of freedom in\nsociety—in the political, economic, and legal structures within\nwhich we live—signals a concomitant failure in cultural\nenlightenment—in philosophy, the arts, religion, and the\nlike. The Nazi death camps are not an aberration, nor are mindless\nstudio movies innocent entertainment. Both indicate that something\nfundamental has gone wrong in the modern West. \n\nAccording to Horkheimer and Adorno, the source of today's disaster is\na pattern of blind domination, domination in a triple sense: the\ndomination of nature by human beings, the domination of nature within\nhuman beings, and, in both of these forms of domination, the\ndomination of some human beings by others. What motivates such triple\ndomination is an irrational fear of the unknown: “Humans believe\nthemselves free of fear when there is no longer anything unknown. This\nhas determined the path of\ndemythologization … . Enlightenment is mythical fear\nradicalized” (DE 11). In an unfree society whose culture pursues\nso-called progress no matter what the cost, that which is “other,”\nwhether human or nonhuman, gets shoved aside, exploited, or destroyed.\nThe means of destruction may be more sophisticated in the modern West,\nand the exploitation may be less direct than outright slavery, but\nblind, fear-driven domination continues, with ever greater global\nconsequences. The all-consuming engine driving this process is an\never-expanding capitalist economy, fed by scientific research and the\nlatest technologies. \n\nContrary to some interpretations, Horkheimer and Adorno do not\nreject the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Nor do they provide a\nnegative “metanarrative” of universal historical decline. Rather,\nthrough a highly unusual combination of philosophical argument,\nsociological reflection, and literary and cultural commentary, they\nconstruct a “double perspective” on the modern West as a historical\nformation (Jarvis 1998, 23). They summarize this double perspective in\ntwo interlinked theses: “Myth is already enlightenment, and\nenlightenment reverts to mythology” (DE xviii). The first thesis allows\nthem to suggest that, despite being declared mythical and outmoded by\nthe forces of secularization, older rituals,\nreligions, and philosophies may have contributed to the process of\nenlightenment and may still have something worthwhile to contribute.\nThe second thesis allows them to expose ideological and destructive\ntendencies within modern forces of secularization,\nbut without denying either that these forces are progressive and\nenlightening or that the older conceptions they displace were\nthemselves ideological and destructive. \n\nA fundamental mistake in many interpretations of Dialectic of\nEnlightenment occurs when readers take such theses to be\ntheoretical definitions of unchanging categories rather than critical\njudgments about historical tendencies. The authors are not saying that\nmyth is “by nature” a force of enlightenment. Nor are they claiming\nthat enlightenment “inevitably” reverts to mythology. In fact, what\nthey find really mythical in both myth and enlightenment is the thought\nthat fundamental change is impossible. Such resistance to change\ncharacterizes both ancient myths of fate and modern devotion to the\nfacts. \n\nAccordingly, in constructing a “dialectic of enlightenment” the\nauthors simultaneously aim to carry out a dialectical enlightenment of\nenlightenment not unlike Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Two\nHegelian concepts anchor this project, namely, determinate negation\nand conceptual self-reflection. “Determinate negation” (bestimmte\nNegation) indicates that immanent criticism is the way to wrest\ntruth from ideology. A dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment\n“discloses each image as script. It teaches us to read from [the\nimage's] features the admission of falseness which cancels its power\nand hands it over to truth” (DE 18). Beyond and through such\ndeterminate negation, a dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment\nalso recalls the origin and goal of thought itself. Such recollection\nis the work of the concept as the self-reflection of thought (der\nBegriff als Selbstbesinnung des Denkens, DE 32). Conceptual\nself-reflection reveals that thought arises from the very corporeal\nneeds and desires that get forgotten when thought becomes a mere\ninstrument of human self-preservation. It also reveals that the goal\nof thought is not to continue the blind domination of nature and\nhumans but to point toward reconciliation. Adorno works out the\ndetails of this conception in his subsequent lectures on Kant (KC),\nethics (PMP), and metaphysics (MCP) and in his books on Husserl (AE),\nHegel (H), and Heidegger (JA). His most comprehensive statement occurs\nin Negative Dialectics, which is discussed later. \n\nDialectic of Enlightenment presupposes a critical social\ntheory indebted to Karl Marx. Adorno reads Marx as a Hegelian\nmaterialist whose critique of capitalism unavoidably includes a\ncritique of the ideologies that capitalism sustains and requires. The\nmost important of these is what Marx called “the fetishism of\ncommodities.” Marx aimed his critique of commodity fetishism against\nbourgeois social scientists who simply describe the capitalist economy\nbut, in so doing, simultaneously misdescribe it and prescribe a false\nsocial vision. According to Marx, bourgeois economists necessarily\nignore the exploitation intrinsic to capitalist production. They fail\nto understand that capitalist production, for all its surface “freedom”\nand “fairness,” must extract surplus value from the labor of the\nworking class. Like ordinary producers and consumers under capitalist\nconditions, bourgeois economists treat the commodity as a fetish. They\ntreat it as if it were a neutral object, with a life of its own, that\ndirectly relates to other commodities, in independence from the human\ninteractions that actually sustain all commodities. Marx, by contrast,\nargues that whatever makes a product a commodity goes back to human\nneeds, desires, and practices. The commodity would not have “use value”\nif it did not satisfy human wants. It would not have “exchange value”\nif no one wished to exchange it for something else. And its exchange\nvalue could not be calculated if the commodity did not share with other\ncommodities a “value” created by the expenditure of human labor power\nand measured by the average labor time socially necessary to produce\ncommodities of various sorts.  \n\nAdorno's social theory attempts to make Marx's central insights\napplicable to “late capitalism.” Although in agreement with Marx's\nanalysis of the commodity, Adorno thinks his critique of commodity\nfetishism does not go far enough. Significant changes have occurred in\nthe structure of capitalism since Marx's day. This requires revisions\non a number of topics: the dialectic between forces of production and\nrelations of production; the relationship between state and economy;\nthe sociology of classes and class consciousness; the nature and\nfunction of ideology; and the role of expert cultures, such as modern\nart and social theory, in criticizing capitalism and calling for the\ntransformation of society as a whole. \n\nThe primary clues to these revisions come from a theory of\nreification proposed by the Hungarian socialist Georg Lukács in\nthe 1920s and from interdisciplinary projects and debates conducted by\nmembers of the Institute of Social Research in the 1930s and 1940s.\nBuilding on Max Weber's theory of rationalization, Lukács argues\nthat the capitalist economy is no longer one sector of society\nalongside others. Rather, commodity exchange has become the central\norganizing principle for all sectors of society. This allows commodity\nfetishism to permeate all social institutions (e.g., law,\nadministration, journalism) as well as all academic disciplines,\nincluding philosophy. “Reification” refers to “the structural process\nwhereby the commodity form permeates life in capitalist society.”\nLukács was especially concerned with how reification makes human\nbeings “seem like mere things obeying the inexorable laws of the\nmarketplace” (Zuidervaart 1991, 76). \n\nInitially Adorno shared this concern, even though he never had\nLukács's confidence that the revolutionary working class could\novercome reification. Later Adorno called the reification of\nconsciousness an “epiphenomenon.” What a critical social theory really\nneeds to address is why hunger, poverty, and other forms of human\nsuffering persist despite the technological and scientific potential to\nmitigate them or to eliminate them altogether. The root cause, Adorno says,\nlies in how capitalist relations of production have come to dominate\nsociety as a whole, leading to extreme, albeit often invisible,\nconcentrations of wealth and power (ND 189–92). Society has come to be\norganized around the production of exchange values for the sake of\nproducing exchange values, which, of course, always already requires a\nsilent appropriation of surplus value. Adorno refers to this nexus of\nproduction and power as the “principle of exchange”\n(Tauschprinzip). A society where this nexus prevails is an\n“exchange society” (Tauschgesellschaft). \n\nAdorno's diagnosis of the exchange society has three levels:\npolitico-economic, social-psychological, and cultural. Politically and\neconomically he responds to a theory of state capitalism proposed by\nFriedrich Pollock during the war years. An economist by training who\nwas supposed to contribute a chapter to Dialectic of\nEnlightenment but never did (Wiggershaus 1994, 313–19), Pollock\nargued that the state had acquired dominant economic power in Nazi\nGermany, the Soviet Union, and New Deal America. He called this new\nconstellation of politics and economics “state capitalism.” While\nacknowledging with Pollock that political and economic power have\nbecome more tightly meshed, Adorno does not think this fact changes the\nfundamentally economic character of capitalist exploitation. Rather,\nsuch exploitation has become even more abstract than it was in Marx's\nday, and therefore all the more effective and pervasive. \n\nThe social-psychological level in Adorno's diagnosis serves to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and pervasiveness of late capitalist\nexploitation. His American studies of anti-Semitism and the\n“authoritarian personality” argue that these pathologically extend “the\nlogic of late capitalism itself, with its associated dialectic of\nenlightenment.” People who embrace anti-Semitism and fascism tend to\nproject their fear of abstract domination onto the supposed mediators\nof capitalism, while rejecting as elitist “all claims to a qualitative\ndifference transcending exchange” (Jarvis 1998, 63). \n\nAdorno's cultural studies show that a similar logic prevails in\ntelevision, film, and the recording industries. In fact, Adorno first\ndiscovered late capitalism's structural change through his work with\nsociologist Paul Lazarsfeld on the Princeton University Radio Research\nProject. He articulated this discovery in a widely anthologized essay\n“On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening”\n(1938) and in “The Culture Industry,” a chapter in Dialectic of\nEnlightenment.  There Adorno argues that the culture industry\ninvolves a change in the commodity character of art, such that art's\ncommodity character is deliberately acknowledged and art “abjures its\nautonomy” (DE 127). With its emphasis on marketability, the culture\nindustry dispenses entirely with the “purposelessness” that was\ncentral to art's autonomy. Once marketability becomes a total demand,\nthe internal economic structure of cultural commodities\nshifts. Instead of promising freedom from societally dictated uses,\nand thereby having a genuine use value that people can enjoy, products\nmediated by the culture industry have their use value\nreplaced by exchange value: “Everything has value only\nin so far as it can be exchanged, not in so far as it is something in\nitself. For consumers the use value of art, its essence, is a fetish,\nand the fetish—the social valuation [gesellschaftliche\nSchätzung] which they mistake for the merit [Rang]\nof works of art— becomes its only use value, the only quality\nthey enjoy” (DE 128). Hence the culture industry dissolves the\n“genuine commodity character” that artworks once possessed\nwhen exchange value still presupposed use value (DE\n129–30). Lacking a background in Marxist theory, and desiring to\nsecure legitimacy for “mass art” or “popular\nculture,” too many of Adorno's anglophone critics simply ignore\nthe main point to his critique of the culture industry. His main point\nis that culture-industrial hypercommercialization evidences a fateful\nshift in the structure of all commodities and therefore in the\nstructure of capitalism itself. \n\nPhilosophical and sociological studies of the arts and literature make\nup more than half of Adorno's collected works (Gesammelte\nSchriften). All of his most important social-theoretical claims\nshow up in these studies. Yet his “aesthetic writings” are\nnot simply “applications” or “test cases” for\ntheses developed in “nonaesthetic” texts. Adorno rejects\nany such separation of subject matter from methodology and all neat\ndivisions of philosophy into specialized subdisciplines. This is one\nreason why academic specialists find his texts so challenging, not\nonly musicologists and literary critics but also epistemologists and\naestheticians.  All of his writings contribute to a comprehensive and\ninterdisciplinary social philosophy (Zuidervaart 2007). \n\nFirst published the year after Adorno died, Aesthetic Theory\nmarks the unfinished culmination of his remarkably rich body of\naesthetic reflections. It casts retrospective light on the entire\ncorpus. It also comes closest to the model of “paratactical\npresentation” (Hullot-Kentor in AT xi-xxi) that Adorno, inspired\nespecially by Walter Benjamin, found most appropriate for his own\n“atonal philosophy.” Relentlessly tracing concentric circles,\nAesthetic Theory carries out a dialectical double\nreconstruction. It reconstructs the modern art movement from the\nperspective of philosophical aesthetics. It simultaneously\nreconstructs philosophical aesthetics, especially that of Kant and\nHegel, from the perspective of modern art. From both sides Adorno\ntries to elicit the sociohistorical significance of the art and\nphilosophy discussed. \n\nAdorno's claims about art in general stem from his reconstruction of\nthe modern art movement. So a summary of his philosophy of art\nsometimes needs to signal this by putting “modern” in\nparentheses. The book begins and ends with reflections on the social\ncharacter of (modern) art. Two themes stand out in these\nreflections. One is an updated Hegelian question whether art can\nsurvive in a late capitalist world. The other is an updated Marxian\nquestion whether art can contribute to the transformation of this\nworld. When addressing both questions, Adorno retains from Kant the\nnotion that art proper (“fine art” or “beautiful\nart”—schöne Kunst—in Kant's\nvocabulary) is characterized by formal autonomy. But Adorno combines\nthis Kantian emphasis on form with Hegel's emphasis on intellectual\nimport (geistiger Gehalt) and Marx's emphasis on art's\nembeddedness in society as a whole. The result is a complex account of\nthe simultaneous necessity and illusoriness of the artwork's autonomy.\nThe artwork's necessary and illusory autonomy, in turn, is the key to\n(modern) art's social character, namely, to be “the social\nantithesis of society” (AT 8). \n\nAdorno regards authentic works of (modern) art as social monads. The\nunavoidable tensions within them express unavoidable conflicts within\nthe larger sociohistorical process from which they arise and to which\nthey belong. These tensions enter the artwork through the artist's\nstruggle with sociohistorically laden materials, and they call forth\nconflicting interpretations, many of which misread either the\nwork-internal tensions or their connection to conflicts in society as a\nwhole. Adorno sees all of these tensions and conflicts as\n“contradictions” to be worked through and eventually to be resolved.\nTheir complete resolution, however, would require a transformation in\nsociety as a whole, which, given his social theory, does not seem\nimminent. \n\nAs commentary and criticism, Adorno's aesthetic writings are\nunparalleled in the subtlety and sophistication with which they trace\nwork-internal tensions and relate them to unavoidable sociohistorical\nconflicts. One gets frequent glimpses of this in Aesthetic\nTheory. For the most part, however, the book proceeds at the level\nof “third reflections”—reflections on categories employed in actual\ncommentary and criticism, with a view to their suitability for what\nartworks express and to their societal implications. Typically he\nelaborates these categories as polarities or dialectical pairs. \n\nOne such polarity, and a central one in Adorno's theory of artworks\nas social monads, occurs between the categories of import\n(Gehalt) and function (Funktion). Adorno's account of\nthese categories distinguishes his sociology of art from both\nhermeneutical and empirical approaches. A hermeneutical approach would\nemphasize the artwork's inherent meaning or its cultural significance\nand downplay the artwork's political or economic functions. An\nempirical approach would investigate causal connections between the\nartwork and various social factors without asking hermeneutical\nquestions about its meaning or significance. Adorno, by contrast,\nargues that, both as categories and as phenomena, import and function\nneed to be understood in terms of each other. On the one hand, an\nartwork's import and its functions in society can be diametrically\nopposed. On the other hand, one cannot give a proper account of an\nartwork's social functions if one does not raise import-related\nquestions about their significance. So too, an artwork's import\nembodies the work's social functions and has potential relevance for\nvarious social contexts. In general, however, and in line with his\ncritiques of positivism and instrumentalized reason, Adorno gives priority\nto import, understood as societally mediated and socially significant\nmeaning. The social functions emphasized in his own commentaries and\ncriticisms are primarily intellectual functions rather than\nstraightforwardly political or economic functions. This is consistent\nwith a hyperbolic version of the claim that (modern) art is society's\nsocial antithesis: “Insofar as a social function can be predicated for\nartworks, it is their functionlessness” (AT 227). \n\nThe priority of import also informs Adorno's stance on art and\npolitics, which derives from debates with Lukács, Benjamin, and\nBertolt Brecht in the 1930s (Lunn 1982; Zuidervaart 1991,\n28–43). Because of the shift in capitalism's structure, and because of\nAdorno's own complex emphasis on (modern) art's autonomy, he doubts\nboth the effectiveness and the legitimacy of tendentious, agitative,\nor deliberately consciousness-raising art. Yet he does see politically\nengaged art as a partial corrective to the bankrupt aestheticism of\nmuch mainstream art.  Under the conditions of late capitalism, the\nbest art, and politically the most effective, so thoroughly works out\nits own internal contradictions that the hidden contradictions in\nsociety can no longer be ignored. The plays of Samuel Beckett, to whom\nAdorno had intended to dedicate Aesthetic Theory, are\nemblematic in that regard.  Adorno finds them more true than many\nother artworks. \n\nArguably, the idea of “truth content” (Wahrheitsgehalt) is\nthe pivotal center around which all the concentric circles of Adorno's\naesthetics turn (Zuidervaart 1991; Wellmer 1991, 1–35 ; Jarvis 1998,\n90–123). To gain access to this center, one must temporarily suspend\nstandard theories about the nature of truth (whether as\ncorrespondence, coherence, or pragmatic success) and allow for\nartistic truth to be dialectical, disclosive, and\nnonpropositional. According to Adorno, each artwork has its own import\n(Gehalt) by virtue of an internal dialectic between content\n(Inhalt) and form (Form). This import invites\ncritical judgments about its truth or falsity. To do justice to the\nartwork and its import, such critical judgments need to grasp both the\nartwork's complex internal dynamics and the dynamics of the\nsociohistorical totality to which the artwork belongs. The artwork has\nan internal truth content to the extent that the artwork's import can\nbe found internally and externally either true or false. Such truth\ncontent is not a metaphysical idea or essence hovering outside the\nartwork. But neither is it a merely human construct. It is historical\nbut not arbitrary; nonpropositional, yet calling for propositional\nclaims to be made about it; utopian in its reach, yet firmly tied to\nspecific societal conditions. Truth content is the way in which an\nartwork simultaneously challenges the way things are and suggests how\nthings could be better, but leaves things practically unchanged: “Art\nhas truth as the semblance of the illusionless” (AT 132). \n\nAdorno's idea of artistic truth content presupposes the\nepistemological and metaphysical claims he works out most thoroughly\nin Negative Dialectics. These claims, in turn, consolidate\nand extend the historiographic and social-theoretical arguments\nalready canvassed. As Simon Jarvis demonstrates, Negative\nDialectics tries to formulate a “philosophical materialism” that\nis historical and critical but not dogmatic. Alternatively, one can\ndescribe the book as a “metacritique” of idealist philosophy,\nespecially of the philosophy of Kant and Hegel (Jarvis 1998,\n148–74; O'Connor 2004). Adorno says the book aims to complete what he considered his\nlifelong task as a philosopher: “to use the strength of the\n[epistemic] subject to break through the deception [Trug] of\nconstitutive subjectivity” (ND xx). \n\nThis occurs in four stages. First, a long Introduction (ND 1–57)\nworks out a concept of “philosophical experience” that\nboth challenges Kant's distinction between “phenomena” and\n“noumena” and rejects Hegel's construction of\n“absolute spirit.” Then Part One (ND 59–131)\ndistinguishes Adorno's project from the “fundamental\nontology” in Heidegger's Being and Time. Part Two (ND\n133–207) works out Adorno's alternative with respect to the\ncategories he reconfigures from German idealism. Part Three (ND\n209–408), composing nearly half the book, elaborates\nphilosophical “models.” These present negative dialectics\nin action upon key concepts of moral philosophy\n(“freedom”), philosophy of history (“world\nspirit” and “natural history”), and\nmetaphysics. Adorno says the final model, devoted to metaphysical\nquestions, “tries by critical self reflection to give the\nCopernican revolution an axial turn” (ND xx). Alluding to Kant's\nself-proclaimed “second Copernican revolution,” this\ndescription echoes Adorno's comment about breaking through the\ndeception of constitutive subjectivity. \n\nLike Hegel, Adorno criticizes Kant's distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena by arguing that the transcendental conditions of experience\ncan be neither so pure nor so separate from each other as Kant seems\nto claim. As concepts, for example, the a priori categories of the faculty of\nunderstanding (Verstand) would be unintelligible if they were\nnot already about something that is nonconceptual.  Conversely, the\nsupposedly pure forms of space and time cannot simply be nonconceptual\nintuitions. Not even a transcendental philosopher would have access to\nthem apart from concepts about them. So too, what makes possible any\ngenuine experience cannot simply be the “application” of a priori\nconcepts to a priori intuitions via the “schematism” of the\nimagination (Einbildungskraft). Genuine experience is made\npossible by that which exceeds the grasp of thought and\nsensibility. Adorno does not call this excess the “thing in itself,”\nhowever, for that would assume the Kantian framework he\ncriticizes. Rather, he calls it “the nonidentical” (das\nNichtidentische). \n\nThe concept of the nonidentical, in turn, marks the difference between\nAdorno's materialism and Hegel's idealism. Although he shares Hegel's\nemphasis on a speculative identity between thought and being, between\nsubject and object, and between reason and reality, Adorno denies that\nthis identity has been achieved in a positive fashion. For the most\npart this identity has occurred negatively instead. That is to say,\nhuman thought, in achieving identity and unity, has imposed these upon\nobjects, suppressing or ignoring their differences and diversity.\nSuch imposition is driven by a societal formation whose exchange\nprinciple demands the equivalence (exchange value) of what is\ninherently nonequivalent (use value). Whereas Hegel's speculative\nidentity amounts to an identity between identity and nonidentity,\nAdorno's amounts to a nonidentity between identity and nonidentity.\nThat is why Adorno calls for a “negative dialectic” and\nwhy he rejects the affirmative character of Hegel's dialectic (ND\n143–61). \n\nAdorno does not reject the necessity of conceptual identification,\nhowever, nor does his philosophy claim to have direct access to the\nnonidentical. Under current societal conditions, thought can only have\naccess to the nonidentical via conceptual criticisms of false\nidentifications. Such criticisms must be “determinate negations,”\npointing up specific contradictions between what thought claims and\nwhat it actually delivers. Through determinate negation, those aspects\nof the object which thought misidentifies receive an indirect,\nconceptual articulation. \n\nThe motivation for Adorno's negative dialectic is not simply\nconceptual, however, nor are its intellectual resources. His\nepistemology is “materialist” in both regards. It is\nmotivated, he says, by undeniable human suffering—a fact of\nunreason, if you will, to counter Kant's “fact of reason.”\nSuffering is the corporeal imprint of society and the object upon\nhuman consciousness: “The need to let suffering speak is a\ncondition of all truth. For suffering is objectivity that weighs upon\nthe subject … ” (ND 17–18). The resources available\nto philosophy in this regard include the “expressive” or\n“mimetic” dimensions of language, which conflict with\n“ordinary” (i.e., societally sanctioned) syntax and\nsemantics. In philosophy, this requires an emphasis on\n“presentation” (Darstellung) in which logical\nstringency and expressive flexibility interact (ND 18–19,\n52–53). Another resource lies in unscripted relationships among\nestablished concepts. By taking such concepts out of their established\npatterns and rearranging them in “constellations” around a\nspecific subject matter, philosophy can unlock some of the historical\ndynamic hidden within objects whose identity exceeds the\nclassifications imposed upon them (ND 52–53, 162–66). \n\nWhat unifies all of these desiderata, and what most clearly\ndistinguishes Adorno's materialist epistemology from “idealism,”\nwhether Kantian or Hegelian, is his insisting on the “priority of the\nobject” (Vorrang des Objekts, ND 183–97). Adorno regards as\n“idealist” any philosophy that affirms an identity between subject and\nobject and thereby assigns constitutive priority to the epistemic\nsubject. In insisting on the priority of the object, Adorno repeatedly\nmakes three claims: first, that the epistemic subject is itself\nobjectively constituted by the society to which it belongs and without\nwhich the subject could not exist; second, that no object can be fully\nknown according to the rules and procedures of identitarian thinking;\nthird, that the goal of thought itself, even when thought forgets its\ngoal under societally induced pressures to impose identity on objects,\nis to honor them in their nonidentity, in their difference from what a\nrestricted rationality declares them to be. Against empiricism,\nhowever, he argues that no object is simply “given” either, both\nbecause it can be an object only in relation to a subject and because\nobjects are historical and have the potential to change. \n\nUnder current conditions the only way for philosophy to give priority\nto the object is dialectically, Adorno argues. He describes dialectics\nas the attempt to recognize the nonidentity between thought and the\nobject while carrying out the project of conceptual\nidentification. Dialectics is “the consistent consciousness of\nnonidentity,” and contradiction, its central category, is “the\nnonidentical under the aspect of identity.” Thought itself forces this\nemphasis on contradiction upon us, he says. To think is to identify,\nand thought can achieve truth only by identifying. So the semblance\n(Schein) of total identity lives within thought itself,\nmingled with thought's truth (Wahrheit). The only way to\nbreak through the semblance of total identity is immanently, using the\nconcept. Accordingly, everything that is qualitatively different and\nthat resists conceptualization will show up as a contradiction. “The\ncontradiction is the nonidentical under the aspect of [conceptual]\nidentity; the primacy of the principle of contradiction in dialectics\ntests the heterogeneous according to unitary thought\n[Einheitsdenken]. By colliding with its own boundary\n[Grenze], unitary thought surpasses itself. Dialectics is the\nconsistent consciousness of nonidentity” (ND 5). \n\nBut thinking in contradictions is also forced upon philosophy by\nsociety itself. Society is riven with fundamental antagonisms, which,\nin accordance with the exchange principle, get covered up by\nidentitarian thought. The only way to expose these antagonisms, and\nthereby to point toward their possible resolution, is to think against\nthought—in other words, to think in contradictions. In this way\n“contradiction” cannot be ascribed neatly to either thought or\nreality.  Instead it is a “category of reflection”\n(Reflexionskategorie) , enabling a thoughtful confrontation\nbetween concept (Begriff) and subject matter or object\n(Sache): “To proceed dialectically means to think in\ncontradictions, for the sake of the contradiction already experienced\nin the object [Sache], and against that contradiction. A\ncontradiction in reality, [dialectics] is a contradiction against\nreality” (ND 144–45). \n\nThe point of thinking in contradictions is not simply negative,\nhowever. It has a fragile, transformative horizon, namely, a society\nthat would no longer be riven with fundamental antagonisms, thinking\nthat would be rid of the compulsion to dominate through conceptual\nidentification, and the flourishing of particular objects in their\nparticularity. Because Adorno is convinced that contemporary society\nhas the resources to alleviate the suffering it nevertheless\nperpetuates, his negative dialectics has a utopian reach: “In view of\nthe concrete possibility of utopia, dialectics is the ontology of the\nfalse condition. A right condition would be freed from dialectics, no\nmore system than contradiction” (ND 11). Such a “right condition”\nwould be one of reconciliation between humans and nature, including\nthe nature within human beings, and among human beings\nthemselves. This idea of reconciliation sustains Adorno's reflections\non ethics and metaphysics. \n\nLike Adorno's epistemology, his moral philosophy derives from a\nmaterialistic metacritique of German idealism. The model on “Freedom”\nin Negative Dialectics (ND 211–99) conducts a metacritique of\nKant's critique of practical reason. So too, the model on “World\nSpirit and Natural History” (ND 300–60) provides a metacritique of\nHegel's philosophy of history. Both models simultaneously carry out a\nsubterranean debate with the Marxist tradition, and this debate guides\nAdorno's appropriation of both Kantian and Hegelian “practical\nphilosophy.” \n\nThe first section in the Introduction to Negative Dialectics\nindicates the direction Adorno's appropriation will take (ND\n3–4). There he asks whether and how philosophy is still\npossible. Adorno asks this against the backdrop of Karl Marx's\nTheses on Feuerbach, which famously proclaimed that\nphilosophy's task is not simply to interpret the world but to change\nit. In distinguishing his historical materialism from the sensory\nmaterialism of Ludwig Feuerbach, Marx portrays human beings as\nfundamentally productive and political organisms whose interrelations\nare not merely interpersonal but societal and historical. Marx's\nemphasis on production, politics, society, and history takes his\nepistemology in a “pragmatic”\ndirection. “Truth” does not indicate the abstract\ncorrespondence between thought and reality, between proposition and\nfact, he says. Instead, “truth” refers to the economic,\npolitical, societal, and historical fruitfulness of thought in\npractice. \n\nAlthough Adorno shares many of Marx's anthropological intuitions, he\nthinks that a twentieth-century equation of truth with practical\nfruitfulness had disastrous effects on both sides of the iron curtain.\nThe Introduction to Negative Dialectics begins by making two\nclaims. First, although apparently obsolete, philosophy remains\nnecessary because capitalism has not been overthrown. Second, Marx's\ninterpretation of capitalist society was inadequate and his critique\nis outmoded. Hence, praxis no longer serves as an adequate basis for\nchallenging (philosophical) theory. In fact, praxis serves mostly as a\npretext for shutting down the theoretical critique that transformative\npraxis would require. Having missed the moment of its realization (via\nthe proletarian revolution, according to early Marx), philosophy today\nmust criticize itself: its societal naivete, its intellectual\nantiquation, its inability to grasp the power at work in industrial\nlate capitalism. While still pretending to grasp the whole, philosophy\nfails to recognize how thoroughly it depends upon society as a whole,\nall the way into philosophy's “immanent truth” (ND\n4). Philosophy must shed such naivete. It must ask, as Kant asked\nabout metaphysics after Hume's critique of rationalism, How is\nphilosophy still possible? More specifically, How, after the collapse\nof Hegelian thought, is philosophy still possible? How can the\ndialectical effort to conceptualize the nonconceptual—which Marx\nalso pursued—how can this philosophy be continued? \n\nThis self-implicating critique of the relation between theory and\npractice is one crucial source to Adorno's reflections on ethics and\nmetaphysics. Another is the catastrophic impact of twentieth-century\nhistory on the prospects for imagining and achieving a more humane\nworld. Adorno's is an ethics and metaphysics “after Auschwitz”\n(Bernstein 2001, 371–414; Zuidervaart 2007, 48–76). Ethically, he\nsays, Hitler's barbarism imposes a “new categorical imperative” on\nhuman beings in their condition of unfreedom: so to arrange their\nthought and action that “Auschwitz would not repeat itself, [that]\nnothing similar would happen” (ND 365). Metaphysically, philosophers\nmust find historically appropriate ways to speak about meaning and\ntruth and suffering that neither deny nor affirm the existence of a\nworld transcendent to the one we know. Whereas denying it would\nsuppress the suffering that calls out for fundamental change,\nstraightforwardly affirming the existence of utopia would cut off the\ncritique of contemporary society and the struggle to change it. The\nbasis for Adorno's double strategy is not a hidden ontology, as some\nhave suggested, but rather a “speculative” or “metaphysical”\nexperience. Adorno appeals to the experience that thought which “does\nnot decapitate itself” flows into the idea of a world where “not only\nextant suffering would be abolished but also suffering that is\nirrevocably past would be revoked” (403). Neither logical positivist\nantimetaphysics nor Heideggerian hypermetaphysics can do justice to\nthis experience. \n\nAdorno indicates his own alternative to both traditional metaphysics\nand more recent antimetaphysics in passages that juxtapose resolute\nself-criticism and impassioned hope. His historiographic, social\ntheoretical, aesthetic, and negative dialectical concerns meet in\npassages such as this: Addressing such passages is crucial in the ongoing assessment of\nAdorno's philosophy.","contact.mail":"LambertZ@icscanada.edu","contact.domain":"icscanada.edu"}]
