C.E.) was a Neoplatonist philosopher born in\nTyre in Phoenicia. He studied with Longinus in Athens and then with\nPlotinus in Rome from 263–269 C.E. and became a follower of the\nlatter’s version of Platonism. Porphyry wrote in just about\nevery branch of learning practiced at the time but only a portion of\nhis large output is extant. Porphyry was an influential thinker. He\napplied Neoplatonism to pagan religion and other spheres and is, as\nsuch, a key figure in the promulgation of Neoplatonic thought. His\nwritings on Aristotle’s logical works, preserved in part and\ninfluential in the Latin West through Boethius’ translations,\ncontain attempts to harmonize Aristotle’s logical writings with\nPlatonism. Such reconciliatory attitude towards Aristotle\ncharacterizes much of his philosophy.\n\nPorphyry was born in Tyre in Phoenicia (now in Lebanon), probably in\n234 C.E. His name was ‘Malcus’, ‘king’ in his\nnative tongue, hence he became ‘Basileus’\n(‘king’) in Greek. He, however, calls himself Porphyry,\nwhich supposedly was a common name in Tyre, the city of purple, and is\ngenerally known under that name. Little is known with certainty about\nhis life, except what can be gleaned from his own account of\nPlotinus’ life, The Life of Plotinus. There is an\naccount of his life in Eunapius’ Lives of Philosophers and\nSophists but this account clearly depends on the The Life of\nPlotinus and has little reliable to add. Before he came to study\nwith Plotinus in Rome in 263 C.E. he studied with the Middle Platonist\nLonginus in Athens. In Rome he stayed for some five years and\nconverted to Plotinus’ version of Platonism. On Plotinus’\nadvice he left Rome for Sicily in order to recover from a bout of\ndepression in 268 C.E. He must have stayed there for some time, even\nbeyond Plotinus’ death in 270 C.E. There are some untrustworthy\nreports about a school of Porphyry in Rome after Plotinus’\ndeath. In reality we do not know anything with certainty about where\nhe lived in the latter half of his life. He may have been\nIamblichus’ teacher. The evidence for this, however, is not\nbeyond dispute. It is clear, though, that Iamblichus was strongly\ninfluenced by Porphyry, even if he turned vehemently against him.\nTowards the end of his life (301 C.E.), Porphyry edited\nPlotinus’ writings, the Enneads, dividing them into six\nbooks of nine treatises each, which he prefaced with his Life of\nPlotinus. The latter is the most reliable and the most\ninformative source about his life and attitudes. He married fairly\nlate an older wife, for whom one of his extant writings, the\nLetter to Marcella, is written. \nPorphyry was a prolific author who wrote about a whole range of\ntopics. There are some sixty works attributed to him, but most of them\nare now lost or survive in mere fragments. Extant (though not all\ncomplete) are: Life of Plotinus, Life of Pythagoras,\nLetter to Marcella, On Abstinence from Eating Food from\nAnimals, Starting-points Leading to the Intelligibles\n(usually called the Sententiae; in Latin the work is called\nSententiae ad intelligibilia ducentes), the Isagoge\n(Introduction), On the cave of the Nymphs,\nIntroduction to Ptolemy’s opus quadripartitum (see\nBezza 2012) and there are commentaries on Ptolemy’s\nHarmonics and Aristotle’s Categories. An\nextant work attributed to Galen, To Gaurus, is almost\ncertainly by him. There are fragments of a history of philosophy and\nfragments of a number of works on psychology. One such work, the\nSymmikta zetemata, has been partly reconstructed by Heinrich\nDörrie (1959). It has been argued by Pierre Hadot (1968 and\nseveral articles) that Porphyry is the author of anonymous fragments\nof a commentary on Plato’s Parmenides. This attribution\nhas been widely accepted but also forcefully challenged (see below).\nHe also wrote commentaries on Plato’s Timaeus and\nseveral works by Aristotle. The fragments of these are given in Smith\n1993, which contains the extant fragments and testimonia of Porphyry.\nIn addition we know that Porphyry wrote on such diverse subjects as\ngrammar, philology, rhetoric, and geometry. Against the\nChristians is perhaps Porphyry’s best known title. Of this\nlarge work only some fragments have survived. \nIn his monumental study, La vie de Porphyre (1913), Bidez\nportrayed the young Porphyry as someone prone to religion and\nsuperstition. He was supposed to have become a more rational thinker\nduring his sojourn with Plotinus, though later to have relapsed to\nsome extent into his previous mode. Later research has found that\nthere is no clear support for such a view of Porphyry’s\ndevelopment. He may throughout his life have used different styles,\nperhaps aiming at different readerships, while maintaining somehow\nboth his proneness for religion and superstition and his rational\ntendencies. \nIt is clear that Porphyry was a very learned man. He is sometimes\nclaimed as a highly important promulgator of the late ancient branch\nof Platonism (usually called ‘Neoplatonism’) rather than\nas an original philosopher. The former claim is certainly true: he\napplied Neoplatonic doctrines to traditional pagan religion and myths\nand was in many respects a more extrovert thinker interested in\napplying Platonic philosophy to various spheres than his master,\nPlotinus. The judgment that he was unoriginal may, however, be\noverhasty, since the sample of his writings we are left with is very\nsmall and among these his more theoretical works are clearly\nunderrepresented. What we have and know to be his, however, does not\nindicate drastic theoretical innovations, except in the sphere of the\nphilosophy of logic and language. To judge from the evidence of\nsubsequent ancient Platonists, Porphyry was an independent philosopher\nwhose views were taken very seriously indeed. Late ancient Platonists,\nhowever, often mention him in the pair “Plotinus and\nPorphyry”. So, as should be clear from what already has been\nsaid, Porphyrian scholarship, when soberly done, is filled with\ncaveats: we rarely know when he wrote what, and we do not know for\nsure what his philosophical doctrines were. What is extant suggests a\nclose doctrinal affinity with Plotinus, except for the fragment of the\nParmenides commentary for which the authorship and\nrelationship to Porphyry is disputed. To this we can add\nPorphyry’s take on Aristotle’s Categories with\nconsequences for his view on the structure of the sensible realm.\nThus, we are faced with a figure whom we know to have been respected\nin late antiquity, who was influential long beyond then, but we do not\nknow with any certainty what he stood for philosophically or what was\noriginal with him in the central areas of philosophy. \nIt seems safe to assume that before his encounter with Plotinus,\nPorphyry’s philosophical views were shaped by Longinus, Numenius\nand other Middle Platonists, in addition to Plato, Aristotle and other\nclassics of Greek philosophy. After meeting with him he turned into a\nfollower of Plotinus, even if some of his Middle Platonist background\nshows through also in his post-Plotinian phase. This picture is\nstrongly suggested both by his Life of Plotinus and the\nSententiae, the only extant work in which he lays out his\nbasic philosophical views that is with certainty attributable to\nhim. \nFor Plotinus and Porphyry, there is a categorical gap between two\nrealms, the sensible and the intelligible. The latter realm contains\nthree “hypostases” (three different ontological levels),\nthe One, Intellect and Soul. Of these, the One is the first cause of\neverything else; it is characterized by sheer unity which renders it\nbeyond thought and beyond description in language. Intellect is the\nsphere of real being, identified with the Platonic Forms, which are\nthe thoughts of a universal intellect. Soul, the lowest of the\nintelligible hypostases, is the intelligible item directly responsible\nfor the sensible realm. The sensible realm, which is an imperfect\nimage of the intelligible, also consists of levels: There are\norganisms, of which the sensible cosmos is one, comprising the other,\nlesser organisms. Organisms are ensouled beings and thus include an\nintelligible component. Below them on the scale are forms in matter,\nbodies, and matter itself. These too are results of Soul’s\ncreative activity but are not intelligible entities. \nThe relationship between these levels is in general described in terms\nof a doctrine of double activity: each higher level has its\ncharacteristic internal activity which is accompanied by an external\npower or activity which constitutes the level below. This talk of\ninternal and external activities (powers) is equivalent to what is\nknown as the relationship between paradigms and imitations in\ntraditional Platonism. \nHuman beings have, so to speak, one leg in each realm: Through the\nbody and its non-rational soul (the seat of appetitive and spirited\ndesires and sense-perception) they belong to the sensible realm,\nthrough their higher soul (intellect) to the intelligible. Actually,\nthe true human being is to be identified with the intellect and the\nintelligible Man. It follows from this that the task set for human\nbeings is to free themselves from the sensible and live by the\nintelligible, which after all is their true or real nature. \nThis is Plotinus’ philosophy, which Porphyry shares, in broad\noutline (see entry on\n Plotinus).\n There are, however, some differences in terminology, which show\nPorphyry to have a certain scholarly bent that Plotinus avoids, and\nPorphyry is in general more interested in reconciling Aristotle with\nPlatonism than Plotinus was. This is seen, for example, in\nPorphyry’s more positive attitude towards the doctrine of\nAristotele’s Categories. In what follows, we focus on\nsome points where Porphyry diverges from Plotinus or has been taken to\ndiverge from him, or may seem to develop his thought. \nIn the Platonic tradition before Porphyry, Plutarch and Plotinus\nalready interpreted classical Greek mythology as philosophical\nallegories (the Stoics were first to establish this practice).\nPorphyry, however, takes this much further than his Platonic\npredecessors and does it more systematically. This is revealed, e.g.,\nin his attitude towards Homer, whose texts he takes to have a hidden,\nphilosophical meaning behind the literal one (see The Cave of the\nNymphs). He wrote a work entitled Philosophy from\nOracles, which survives only in a few fragments (F343–F350\n[Smith 1993]). We have only a vague idea about its contents but\npresumably it presented some kind of synthesis of pagan oracles and\ncults with Platonic philosophy. It is a characteristic of\npost-Iamblichean Neoplatonism (330 AD onwards) that religion,\nreligious rites and even magic (theurgy) were taken to be an\nalternative way to the soul’s salvation, beside philosophy.\nPorphyry did not share this view and was scolded for his skeptical\nattitude towards theurgy by Iamblichus, his presumably former student,\nin the latter’s Reply to Porphyry. Iamblichus’\ncensure was actually not limited to Porphyry’s attitude towards\ntheurgy, it concerned fundamental ontological issues as well (see\narticle on\n Iamblichus\n 5.3.). Porphyry did not reject magic outright, however, but he seems\nto have restricted its efficacy to the sphere of nature and not to\nhave regarded it as a means to establish contact with the intelligible\nrealm as philosophy could do (see Smith 2011b). His interpretation and\nconcerns with religious matters, however, opened for the developments\nundertaken by Iamblichus and the subsequent tradition of pagan\nNeoplatonism. Somewhat disappointingly, perhaps, the fragments from\nAgainst the Christians do not exhibit deep metaphysical\ndisagreements; they are mostly concerned with particular,\nnon-philosophical claims made in the Bible and by Christians that\nPorphyry finds incredible and objectionable. \nAs regards his views on the soul, Porphyry seems in all essentials to\nfollow Plotinus. In addition to the Sententiae, On\nAbstinence and To Gaurus, there are quite a few\nfragments of other works bearing on his psychological views, preserved\nespecially in Nemesius, Stobaeus, and St. Augustine. \nThe soul is an intelligible entity but, as noted above, it is the\nintelligible entity that is directly engaged with the sensible realm.\nIntelligible entities are incorporeal and without extension and not\npresent in bodies as in place. Following Plotinus, Porphyry\ndistinguishes between the soul in itself, which seems to be identical\nthe rational soul, and a second power of the rational, the lower soul,\nwhich is the soul in relation to the body and is alone directly\nengaged with it (Sent. 4). The lower soul is responsible for\nsoul-functions that directly involve the body, such as\nsense-perception, desires, emotions and purely biological functions\nsuch as growth. In the tradition before Porphyry, this distinction\nsometimes became so sharp that it was supposed that each person has\ntwo distinct souls. Porphyry, by contrast, insists on the unity of the\nhuman soul: the lower functions are powers that depend on the rational\nsoul (see Deuse 1983: 169–217). The distinction between the soul\nitself and its powers (the lower soul) is an instance of the\ndistinction between internal and external acts, mentioned above. Thus,\nthe soul itself has an intellectual activity that has the second\npowers or lower soul as its external act. \nCertain problems arise in accounting for how something which in itself\nis incorporeal can be present in an extended body, as the soul\napparently is. Porphyry resolves this by saying that the soul is not\nlocally present in the body but is present to it by a certain\ndisposition or inclination towards the body (Sent.3; 4). In a\npassage preserved in Nemesius, On the Nature of Man, he says\nthat when something intelligible enters into a relation to some place\nor to a thing in a place, it is by a misuse of language that we say\nthat it is there. Because its activity is there, we speak of the place\nwhen we should speak of the relation to it and the activity. When one\nshould say “it acts there” we misleadingly say “it\nis there” (Nem. 3, 112–114; cf. Sent. 28). From\nPorphyry’s “inquiry” (zētema) about\nthe relation preserved by Nemesius we further learn that the embodied\nsoul’s relation to the body is a case of “unfused\nunion” (asynchytos henōsis), (3, 1–185;\nDörrie 1959: cap. 2). This implies a relationship that amounts to\na fusion in which the two ingredients, however, retain their identity\nand can in principle be separated. Here, perhaps typically, Porphyry\nmakes use of Stoic theories about mixtures but comes up with an\naccount that does not essentially depart from Plotinus (see Emilsson\n1994: 5357ff.). In Against Boethus (a Peripatetic philosopher\nof the 1st century B.C.), fragments of which are preserved by\nEusebius, Porphyry argues that a distinction must be made between the\nsoul as the form of the body, what makes the body alive, and the soul\nas an intellective, transcendent entity, which is its essential\nnature. This latter soul is immortal and Boethus makes the mistake of\nconfusing the two (see Karamanolis 2006: 91–98 and Trabattoni\n2020). \nFor Porphyry, as for Plotinus, what matters most in life is to free\none’s soul from the calamities of the body and the sensible\nworld in general so that it may become purely what it originally and\nessentially is, viz., a part of the intelligible world. Thus, reason\nshould endeavor to elevate itself to the level of the Intellect, which\nis distinguished by a much higher degree of unity than the mere\nordinary use of reason is capable of. It may even be possible to rise\nabove this to the level of the One itself. There seems to be a certain\ndifference in Porphyry’s and Plotinus’ emphasis here,\nhowever. Whereas Plotinus stresses episodic escapes in this life by\nmeans of philosophy, Porphyry, while admitting this possibility, seems\nto suppose that the soul may, after successive reincarnations, free\nitself from the sensible realm for good. At least according to some of\nthe evidence, he, however, rejects the incarnation of human souls into\nanimal bodies and interprets Platonic passages suggesting this as not\nliterally intended (see Smith 1984 and Deuse 1983: 129–159). \nScholars now universally agree that the work, To Gaurus on How\nEmbryos are Ensouled attributed to Galen in the manuscripts, is\nnot by him but by Porphyry. There is now a fine edition, translations\nand commentaries of this work (Wilberding 2011; Brisson et al. 2012).\nThough arguably an elaboration of Plotinus’ views, in To\nGaurus Porphyry gives the details of a very interesting account\nof the development of the embryo and its relations to the parents (see\nin particular Wilberding 2008). Among other things Porphyry gives an\nexplanation of how and why children resemble both their parents: the\nembryo develops from the seed of the father but it does not have a\nsoul of its own. It is ruled by the vegetative soul of the mother who\nputs a permanent stamp on the embryo through a process of blending in\nwhich the nature of the embryo retains its individuality. The account\ngiven diverges significantly from those of previous thinkers, allowing\nfor much greater influence of the mother. \nPorphyry is on record for his defense of vegetarianism in his On\nAbstinence. This work is addressed to a friend (an associate of\nPlotinus’ circle in Rome) and former vegetarian who has resumed\nthe consumption of meat. On the one hand, Porphyry’s abstinence\nfrom eating animals is motivated by the goal, mentioned above, of\nfreeing oneself from the body and the sensible realm as much as\npossible. The exhortation is addressed to those who have set\nthemselves such a goal. There are, however, ethical concerns as well.\nPorphyry accords certain rationality to the animals and in general\nemphasizes what they have in common with us humans. He claims that it\nis plainly unjust to harm those who intend no harm against us, and\nthis applies to the animals. So his vegetarianism is also a matter of\njustice (Tuominen 2015). The evidence suggests, however, that he did\nnot hold this view consistently: in his Philosophy from the\nOracles (see Smith 1993) he accepts animal sacrifices and does\nnot object to them on principle in his Letter to Anebo. \nIn Sententiae 32 Porphyry presents his views on the virtues,\nwhich, though a development of Plotinus’ account in\nEnnead I. 2, are interesting in their own right. He\ndistinguishes between four kinds of virtue: civic, purgative,\ncontemplative and paradigmatic. The four kinds of virtue are\nhierarchically ordered so that paradigmatic virtue comprises in some\nway all the rest (paradigmatic virtues are the Platonic Forms, or\nparadigms, of the different virtues). On the other hand, even if,\ne.g., civic virtue naturally leads to purgative virtue, a person may\nbe virtuous at the civic level without possessing the higher forms. On\nall four levels Porphyry posits the four cardinal virtues of\nPlato’s Republic (wisdom, courage, temperance and\njustice). The civic virtues are concerned with the virtuous actions of\nordinary life—wise, temperate, just and courageous. These\ncardinal virtues are differently, albeit analogously, defined in the\ncase of each level. Thus, e.g., wisdom as a purgative virtue is\ndefined as the soul’s “not forming opinions in accordance\nwith the body, but acting on its own”, whereas wisdom as a\ncontemplative virtue consists in the contemplation of the essences\ninherent in Intellect. Thus, the virtues form a hierarchy where the\ninferior may be seen as a weaker manifestation of the superior. This\ntheory of virtue is a clever attempt at reconciling the\nRepublic, the Phaedo and the Theaetetus and\nfitting their teaching about virtue into a coherent Platonic\nmetaphysics. This kind of account of the virtues was accepted and\nexpanded on by later Neoplatonists. \nInteresting differences between Porphyry and Plotinus can be detected\nin their respective views on the emotions and on happiness. While\nPlotinus holds that the emotions should be eradicated and that\nhappiness consists in the life of Intellect alone, the perfect life\n(Ennead I.4.3), Porphyry recommends metriopatheia,\n“moderate emotions”, and allows for degrees of happiness.\nNot only the intellectually virtuous person is happy, the civically\nvirtuous person is happy too, even if this is a lower form of\nhappiness (see Karamanolis 2006: 303–308). These differences\nreflect Porphyry’s endeavor to bring Plato and Aristotle into\nharmony. \nThe hierarchy of hypostases the One, Intellect and Soul has already\nbeen sketched. Given the available texts with certainty attributable\nto Porphyry, in particular the Sententiae, there would be no\nstrong reason for supposing Porphyry’s metaphysics to differ\nsignificantly from that of Plotinus, though he does not always follow\nhis vocabulary. Furthermore, Porphyry has a different and more\nAristotelian conception of the branches of philosophy than Plotinus,\nwho claims dialectic as the supreme philosophical method (Hadot 1966;\nStrange 2007; cf. Plotinus, Ennead I. 3). This different\nconception is shown, for instance, in his arrangement of\nPlotinus’ treatises which follows a pattern of ethics, physics,\npsychology, and ontology. \nAs mentioned above, Hadot (1968) made a case for identifying Porphyry\nas the author of the so-called Anonymous commentary on Plato’s\nParmenides. The late ancient author of this commentary,\nextant in mere fragments, takes the Parmenides to present\nPlato’s ontological view. The commentary employs a notion of the\nOne as an ineffable first principle that according to Hadot makes it\npost-Plotinian. However, in the commentary the distinction between the\nfirst and the second hypostasis is somewhat blurred: the ineffable One\nis somehow also at the same time the first member\n(“Father”) in a triad of being, life and intelligence and\nin this context identical with being. Positing a first principle that\nis a part of such a composite is surely un-Plotinian. If Hadot’s\nidentification of the author with Porphyry is right, Porphyry indeed\nheld metaphysical views that differ significantly from those of\nPlotinus. However, even if Hadot’s hypothesis about Porphyry as\nthe author of the commentary quickly won wide acceptance, in later\nyears it has suffered several blows at the hands of scholars with the\nresult that it must be considered highly questionable (see, e.g.,\nEdwards 1990, Bechtle 1999, Corrigan 2000, Rasimus 2011). The\ndiscovery that most of the supposedly Porphyrian characteristics of\nthe Parmenides commentary are to be found in pre-Porphyrian\nGnostic texts (unavailable to Hadot in the 1960s) seems especially\ntroublesome for Hadot’s thesis (see Rasimus 2011).\nPorphyry’s authorship has, however, been recently defended by\nChiaradonna (2014). Smith (1987, 2007), though unwilling to assert\nPorphyry as the author, holds that it comes from his circle and,\nhence, is definitely post-Plotinian. \nPorphyry was the first Platonist to write proper commentaries on\nAristotle’s logical works and indeed on Aristotle generally\n(Karamanolis 2004) and from what can be gathered from what is extant\nhe does so without assuming a strong Platonist point of view. There is\nan extant commentary of his on Aristotle’s Categories\nand another longer one in seven books, Ad Gedalium. This\nlatter work was for centuries known only in mere short fragments from\nlater commentators but a plausible case has been made that a recently\ndiscovered palimpsest contains a substantial portion of it\n(Chiaradonna et al. 2013). He also wrote commentaries on other parts\nof Aristotle´s Organon. He wrote the Isagoge,\nwhich is an introduction to Aristotle’s logical works in\ngeneral. Through these logical writings Porphyry established himself\nas an important figure in the history of logic. He is the instigator\nof the tradition followed by subsequent Neoplatonists of taking\nAristotle’s Categories as a basic introductory text and\nhis Isagoge in particular served as a standard introductory\ntext in Byzantium, the Arabic world and in the Latin West through\nBoethius’ translations and commentary. These texts served as a\nbasic introductory texts in philosophy for at least 1000 years. \nPlatonists before Plotinus differed in their attitude towards\nAristotle (see Karamanolis 2006). Porphyry belongs to those who\nbelieved that Plato and Aristotle can be harmonized and in this he is\nfollowed by just about all subsequent ancient Platonists. A preserved\ntitle of a lost works of his, On the differences between Plato and\nAristotle, may seem to give contrary indications (he is also\nsupposed to have written a work about the unity of their thought).\nAdmitting some differences is compatible with a fundamentally\nreconciliatory attitude (cf. Karamanolis 2006: 243ff.). This positive\nattitude towards Aristotle is particularly evident from his position\non Aristotle’s Categories. The question arises how such\nan attitude can be reconciled with those passages in Aristotle that\nseem to disagree with Plato, sometimes expressly. We do not know how\nPorphyry dealt with others of these, besides Aristotle’s\nCategories, which appears to modern readers in many respects\nto be an anti-Platonic work. This is especially notable in its claim\nthat particular sensible substances are prior to the universal species\nand genera. Porphyry solves this dilemma by insisting that the\nso-called Aristotelian categories—substance, quality, quantity\netc., dealt with in the Categories—are\n“significant expressions”. That is to say, the\nCategories is not a work in primary ontology but rather a\nwork about the expressions used to signify the sensible things around\nus and that the sense in which these are first or primary is that they\nare the first we meet with in our experience (58, 1ff.). The class of\nbeings signified by a universal term of this sort is indeed prior to\nthe universal term, e.g., the class of pale things to the universal\nterm ‘pale’. As Strange (1987, 1992) notes, this, however,\ndoes not affect the basic ontology. So interpreted the\nCategories is innocuous from a Platonic point of view: the\nrealm of Platonic intelligible Forms, which are universals of a\ndifferent kind than the expressions involved in the\nCategories, can be kept intact. The universals the\nIsagoge and Porphyry’s commentaries on the\nCategories are concerned with are post rem\nuniversals abstracted by the mind from external objects met with\nthrough sense-perception. \nThe extant commentary on the Categories mentions only a dual\nsemantic relation, that between signifying expressions (words) and\nthings, whereas other sources attribute to Porphyry a triadic relation\nbetween words, concepts and things. This is probably the doctrine of\nthe longer lost commentary. The reason for the difference may be that\nin the short commentary he wanted to keep matters as simple as\npossible or as Griffin (2012) has proposed that the two views build on\ndifferent traditions. \nThere are two intertwined issues debated by scholars relating to\nPorphyry’s philosophy of logic: One has to do with\nPorphyry’s understanding of the relationship between\nAristotelian categories as “signifying expressions” and\nthe things these expressions refer to, the ontology. His remarks in\nthe Isagoge indicating that he will eschew difficult\nontological issues (1, 9–16) as well as the absence of\ndistinctively Platonic views in the Isagoge and the extant\ncommentary on the Categories have lead scholars to suppose\nthat he regarded logic as an ontologically uncommitted discipline that\ncould be freely adopted by different schools of different persuasions\n(Ebbesen 1990; Barnes 2003). There are strong reasons to believe,\nhowever, that Porphyry the logician cannot so easily be separated from\nPorphyry the philosopher. The Isagoge and the extant\ncommentary on the Categories are intended as elementary works\nbut not thereby philosophically neutral, unconnected with\nPorphyry’ substantial views on the nature of things. That\nPorphyry’s interpretation of the Categories brings with\nit certain ontological commitments is evident from the fact that he\ntook the signifying expressions, the categories, to reflect the\nstructure of the sensible world (cf. In Categorias., 58,\n21–29; Chiaradonna 2008). This is by no means a trivial\nassumption. The other issue has to do with Porphyry’s stance\ntowards Plotinus’ account of the Aristotelian categories in\nEnnead VI.1 and 3. Plotinus understands the\nCategories as a work in ontology rather than being about\nexpressions and he takes a critical view of it as such. What is\ndebated is to what extent this shows a deep disagreement between the\ntwo thinkers not only about the interpretation of Aristotle’s\nCategories but about the structure of the sensible realm and\nits relation to the intelligible causes. Chiaradonna (2002:\n48–54) argues forcefully, and in this author’s view\nsuccessfully, that there is a breach with Plotinus on the issue.\nPorphyry accepted and adopted Aristotelian essentialism about sensible\nobjects along with Aristotle’s categorization of them and sought\nto harmonize this view with his Platonist position about the\nintelligible causes of this realm. Plotinus did not share this view.\nPorphyry’s line won the day in late antiquity. The opposite\nview, that there is a smooth continuation between Plotinus and\nPorphyry on the Aristotelian categories, is argued by Frans de Haas\n(2001). \nIn spite of the ontological assumptions behind the Isagoge\nand the lesser, extant commentary on the Categories,\nPorphyry’s very disclaimers, his avoidance of the deep questions\nabout the ontological status of genera and species—whether they\nexist or depend on thought; and if they exist, whether they are bodies\nor incorporeal; and if the latter, whether they are sensible items or\nexist separately from such—no doubt contributed to the ease with\nwhich these works were taken into obligatory school readings for\ncenturies. Thus, his non-committal formulations of them helped make\nthese works the most lasting part of his legacy in West. \nIt has already been noted that Porphyry seems to be committed to a\nversion of abstractionism with regard to human beings’\nacquisition of knowledge of sensibles. His Commentary on\nPtolemy’s Harmonics contains a section about epistemology\n(11, 5–22, 7), in which the overarching theme is the question of\nthe respective roles of sense-perception and reason (logos)\nin the acquisition of knowledge. In the course of this discussion he\ndescribes a process starting from sense-perception, through\napprehension (antilepsis) and supposition (doxastike\nhypolepsis) to the reception of in the soul of a concept\n(epinoia), which is identical with the form of the object;\nhence come knowledge (episteme) and finally understanding\n(nous). Much of what Porphyry says here is compatible with\nMiddle Platonist and Peripatetic doctrines and with Plotinus (who is\nrather ambiguous about the details of this process) and indeed with\nAristotle. As regards the intellect, however, Porphyry’s account\ncontains an unmistakable reference to Plato’s Seventh letter,\nwhich would count against his assent to a purely Aristotelian account\nof the acquisition of knowledge about sensible objects (see Chase\n2010). More research is needed on these aspects of Porphyry’s\nthought.","contact.mail":"e.k.emilsson@ifikk.uio.no","contact.domain":"ifikk.uio.no"}]
