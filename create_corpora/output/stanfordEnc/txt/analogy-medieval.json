Logicians were concerned with\nthe use of words having more than one sense, whether completely\ndifferent, or related in some way. Theologians were concerned with\nlanguage about God. How can we speak about a transcendent, totally\nsimple spiritual being without altering the sense of the words we use?\nMetaphysicians were concerned with talk about reality. How can we say\nthat both substances (e.g., Socrates) and accidents (e.g., the\nbeardedness of Socrates) exist when one is dependent on the other; how\ncan we say that both God and creatures exist, when one is created by\nthe other? Medieval thinkers reacted to these three problems by\ndeveloping a theory which divided words into three sorts,\nindependently of context. Some were univocal (always used with the\nsame sense), some were purely equivocal (used with quite different\nsenses), and some were analogical (used with related\nsenses). Analogical terms were thought to be particularly useful in\nmetaphysics and theology, but they were routinely discussed in\ncommentaries on Aristotle’s logic and in logic textbooks. The\nbackground to the discussion was given by what is often called the\nanalogy of being or metaphysical analogy, the doctrine that reality is\ndivided both horizontally into the very different realities of\nsubstances and accidents and vertically into the very different\nrealities of God and creatures, and that these realities are\nanalogically related. Nonetheless, the phrase “medieval theories\nof analogy” as used here will refer to semantic analogy, a set\nof linguistic and logical doctrines supplemented, at least from the\nfourteenth century on, by doctrines about the nature of human\nconcepts.\n\n\n\n\nThere were three main types of semantic analogy, each based on a type\nof metaphysical analogy. In the original Greek sense, analogy involved\na comparison of two proportions or relations. Thus\n‘principle’ was said to be an analogical term when said of\na point and a spring of water because a point is related to a line as\na spring is related to a river. This type of analogy came to be called\nthe analogy of proportionality. In the second sense, analogy involved\na relation between two things, of which one is primary and the other\nsecondary. Thus ‘healthy’ was said to be an analogical\nterm when said of a dog and its food because while the dog has health\nin the primary sense, its food is healthy only secondarily as\ncontributing to or causing the health of the dog. This second type of\nanalogy became known as the analogy of attribution, and its special\nmark was being said in a prior and a posterior sense (per prius et\nposterius). A third type of analogy, sometimes used by\ntheologians, appealed to a relation of likeness between God and\ncreatures. Creatures are called good or just because their goodness or\njustice imitates or reflects the goodness or justice of God. This type\nof analogy was called the analogy of imitation or participation. Of\nthe three types, it is the analogy of attribution that is central to\nmedieval discussions.\n\n\n\nFrom the fourteenth century on discussions of analogy focused not so\nmuch on linguistic usages as on the nature of the concepts that\ncorresponded to the words used. Is there just one concept that\ncorresponds to an analogical term, or is there a sequence of concepts?\nIf the latter, how are the members of the sequence ordered and related\nto each other? Moreover, how far should we distinguish between\nso-called formal concepts (or acts of mind) and objective concepts\n(whatever it is that is the object of the act of understanding)? These\ndiscussions were still influential at the time of Descartes.\n\n\n\nMedieval logicians and philosophers of language were principally\nconcerned with the relationship between utterances, concepts, and\nthings. Written language was only of secondary importance. They agreed\nthat spoken language was conventional, having its origin in\nimposition, or the decision to correlate certain sounds with certain\nobjects.  Concepts, however, were natural, in the sense that all human\nbeings with similar experiences had the same concepts, without any\ndecision being involved. The key semantic notion was signification,\nrather than meaning, though translated sources tend to obscure this by\ntranslating ‘significatio’ as ‘meaning’. For a\nterm to signify is for it to function as a sign, to represent or make\nknown something beyond itself. A typical spoken term, such as\n‘horse’ or ‘dog’, signifies in two ways. It\nsignifies or makes known the concept with which it has to be\ncorrelated in order to function significatively at all, and it also\nsignifies or makes known something external to and independent of the\nmind.  Modifications were made to this simple scheme to cover the\ncases of special terms, including syncategorematic terms, such as\n‘every’ and ‘not’, fictional terms such as\n‘chimera’, and privative terms such as\n‘blindness’; and modifications were also made to cover the\ncase of special predicates, such as “is a genus”, or\n“is thought about”, but we need not concern ourselves with\nthese modifications here.  \n\nTheories of signification were complicated by the metaphysical problem\nof common natures. If we say that words signify not only concepts but\nthings external to and independent of the mind do we mean that\n‘human being’ and ‘tall’ signify special\ncommon objects such as humanity or tallness, or do we mean that they\nsignify Socrates and his quality of being tall? For Aquinas, who did\nnot want to give common natures any kind of intermediary existence\nindependent of both concepts and actual things, the significate\n(significatum) of a term was the intellect’s conception\n(whether simple or definitional) of the thing signified; the thing\nsignified (res significata) was usually the property or the\nnature characterizing individual external objects; and the referent\n(suppositum) was the individual external object itself,\nviewed as the bearer of the property or nature. However,‘human\nbeing’ cannot be said to  signify  Socrates, since the\nmind cannot conceive physical individuals as such.  In the fourteenth\ncentury, further developments took place. There was a new focus on the\nnotion of a mental language superior to spoken language, and concepts,\nas parts of this mental language, were themselves regarded as having\nsignification.  Moreover, Scotists and nominalists agreed that, at\nleast in principle, physical individuals could be conceived as\nsuch. William of Ockham and his followers not only denied the\nexistence of common natures but insisted that spoken words did not\nsignify concepts. As a result, both spoken words and the concepts to\nwhich spoken words are subordinated have the same significates, namely\nindividual things and their individual properties, such as the\ntallness of Socrates). Other nominalists, notably Buridan, insisted\nthat spoken words did signify concepts as well as individuals, for\nconcepts are required to mediate between spoken words and individual\nthings. \n\nIn addition to having signification, terms were also said to have\nmodes of signifying (modi significandi). These modes of\nsignifying were related to the term’s logical and grammatical\nfunctions, and include such essential features as being a noun, verb,\nor adjective, and such accidental features as time (which includes\ntense without being limited to it), gender, and case. More generally,\nthey included being abstract (e.g., justice) and concrete (e.g., just).\nThey also include modes of predication, related to Aristotle’s ten\ncategories, such as substantial (e.g., horse), qualitative (e.g.,\nbrown), quantitative (e.g., square), relative and so on. The notion of\nmodes of signifying was developed from the early twelfth century on,\nthough it was specially emphasized by the speculative grammarians of\nthe late thirteenth century. \n\nIt is important to recognize that medieval thinkers had a\ncompositionalist view of language signification, and so words were\nthought to be endowed as units both with their signification and with\nnearly all their modes of signifying in advance of the role they would\nsubsequently play in propositions. Moreover, the doctrine of common\nnatures suggested that terms, at least those terms which seem to fall\nwithin Aristotle’s ten categories (substance, quality, quantity and so\non), each correspond to a common nature and so have a signification\nwhich is fixed and precise.  This meant that questions of use and\ncontext, though explored by medieval logicians especially through\nsupposition theory, were not thought to be crucial to the\ndetermination of a term as equivocal, analogical or univocal. It also\nmeant that terms which did not fit into Aristotle’s categorial\nframework needed a special account. This problem relates especially to\ntheology, because God was thought to transcend the categories in the\nsense that none of them apply to him, and also to metaphysics, because\nof the so-called transcendental terms, ‘being’,\n‘one’, ‘good’. These transcend the categories\nin the sense that they belong no more to one category than to another,\nand they do not correspond to common natures. \n\nIn order to understand how the theory of analogy arose we have to bear\nin mind the history of education in the Latin-speaking western part of\nEurope. During the so-called dark ages, learning was largely confined\nto monasteries, and people had access to very few texts from the\nancient world. This situation had changed dramatically by the beginning\nof the thirteenth century. The first universities (Bologna, Paris,\nOxford) had been established, and the recovery of the writings of\nAristotle supplemented by the works of Islamic philosophers was well\nunder way.  \n\nOne source for the theory of analogy is the doctrine of equivocal\nterms found in logic texts. Until the early twelfth century, the only\nparts of Aristotle’s logic to be available in Latin were the\nCategories and On Interpretation, supplemented by a\nfew other works including the monographs and commentaries of Boethius.\nThe Categories opens with a brief characterization of terms\nused equivocally, such as ‘animal’ used of real human\nbeings and pictured human beings, and terms used univocally, such as\n‘animal’ used of human beings and oxen. In the first case,\nthe spoken term is the same but there are two distinct significates or\nintellectual conceptions; in the second case, both the spoken term and\nthe significate are the same. We should note that equivocal terms\ninclude homonyms (two words with the same form but different senses,\ne.g., ‘pen’), polysemous words (one word with two or more\nsenses), and, for medieval thinkers, proper names shared by different\npeople. By the mid-twelfth century the rest of Aristotle’s logic had\nbeen recovered, including the Sophistical Refutations in which\nAristotle discusses three types of equivocation and how these\ncontribute to fallacies in logic. For writers throughout the later\nmiddle ages, the discussion of analogical terms was fitted into the\nframework of univocal and equivocal terms provided by Aristotle and his\ncommentators. We will return to this below. \n\nTwelfth-century theology is another important source for the doctrine\nof analogy, for twelfth-century theologians such as Gilbert of\nPoitiers and Alan of Lille explored the problem of divine language in\ndepth. Their work initially sprang from works on the Trinity by\nAugustine and Boethius. These authors insisted that God is absolutely\nsimple, so that no distinctions can be made between God’s essence and\nhis existence, or between one perfection, such as goodness, and\nanother, such as wisdom, or, more generally, between God and his\nproperties. New attention was also paid to Greek theologians,\nespecially Pseudo-Dionysius. These theologians insisted on God’s\nabsolute transcendence, and on what came to be called negative\ntheology. We cannot affirm anything positive about God, because no\naffirmation can be appropriate to a transcendent being. It is better\nto deny properties of God, saying for instance that he is not good\n(i.e., in the human sense), and still better to say that God is not\nexistent but super-existent, not substance but super-substantial, not\ngood but super-good. These theological doctrines raised the general\nproblem of how we can speak meaningfully of God at all, but they also\nraised a number of particular problems. Must we say that “God is\njustice” means the same as “God is just”? Must we\nsay that “God is just” means the same as “God is\ngood”? Can we say that God is just and that Peter is just as\nwell? For our purposes, this last question is the most important, for\nit raises the question of one word used of two different\nrealities. \n\nThe third source for doctrines of analogy is metaphysics. The first\npart of Aristotle’s Metaphysics had been translated by the\nmid-twelfth century, though the full text was recovered only\ngradually.  One crucial text is found in Metaphysics 4.2\n(1003a33–35): “There are many senses (multis\nmodis) in which being (ens) can be said, but they are\nrelated to one central point (ad unum), one definite kind of\nthing, and are not equivocal.  Everything which is healthy is related\nto health…. and everything which is medical to\nmedicine….” In this text, Aristotle raises the general\nproblem of the word ‘being’ and its different senses, and\nhe also introduces what is known as pros hen equivocation or\nfocal meaning, the idea that different senses may be unified through a\nrelationship to one central sense. Another foundational text is from\nAvicenna’s\nMetaphysics, also translated into Latin during the twelfth\ncentury, where he writes that being (ens) is neither a genus\nnor a predicate predicated equally of all its subordinates, but rather\na notion (intentio) in which they agree according to the\nprior and the posterior. As we shall see below, this reference to the\nprior and the posterior is particularly important.  \n\nSome further background for the development of doctrines of analogy is\nprovided by Aristotle’s discussion of scientific reasoning in his\nPosterior Analytics, first commented on in the 1220s by\nRobert Grosseteste. One important issue was how analogical relations\nmight be used to find a way of referring to things which did not\nbelong to one genus and lacked a common name. A popular example\nthroughout the middle ages involved Aristotle’s account of the\nrelation between the ‘bone’ of a cuttlefish, a spine, and\na normal bone (Posterior Analytics, 14.2, 98a20–23), though\nthere was some disagreement about the type of analogy involved. Even\nmore important was Aristotle’s view that scientific reasoning requires\ndemonstrative syllogisms, which, in order to be logically valid, must\nhave a middle term that avoids the fallacy of equivocation. How far\nanalogical terms could fill that role was a frequent topic of\ndiscussion and controversy. In the thirteenth century, in his\nquestions on Aristotle’s Physics, Geoffrey of Aspall remarked\nthat analogy did not rule out univocity or prevent a subject from\nbeing one, while in the early fourteenth century, Scotus preferred to\npreserve unity by abandoning the use of analogical terms. In the late\nfifteenth century Cajetan strongly supported the claim that analogical\nterms could function as middle terms. None of these authors suggested\nthat natural science and theology could appeal to analogical\nrelationships to produce probabilistic rather than demonstrative\narguments. \n The Latin term ‘analogia’ had various senses. In\nscriptural exegesis, according to Aquinas, analogy was the method of\nshowing that one part of scripture did not conflict with another. In\nrhetoric and grammar, analogy was the method of settling a doubt about\na word’s form by appeal to a similar and more certain case. Several\ntwelfth-century theologians use the word in this sense. In\ntranslations of Pseudo-Dionysius, the term had a strictly ontological\nsense, for it refers to a being’s capacity for participation in divine\nperfections as this relates to lower or higher beings. In logic,\nauthors were aware that the Greek word\n‘αναλογια’,\nsometimes called ‘analogia’ in Latin, but often\ntranslated as ‘proportio’ or\n‘proportionalitas’, referred to the comparison between\ntwo proportions. However, by the 1220s the word came to be linked with\nthe phrase “in a prior and a posterior sense” and by the 1250s terms\nsaid according to a comparison of proportions were normally separated\nfrom terms said according to a prior and a posterior sense. \n The phrase “in a prior and a posterior sense” seems to have been\nderived from Arabic philosophy. H.A. Wolfson has presented evidence\nfor Aristotle’s recognition of a type of term intermediate between\nequivocal and univocal terms, some instances of which were\ncharacterized by their use according to priority and posteriority. He\nshowed that Alexander of Aphrodisias called this type of term\n‘ambiguous’ and that the Arabic philosophers, starting\nwith Alfarabi, made being said in a prior and a posterior sense the\nmain characteristic of all ambiguous terms. So far as the medieval\nLatin west is concerned, the main sources for the notion of an\nambiguous term said in a prior and a posterior sense are Algazel and\nAvicenna, both of whom became known in the second half of the twelfth\ncentury, and both of whom used the notion to explain uses of the word\n‘being’. \n The word ‘analogical’ soon became linked with the word\n‘ambiguous’ in Latin authors. Speaking of the cuttlefish example in his commentary on\nAristotle’s Posterior Analytics, \nGrosseteste says that Aristotle’s use of analogy to find a common term\nproduces ambiguous names said according to a prior and a posterior\nsense, and he uses the phrase “ambiguum analogum”. In the\nsame decade, the Glossa of the theologian Alexander of Hales\nlinks being said in a prior and a posterior sense with ambiguity and\n(in one possibly unreliable manuscript) with analogy, and the writings\nof Philip the Chancellor also link being said in a prior and a\nposterior sense with analogy. In logic textbooks, the word\n‘analogy’ in the new sense appears in the Summe\nmetenses, once dated around 1220, but now thought to be by\nNicholas of Paris, writing between 1240 and 1260. The new use of\n‘analogy’ rapidly became standard in both logicians and\ntheologians. \n\nIn order to understand the way in which theories of analogy developed,\nwe need to consider the divisions of equivocation found in medieval\nauthors. In his commentary on the Categories, Boethius\npresented a series of divisions which he took from Greek authors. The\nfirst division was into chance equivocals and deliberate equivocals. In\nthe first case, the occurrences of the equivocal term were totally\nunconnected, as when a barking animal, a marine animal, and a\nconstellation were all called ‘canis’ (dog).\nChance equivocation was also called pure equivocation, and it was\ncarefully distinguished from analogy by later writers. In the second\ncase, that of deliberate equivocation, some intention on the part of\nthe speakers was involved, and the occurrences of the equivocal term\ncould be related in various ways. Boethius himself gave four\nsubdivisions. These are found in various later sources, including\nOckham’s commentary on the Categories, but as we shall see,\nother subdivisions became more popular.  \n\nThe first of Boethius’s four subdivisions was similitude, used of\nthe case of the noun ‘animal’ said of both real human\nbeings and pictured human beings. Medieval logicians seem to have been\ntotally unaware of the fact that the Greek word used by Aristotle was\ngenuinely polysemous, meaning both animal and image, and they explained\nthe extended use of ‘animal’ in terms of a likeness between\nthe two referents — a likeness which had nothing to do with the\nsignificate of the term ‘animal’, which picks out a certain\nkind of nature, but which was nonetheless more than metaphorical in\nthat the external shape of the pictured object does correspond to that\nof the living object. Those medieval authors whose discussion of\nequivocation was very brief tended to use this example, and they often\nclaimed that Aristotle introduced it in order to accommodate analogy as\na kind of equivocation. On the other hand, authors whose discussion was\nmore extensive tended to drop both the example and the subdivision of\nsimilitude. \n\nBoethius’s second type of equivocation is\n‘analogia’ in the Greek sense, and the standard\nexample was the word ‘principium’ (principle or\norigin), which was said to apply to unity with respect to number and\nto point with respect to a line, or to both the source of a river and\nthe heart of an animal. ‘Principium’ is a noun\nand, as such, might be expected to pick out a common nature, but\nalthough a unity, a point, a source and a heart can all be called\n‘principium’ with equal propriety, there is no\ncommon nature involved. Mathematical objects, rivers, and hearts,\nrepresent not merely different natural kinds, but different\ncategories, in that mathematical objects fall under the category of\nquantity, and hearts at least under the category of substance. What\nallows these disparate things to be grouped together is a similarity\nof relations: a source is to a river as a heart is to an animal\n— or so it was claimed. While theologians, including Aquinas\nhimself in De veritate, and the fourteenth-century Dominican\nThomas Sutton, occasionally make use of this type of analogy, most\nlogicians do not even mention it. \n\nThe last two subdivisions found in Boethius are ‘of one\norigin’ (ab uno), with the example of the word\n‘medical’, and ‘in relation to one’ (ad\nunum), with the example of the word ‘healthy’. These\nsubdivisions correspond to Aristotle’s pros hen equivocation.\nThe example ‘healthy’ (sanum) as said of animals,\ntheir diet, and their urine is particularly important here.\n‘Sanum’, like other adjectives, was classified as a\nconcrete accidental term. As such, it did not fall within an\nAristotelian category, since its primary signification had two elements\nwhose combination was variously explained. On the one hand, some kind\nof reference is made to the abstract entity health, which belongs to\nthe category of quality; on the other hand, some kind of reference is\nmade to an external object which belongs to the category of substance.\nThis dual reference precludes the term from picking out a natural kind,\nthough in the case of other adjectives, such as ‘brown’, no\nproblem is caused thereby. Brown things may not form a natural kind,\nbut at least they are all physical objects, and ‘brown’ is\nused in the same sense of each one. ‘Healthy’, however, is\nmore complicated. To say that Rover is healthy is to say that Rover is\na thing having health, and obviously this analysis can’t be applied to\ndiet, which is called healthy only because it causes health in an\nanimal, or to urine, which is called healthy only when it is the sign\nof health in an animal. Whatever the properties which characterize\nurine and food, they are different from those characterizing the\nanimal. \n\nWe should also note that in the same passage of his commentary on\nthe Categories, Boethius linked deliberate equivocation with\nmetaphor, in which the sense of one word with an established\nsignification was extended to apply improperly to something else. A\nfavourite medieval example was ‘smiling’ said of flowering\nmeadows. Later logicians supported this link between equivocation and\nmetaphor by an appeal to Aristotle’s divisions of equivocation in\nhis Sophistical Refutations, where he remarked that the\nsecond type was based on common usage. As we shall see, the question\nof metaphor’s relation to analogy became particularly important in\npost-thirteenth-century discussions.  \n\nBoethius’s subdivisions had one major failure: they did not seem to\naccommodate the different uses of the word ‘being’\n(ens). As a result, many authors used a new threefold division\nwhich included Boethius’s last two subdivisions and one more. They\npresented the division as a division of deliberate equivocals, and they\nidentified deliberate equivocals with analogical terms. This threefold\ndivision of analogy was established in the thirteenth-century, in\nresponse to a remark by Averroes in his commentary on the\nMetaphysics to the effect that Aristotle had classified\n‘healthy’ as a case of relationship to one thing as an end,\n‘medical’ as a case of relationship to one thing as an\nagent, and ‘being’ (ens) as a case of relationship\nto one subject. It is found in Thomas Aquinas’s own commentary on the\nMetaphysics, as well as in his fifteenth-century follower\nCapreolus. An analogical term is now seen as one which is said of two\nthings in a prior and a posterior sense, and it is grounded in various\nkinds of attribution or relationship to the primary object: food is\nhealthy as a cause of a healthy animal, a procedure is medical when\napplied by a medical agent, a quality has being by virtue of the\nexistent substance that it characterizes.  \n\nA second threefold division of analogy arose from reflection on the\nrelationship between equivocal and analogical terms. Analogical terms\nwere said to be intermediaries between equivocal and univocal terms,\nand the standard view was that analogical terms were intermediary\nbetween chance equivocals and univocals, and hence that they were to be\nidentified with deliberate equivocals. The notion of an intermediary\nterm, however, is open to more than one interpretation, and some\nauthors went further in suggesting that at least some analogical terms\nwere intermediary between univocals and deliberate equivocals, so that\nthey were not equivocal in any of the normal senses at all. Towards the\nend of the thirteenth century, an anonymous commentator on the\nSophistical Refutations gives the following classification.\nFirst, there are analogical terms which are univocal in a broad sense\nof ‘univocal’. Here reference was made to genus terms such\nas ‘animal’. Human beings and donkeys participate equally\nin the common nature animal, but are not themselves equal, since human\nbeings are more perfect than donkeys. This type of analogy was\nroutinely discussed in response to a remark Aristotle had made in\nPhysics VII (249a22–25) which, in Latin translation, asserted\nthat many equivocations are hidden in a genus. Medieval logicians felt\nobliged to fit this claim into the framework of equivocation and\nanalogy, even if the consensus was that in the end the use of genus\nterms was univocal. Second, there are those analogical terms such as\n‘being’ (ens) which are not equivocal, because\nonly one concept or nature (ratio) seems to be involved, and\nwhich are not univocal either, because things participate this one\nratio unequally, in a prior and a posterior way. It is these terms\nwhich are the genuine intermediaries. Third, there are those analogical\nterms which are deliberate equivocals, because there are two concepts\nor natures (rationes) which are participated in a prior and a\nposterior way. The example here was ‘healthy’. This second\nthreefold division was much discussed. Duns Scotus bitterly criticized\nit in his earlier logical writings. Walter Burley claimed that both the\nfirst and the second kinds of analogical term could properly be\nregarded as univocal in a wide sense. The division was popular in the\nfifteenth century with such Thomists as Capreolus, who realized its\ncloseness to the account given by Aquinas in his Sentences\ncommentary. \n\nDespite the vast modern literature devoted to Aquinas’s theory of\nanalogy, he has very little to say about analogy as such. He uses a\ngeneral division into equivocal, univocal, and analogical uses of\nterms, and he presents both of the threefold divisions of analogy\nmentioned in the previous section, but he offers no prolonged\ndiscussion, and he writes as if he is simply using the divisions,\ndefinitions, and examples with which everyone is familiar. His\nimportance lies in the way he used this standard material to present\nan account of the divine names, or how it is we can meaningfully use\nsuch words as ‘good’ and ‘wise’ of God. \n\nThe background to this account has to be understood in terms of\nAquinas’s theology and metaphysics. Three doctrines are particularly\nimportant. First, there is the distinction between being existent,\ngood, wise, and so on, essentially, and being existent, good, wise, and\nso on, by participation. God is whatever he is essentially, and as a\nresult he is existence itself, goodness itself, wisdom itself.\nCreatures are existent, good, wise, only by sharing in God’s existence,\ngoodness, and wisdom, and this sharing has three features. It involves\na separation between the creature and what the creature has; it\ninvolves a deficient similarity to God; and it is based on a causal\nrelation. What is essentially existent or good is the cause of what has\nexistence or goodness by participation. Second, there is the general\ndoctrine of causality according to which every agent produces something\nlike itself. Agent causality and similarity cannot be separated. Third,\nthere is Aquinas’s belief that we are indeed entitled to claim that God\nis existent, good, wise, and so on, even though we cannot know his\nessence. \n\nAgainst this background, Aquinas asks how we are to interpret the\ndivine names. He argues that they cannot be purely equivocal, for we\ncould not then make intelligible claims about God. Nor can they be\npurely univocal, for God’s manner of existence and his relationship to\nhis properties are sufficiently different from ours that the words\nmust be used in somewhat different senses. Hence, the words we use of\nGod must be analogical, used in different but related senses. To be\nmore precise, it seems that such words as ‘good’ and\n‘wise’ must involve a relationship to one prior reality,\nand they must be predicated in a prior and a posterior sense, for\nthese are the marks of analogical terms. \n\nNonetheless, the divine names do not function exactly like ordinary\nanalogical terms such as ‘healthy’. We need to begin by\nmaking use of the distinction between the thing signified (a nature or\nproperty) and the mode of signifying. All the words we use have a\ncreaturely mode of signifying in that they imply time and composition,\nneither of which can pertain to God. When speaking of God, we must\nrecognize this fact, and attempt to discount it. To say “God is good”\nis not to imply that God has a separable property, goodness, and that\nhe has it in a temporally limited way. God is eternally identical to\ngoodness itself. But even when we have discounted the creaturely mode\nof signifying, we are left with the fact that God’s goodness is not\nlike our goodness. This is where the analogy of attribution enters the\npicture. \n\nIn his early writings, Aquinas questioned whether the standard\naccount of the analogy of attribution was sufficient for his purposes.\nIn his commentary on the Sentences, he suggests that there is\none kind of analogy in which the analogical term is used in a prior and\na posterior sense, and another kind of analogy, the analogy of\nimitation, which applies to God and creatures. In his De\nveritate, he argues that the analogy of attribution involves a\ndeterminate relation, which cannot hold between God and creatures, and\nthat the analogy of proportionality must be used for the divine names.\nWe must compare the relation between God and his properties to the\nrelation between creatures and their properties. This solution was\ndeeply flawed, given that the problem of divine names arises precisely\nbecause the relationship of God to his properties is so radically\ndifferent from our relation to our properties. Accordingly, in his\nlater discussions of the divine names, notably in the Summa contra\ngentiles and the Summa theologiae, Aquinas returns to the\nanalogy of attribution, but links it much more closely with his\ndoctrines of causal similitude. As Montagnes has pointed out, he came\nto place much greater emphasis on agent causation, the active\ntransmission of properties from God to creatures, than on exemplar\ncausality, the creature’s passive reflection or imitation of God’s\nproperties. In this context, Aquinas makes considerable use of his\nontological distinction between univocal causes, whose effects are\nfully like them, and non-univocal causes, whose effects are not fully\nlike them. God is an analogical cause, and this is the reality that\nunderlies our use of analogical language. \n\nAquinas’s views about agent causality explain his insistence on\ndefinitional inclusion. He says explicitly that the term said in a prior\nway must be included in the definition of the posterior, just as the\ndefinition of healthy food includes a reference to the health of the\nanimal. In the divine case, the reference is not direct or explicit,\nbut is a function of our recognition that when humans are said to be\ngood, this means that they have a participated goodness which must be\ncaused by that which is goodness itself. The nature of this causal\nrelation between God and creature also helps to explain the sense in\nwhich terms are said in a prior way of God. So far as imposition is\nconcerned, terms are given their signification on the basis of\ncreaturely effects, and, before we learn about God, we may think that\ntheir prior use is to refer to creaturely perfections. However, when we\ncome to know God as the first cause and fully perfect being, we\nrecognize that their prior application is to God. Finally, Aquinas’s\ncausal doctrines help us to explain his insistence on the distinction\nbetween the analogy of many-to-one and the analogy of one-to-another.\nIn the first case, both food and medicine are said to be healthy\nbecause each is related to something else, the health of an animal. In\nthe second case, food is said to be healthy because of its relation to\nthe health of an animal. Only the second kind of analogy applies to the\ndivine names, for no non-metaphorical name we apply to God can ever be\nexplained in terms of something other than God. Our use of divine names\nhas to reflect God’s absolute priority. \n\nOne of the issues that Aquinas touched on but did not settle was that\nof the number of rationes an analogical term was associated\nwith. This issue stemmed from Aristotle’s Categories. As\ntranslated by Boethius, Aristotle introduced the distinction between\nunivocal and equivocal terms by claiming that whereas univocal terms\nwere subordinated to one substantiae ratio, equivocal terms\nwere subordinated to more than one substantiae ratio. The\nword ‘ratio’ here is capable of various\ninterpretations, including ‘definition or description’,\n‘analysis’, or ‘concept’, but by the early\nfourteenth century logicians and theologians came to agree that the\nappropriate interpretation was ‘concept’. The second\nthreefold division of analogy given above suggests the importance of a\nfocus on concepts; and the question of how many concepts an analogical\nterm was subordinated to came to be central. The nominalists held that\nso-called analogical terms were either metaphorical or were\nstraightforwardly equivocal terms subordinated to two distinct\nconcepts, but the Thomists were split. Analogical terms could be\nviewed as subordinated to an ordered cluster of concepts (possibly but\nnot necessarily described as a disjunction of concepts); or they could\nbe subordinated to a single concept which represents in a prior and a\nposterior manner (per prius et posterius).  \n\nThe issue was considerably complicated by the influence of John Duns\nScotus. In his early logical commentaries, Scotus had argued that it\nwas impossible to have two concepts that were related in a prior and\nposterior way, just as it was impossible to have a single concept that\ncaptured such a relationship. As a result, ‘being’ was a\nchance equivocal, and metaphor, which was a matter of linguistic\nusage, replaced semantic analogy. However, Scotus did believe in\nmetaphysical analogy, whereby God and creatures, substances and\naccidents were related in a prior and posterior way, and in his later\ntheological works he argued that without a unified concept of being\nneither metaphysics nor theology would be possible. Accordingly, he\nreplaced the claim that ‘being’ was a chance equivocal\nwith the claim that it was univocal. In order to support this claim,\nhe rejected the common doctrine that for a term to be univocal it had\nto be a strictly categorial term, picking out some natural kind or\nother. He argued that it was sufficient for univocity that\ncontradiction would arise when the term was affirmed and denied of the\nsame thing. He then argued that ‘being’ (ens) was\na univocal term subordinated to a single univocal concept. \n\nEven for\nthose within the Thomistic tradition, Scotus’ arguments about the\nunivocity of ‘being’ had to be taken seriously. On the one\nhand, the word does not seem to be straightforwardly equivocal, in the\nsense of being subordinated to more than one concept, for we at least\nhave the illusion of being able to grasp ‘being’ as a\ngeneral term. As Scotus pointed out, in an argument reproduced by all\nwho considered the issue, we can grasp that something is a being while\ndoubting whether it is a substance or an accident, and this surely\ninvolves having a relatively simple concept of being at our disposal.\nOn the other hand, there does not seem to be any common nature\ninvolved, and in the absence of a common nature, Thomists thought that\nto call the term ‘univocal’ was inappropriate. What was\nneeded was a way of allowing the concept to enjoy some kind of unity,\nwhile allowing the word to have a significate that was not a simple\ncommon nature. For many thinkers from the early fourteenth century\nonward, the distinction between formal and objective concepts provided\nthe answer. \n\nThe formal concept was the act of mind or conception that\nrepresented an object, and the objective concept was the object\nrepresented. If the spoken word ‘being’ corresponds to just\none formal concept (a point on which there were some differences of\nopinion), the focus of discussion shifts to the status of the objective\nconcept. Is it the actual thing in the world which is thought about; is\nit a common nature or some other kind of intermediary entity which is\ndistinct from the external object without being mind-dependent; or is\nit a special kind of mind-dependent object which has only objective\nbeing, the being of being thought (esse objective, esse\ncognitum)? In the case of ‘being’, since we are\nclearly not talking about either an individual thing or a common\nnature, we get back to the original set of questions about analogical\nconcepts, now posed at a different level. That is, are we talking about\na special ordering intrinsic to a single objective concept, or are we\ntalking about an ordered sequence of objective concepts which\ncorresponds to the one formal concept? \n\nIn 1498 Thomas de Vio, Cardinal Cajetan, wrote a little book called\nOn the Analogy of Names which he intended to supplement his\ncommentary on Aristotle’s Categories. The work was not\npublished until 1506, when it was included in a collection of short\ntexts that was reprinted at least six times during the\ncentury. Perhaps because of his important contribution to the\nsixteenth-century revival of Thomism, Cajetan’s contribution to\ndiscussions of analogy has been misrepresented in modern times. It has\nbeen assumed that he was commenting directly on Aquinas, rather than\non his immediate predecessors, and that his views were central to\nsixteenth-century discussions. In fact, his influence was slight at\nfirst, and when he became more widely read, such important late\nscholastic authors as Francisco Suárez argued against his\ndoctrines. \n\n  Part of Cajetan’s book is devoted to formal and objective\nconcepts and ways in which the latter can be ordered, but he also\noffered a new threefold division of types of analogy. He called the first type, the\ncase of genus terms, the analogy of inequality, and dismissed it as\nunimportant, indeed, not properly analogy at all. He called the second\ntype the analogy of attribution, and here he made two changes. First,\nhe gave a new account of its subdivisions by adding Boethius’s\nsubdivision, similitude, to the first threefold division involving\nattribution to one efficient cause, one end, and one subject. He\ndescribed the resulting four subdivisions in terms of Aristotle’s four\ncauses. Second, he claimed that attribution involved only extrinsic\ndenomination. That is, in each case of attribution, only the prior\nobject is intrinsically characterized by the property in question,\ne.g., health.  \n\nCajetan called the third type of analogy the analogy of\nproportionality, and he subdivided it into metaphor and proper\nproportionality. His account of metaphor was commonplace, and goes\nback to Aquinas’s remark that meadows are said to smile because\nflowering is related to meadows in the way that smiling is related to\nhuman beings. He claimed that proper proportionality was analogy in\nthe Greek sense of the word, and that it was the only true kind of\nanalogy. Moreover, it involves only intrinsic denomination, that is,\nboth the primary and the secondary object referred to are\ncharacterized by the property in question. He did allow for the word\n‘being’ to be used in accordance with attribution when we\nthink of creatures as beings only because they reflect the nature of\nthe God who created them, but in general he held that\n‘being’ and all other metaphysically and theologically\nimportant analogical terms principally belonged to this third\ndivision. Both in his insistence on the priority of proper\nproportionality and in his use of a sharp distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic denomination, Cajetan departed from earlier\nmedieval discussions of analogy. It was also on these points that his\nlate scholastic successors were to disagree with him. For instance,\nSuárez held that the main use of proportionality was to account\nfor metaphor, and that the analogy of attribution embraced both\nintrinsic and extrinsic denomination.  \n\nIt is unfortunate that many later commentators have been misled into\ntaking Cajetan’s account of analogy as a typical one, and, even more\nunfortunately, as a useful summary of the doctrines of\nAquinas. However, more recent scholarship involving a number of\nauthors is beginning to change this situation.","contact.mail":"ejashwor@uwaterloo.ca","contact.domain":"uwaterloo.ca"}]
