Traditionally, logicism has concerned\nitself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in a\nstronger and a weaker version. \n\n\nThe strong version of logicism maintains that all\nmathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a species\nof logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintains\nonly that all the theorems do. (By ‘theorems’ we\nmean results that are provable within the branch of\nmathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to those\nparts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in this\nregard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,\ncoherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be so\nreconstructed. \n\n\nBoth versions of logicism—strong and weak—maintain that\n\n\nAll the objects forming the subject matter of those\nbranches of mathematics are logical objects; and \n\nLogic—in some suitably general and powerful sense that the\nlogicist will have to define—is capable of furnishing\ndefinitions of the primitive concepts of these branches of\nmathematics, allowing one to derive the mathematician’s\n‘first principles’ therein as results within Logic itself.\n(The branch of mathematics in question is thereby said to have been\nreduced to Logic.)\n\nFor the foundationalist who accepts Kant’s distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm cases\nof analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meanings\nof the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, as\nKant might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations among\nthe concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branch\nof mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) or\nits theorems (weak version) are analytic. \n\n\nAnother consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branch\nof mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) is\nof a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds for\nnecessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledge\nconcerned. \n\n\nLogicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms—Fregean and\nRussellian—until around 1930, at which point logicism went into\ndecline, largely because of the discovery of Gödelian\nincompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,\nwhich displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promising\nfoundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine of\nneo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas of\nlogicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and its\nmore substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s. \n\n\nThe main technical and philosophical innovation of the\nneo-logicists is their use of abstraction principles\nin order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,\nunderstood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kind\nof abstraction principle typically effects the reification of\nequivalence classes of an equivalence\n relation.[1]\n One of Frege’s favorite examples involved the equivalence\nrelation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would be\nthat of the direction of a line. Thus, two lines\nl1 and l2 have the same\ndirection just in case they are parallel: \n\n\nd(l1) = d(l2) ⇔\nl1 || l2.\n\n\n\nThe function denoted by the abstraction operator d( ) is\nhere applied to lines, and produces directions (new abstract\nobjects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can take\nvariables as arguments. \n\n\nThe neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that produce\nnumbers as their values. Details of notation and method will\nbe provided in due course. \n\n\nThere has not been any historical trend discernible as an\nevolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incremental\nadjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, while\nmaintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an ideal\nformulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abrupt\nshifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goal\nhas remained relatively constant through such\n changes.[2]\n We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as the\ndifferent phases of logicism are recounted below. \n\nKant had held that both arithmetic and (Euclidean) geometry were\nsynthetic a priori, just as—for him—metaphysics\nwas. Indeed, this was to explain the special status of both\nmathematics and metaphysics, so that the latter could enjoy the\nexalted status of the former. For Kant, both mathematics and\nmetaphysics afforded informative insights into the nature of reality\n(they were synthetic); yet, for all that, the rational intellect\nneeded no sensory experience in order to attain such insights (they\nwere a priori). On Kant’s account, even a simple\ncomputational statement of arithmetic—let alone a statement\ninvolving quantification over the natural numbers—is synthetic.\nHere is how he put the matter in his Critique of Pure Reason,\nat B16:  \nWe might, indeed, at first suppose that the proposition 7\n+ 5 = 12 is a merely analytical proposition, and\nfollows by the principle of contradiction from the concept of a sum of\n7 and 5. But if we look more closely we find that the concept of the\nsum of 7 and 5 contains nothing save the union of the two numbers into\none, and in this no thought is being taken as to what that single\nnumber may be which combines both. The concept of 12 is by no means\nalready thought in merely thinking this union of 7 and 5; and I may\nanalyze my concept of such a possible sum as long as I please, still I\nshall never find the 12 in it. (Translation by Norman Kemp Smith) \nKant’s search for conceptual containments is confined to those\nthat he might be able to find among just the explicit constituents of\nthe proposition concerned, unmediated by any connections with related\nconcepts that do not themselves occur within the proposition. (We note\nthis in anticipation of a contrast to be made in due course with\nFrege’s modification of Kant’s conception of analytic\n truth.)[3]\n For Kant, the a priori character of arithmetical truth\nderives not from conceptual containments (within the proposition in\nquestion), but from the pure form of our intuition of time,\nas affording an unbounded series of successive moments. According to\nMichael Friedman, Kant held that  \nonly the general features of succession and iteration in time can\nguarantee the existence and uniqueness of the sum of 7 and 5 …;\nonly the unboundedness of temporal succession can guarantee the\ninfinity of the number series, and so on\n ….[4] \nLikewise, on Kant’s account, the a priori character of\nEuclidean geometry derives from the pure form of our intuition of\nspace, which enables the thinker, correctly one may presume, to\nintuit straight lines in space as continuous.  \nThese two pure forms of intuition—time and\nspace—delivered, for Kant, the theories of arithmetic and\nEuclidean geometry respectively, and endowed them both with their\na priori character. And they made possible the\nspatio-temporal manifold of intuitions (Anschauungen) which\nwould then in turn, upon structuring by the exercise of concepts of\nthe understanding (especially the concepts of substance and\ncause) make possible objective knowledge of things and events\nin the external world.  \nThe logicists, then, could be seen as adopting Kant’s\ndistinction, but applying it to radically different effect. Their\nfirst move was to argue that arithmetic, at least, is\nanalytic, not synthetic.  \nThe doctrine of logicism had its first glimmerings in the writings of\nDedekind, but it really only came to full flowering in the work of\nFrege. In Dedekind’s work, the ideas were presented in a form\naccessible to his contemporaries in the mathematical community.\nPrecise and rigorous though those ideas were, they nevertheless\nenjoyed a relatively informal presentation. No one had yet come up\nwith the idea of formal deductive systems of logic adequate for\nformalizing the mathematical reasoning of their day; so no logicist\nthesis in Dedekind’s day could be formulated in the way that is\nnow familiar to us. Matters were different, of course, with Frege, for\nhis crowning achievement was a formal deductive system of logic by\nreference to which a logicist thesis could at last be expressed.  \nNow, when crediting Frege also with the pioneering of a detailed\nexecution of a logicist program, one cannot ignore his continuing\ninsistence that the truths of Euclidean geometry were synthetic a\npriori, and founded in a completely different way from the truths\nof\n arithmetic.[5]\n Hence they were not subject to his doctrine of logicism. This is why\nwe have exercised care in our introductory characterization of the\ndoctrine of logicism, as concerned first and foremost with the truths\nof arithmetic and of real analysis.  \nThe combined contributions of Dedekind and Frege represented a\nculmination of the trend, by their time well under way among leading\nmathematicians, towards the arithmetization of real (and\ncomplex) analysis. This trend had its beginnings in the even earlier\nworks of Gauss and Bolzano. It came to maturity in the works of Cauchy\nand Weierstraß, and became the dominant paradigm in Western\nthought about the nature of mathematics. The leading idea of the\narithmetizers was that the concepts and first principles of arithmetic\nand analysis are to be found in the concepts of the understanding (as\na Kantian might put it), independently of one’s geometric\nintuitions concerning any spatial or temporal continua. Arithmetic and\nanalysis are completely conceptual and logical in\ntheir axiomatic sources and in their deductive development.  \nWe proceed now to consider Dedekind and Frege in turn.  \nIt is fair to say that Dedekind enabled the trend of arithmetization\nto culminate in the doctrine of logicism. The recommendation (or\nstatement of the methodological maxim) that one ought to\navoid all matters geometric when providing a foundation for real\nanalysis goes back at least to Dedekind, Stetigkeit und\nIrrationale Zahlen (1872). This work was published late. Its\nbreakthrough idea had come fourteen years earlier, in\n 1858.[6]\n At pages 3–4 Dedekind writes in an engaging and revelatory way\nof his earlier struggle in the autumn of 1858 to furnish\n“eine wirklich wissenschaftliche Begründung der\nArithmetik” (a really scientific foundation for Arithmetic\n[i.e., real\n analysis]).[7] \nIt is clear that Dedekind is writing on the\npresumption—assumed to be so widespread as not to call\nfor any justificatory argument—that one should have no\nrecourse at all to geometric intuitions or first principles when\nfounding the theory of the real numbers. This presumption, said\nDedekind, ‘no one will deny’. Dedekind wanted “a\npurely arithmetical and perfectly rigorous foundation for the\nprinciples of infinitesimal analysis” [Emphases\n added].[8] \nThe presumption receives further emphatic statement in\nDedekind’s later work (1888) Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen?, which, like the earlier work, was published much later\nthan it could (or should) have been. In the preface to the first\nedition (Dedekind 1996b: 790–1) Dedekind writes  \nIn speaking of arithmetic (algebra, analysis) as merely part of logic\nI mean to imply that I consider the number-concept entirely\nindependent of the notions or intuitions of space and\ntime—that I rather consider it an immediate product of the\npure laws of thought.… It is only through the purely logical\nprocess of building up the science of numbers and by thus acquiring\nthe continuous number-domain that we are enabled accurately to\ninvestigate our notions of space and time by bringing them into\nrelation with this number-domain created in our mind.[fn] [Emphasis\nadded] \nOnce again we see the presumption at work: in laying a foundation for\nthe theory of real numbers, one must avoid any recourse to\ngeometrical intuition. To inquire how such a presumption become so\nwidespread, and in whose works it originated, is a topic outside the\nscope of the present study.  \nIt is clear from Frege’s Preface to his Begriffsschrift\n(at pp. IX–X) that he shared Dedekind’s methodological\nconcerns, and that he had an eventual logicist treatment of arithmetic\nin his sights when devising his concept script. Frege distinguished\ntwo kinds of truths that require a Begründung\n(justification): those whose proofs could proceed purely logically;\nand those which had to be supported by experiential facts\n(Erfahrungsthatsachen). And he sought to inquire how far one\ncould succeed in capturing arithmetic by means only of inferences\nbased on the laws of thought that transcend all particularities\n(“durch Schlüsse allein …, nur gestützt auf\ndie Gesetze des Denkens, die über allen Besonderheiten erhaben\nsind”). He made it clear that he wished to get at the root\nconcept of ordering in a series, and to advance from there to\nthe concept of number. Then comes this unmistakeable echo of Dedekind:\n \nIn order that, in doing this, nothing intuitive could intrude\nunnoticed, everything would turn on there being no gaps in the chain\nof inferences. \nDamit sich hierbei nicht unbemerkt etwas Anschauliches\neindrängen könnte, musste Alles auf die Lückenlosigkeit\nder Schlusskette ankommen. \nFrege stressed that he was concerned to reveal how the analyticity of\narithmetical truths derived from their justifications. In §3 of\nFrege 1884 (Grundlagen der Arithmetik) he wrote  \n… these distinctions between a priori and a posteriori,\nsynthetic and analytic, concern … the justification for making\nthe judgement. … When a proposition is called … analytic\nin my sense, … it is a judgement about the ultimate ground upon\nwhich rests the justification for holding it to be true.  \n… The problem becomes … that of finding the proof of the\nproposition, and of following it up right back to the primitive\ntruths. If, in carrying out this process, we come only on general\nlogical laws and on definitions, then the truth is an analytic\none, bearing in mind that we must take account also of all\npropositions upon which the admissibility of any of the definitions\ndepends. [Emphasis added] \nWe see, then, that Frege’s conception of the analytic was\nsuitably broader than Kant’s. Kant required that conceptual\ncontainments be evident within the sentence, rather than that the\nsentence be displayed as a conclusion following logically from axioms\nwhose own logical or conceptual truth was self-evident, and which\nmight contain expressions not occurring in the sentence in question.\nAs we saw from the quote from B16, Kant did not regard ‘7\n+ 5 = 12’ as an analytic truth. The\nFregean, by contrast, is able to exploit the internal structure of the\nnumerals, and to invoke the recursion axioms for addition (which\nthemselves would have to have been derived in logicist\n fashion).[9]\n So, for the Fregean, even if not for Kant, ‘7\n+ 5 = 12’ is an analytic truth. Where s is the\nsuccessor function, Kant’s example takes the more detailed form\n \nsssssss0 + sssss0 = ssssssssssss0, \nwhich is provable using the recursion axioms  \n∀x x + 0 = x;\n\n∀x∀y x + sy =\ns(x + y). \nThe latter axiom justifies each of the transitions below:  \nAt this point the former axiom secures  \nHence (suppressing parentheses) we have  \nas\n foreshadowed.[10] \nFrege went on in this work to give his famous elucidation of\n‘number of’ as a concept of concepts, along with\ndevastating critiques of rival accounts of number by contemporaries in\nthe grip of psychologism, empiricism, or formalism. He kept\ntechnicalities to a minimum, in a tour de force of\nphilosophical elucidation.  \nFrege’s key insight, which he never abandoned, was first\nexpressed in §46: “… the content of a statement\nabout number is an assertion about a concept”. By way of\nillustration: Suppose one states that  \n(ν) is definitely a statement ‘about number’. Yet all\none is saying, when asserting (ν), is that  \n(γ), for Frege, is an assertion about the concept\n“___is an apple in the basket”. It is not an assertion\nabout the number 2, since the adjectival occurrence of\n‘two’ in (γ) can be avoided. One could re-phrase\n(γ) as  \nWe shall show how Frege’s point here can be made watertight, and\ngeneral, after providing a few words of explanation about notation for\nnumber-abstraction.  \nIn the simple example above about line-directions, the abstraction\noperator d( ) is a function sign, and does not bind any\nvariables. But with numerical abstractions, matters are\nsubtly different. Here, the abstraction operator #, meaning “the\nnumber of …”, can be deployed in two different ways. On\nthe one hand, it can be a function symbol: if F is a predicate\n(resp., a second-level variable), then #F is a singular term\ndenoting the number of things falling under F (resp., in the\nextension assigned to the second-level\n variable).[11]\n On the other hand, the operator #x can be applied to the open\nsentence Φ(x) with x free, thereby binding the\nvariable x. The complex term thus formed is read as “the\nnumber of\n Φs”.[12] \nWith that explanation of notation in place, suppose one makes a\nstatement about number of the following form, where #xFx is the\nformal rendering of “the number of Fs”:  \nThen one is thereby (says Frege) making the assertion that  \nThe concept F is the only one finding expression in this last\nassertion, apart from standard logical operators. Therefore the\nassertion is about the concept F. It is in the general form of\na numerosity assertion, which does not necessarily refer to,\nor generalize about, numbers. For arbitrary n, the logical form\nin question will be  \nOf course (returning to our example where n =\n2), one can consider matters in the converse logical direction.\nIf one makes the numerosity assertion first, then one can regard that\nas a justifying ground for the subsequent statement that the number of\nFs is identical to 2.  \nIf, with Frege, we countenance these two different ways of\n‘carving’ one and the same propositional content, then we\nshall require, in whatever language is rich enough to provide the two\nforms of expression in question, the following logical equivalence,\nindicated by the two-way deducibility sign ⊣⊢:  \nAs Frege put it, the propositional content on the right-hand side has\nbeen ‘re-carved’ as the identity statement on the\nleft-hand side. One and the same thought has been presented in two\nvery different ways. They have the same truth conditions, but\ndifferent logico-grammatical forms.  \nThe form on the right, within a language devoid of the operator #, is\ncompletely innocent of any commitment to numbers as objects. If such a\nlanguage is extended, however, by adding # to its stock of logical\nexpressions, then one is thereby able to express the form on the left,\nwhich is number-committal.  \nBy being aware that the concept-numerosity thought on the right can be\nrendered equivalently (in the extended language) as the\nnumber-committal thought on the left, one comes to recognize numbers\nas abstract, logical objects. In the extended language, their\nexistence can be established on purely logical grounds.  \nIn the Grundlagen, Frege considered the following\nequivalence, known as Hume’s Principle:  \nThere are two important features to note.  \nFirst, HP is explicitly second order on the right-hand side,\ninvolving, as it does, a second-order quantification over relations\nR; and HP is purely logical on the right-hand side.\nHere, the notion to be defined (the definiendum) is that of a\nrelation R mapping the Fs 1–1 onto the Gs.\nThis can be spelled out in purely logical terms: every F bears\nR to exactly one G, and every G is borne R\nby exactly one F. In symbols, this definiens reads as\nfollows:  \nwhich we shall abbreviate as  \nSecondly, HP involves two predicates, F and G. It does\nso in order to state an important criterion of identity for\nnumbers denoted, respectively, as #xFx and as #xGx. Note\nthat both terms in the identity-statement on the left-hand side are\nabstractive terms.  \nLet us call (neo-)Fregean abstraction principles (like HP) that seek\nto specify the truth conditions of identities involving\ntwo distinct abstractive terms (involving the same\nabstraction operator @) double-abstraction principles.\n(Contrasting single-abstraction principles for identities will be\ndiscussed\n shortly.)[14]\n Double-abstraction identity principles have the general form  \nwhere the right-hand side expresses a second-order equivalence\nrelation Ψ between F and G, and is stated without\nuse of @. But that does not preclude instances of such a principle\nwhere either F or G, or both, contain occurrences of @.\n \nTypically these double-abstraction principles are laid down as\npostulates, or axioms (or axiom schemes). But that is not absolutely\nnecessary. All that is important is whether the theory in question\ncontains such a principle as a theorem (or theorem-scheme). Like the\nearlier abstraction principle for directions, HP is a\ndouble-abstraction principle. So too is Frege’s ill-fated Basic\nLaw V, which we shall discuss in due course.  \nHP tells us that the numbers #xFx and #xGx will be\nidentical if and only if the predicate-extensions that they\nrespectively number are in one-one correspondence (under some\ntwo-place relation R). Another way of expressing this latter\ncondition is to say that F and G are\nequinumerous.  \nThe basic idea of this equivalence is owed to Hume (whence the current\nname of the principle); and it had of course been exploited to great\neffect by Cantor, well before Frege wrote the\n Grundlagen.[15]\n Without the use of one-one correspondences in this way, Cantor would\nnot have been able to motivate his later groundbreaking idea that\nthere are distinct infinite numbers (see Cantor 1891).  \nFrege considered whether HP might be laid down as a constitutive\ndefinition of numbers—a definition that would give a full and\nexact characterization of their nature. But he concluded that HP could\nnot meet this more exigent, yet reasonable, demand. The reason is what\nhas now become known as the Julius Caesar Problem. Frege\ninsisted (Grundlagen, §56), that our definition of\nnumber should enable us to decide that Julius Caesar is not a\nnumber. His conclusion was that HP could not enable us to do this.\n \nFor, suppose we say that if there are exactly two apples in the\nbasket, then the number of apples in the basket is Julius Caesar. For\nthe sake of consistency, it would be enough (in conformity with HP)\nsimply to make sure that one assigns the same number (i.e., Julius\nCaesar) to any other concept that is in one-one correspondence with\nthe concept “…is an apple in the basket”. Thus, for\nexample, the number of prime numbers strictly between 4 and 8 is\nJulius Caesar. Indeed, the number of prime numbers strictly between 1\nand 4 is Julius Caesar, one of those prime numbers being Julius Caesar\nhimself!  \nOn the one hand, HP is, to be sure, a necessary condition on number.\nIt must be satisfied by any licit interpretation of the abstraction\noperator #. HP is not, however, sufficient to ensure that the\nthings denoted by terms of the form #xFx really are\nnumbers!  \nOn the other hand—as revealed in Frege’s painstaking\ndeductive work—HP suffices for a logicist derivation of the\nDedekind-Peano postulates for the arithmetic of natural numbers. This\nis what accounts for the vaunted status of HP in certain subsequent\nneo-logicist accounts (see\n §2).\n  \nBut Frege wanted more than just a logically powerful enough source for\narithmetic; he wanted, in addition, a principle that would account for\nthe metaphysical nature of numbers. They must, surely, at\nleast be abstract? Numbers are also eternal and necessary.\nThey are not located in space, and they do not enter into any causal\ninteractions. Frege therefore sought a deeper logical theory that\nmight be able to vouchsafe for numbers these latter characteristics,\nand thereby solve the Caesar Problem.  \nUnfortunately, in this regard he arguably failed (and did so quite\nindependently of Russell’s Paradox, of which more in due\ncourse). Frege thought (mistakenly, according to Dummett (1998)) that\nhe could avoid the Julius Caesar problem by identifying numbers as\nspecial kinds of classes, or extensions (of\nconcepts). In the Grundlagen, at §68, he wrote  \nMy definition [of Number] is … as follows:  \nthe Number which belongs to the concept F is the extension\n[Umfang][fn.] of the concept “equal\n[gleichzahlig] to the concept F”. \nAnd the footnote to “Umfang” ends with the\nsentence “I assume that it is known what the extension of a\nconcept is.” For those who nevertheless needed some instruction\nin this regard, the Grundgesetze were intended to supply it.\n \nThe Julius Caesar problem would, in principle, bedevil any\ndouble-abstraction principle. (It is not a problem specifically for\nlogicism; it is a problem for abstraction principles of a\nspecific\n form.)[16]\n The problem can be avoided by using single-abstraction identity\nprinciples.  \nThe general form of a single-abstraction identity principle, when\nexpressed by a sentence rather than by rules of inference, is  \nwhere t is a placeholder for singular terms in general\n(including parameters), and not just for @-terms. The right-hand side\nmay contain occurrences of @; moreover, when taking instances,\nexpressions substituted for either F or t may contain\noccurrences of @. And all that is important with a single-abstraction\nidentity principle is whether the theory in question contains it as a\ntheorem (or theorem-scheme).  \nSome examples of single-abstraction identity principles are the\nfollowing. Here, ∃!t is short for ∃x\nx = t. It may be read as “t exists”.\n \nFor definite descriptions (on Smiley’s treatment, Smiley 1970):\n \nFor set abstracts:  \nFor number-abstracts (on Tennant’s treatment—see\n §4):\n  \nFor number-abstracts (on Zalta’s treatment—see\n §5):[18] \nt = #G ↔ t = ιx(Ax ∧\n∀F(xF ↔ F is equinumerous with\nG)). \nThe important feature of single-abstraction identity principles of the\nkind on which we are focusing is that they are free of ontological\ncommitment. Theories that postulate or prove them need to be\nsupplemented with specific further ontologically committal postulates\nbefore incurring commitment to the sort of entities whose broad\nlogical behavior is captured by a single-abstraction identity\nprinciple. For example, the set-abstraction principle above merely\nplaces constraints on how sets, membership (‘∈’) and\nset-defining conditions F interrelate. It logically implies\nboth extensionality and the conversion schemata (“If u is\na member of the set of all and only Fs, then u is an\nF”, and “If u is an F, and the set of\nall and only Fs exists, then u is a member of\nit”), but does not guarantee the existence of any\nsets—not even that of the empty set.  \nThe heart of Frege’s logicist achievement was deferred to the\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, the first volume of which\nappeared in 1893. This almost decade-long delay after the\nGrundlagen he explained in his foreword as being occasioned\nby some re-thinking of his Begriffsschrift (Frege\n1879)—the most important innovation being the introduction of\nthe notion of, and notation for, the Werthverlauf\n(value-range, or extension) of a concept. Frege had also, by the time\nof publication of the Grundgesetze, formulated his\ndistinction between sense and reference, and decided to treat\ntruth-values as objects, and indeed as referents of sentences.  \nHe confessed that he expected his symbolism to be a grosses\nHemmniss (great obstacle) standing in the way of the spread and\nimpact of his ideas (Frege 1893: x). On the one hand, the exacting\nnotation and absolutely rigorous and logically watertight proofs were\nessential to his logicist project. On the other hand, he feared,\nmathematicians would think metaphysica sunt, non leguntur!\n(it’s metaphysics, and is not [to be] read!), and philosophers\nwould think mathematica sunt, non leguntur! (it’s\nmathematics, and is not [to be] read!); (Frege 1893: xii). Poor Frege\nmight have been right. But the reason why the beef of his\nGrundgesetze was never properly digested can be read off the\nsandwiching. His foreword to Volume I ends with the confident words\n \nThe only refutation I would acknowledge would be if someone actually\nshowed that a better and more sustainable edifice could be erected on\nother foundational convictions, or if someone were to show that my\naxioms led to obviously false consequences. But no one will succeed in\ndoing that. (Frege 1893: xxvi; author’s translation) \nThis confident statement belies somewhat his own prescient misgiving\nexpressed a few pages earlier, over his Basic Law V:  \nAs far as I can see, controversy could arise only over my Basic Law of\nValue-ranges (V), which perhaps has not been given special expression\nby logicians, even though one thinks of it, for example, when one\ntalks of extensions of concepts. I hold it to be purely logical.\nAnyway, this marks the place where the decision must fall. (Frege\n1893: vii; author’s translation) \nAnd fall it did. Frege, it turned out, had gone in for overkill with\nthe formal system that was to vindicate his logicism. He sought to\nunify all of arithmetic and analysis within a general theory of\nclasses, or extensions (of concepts). Classes were supposed\nto be logical objects par excellence. The strategy was to\ndefine the natural numbers, say, as particular classes within a much\nmore capacious universe of abstract, logical objects. Using the\ndefinitions, one would then derive the first principles of arithmetic\n(the Dedekind-Peano axioms, say) as theorems within the theory of\nclasses. To that end one would exploit, ultimately, only the deeper\nunderlying axioms (or basic laws) governing classes themselves. For\nmore details on this strategy, see\n §1.2.4.\n  \nAmong these deeper axioms was Frege’s ill-fated Basic Law V.\nThis, like HP, is a double-abstraction principle. Basic Law V,\nhowever, allows for the abstraction of classes, and the\nequivalence relation by which this is effected is the relation of\ncoextensiveness among defining predicates. Frege never raised the\nJulius Caesar objection against his Basic Law V. Using modern\nnotation, Basic Law V can be stated as the following axiom schema, in\nwhich Φ and Ψ are placeholders for formulas:  \nFrege was assuming a ‘logically perfect’ language, in\nwhich every well-formed term—including any class-abstractive\nterm of the form {x | Φx}—denotes. If, by\ncontrast, one countenances the possibility that certain well-formed\nsingular terms in one’s language might not denote\nobjects, then one has to employ a different kind of logic—a\nso-called free logic. (It is ‘free’ of the\nbackground assumption that all singular terms denote.) Such a logic\nqualifies the quantifier rules with ‘existential\npresuppositions’ concerning the terms involved. For example,\ninstead of being able to infer directly from “for all x,\nF(x)” to “F(t)”, as one\nmay, when using the unfree logic of a logically perfect\nlanguage:  \none needs, in the case of a free logic dealing with possibly\nnon-denoting terms, to ensure that the singular term t denotes:\n \nThe reader is reminded that ∃!t, to be read\n“t exists”, is short for ∃x x =\nt. Similar modifications are required for the other quantifier\nrules.  \nEven if Frege had not been assuming a logically perfect\nlanguage, and had instead been using a free logic, Basic Law V would\nstill have committed him to the existence of the class of all Φs,\nwhatever the defining formula Φ might be. The proof proceeds as\nfollows.  \nProof. Note, first, that it is a logical truth that\n \nBy Basic Law V in the right-to-left direction, taking Φ for Ψ,\nit follows that  \nBut in free logic, an identity holds only if its terms denote. Hence\n \nThis schema is known nowadays as ‘Naïve\nComprehension’. (Comprehension is the abstraction of sets or\nclasses.) Basic Law V committed Frege to claiming that, corresponding\nto any defining predicate Φ, there exists the class of all and\nonly those things that satisfy Φ.  \nNote that any double-abstraction principle for an abstraction\noperator @, whose right-hand side \nwill generate existential commitment to a denotation for any\nwell-formed abstract term @xΦx. This is because, in\nlight of (ii), the self-identity @xΦx =\n@xΦx will also be logically true. And\n@xΦx = @xΦx is true only if\n∃!@xΦx. This consideration holds for any\ndefining predicate Φ. This invites the objection, raised both by\nTennant (1987: 236) and by Boolos (1987: 184) that in certain\nconspicuous cases there is no a priori justification for\ncommitment to the existence of denotations for these terms, in the\ncase of particularly problematic concepts Φ (such as\nself-identity). This was the earliest form of the ‘Bad Company\n objection’.[19] \nWe shall not dwell on the peculiarities of Frege’s class theory,\nbut shall try instead to set out the overall shape of the leading\nideas in Frege’s account, as they were set forth informally in\nthe Grundlagen and executed formally in the\nGrundgesetze.  \nFirst Frege had to identify 0, which he defined as the number of any\nempty concept. A necessarily empty concept is that of\nnon-self-identity:  \nNext Frege had to specify what it was for one natural number to be the\nsuccessor of another, or the next largest natural\nnumber. How might one define what it is for m to\nimmediately succeed n? The answer is found by appeal\nto concepts F and G, say, that respectively enjoy\nm and n as their (finite) cardinals. There must be\nexactly one more object falling under the concept F than there\nare objects falling under the concept G. And this will\nconsist in there being a one-one correspondence (R, say)\nbetween all the Gs and all but one of the Fs. Formally:\n \nIt is easy to show that n has exactly one immediate successor.\nThat is, if m immediately succeeds n, and\nm′ immediately succeeds n, then m =\nm′.  \nWhat, now, can we say about the extension of the concept\n‘natural number’? It must consist of 0 along with any\nnumber than can be reached from 0 by finitely many steps of\nimmediate succession. This characterization, however, threatens to be\ncircular: for, how is one to understand the adverb\n‘finitely’ here, if not by appeal to the notion of natural\nnumber itself?  \nFrege’s genius revealed itself in the solution he devised to\nthis circularity problem. He had already covered the necessary logical\nand conceptual ground in his Begriffsschrift of 1879. For any\ntwo-place relation R, Frege had defined what it was for\nx to be an R-ancestor of y (abbreviated\nhere as R∗xy). For this definition, he\nhad employed two ancillary notions. The first was that of a concept\nF being R-hereditary:  \nLet us abbreviate this as  \nThe second ancillary notion we shall express here as “x\nis R-barred by F”, or “F\nR-bars x”, and it is defined thus:  \nLet us abbreviate this as  \nNow we are in a position to give Frege’s definition of the\nancestral relation R∗xy as follows:\n \nThis tells us that y falls under any concept G that is\nR-hereditary and R-bars x.  \nStill following Frege, one can then define Nx (“x\nis a natural number”) as short for  \nThe relation Rxy on which Frege focuses is that of y\n(immediately) succeeding x. This has the further advantage of\nbeing a function, i.e., a many-one relation. This enabled\nFrege to prove that the ancestral of successor is linear:\n \nThis definition of Nx secures the desired result: every natural\nnumber is but finitely many steps of immediate succession away from 0.\nAncestralization captures the notion ‘finitely many’\nwithout invoking the notion of natural number, and indeed serves as an\nindependent logico-conceptual basis for the definition of the notion\nof natural number itself. Note also that it is an essentially\nsecond-order notion.  \nGiven the functional character of the relation of immediate\nsuccession, one can write m = sn when m\nimmediately succeeds n. One especially important consequence of\nFrege’s definition of Nx is that it enables one to prove,\nas a purely logical result, the Principle of Mathematical\nInduction:  \nSo too could Frege derive, logically, all the other Dedekind-Peano\npostulates (involving the name 0 and the successor function-sign\ns) for the natural numbers.  \nThe most important of these remaining postulates is the one saying\nthat every natural number has a unique (immediate) successor. In order\nto prove this in full generality, Frege had of course to take into\naccount the possibility that an arbitrarily given natural number might\nfar exceed the size of any collection of physical objects in the\nuniverse. To what concept, then, could he turn (for a given natural\nnumber n), whose cardinality would be the successor of\nn?  \nHis answer has earned the label ‘Frege’s trick’. The\nsought concept would be none other than\n‘successor∗xn’, i.e.,\n“x is a natural number preceding or identical to\nn”. The natural numbers relentlessly generate ever more\nof their kind, as soon as we try to count them. This is why\nthere are infinitely many of them. The idea that each natural number\ntallies its predecessors in the series of natural numbers was fully\nformed in the Grundlagen, at §82, and rigorously\nexecuted in Volume I of the Grundgesetze, at\n§§114–119.  \nBy the time of the Grundgesetze, Frege had settled on an\nexplication of cardinal numbers in class-theoretic terms, which would\npreserve the structure of the foregoing considerations. The number of\nFs (i.e., the cardinal number of the class of all Fs)\nwas identified as the class of all classes that are equinumerous with\n(i.e., in 1–1 correspondence with) the class of all\n Fs.[21]\n Thus the class of all Fs is a member of its own cardinal\nnumber. So too is any class that is equinumerous with the class of all\nFs. Thus the cardinal number of any one-membered class is the\nclass of all one-membered classes; the cardinal number of any\ntwo-membered class is the class of all two-membered classes; …\nand so on. It is easy to see that, on Frege’s class-theoretic\ndefinition of cardinal number, any two equinumerous classes have the\nsame cardinal number. And numbers are not sui generis, but\nare rather classes of a very special kind. See also the Encyclopedia\narticle on\n Frege’s Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic.\n  \nIn the language of modern logic, supplied with the binary predicate\n∈ of membership, Frege’s principle of naïve\ncomprehension, to which he was committed by Basic Law V in the\nGrundgesetze, can also be rendered as the following schema:\n \nRussell’s famous paradox ensues.  \nProof. For Φy in the foregoing expression of\nnaïve comprehension, take y ∉\ny (non-self-membership). One thereby obtains  \nLet r be such an x. So  \nBut r is an object within the scope of this generalization.\nInstantiating with respect to r, one obtains  \nBut one can show in short order, within a very weak propositional\nlogic, that any statement of the form  \nis\n inconsistent.[22]\n So Frege’s Basic Law V is inconsistent. □  \nThis simple formal discovery occasioned the ‘crisis in\nfoundations’ early in the 20th century.  \nFrege’s Afterword to Volume II of his Grundgesetze,\nwritten in October 1902, begins with the heart-breaking words  \nHardly anything more undesirable can befall a scientific writer than\nto have, at the completion of his work, one of the foundation-stones\nof his edifice shattered. (Frege [1903], p. 253; author’s\ntranslation) \nRussell’s paradox consigned the details of the\nGrundgesetze to relative obscurity. The scholarly community\nhad to wait a long time for a complete English translation of the\nwork. And this was unfortunate, given its importance for the\nneo-Fregean revival that began in the\n 1960s.[23] \nRussell offered his own solution to the problem of his paradox, in the\nform of his theory of types (both simple and\n ramified).[24]\n By stratifying the universe of objects into types, Russell sought to\navoid the vicious circularity that he had diagnosed as the underlying\nproblem with Fregean class abstraction.  \nIndividuals would form the lowest type. Attributes or properties of\nindividuals (or what Russell called propositional functions\nthat could be true or false of individuals) would form the next higher\ntype … and so on. In Russell’s type theory, the relation\nof membership can hold only between objects of different types: if\nα is a member of β, then α is of lower type than\nβ. In type theory, the variables are typed. That is, a given\nvariable is to be construed as ranging only over objects of a certain\ntype. Thus there will be ‘individual’ variables (of type\n0, say) ranging over just the individuals. At the next type\nup—type 1—there will be ‘property’ and\n‘relation’ variables ranging over such properties and\nrelations as hold of, or among, individuals. (0 and 1 here are serving\nas indices of types.) The idea iterates to cover all types of\nfinite index. Moreover, in Russell’s theory, only the\nfinitely indexed types could be formed. These are the types that can\nbe indexed, from ‘outside’, so to speak, by natural\nnumbers n. There are no transfinite types, i.e., no types that\nwould be indexed by transfinite ordinals such as\n ω.[25] \nA predicative propositional function is one that involves no\nquantifications over types higher than those of its arguments. Russell\nstratifies not only the universe of discourse (the various types, and\nobjects of those types); he also stratifies the language.\nSuppose that a Russellian class (or predicative propositional\nfunction) β is first formed at a higher rank than is α.\nThen it is supposed to be meaningless (in the language of\ntype theory) to say that β is a member of α, where this is\nconstrued in the official sense of supposedly attributing the\nattribute corresponding to α to the object β. (By contrast,\nin the language of set theory, it is\nmeaningful—even if false—to say that β\n∈ α.) Thus it is impossible,\nwithin Russell’s type theory, to deal with the would-be\npredicate or property of non-self-membership. For that requires that\nthe predicate x ∈ x of\nself-membership be meaningful (and well-formed); which it is not. So,\nin his type theory, Russell blocked the kind of derivation of his own\nparadox to which Frege’s class theory fell victim.  \nRussell, however, sought to preserve Frege’s approach\nto defining cardinal numbers as classes of similar-sized classes:  \nThe cardinal number of a class α is defined as the class of all\nclasses similar to α, two classes being similar when there is a\none-one relation between them. (Russell 1908: 256) \nThis definition, and the problems it engenders, survived into\nPrincipia Mathematica.  \nBecause of Russell’s partitioning of the logical universe into\ntypes, his ‘cardinal numbers’ became typically\nambiguous. (In the following quotation, the symbol Λ\nstands for the null, or empty, class.) As Russell conceded (1908:\n257),  \n… 0 and 1 and all the other cardinals, according to [our]\ndefinitions, are ambiguous symbols, like cls, and have as many\nmeanings as there are types. To begin with 0: the meaning of 0 depends\nupon that of Λ, and the meaning of Λ is different\naccording to the type of which it is the null-class. Thus there are as\nmany 0’s as there are types; and the same applies to all the\nother cardinals. \nRussell does not, however, fully accept the strictures thus imposed.\nIn more expansive mood he immediately adds  \nNevertheless, if two classes α, β are of different types,\nwe can speak of them as having the same cardinal … because a\none-one relation may hold between the members of α and the\nmembers of β, even when α and β are of different\ntypes. [Emphasis added] \nBy giving in to this structuralist impulse, Russell in effect puts a\nsecond construal of cardinal numbers into contention with his official\ntype-theoretic one. The new construal is of a cardinal number as\nsomething that results from abstracting from classes on the\nbasis of their similarity, rather than from forming classes of similar\nclasses. Such abstraction takes the Humean form (famously exploited by\nCantor)  \nFor the reasons internal to type theory explained above, a Card cannot\nbe an object within any type within the official ontology of type\ntheory. For its would-be domain of definition would not only have to\nstraddle distinct types, but also include classes of all types. But\nthat is not possible for any type-theoretically admissible function or\noperation. This fact also precludes Russell from using Frege’s\ntrick to ensure an infinity of\n numbers.[26]\n For Frege had each natural number n be the number of preceding\nnatural numbers. For the latter to be thus numbered, they have to be\nobjects in the official ontology—which, however, as just\nobserved, Russell’s Card(inal)s are not.  \nPartitioning the universe into types accordingly exacted a high price\nfor the ‘logicism’ that might result. It is not reassuring\nto learn that the logicist reconstruction on offer for one’s\nfavorite mathematical structures is so generous as to be uniquely\nre-presented within each type. One would wish to capture their\ncommonalities within some one structure. And that,\nas we have just seen, is what Russell was trying to do, even though it\nwas doomed to failure from the start, on account of its being\ncommitted to the existence of a different series of the\n‘same’ numbers within each type.  \nThe motivation for the typing that led to this embarras de\nrichesses was understandable at the time. Russell wished to avoid\nany potentially vicious circularity that might result from\nimpredicative definitions. According to Russell, it should be illicit\nto define a class C in a way that involves generalizing about\nany range of individuals to which C itself would have to\nbelong. Thus, with partitioning into types, the notion of\nself-membership, along with non-self-membership, could not even be\ndeployed.  \nThis Russellian constraint on class abstraction, however, had the\nconsequence that with impredicative ‘class abstracts’ of\nthe form “the class of all x such that\nΦ(x)”, the existence of such a class could\nnot be guaranteed as a matter of logic. So Russell had to\npostulate that such classes existed. This came to be regarded\nas detracting from their status as would-be logical objects, and\nrevealing them instead as no more than mathematical posits. Their\nexistence was once again (at best) a synthetic a priori\nmatter, rather than one of analytic necessity and certainty.  \nOne might wonder why such classes would qualify as logical objects\ncourtesy of a single immensely powerful postulate (had it been\nconsistent), but would not so qualify if their existence has to be\nsecured in a more piecemeal postulational fashion. But that was the\nAchilles heel of Russellian logicism. The existential postulation\npresent in Russell’s Multiplicative Axiom (nowadays known as the\nAxiom of Choice) and in his Axiom of Infinity were seen as marks of\nthe merely mathematical, albeit against the background of a much more\ncapacious universe of abstract objects than just the natural numbers\nor the real numbers themselves.  \nRussellian types are ramified: that is, propositional\nfunctions of one and the same type belong to different\norders, depending on their internal logical structures. The\ntype of a propositional function, as we have seen, is\ndetermined by the types of its free variables. But two propositional\nfunctions φ and φ′ of the same type can involve\ndifferent kinds of quantifications. If φ involves quantifications\nwhose (bound) variables range over higher types than do the bound\nvariables within φ′, then φ is of correspondingly higher\norder than φ′, even though φ and φ′ are of the\nsame type. Recall that an impredicative propositional\nfunction φ is one that contains bound variables ranging over types\nas high as or higher than the type of φ itself. Assigning an\nimpredicative propositional function to a higher order is the\nramifier’s way of marking it as not kosher.  \nRussell ramified his theory of types in order to avoid explicitly\nimpredicative definitions (against which definitions Poincaré\ninfluentially inveighed). Russell then found himself hamstrung, unable\nto derive certain desired mathematical results. Among these results\nwere Cantor’s Theorem, and the theorem of real analysis which\nstates that every set X of real numbers that is bounded above\nhas a least upper bound of the same order as the real numbers in\nX. Ramified type theory appeared powerless to prove these\nresults. So Russell, in pragmatist spirit, introduced the Axiom of\nReducibility simply in order to get things done.  \nRussell’s Axiom of Reducibility in type theory states that every\npropositional function is coextensive with a predicative\none—that is, one whose quantifiers range only over types lower\nthan that of the propositional function itself. The non-trivial\ncontent of this axiom is that every impredicative\npropositional function is coextensive with a predicative one. A well\nknown example to illustrate this is the impredicative propositional\nfunction ∀F(Fx ↔\nFy). The Axiom of Reducibility could be vindicated on\nthis example by adducing the predicative propositional function x\n= y—provided that one accepts\nLeibniz’s controversial principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. If, contra Leibniz, one believes it is\npossible for indiscernibles to be distinct, then, in order to\nvindicate the Axiom of Reducibility, it would be necessary to adduce\nsome other predicative propositional function, x\n∼ y say, for which it is true\nthat  \nThe Axiom of Reducibility, however, is tantamount to conceding the\nadmissibility of impredicative definitions after all. For it collapses\nthe orders for propositional functions of type 1. Critics pointed out\nthat it would be better to eschew ramification and embrace the\nprocedure of impredicative definition as licit after all.  \nOne was then left with simple type theory (and no need for the Axiom\nof Reducibility). But even the simple theory of types eventually fell\nout of favor as a foundational theory for mathematics—possibly\nbecause in the wake of the Byzantine ramified theory, no version of\ntype theory could find favor among mathematicians themselves. Type\ntheory was displaced by the newly emerging set theory due to\nZermelo and Fraenkel, which mathematicians could recognize more easily\nas a formal codification of Cantorian mathematical practice. A\ndefinitive and richly detailed history of the reception and eventual\ndemise of Russellian logicism can be found in Grattan-Guinness (2000).\n(The terminology of ‘sets’ was adopted in order to\ncontrast these ‘safer’, paradox-free objects with the\nproblematic classes of Frege’s inconsistent theory.)\n \nWith some justice ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of\nChoice) can be construed as an intellectual descendant of Russellian\ntype theory, even though both theories date from the same year, 1908.\n \nThe displacement of type theory by set theory took place during the\n1920s. The aim was still to unify all of mathematics, and to provide a\ncapacious universe of abstract objects in order to do so. All the\ndifferent mathematical theories would be interpretable within set\ntheory, upon suitable identification of ‘set-theoretic\nsurrogates’ for the objects studied by those theories. So, for\nexample, the finite von Neumann ordinals can serve as set-theoretic\nsurrogates for the natural\n numbers.[27]\n And ℘(ω), the power set of the set of natural numbers,\nis the set-theoretic surrogate for the real\n continuum.[28] \nZFC set theory is an account of a cumulative hierarchy V of\npure sets, built up, ultimately, from the empty set ∅. Each set\nwithin V is ‘formed’ by some ordinally indexed\nrank. The ranks are cumulative, and are generated, at successor\nordinals, by application of the power-set operation. The erstwhile\ntypes are born again as ranks, except that ranks are\ncumulative—every rank contains all members of lower\nranks. Their members are put on all fours, so to speak, for they are\ntaken to occupy one single extensionalized, untyped universe V\nof sets.  \nQuine (1969), chapters XI and XII, is a masterly tracing of a route\nconsisting of incremental theoretical adjustments that one could in\nprinciple make, beginning with the type theory of Principia\nMathematica (PM), and ending with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\nThe purpose behind postulating the Axiom of Reducibility in type\ntheory, as already observed, was to ensure that every propositional\nfunction is coextensive with a predicative one. As Quine points out,\nhowever (and as Ramsey had pointed out before him), the Axiom of\nReducibility really defeats the purpose behind its own postulation,\nthereby motivating the adoption of a simple type theory in place of\nPM’s ramified one. If one then reformulates simple type theory\nwith ‘general’, or untyped, variables, and lets the types\nbe cumulative (rather than remain stratified one from another without\noverlap), one effects the segue to Zermelo set theory.\nFraenkel’s Axiom Scheme of Replacement finally allows one to\n“[pierce] all type ceilings” (Quine 1969: 282), and reach\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Replacement says that any function that\nis defined on a set as its domain has a set as its range. This allows\none to form, for example, for any transfinite ordinal number κ,\nthe set  \nof all infinite cardinals numbers ℵα, where\nα = 0,1,2,… < κ. The ordinals α less than\nκ form a set (indeed: κ itself).\nℵα, better thought of as ℵ(α),\nis the α-th infinite cardinal number. So ℵ is a function\nwith domain κ, whose value on α is the α-th infinite\ncardinal number. By Replacement, the set {ℵα\n| α < κ}\nexists. Such a set resides at a rank way above κ.  \nQuine’s account amplifies the slightly less detailed one that is\nto be found in Gödel\n (1993/1995).[29]\n As Gödel observed (pp. 45–6), the ‘theory of\naggregates’, or set theory,  \n… as presented by Zermelo, Fraenkel and von Neumann … is\nnothing else but a natural generalization of the theory of types, or\nrather, it is what becomes of the theory of types if certain\nsuperfluous restrictions are removed. \nThese removals are threefold: make the types cumulative; untype the\nvariables; and allow type formation to extend into the transfinite.\n \nZFC avoids Russell’s Paradox, even though all its member-sets\nare on all fours, within an untyped universe. This is because its\nuniverse V itself is not a set. By not espousing any\npowerful enough set-abstraction principle, the set theorist avoids\nRussell’s paradox. Partitioning the universe of discourse into\ntypes appears to have been a methodologically costly over-reaction to\nthe problem of Russell’s Paradox. The latter would of course be\nre-instated if one were ever to treat the universe V as a set.\nSimply apply the Axiom Scheme of Separation  \nusing for Φ(x) the Russellian formula-instance x\n∉ x, and instantiating\n∀y with respect to V.  \nMathematicians have a well-established practice of treating\nset-abstracts as well-formed terms. They are of the logico-grammatical\nform {x |\n Φ(x)}.[30]\n If one’s formalizing logic is to respect this practice, then it\nmust provide the variable-binding term-forming operator\n(v.b.t.o.) of set-abstraction:  \nSuch an operator may be applied to any formula Φ to produce a\nterm. Among such formulae are the hazardous ones x = x\nand x ∉ x. The formalizing foundationalist will\ntherefore be careful to adopt a free logic in which it is\nnot assumed, of every well-formed term, that it enjoys a\ndenotation. The proof of Russell’s Paradox can then be deprived\nof its sting: it simply becomes a proof of the negative existential\n¬∃x x = {y | y\n∉ y}.  \nAdopting a free logic, however, brings with it the following\nobligation: if one wishes to recognize that certain sorts of objects\nexist, or that a particular object exists, then one will have to\npostulate their existence explicitly. No longer does such existence\nderive from a kind of built-in, or tacit, default assumption of the\nunderlying logic. Rather, it demands explicit expression as a\ntheoretical commitment.  \nYou want an empty set? the ZFC-theorist asks. By all\nmeans! Here it is:  \nYou want singletons? Sure thing!:  \n… Or, if you prefer, get them from the axiom of unordered\npairs, by taking the same instance twice over:  \nYou want an infinite set? By all means! Here is a very useful\none:  \nwhere Ny means that y is a finite von Neumann\nordinal (and this concept can be explicitly defined in set-theoretic\nterms).  \nZFC theorists wear their ontological commitments, either outright or\nconditional, very much on their postulational sleeve. They are out to\ncharacterize a very rich mathematical universe, to be sure—one\nin which there are so many things, and of such great variety of\nstructure(s), that one should be able to find, therein, a\nset-theoretic ‘surrogate’ for virtually any kind of\nmathematical object or structure about which one may wish to make\nconjectures and prove theorems. With only this over-riding concern to\nunify all of mathematics within one overarching\n domain,[31]\n the ZFC theorist is not particularly committed to a logicist\nview of the objects and structures involved. If anything, logicism has\nacquired a new challenge: show how set theory\nitself—like arithmetic and analysis, say—is simply a\nbody of logical truths in definitional disguise; and show how sets\nthemselves can be (re-)construed as some kind of definitional\nconcoction from purely logical\n objects![32] \nThe neo-Fregean revival had its origin in an insight of Charles\nParsons (see Parsons 1965: 183 and 194). He pointed out that what he\ncalled principle (A) below suffices, given the structure of\nFrege’s argumentation in the Grundlagen, for the\nderivation of the axioms of Peano arithmetic. Parsons uses the binary\nquantifier ‘Glz’ to abbreviate\n“gleichzahlig” (equinumerous), and uses\nNx to abbreviate “the number of”:\n \n(A) NxFx =\nNxGx ≡\nGlzx(Fx,Gx).\n \n… we can put [Frege’s procedure] in the form of defining\nPeano’s three primitives ‘0’, ‘natural\nnumber’ and ‘successor’, and proving Peano’s\naxioms. … it is not necessary to use any axioms of set\nexistence except in introducing terms of the form\n‘NxFx’ and in proving (A),\nso that the argument could be carried out by taking (A) as an\naxiom. \nThis is nowadays called ‘Frege’s\n Theorem’.[33]\n Frege’s Theorem has Principle (A) as its hypothesis. Curiously,\nthe stress Frege places, in the Grundlagen, on the importance\nof this principle (that two concepts have the same number just in case\nthey are gleichzahlig) is dissipated in the\nGrundgesetze, where the two halves of the biconditional\nappear widely separated: in §53 Frege proves that if two concepts\ncorrespond 1–1, then their numbers are identical, and in\n§69 he proves the converse. But nowhere in the\nGrundgesetze does he re-assemble the biconditional and accord\nit prime philosophical importance. Had he done so, he might\nwell have become the first neo-Fregean in response to Russell’s\nParadox. In order to do so, however, he would have had to overcome his\nreluctance to view (A) as a logical\n axiom.[34] \nThe neo-Fregean movement seeks to reveal that a significant amount of\nmathematics is analytic. This is a stronger claim than that it is\na priori and derives no part of its justification from\nempirical science, or even from successful applications within the\nempirical sciences. For that would hold of mathematics (or indeed any\nother branch of knowledge) conceived of as synthetic a\npriori. The neo-Fregean maintains in addition that significant\nparts of mathematics flow logically from principles that are analytic\nof (or definitional of) their central concepts or predicates, such as\n‘natural number’ or ‘real number’. That is,\nthey flow from the very meanings of those central predicates. (We opt\nhere for the linguistic version of the analyticity claim). Note the\nstress here on ‘significant\n parts’.[35]\n We know from Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem that\nany consistent and sufficiently strong theory of arithmetic is unable\nto prove or refute (the formalized statement of) its own consistency.\nThe latter statement is true, but unprovable. In light of the\nincompleteness phenomena, one would be hard pressed to make good on\nthe claim that all mathematical truths are true by virtue\nonly of such logical considerations as can be captured in\nsystems of formal\n proof.[36]\n When the first principles of a mathematical theory, such as\narithmetic, form an essentially incomplete axiomatization, the\nlogicist will have to maintain that the justification of any\nnew first principle can be furnished in some strictly logical\nsense.  \nNote that the foregoing remarks describe the general context for a\nneo-Fregean revival of logicism of any kind. They do not dictate the\nexact form of any such revival. In\n §3\n we discuss the particular form of the revival that involves extending\nsecond-order logic with Hume’s Principle; and in\n §4,\n we discuss constructive logicism.  \nThese two forms of neo-Fregean revival of logicism share the following\nthree important features with Frege’s own treatment.  \nFirst, the number 0 (zero) is still defined as the number of any empty\nconcept: in particular, as the number of non-self-identical\nthings (formally: #x ¬x =\nx).  \nSecondly, once the existence of any natural number n is\nsecured, that of its successor, s(n), is secured by\ntaking s(n) to be the number of all natural numbers\nfrom 0 to n, inclusive (Frege’s trick).\n \nThirdly, the definition of the concept of natural number exploits the\nnotion of the ancestral of the relation of succession:\nx bears the succession-ancestral relation to y just in\ncase y is at most finitely many steps of succession away from\nx. (As already made clear, any apparent circularity in this\ndefinition, deriving from the adverbial gloss ‘finitely’,\nturns out, upon closer inspection of the definitions used, to be just\nthat: merely apparent.) The concept “z is a natural\nnumber” is then defined as “either 0 is z, or 0\nbears the succession-ancestral relation to z”. And this\nis what allows the neo-Fregean logicist to derive the principle of\nmathematical induction for the natural numbers. The reader of this\nsurvey article will be spared the formal details.  \nThe neo-Fregean revival began in earnest with\n Wright.[37]\n Wright (1983) sought to derive the Dedekind-Peano axioms for\nsuccessor arithmetic from what was called N= and has since\ncome to be known as Hume’s Principle (that is, Parsons’s\nprinciple (A) above):  \nWright sketched a derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from\nHume’s Principle. The deductions sketched would be carried out\nin standard second-order logic—‘standard’ in the\nsense that, in the presence of HP, all number-abstractive terms of the\nform #xΦ(x) can be proved to denote. Such a system\nis unfree with respect to its number-abstractive terms. This\npoint holds even if the second-order logic in question is a\nfree logic in the official sense of not being committed to the\ntheorem-scheme ∃!t (i.e., ∃x\nx = t) for any\nwell-formed singular term t. The proof of this point is short\nand easy, and is like the one given in\n §1.2.3.\n We shall given an informal version as follows.  \nClearly, the identity relation is a one-one correspondence of the\nΦs onto the Φs. Therefore it is a theorem of second-order\nlogic that  \n∃R(R maps the Φs 1–1 onto the Φs).\n \nThis is the right-hand side of that instance of HP whose left-hand\nside is  \n#xΦ(x) = #xΦ(x).  \nThe latter has now been established as a theorem-scheme of\nsecond-order logic with HP. Hence in this system we have the\ntheorem-scheme  \n∃!#xΦ(x).  \nThe over-arching theme is that we can redeem Frege’s key\nphilosophical insights concerning (natural and real) numbers and our\nknowledge of them, despite Russell’s discovery of paradox in\nFrege’s own theory of classes. That paradox notwithstanding,\nnumbers are still logical objects, characterized by methods or\nprinciples of abstraction—which of course cannot be as ambitious\nas Frege’s Basic Law V. These principles afford a distinctive\nform of epistemic access to numbers. The usual mathematical axioms\ngoverning the two kinds of numbers are to be derived as results in\n(higher-order) logic—essentially following Frege’s\ndeductive plan. These derivations will exploit appropriate definitions\nof the primitive constants, functions, and predicates of the brand of\nnumber theory concerned. (For example: 0, 1; s, +, ×;\n<; N(x); ℝ(x).)  \nThe main difference is this: the neo-Fregean no longer accepts\nFrege’s definition of numbers as classes of equinumerous\nclasses. Instead, the numbers are vouchsafed as sui generis,\ncourtesy of newly chosen abstraction principles. The Wrightian\nneo-logicist (henceforth: the HP-er) opts for HP; the constructive\nlogicist opts, much more modestly, for rules permitting the\nintroduction of zero and of successors. Apart from this key\ndifference, however, the neo-Fregeans hew in other places quite\nclosely to Frege’s overall deductive strategy when deriving the\nDedekind-Peano postulates.  \nNo supplementation by intuition or sensory experience will be needed\nin the derivations of these postulates. The trains of reasoning\ninvolved will depend only on our grasp of logical validities,\nsupplemented by appropriate definitions. Purported result (for the\nHP-er): because HP is analytic, logicism is vindicated; and\nthe mathematical knowledge derived in this way is revealed to be\nanalytic, not synthetic.  \nFor reservations about this claimed result, however, see Boolos\n(1997). The main objection with which the HP-er needs to contend is\nthat Hume’s Principle is neither a logical nor an analytic\ntruth. It cannot be logical, so the objection would go, because it has\nsuch a huge ledger of ontological commitments: for every\nconcept, its alleged number. And it cannot be analytic, because the\ntwo sides of the biconditional have different ontological\ncommitments: the right-hand side has no commitments to\nnumbers, while the left-hand side is brimming with such commitments.\nIn order to defend against these objections, the HP-er needs to do two\nthings. First—as any logicist needs to do—he needs to\nchallenge the dogma that no logical principle can carry any\nontological commitments. Secondly, he needs to provide an account of\nanalyticity according to which a biconditional can be analytic even\nwhen the explicit ontological commitments of each side of the\nbiconditional differ. (These commitments are to be judged by\nconsidering each side as a sentence in the restricted language whose\nvocabulary is just sufficient to allow the sentence in question to be\nformed.)  \nThe HP-er advocates Hume’s Principle in its unrestricted form,\nand is thereby committed, as we have seen, to the existence of a\ndenotation for every term of the form {x |\nΦ(x)}. The HP-er is committed, not only to the\nnumber of all natural numbers, but also to the number of all\nself-identical things—or, at least, so Wright was in Wright\n(1983). This ‘universal number’ #x(x\n= x) is sometimes called\n‘anti-zero’. In n. 5 on p. 187 one reads  \nIt is worth stressing that it is, of course, absolutely essential that\nthere be such a number as Nx : x =\nx; for it is impossible to imagine what sort of ground\nthere could be for admitting Nx : x\n≠ x if that were in doubt. \nBoolos (1987), after raising qualms about the universal number,\nprovided an ingenious model (which had been anticipated informally by\nGeach (1975: 446–7)) to allay the misgiving about the\nconsistency of full second-order logic with HP (the system now known\nas FA, for ‘Frege Arithmetic’). Simply take the natural\nnumbers along with the distinct object ω as the elements of the\ndomain. The element ω serves as the denotation of any term of\nthe form #xΦ(x) where Φ is satisfied by\ninfinitely many elements. Note, however, that this consistency proof\nworks only when FA is taken on its\n own.[38]\n The Geach–Boolos model cannot be relied upon to secure the\nconsistency of FA in conjunction with other theories, such as\nset theory, that one might wish to extend with FA. Since, however,\ncounting finite extensions ought to be a universally applicable\nintellectual operation, regardless of subject matter, it will be the\nexception rather than the rule that FA is to be applied only to\nthe natural numbers (plus, perhaps, the unnatural factotum\nω). Rather, FA should be applicable not only to concrete\nobjects, but also to abstract mathematical entities such as real\nnumbers and sets. Provided only that one has a criterion of identity\nfor the objects in question, one should be in a position to count any\nfinite collection of them.  \nSubsequently, in Hale and Wright 2001 (p. 315), Wright expressed\nreservations over whether “x =\nx” counts as a sortal predicate eligible to be\nprefixed by “the number of x such that”. Now Wright\nwas inquiring after what “is wanted for the exorcism of\nanti-zero” (p. 314, emphasis added). His considered answer is\nthat a term of the form #xFx will denote a number only if the\nconcept F is both sortal and not indefinitely\n extensible.[39]\n So Wright subsequently hoped to make actual what he had previously\nalleged to be impossible to imagine. The technical proposal must\ntherefore be that Hume’s Principle is to be restricted to\npredicates that (express concepts that) are both sortal and not\nindefinitely extensible. But this, of course, raises the question\nwhether there is an effective method for determining, of any given\npredicate F, whether F (expresses a concept that) is\nboth sortal and not indefinitely extensible. In the absence of any\nsuch effective method, the theory will not have been axiomatized.  \nThis survey perforce confines itself, in the main, to (neo-)logicist\naccounts of the natural numbers. But it is worth raising one\nmore question about the extension of a neo-Fregean account in an\nattempt to cope with the real numbers. We shall call it the\ninclusion question. How is one to appreciate that the natural\nnumbers qua reals are (in the non-punning sense of\nnumerical identity) the natural numbers vouchsafed by logicism about\nthe\n naturals?[40]\n This question is not answered by the neo-Fregean abstractionist\naccount of the reals in Shapiro (2000). In that account, the various\nnew abstracta are abstracted from quite varying equivalence relations,\nand no attempt is made to leave it open as a possibility that the\nnatural number n is the integer n, is\nthe rational number n, and is the real number\nn. (Although on p. 339 Shapiro writes that he proposes\n“to avoid the issue [of identity under inclusion]\nhere”, his proposed treatment nevertheless answers the inclusion\nquestion negatively.)  \nOne issue that is not satisfactorily disposed of, is this: in what\nsense can Wright’s neo-Fregean logicist claim to be furnishing\nan epistemic foundation for, let us say, first-order Peano\narithmetic, if their axiomatic principle HP, along with the\nsecond-order logic employed (=FA), puts the supposed\n‘foundation’ much higher in the hierarchy of\nconsistency-strengths than the weaker theory being\n‘founded’? (This is to raise once again the worry\nexpressed by Boolos (1997:\n 248–9).)[41] \nIt is an age-old tradition in foundational investigations to provide a\nfoundation that is not only obviously consistent, but obviously true,\nand from which all the results in the branch(es) of mathematics being\nfounded will follow logically. Moreover, this following logically is\nitself something that must be epistemically accessible—hence the\nimportance of checkable proof. A foundational effort can be directed\nat many different branches of mathematics simultaneously, or just at\nsome particular branch, such as arithmetic. In the former case, it is\nunderstandable if the foundational theory chosen (such as ZFC) has a\nhigher consistency strength in relation to any one branch of\nmathematics being founded. But if the effort is directed at just that\none branch (say, arithmetic), then the foundation provided should be\nof a consistency-strength that is as low as possible, in relation to\nthat branch.  \nThe consistency-strength of FA is that of second-order arithmetic\nZ2 (i.e., real analysis), which is equal to that of\nZermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Power Sets. The\nconsistency-strength of first-order Peano arithmetic is much weaker,\nnamely that of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of\nPower Sets and without the Axiom of Infinity.  \nBy adopting second-order logic along with Hume’s Principle in an\nunrestricted form, Wright incurred commitment (as a matter of\nanalyticity) not only to each natural number, seriatim, but\nalso to the cardinal number of any concept whatsoever. We\nknow now, however, that Gödel’s prescient\n‘completionary’ insight has long since been fully borne\nout. The insight in question was that the set-theorist’s key to\nproving stronger and stronger results in mathematics—and in\nparticular the consistency of each newly attained system—is to\npostulate the existence of ever-larger cardinal numbers. If all these\ncardinals were available across the board courtesy of Hume’s\nPrinciple applied to appropriately expressed concepts, then Wright\nwould be proposing a foundational theory of enormous strength. The\nonly reason why FA is not even more powerful than Z2\nis that the former system’s ontology is being generated solely\nby the abstractions. There is no other source of existential\npostulation, as there would be if one were to add, say, set theory to\nthe theoretical mix.  \nUpon such addition further care would be needed when considering the\nnature of Wright’s transfinite cardinals begotten by\nHume’s Principle. As the investigations of Kit Fine (1998: 515;\n2002) have revealed, any attempt to combine such an abstractive\naccount of transfinite cardinals with set theory must resort to\ntreating the abstracted cardinals as Urelemente rather than\nas sets. Set theory cannot, by itself, provide a set-surrogate for\nevery transfinite cardinal that would be generated by Hume’s\nPrinciple.  \nAnother and rather different line of criticism of the claim that HP is\nanalytic can be found in Mancosu (2016: Chapter 4). Ironically,\nMancosu advances what he calls a Good Company objection to HP.\nHP jostles for primacy with at least infinitely many ‘Good\nCompanion’ abstraction principles. They are good because, like\nHP, they permit the logical derivation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms.\nThey do so via their respective ‘number’-abstraction\noperators with predicates whose extensions are\n(Dedekind-)finite. They assign such extensions the right\nnatural numbers as their cardinal numbers. When that operator is\napplied to a predicate whose extension is (Dedekind-)infinite,\nhowever, these other principles give results arbitrarily different\nfrom what one would expect from the more Cantorian principle HP. HP\nand these Good Companions get matters right on all finite extensions.\nBut the Good Companions give rise to a confusing variety of\n‘number’-assignments to infinite extensions. The problem\nfor the HP-er, as Mancosu sees it, is how to maintain the case for the\nanalyticity of HP in light of all this good company. We see here\nanother manifestation of the epistemological worry that HP is of\nexcessive consistency strength when the logicist project is simply to\nfurnish a deeper but analytic foundation for Dedekind-Peano\narithmetic. All that such a foundation requires is what HP and\nthese competing Good Companion principles agree\nupon—namely, that predicates with (Dedekind-)finite\nextensions should get the right numbers assigned to them (i.e., the\nnatural numbers). There is no need for the logicist about\nDedekind-Peano arithmetic to make pronouncements about any infinite\nnumbers. \nMancosu’s Good Companions to HP arise only because he shares\nwith the HP-er a fundamental logical commitment: every singular\nterm of the language must denote. This means that the logic furnishing\nthe supposed logicist foundation for arithmetic is not a free\nlogic. Every singular term formed by applying the number-abstraction\noperator to a predicate is taken to stand for some object. This\nrefusal to adopt a free logic complicates matters unduly if ones sees\nas part of the logicist project the task of generating only\nepistemically justifiable commitment to numbers as abstract\nexistents. We want, as it were, to be able to recognize only those\nnumbers whose existential credentials are absolutely compelling. In\nparticular, the logicist should be able to deliver only the\nnatural numbers, when furnishing deeper logical derivations of the\nDedekind-Peano postulates. \nWe begin this section with some remarks about Gentzenian proof theory.\nThis is not because it played any direct role in the development of\nlogicism—far from it—but because we seek in this section\nto describe in broad terms a different kind of neo-logicism that draws\nmore heavily on proof-theoretic resources.  \nIt was only with the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the early 1930s (see\nGentzen 1934, 1935) that researchers in foundations were equipped with\nformal calculi of deduction that could do real justice to the actual\nstructure of inferential dependencies within mathematical proofs. What\nwe have in mind here are the dependencies of conclusions upon both\npremises and assumptions that may have been made only “for the\nsake of argument”. A good example of assumptions of the latter\nkind are reductio assumptions (assume φ; derive\nabsurdity; conclude ¬φ, now independently of φ).  \nIt is extraordinary that the community of mathematical logicians took\nso long to discover the calculi of natural deduction (and the\nsequent calculi), once Frege, in 1879, had cracked the\npreviously hidden grammatical code of multiply quantified sentences.\nIt is remarkable that Gödel, in 1929, could have demonstrated the\ncompleteness of first-order logic before Gentzen’s\nnatural formulation of it, when that logic was available only in the\nforms of the highly unnatural deductive calculi devised by Frege, by\nHilbert, and by Russell and Whitehead.  \nThe essential breakthrough of Gentzen’s treatment was to\ncharacterize each logical operator in isolation, with rules of its\nown, rules in which only that operator would explicitly\nfeature. Moreover, the rules in question would deal only with a\nsingle occurrence (in dominant position) of the operator in\nquestion. The rule for reasoning to a conclusion with the operator\ndominant was called the operator’s introduction rule;\nwhile the rule for reasoning from a premise with the operator\ndominant was called its elimination rule.  \nThe introduction and elimination rules for any logical operator have\nto be in a certain kind of equilibrium, an equilibrium that\nlends itself to an interpretation of the rules as matching the\ninferential obligations of any responsible, rational and sincere\nspeaker to the inferential entitlements of any responsible, rational\nand trusting\n listener.[42] \nThe equilibrium in question is explicated by the so-called\nreduction procedures for the logical operators. These\nprocedures enable one to remove from a proof any sentence occurrence\nthat stands both as the conclusion of an application of an\nintroduction rule and as the major premise of an application of the\ncorresponding elimination rule. Repeated application of the procedures\nwill eventually turn the proof into one that is in normal\nform—essentially, one that is not eligible for any further\napplication of the\n procedures.[43]\n The significance of proofs in normal form is that they represent\ndirect deductive routes from their premises to their\nconclusions.  \nPowerful, incisive and revolutionary though Gentzen’s approach\nhas since proved to be, it was, in its turn, curiously limited. It was\nrestricted to just the universally acknowledged logical\noperators of first-order logic: ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ∃\nand ∀.  \nAt exactly the same time there appeared Carnap (1934), Logische\nSyntax der Sprache, which offered an account of analyticity for\nlanguages in which all logico-mathematical operators could\nmake similar contributions to the status of a sentence as analytically\ntrue (or analytically false). Carnap, however, did this by employing\naxiomatizations involving all the various logico-mathematical\noperators, co-functioning in grammatically complex axioms. His\napproach was therefore quite unlike the more ‘natural’ one\nof Gentzen, which was single-operator focused. Moreover, the\nunnatural approach was still Carnap’s preferred choice in work\nas late as his Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (Carnap\n 1939).[44]\n We mention Carnap in contrast with Gentzen here because of\nGentzen’s tragic early death at the end of the Second World War.\nWho knows how Gentzen might have extended his exquisitely conceived\ninferentialist techniques to items on the broad logicist agenda? His\nwritings appeared in English translation only in 1969 (see Gentzen\n1934/1935 [1969]). Carnap, however, did survive to exert considerable\ninfluence on the thinking of a new generation of philosophers of\nmathematics on the problems and prospects for logicism; and he was\nable to do so from the mid-1930s, in the USA, writing in English.  \nAfter the early 1940s, proof theory did not broaden and diversify so\nas to address a potentially fertile agenda: an investigation of the\nvarious forms that introduction and elimination rules might take, as\nit examines rule-governed expressions whose rules are not quite so\nneatly classifiable as introduction and elimination rules. This is the\ncase, for example, with families of ‘coeval’ and\ninterdependent concepts of a nevertheless logico-mathematical kind. An\nexample of such a family is that of the ordered pair of any\ntwo things; the first member of any ordered pair; and the\nsecond member of the same. An important feature of this\nexample, and of other examples that could be given, is that the\noperators in question are term-forming operators. Gentzen had\nconfined his study to sentence-forming operators. Perhaps it was\nTarski’s theory of truth for formalized languages (see Tarski\n1956 [1933]) that deflected interest away from further development of\nthis essentially inferentialist approach to the meanings of\nlogical and mathematical operators.  \nAn inferentialist approach holds special appeal for the semantic\nanti-realist. According to Michael Dummett’s influential\ncharacterization of semantic realism, the realist is one who believes\nthat every declarative sentence of one’s language is\ndeterminately true or false, independently of our means of coming to\nknow which. This is what is supposed to justify the realist’s\nuse of strictly classical logical principles such as the Law of\nExcluded Middle. The anti-realist, by contrast, insists that all\ntruths are knowable; and is quick to point out that we do not\nhave any effective method for deciding the truth or falsity of\nstatements in mathematics. Anti-realists, accordingly, reject the Law\nof Excluded Middle (and all other strictly classical rules that are\nintuitionistically equivalent to it), and advocate the use of\nintuitionistic or constructive logic, rather than classical logic.\n \nAn anti-realist concerned to demonstrate the analyticity of the basic\nlaws of arithmetic would inquire whether one can eschew strictly\nclassical passages of inference when deriving the Peano postulates.\nFor, if those postulates are analytically true, then the anti-realist\nwould expect to attain them by means of rules justifiable by appeal\nonly to the constructive contents involved (see Rumfitt 1999). And\nindeed the anti-realist can. She can avoid recourse to the full power\nof Hume’s Principle. The innocuous ingredients of the conceptual\ncontent of Hume’s Principle, insofar as finite numbers are\nconcerned, will find expression in the inferential rules that the\nanti-realist lays down for zero, #, and successor. Heyting arithmetic,\nafter all, has exactly the same axioms as Peano arithmetic, and is the\nlogical closure of those axioms under intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. The two systems PA and HA differ only in respect of\nthe logic used for closure. It would be rather odd if the intuitionist\nwere debarred from being a logicist in the sense at issue here.  \nThe pursuit of analyticity in the foundations of arithmetic is one\nthat could be very well served by the proof-theoretic methods favored\nby the Dummettian anti-realist’s theory of meaning. Central to\nsuch a proof-theoretic approach is the formulation of inferential\nrules governing all the expression-forming operators in\nquestion—rules that come, preferably, in\nintroduction-elimination pairs. The rules are constitutive of the\nrespective operators’ meanings; whence results proved solely by\nmeans of those rules qualify as analytic. A question that will be\nraised by any alert meaning-theorist, therefore, is the following:\nMight there not be some anti-realist (constructive, or intuitionistic)\nderivation, in Fregean spirit, of the basic laws of arithmetic by\nappeal to suitable meaning-constituting rules of inference that\nconform to the general requirements of an anti-realist theory of\nmeaning? Anti-realist doctrine invites such extension to the\nmathematical expressions in fundamental theories such as arithmetic.\nIt could give Fregean logicists what they are seeking: fundamental\nderivations of the Dedekind-Peano postulates from more basic logical\nprinciples, logical principles that are at least as secure,\nepistemically, as the mathematical postulates they are seeking to\nderive.  \nA theory of this kind, called constructive logicism, was\npresented in Tennant (1987). Its distinguishing features may be\nsummarized as follows.  \nConstructive logicism is based on rules of natural deduction that are\narguably analytic of the central notions zero, successor, and number.\nThere are also rules that pin down the meaning of the\nnumber-term-forming operator #xΦ(x) (the number of\nΦs). In the terminology introduced above, the rules for #x\namount to a single-abstraction identity principle. The\nremaining rules are allowed to carry only very local and modest\nontological commitment, on the grounds that it is part of the very\nmeaning of a term such as ‘0’ that its use in the language\ncommits one to the existence of the number 0. Here, for example, are\nthe natural-deduction rules governing zero. ‘⊥’ is\nthe symbol for absurdity.  \nIn order to temper the modest commitment just mentioned, all\nderivations are constructed within a free logic, so that all\nexistential commitments other than those incurred by the rules\nthemselves would have to be made\n explicit.[46]\n All of the existential commitments that the constructive logicist\nincurs in this way will be incurred, anyway, by the HP-er who\nadvocates Hume’s Principle in its unrestricted form. Recall that\nthe HP-er is committed, not only to the number of all natural numbers,\nbut also to the number of all self-identical things.  \nThe ontological bill for the constructive logicist is much more\nmodest, compared to that of the HP-er. The constructive logicist is\nnot even committed (by the rules he lays down) to the existence of the\nnumber of all natural numbers. Commitment is incurred (by employing\nFrege’s trick) to the natural numbers seriatim, as\nnecessary existents. No commitment is incurred, however, to any other\ncardinal numbers.  \nChapter 25 of Tennant (1987), titled “On deriving the basic laws\nof arithmetic: Or, how to Frege–Wright a Dedekind-Peano”,\nprovides detailed formal derivations of the Dedekind-Peano axioms,\nwithin a free, intuitionistic relevant logic. All the derivations\ngiven are intuitionistic, in conformity with the anti-realist\naspirations explained above, and in order to warrant the adjective\n‘constructive’ in the phrase ‘constructive\nlogicism’.  \nHeck (1997b) dealt with so-called ‘finite Frege\narithmetic’. His treatment was classical. But Heck was\nconcerned, as constructive logicism had been, to derive the basic laws\nof arithmetic while incurring ontological commitment only to the\nnatural numbers. To this end Heck restricted Hume’s Principle to\npredicates with finite extensions. It is therefore natural to\nconjecture that constructive logicism is the intuitionistic\n(relevant) fragment of Heck’s finite Frege arithmetic.  \nTennant (1987) argues that a condition of adequacy for any logicist\ntheory is to explain the applicability of the finite cardinals (see p.\n234). Let ∃nxFx be the formula of\nfirst-order logic with identity, defined inductively in the usual way,\nthat says that there are exactly n Fs. Let\nn be the numeral denoting the natural number n,\nthat is, “s…s0”, with n\noccurrences of the successor symbol s. Schema N is the\nfollowing biconditional, an instance of which is obtained by fixing on\na particular natural number n and open formula Φ.  \nSchema N: #xΦx = n ↔\n∃nxΦx. \nAn adequate theory of number would allow one to derive every instance\nof Schema\n N;[47]\n and the theory of constructive logicism does that. Tennant suggests\nthat this constitutes a solution to the problem of the applicability\nof natural numbers in counting finite collections.  \nAll the logicist accounts discussed so far dealt only with zero,\nsuccessor, and “…is a natural number”. But there\nare important differences among them. It is not at all clear that\nconstructive logicism has the same high consistency-strength of Frege\nArithmetic. There appears to be no way to derive, within the\nconstructive logicist system, an existence claim of the form  \nwhere the extension of F is an infinite set (such as the set of\nall natural numbers). Contrast this with the fact that FA proves  \nThe present author therefore conjectures that the consistency-strength\nof this system is lower than that of FA.  \nIn Tennant (2009), the constructive logicist treatment is extended to\ndeal with both addition and multiplication. The key innovation is a\n‘logic of orderly pairing’: a system of natural-deduction\nrules of inference governing the formation of the ordered pair\nπ(t,u) from existing objects t and u,\nand the projections λ(u) of the left, and\nρ(u) of the right, member of any ordered pair u.\n \nZalta (1999) proposes an interestingly different, because\nmodal-logical, route to the natural numbers. Although Zalta\ndoes not himself classify it as such, his approach would appear to\nwarrant the adjective ‘neo-logicist’. (We prescind from\nquestions about the logical status of modal logic.)  \nZalta employs a classical second-order modal logic (S5) with identity,\nand with both the first-order Barcan ‘formula’, or\naxiom-scheme  \nand its second-order correlate  \nThe first-order Barcan formula forces one to interpret quantifiers as\nranging over all possible individuals, whatever world one is\n‘in’—no ‘expansion’ or\n‘contraction’ of the domain can be involved as one\ntraverses the accessibility relation from possible world to possible\nworld.  \nThe logic is free, and descriptive terms (the description operator\nι is primitive) are interpreted rigidly—that is, the\ndenotation of a descriptive term in the actual world, if it has one\nthere, is its denotation in any other possible world.  \nThere are the usual alethic modalities □ and ◊ of necessity\nand possibility (as interpreted by S5, of course), and the actuality\noperator A. The relation xF of\nencoding can hold between an abstract object\nx and a property F.  \nAx will mean that x is an abstract object. The\nproperties that an abstract object encodes are constitutive of its\nnature, and as such, are essential to its identity as an object.\n(Zalta 1993: 396)  \nFor example, Plato’s Form of a Triangle encodes the property of\nbeing a triangle, but does not exemplify it.  \nAmong Zalta’s fundamental principles are the following.  \nZalta defines an equinumerosity relation ≈ among properties with\nrespect to ordinary objects—that is, the possibly\nconcrete ones. With ≈ in hand, Zalta offers the notion of a\n(cardinal) number (Zalta 1993: 630):  \nNumbers(x,G) ≡dfAx\n∧ ∀F(xF ↔ F ≈\nG). \nIt follows that x numbers G just in case x is an\nabstract object that encodes exactly the properties equinumerous to\nG (where, nota bene, equinumerosity is judged only\nwith respect to the ordinary objects). And it follows easily\nfrom Zalta’s first principles that “for every property\nG, there is a unique object which numbers G”.  \nZalta’s system delivers Hume’s Principle:  \n#F = #G ↔ F ≈ G, \nand the following obvious corollary:  \n∀G∃y(y = #G). \nIn this regard Zalta’s system is as powerful as Wright’s:\nthey both guarantee for every property its number. Wright, however,\nbegins with Hume’s Principle as a first principle, whereas Zalta\nderives Hume’s Principle (as Frege originally did) from his own\n‘more basic’ (and possibly more powerful) principles.  \nWe note the following three points, in concluding our exposition of\nZalta’s system. In his sense of ‘concrete’ and\n‘abstract’,  \nIn points (2) and (3), Zalta departs explicitly from Frege and all\nother (neo-)logicists discussed above.  \nWe see from the foregoing discussion that there are various problems\nto be faced by extant versions of logicism or neo-logicism in the\nliterature. The reader who remains mindful of them will be in a\nposition to examine the details of any proposed new neo-logicist\naccount with a more critically focused eye.  \nSome of these problems confront any version of logicism, and their\nsolutions might be required as ‘conditions of adequacy’ on\nthe latter. Others among these problems arise only in response to the\nparticular methods or posits employed by the version of logicism under\nconsideration. The following problems appear to have loomed large in\nthe foregoing discussion. ","contact.mail":"tennant.9@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
