Some believe moral thoughts are\nfundamentally sentimental, others that moral facts make essential\nreference to our sentimental responses, or that emotions are the\nprimary source of moral knowledge. Some believe all these things. The\ntwo main attractions of sentimentalism are making sense of the\npractical aspects of morality, on the one hand, and finding a place for\nmorality within a naturalistic worldview, on the other. The\ncorresponding challenges are accounting for the apparent objectivity\nand normativity of morality. Recent psychological theories emphasizing\nthe centrality of emotion in moral thinking have prompted renewed\ninterest in sentimentalist ethics.\n\n\n\nConsider the following story related by Frans de Waal in a recent\nbook: \n\nJ. lives in a small seaside town in France, where he is known as the\nhandyman he is. He can build an entire house with his own hands, as he\nis skilled in carpentry, plumbing, masonry, roof work, and so on. He\ndemonstrates this every day at his own home, and so people naturally\nask him for help. Being extremely nice, J. usually dispenses advice or\nlends a helping hand. One neighbor, whom he barely knew, kept asking\nabout how to put a skylight in his roof. J. lent him his ladder for the\njob, but since the man kept returning, he promised to come take a look\none day. \n\nJ. spent from morning until late evening with the neighbor,\nbasically doing the job on his own (as the neighbor could barely hold a\nhammer, he said), during which time the neighbor's wife came,\ncooked, and ate lunch (the main meal in France) with her husband\nwithout offering J. anything. By the end of the day, he had\nsuccessfully put the skylight in, having provided expert labor that\nnormally would have cost more than six hundred euros. J. asked for\nnothing, but when the same neighbor a few days later talked about a\nscuba diving course, and how it would be fun to do together, he felt\nthis opened a perfect occasion for a return gift, since the course cost\nabout 150 euros. So J. said he'd love to go, but unfortunately\ndidn't have the money in his budget. By now you can guess: The\nman went alone. (de Waal 2009: 174–175) \n\nAssuming the story is true and leaves nothing of importance out,\nwe're likely to have two kinds of response to it: we have a\nnegative feeling of some sort towards the neighbour, and we think that\nthe neighbour acted wrongly towards poor J. Roughly speaking,\nsentimentalists think that these two responses are intimately related,\nwith the feeling in the driving seat. (Since different theories in the\nsentimentalist family make use of different responses, this entry will\nadopt a liberal definition of a ‘sentiment’ that comprises\nnon-cognitive attitudes and states of all kinds—emotions,\nfeelings, affects, desires, besires, plans, and dispositions to have\nthem.) \n\nThere are many questions we could ask about this. One kind of\nquestion is explanatory: Why do we think that the neighbour did\nsomething wrong? Explanatory sentimentalists believe that\nmoral thoughts are fundamentally explained by sentiments or emotions.\nThe second kind of question is constitutive: What does our thought that\nthe neighbour did something wrong consist in? That is, what kind of\nthought is it? Is it more like believing that Pluto is a planet or like\nwanting to hit an uncooperative computer? Judgment\nsentimentalists believe that moral judgments are constituted by\nemotional or non-cognitive responses, at least in part, or\nalternatively are judgments about emotional responses or the\ntendency of something to give rise to them. Some judgment\nsentimentalists are also expressivists, who believe that the\nmeanings of moral terms must be accounted for in terms of associated\nnon-cognitive states. \n\nThird, assuming that we've got it right, what kind of fact if any\nmakes our thought about the neighbour's action true? Is the wrongness\nof the action a projection of our sentiments? If it is a fact, is it\nlike the fact that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the\nsquares of the other two sides of a right triangle, or like the fact\nthat water is H2O, or perhaps more like the fact that\nrotten food is disgusting? For metaphysical sentimentalists,\nmoral facts make reference to our sentimental responses. Finally,\nwe're pretty confident of our judgment. But even if we assume we know\nall the pertinent empirical facts, how do we know that what the\nneighbour did is wrong? What if someone disagrees? How can we justify\nour verdict?\nEpistemological sentimentalists believe that moral\njustification bottoms out in sentimental responses of a certain\nkind. \n\nThese sentimentalist views are logically independent of each other.\nOne indication of this is that they contrast with different views.\nEpistemological and possibly explanatory sentimentalist views contrast\nwith rationalist and intuitionist views, according\nwhich we can acquire moral knowledge by reasoning or intuition,\nrespectively. Judgment sentimentalist views, in turn, contrast with\nsome forms of cognitivism. Metaphysical sentimentalist views\ncontrast with error theory and mind-independent moral\nrealism in naturalist and non-naturalist variants. \n\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary philosophers to see sentimentalism\nas a theory of moral judgment or facts. But classical sentimentalists\nclearly considered the primary question to be a moral\npsychological one: What feature of human nature—reason,\nsentiment, or intuition—explains why we approve of something or\nblame someone? (See David Hume's Treatise of Human Nature\n(T), 456 and Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments\n(TMS), 312–313.) Since it is in this context of fundamentally\nexplaining our moral judgments that they introduced some of their main\narguments, it is good to start with these issues, even though they lie\non the borderline of philosophy and what is now the empirical science\nof psychology. \n\nThe roots of the modern sentimentalist tradition in ethics go back\nto early 18th century debates in Britain. Anthony Ashley\nCooper, better known by his title as the Earl of Shaftesbury,\nintroduced the notion of a moral sense in his Inquiry\nConcerning Virtue, or Merit. According to Shaftesbury,\nthe primary object of moral evaluation is the “affection”\nor motive behind the action. Such affections can, by reflection, become\nthe object of a second-order affection: \n\nIn a Creature capable of forming general Notions of Things, not only\nthe outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the Objects\nof the Affection; but the very Actions themselves, and the Affections\nof Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their Contrarys, being brought into\nthe Mind by Reflection, become Objects. So that, by means of this\nreflected Sense, there arises another kind of Affection towards those\nvery Affections themselves, which have been already felt, and are now\nbecome the Subject of a new Liking or Dislike. (Shaftesbury\n1699–1714: 16) \n\nMoral approval is explained by (and perhaps consists in) this sort\nof second-order liking, which Shaftesbury usually designates the\n‘Sense of Right or Wrong’. This sense is innate or natural,\nand can be displaced only by “contrary habit and custom”\n(1699–1714: 25), although it may on occasion be overcome by\n“rage, lust, or any other counterworking passion”\n(1699–1714: 35). On Shaftesbury's view, what it approves of\nare natural or public affections, which are the beautiful and\nharmonious motives tending towards the good of the whole system of\nrational creatures. There is also a place for subordinate\nself-interested motives, since society suffers if individuals fail to\npreserve or defend themselves. To be virtuous, a creature must not only\ndo the right things, but exercise its moral sense and act for the very\nreason that something is worthy and honest (1699–1714: 18).\nShaftesbury doesn't, however, give details of how the sense of\nright or wrong works, or how it can guide action. \n\nFrances Hutcheson fills in Shaftesbury's sketch to some\nextent. His argument for the existence of a moral sense draws on his\nrejection of rationalism and intuitionism (see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments).\n Since we don't approve of actions because of\nself-interest or self-evidence, something else must explain our\nconvictions. According to him, a sense is a\n“determination of the mind, to receive any idea from the presence\nof an object which occurs to us, independent on our will” (1725:\n90). There are many more such senses than traditionally acknowledged.\nSince moral ideas arise spontaneously, Hutcheson concludes we have a\nmoral sense, \na determination of our minds to receive amiable or\ndisagreeable ideas of Actions, when they occur to observation,\nantecedent to any opinions of advantage or loss to redound to ourselves\nfrom them. (1725: 100) \n The moral sense, though not moral ideas,\nis innate, as can be seen from the sentiments of small children (1725:\n145–146). \n\nOn Hutcheson's view, what the moral sense approves of is above\nall “the general calm desire of the happiness of others”,\nin distinction from particular benevolent passions like love and\ncompassion (1728: 175). On this picture, in contrast to Shaftesbury,\nthe motive of morally praiseworthy actions is benevolence and\nnot the thought that the action is obligatory or that it would\nbe approve of by the moral sense itself. In Hutcheson's\nterminology, moral sense is the source of justifying reasons, but not\nexciting reasons. \n\nSome key features of these early sentimentalist theories are shared\nby the psychologist Jonathan Haidt's (2012) contemporary model.\nHaidt's starting point is an increasingly common distinction in\npsychology between two kinds of cognitive process. What is known as\nSystem 1 or the Intuitive System comprises of automatic, effortless,\nfast, often associative, parallel, affective, and modular processes. We\nare only conscious of their outputs, not the processes themselves.\n(They are thus parallel to Hutcheson's ‘senses’.)\nSystem 2 or the Reasoning System comprises of conscious, effortful,\nslow, memory-taxing, sometimes inferential, rational, and linear\nprocesses. As is common in psychology, Haidt uses the term\n‘intuition’ for beliefs that result from the Intuitive\nSystem. \n\nHaidt's empirical claim is that moral judgments are for the\nmost part intuitions proximally caused by gut reactions, quick\nand automatic flashes of affect. In support of this, manipulating\naffect has been shown to make a difference to people's judgments\n(Wheatley and Haidt 2005), and areas of the brain associated with such\naffective responses found active when people make judgments (e.g.,\nGreene and Haidt 2002; Moll, de Oliveira-Souza, and Eslinger 2003).\nFurther, in some studies, people are easily dumbfounded when challenged\non their moral views: they cannot (Haidt claims) give reasons for why\nthey disapprove of harmless sibling incest, for example (Haidt 2001).\nOn Haidt's somewhat pessimistic picture, the role of reason is\nfor the most part lawyerly rationalization of the pre-existing gut\nreactions, in particular in a social context. \n\nWhere the early sentimentalists gesture towards divine providence\nwhen it comes to explaining why we have a moral sense and why it\napproves of things like benevolence, Haidt's story appeals to\nevolution. He believes we are pre-programmed to respond to suffering\nwith compassion, arrogance by subordinates with contempt, cheating with\nanger, and impurity with disgust, for example. These culturally\nfine-tuned affective responses are in turn distally explained by having\nbeen evolutionary “adaptations to long-standing threats and\nopportunities in social life” (Haidt 2012) of our ancestors. But\nhow can it be adaptive to risk the wrath of an aggressor in order to\ndefend a victim that one sympathizes with, for example? Haidt's\nexplanation appeals to the controversial notion of group selection, the\nidea that genes that program for individually fitness-decreasing\nbehavior can nevertheless be naturally selected for as a result of\nincreasing group fitness (Sober and Wilson 1998). \n\nIt's not clear whether group selection suffices to explain our\napproval of actions that benefit outgroup members, however. Further, as\ndiscussed below, contemporary sentimentalists who follow Hume rather\nthan Hutcheson argue that there is no need to assume that moral\nreactions are innate, and some reason to assume they are not (even if\nour innate dispositions do play a role in explaining them). A related\nchallenge to Haidt's account is that he does not distinguish\nbetween moral and non-moral evaluations. When talking about intuitions\nin his sense, he says that \nthe brain has a kind of gauge\n(sometimes called a “like-ometer”) that is constantly\nmoving back and forth, and these movements, these quick judgments,\ninfluence whatever comes next. (Haidt and Björklund 2008:\n186–187)  \nBut we don't regard everything we dislike, or\neven everything that makes us angry, as morally wrong. The story is at\nleast incomplete. (For more discussion, see the entry on\n Morality and Evolutionary Biology.) \n\nFurther, as a psychologist, Haidt offers no a priori\narguments against the possibility of reason yielding moral verdicts.\nAll he can claim is that people don't usually engage in reasoning\nfirst. Even if that is true, it doesn't follow that\npeople's judgments are not shaped by reasoning (perhaps someone\nelse's reasoning, in the case of culturally shaped dispositions)\nor that they are insensitive to reasons. Indeed, Daniel Jacobson (2012)\npoints out that the evidence that people lack reasons for their\njudgments is in fact very thin. In Haidt's dumbfounding studies,\nsaying that an act is unnatural, for example, doesn't count as\ngiving a reason for one's judgment. But (rightly or wrongly),\nthat's the sort of thing that many people take as reason for\ncondemning certain kinds of action. Moreover, as Jacobson notes, there\nare also harm-based reasons to regard Haidt's harmless incest as\nwrong—after all, even if no problems actually result from\nhaving sex with your sister or brother, you take an enormous\nrisk of emotional repercussions. The vibe at your\nsister's wedding three years later might not be quite the same.\nPeople might not be able to immediately articulate such reasons, but\nthat doesn't show they don't have them. Rather than being\nmere rationalization, post hoc reasoning might be a process of trying\nto articulate the considerations one's intuitive judgments were\nresponsive to. This is relevant to the epistemic status of judgments\nbased on emotion (see Section 5.3). \n\nWhat is distinctive of Hume and Smith is that although they\noccasionally use the term ‘moral sense’, they do not take\nit to be a primitive, innate capacity, but rather aim to explain its\nworkings in terms of more basic mechanisms, in particular what they\ncall ‘sympathy’. In contemporary use, the term is often\nused for a kind of concern for another. But Hume and Smith, in\ndifferent ways, used it for sharing what another feels. The\ncontemporary term for this kind of mechanism is empathy (for\nthe distinction between sympathy and empathy, see Darwall 1998; Sober\nand Wilson 1998). This section will nevertheless use the older term,\nsince what the classical sentimentalists talk about isn't quite\n‘empathy’ either, insofar as empathy involves taking on the\nactual feeling of another. \n\nFollowing Hutcheson, Hume rejects reason or reasoning as the source\nof moral distinctions (understood either as judgments or facts). His\nmotivation sceptical arguments are based on what he believes\nis reason's inability to move us in the way that morality does.\nContent sceptical arguments, in turn, aim to demonstrate that\nrecognizably moral conclusions cannot be reached by reason alone,\nwithout sentiment-supported premises. These arguments are crucial for\nthe case for sentimentalism. Contemporary sentimentalists have\ndeveloped new versions of both arguments against Kantian counters. For\na more thorough discussion, see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments. \n\nOn Hume's positive account, moral approval is caused if not\nconstituted by pleasure of a special kind: \nTo have the sense of\nvirtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of particular\nkind from the contemplation of a character. (T 471) \n (Sometimes\nhe says that approval consists of a form of love towards an agent on\naccount of such pleasure.) What kind of pleasure? Hume's\ncriterion is aetiological: \n 'Tis only when a character is\nconsidered in general, without reference to our particular interest,\nthat it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally\ngood or evil. (T 472) \n But why does contemplation of a character\nwithout reference to our own interest give us pleasure in the first\nplace? Not because we're simply equipped with a moral sense, but\nbecause of the operation of sympathy, which, according to Hume, offers\na more parsimonious and systematic explanation of the phenomena. \n\nHow does sympathy work? For Hume, the mechanism is a kind of\nanalogical association: \nWhen I see the effects of\npassion in the voice and gesture of any person, my mind immediately\npasses from these effects to their causes, and forms such a lively idea\nof the passion, as is presently converted into the passion\nitself. (T 576) \n Similar association operates on the causes of a\npassion. It is by this mechanism that the pleasures and pains of others\nare communicated for us, so that we are ourselves pleased in a special\nway when contemplating those durable character traits that reliably\nbenefit and hence please others. This special kind of pleasure\n‘denominates’ the trait as virtuous or vicious. (Hume\ndistinguishes between ‘natural’ and\n‘artificial’ virtues, the latter including justice and\nallegiance, which are human inventions that have beneficial\nconsequences on the whole, and approved of because of that.) Here is\nhow Hume summarizes the view: \n\nWhen any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of\nmankind, we are pleased with it, and approve of it; because it presents\nthe lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is\nitself a kind of pleasure. (T 580) \n\nThis simple account needs refinement, however. Hume observes two\nways in which our moral approval diverges from what causes sympathetic\npleasure. First, what comes naturally to us is taking on the feelings\nof the near and the dear, those who are close to or similar to us and\nthose we care about. Yet we regard a historical character renowned for\nbeing just with equal moral approval as someone with the same trait\nliving today in our own town, for example. Second, we sometimes approve\nof “virtue in rags”: an honest and generous person who due\nto no fault of her own is incapacitated and in no position to benefit\nothers is not considered morally worse than someone with the same\ntraits who actually does cause pleasure for us to sympathize with.\nHume's answer to these challenges is that we correct our\ninitial responses for bias and the influence of moral luck, as well as\nour present disposition—not because we aim for some standard\nthat is independent of our responses, but because of the practical\nproblems that result from relying on “momentary\nappearances” (T 582). \n\nWhen we judge others on the basis of self-interest or uncorrected\nsympathy with the near and the dear, the result is “many\ncontradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation” (T\n583). When it comes to feelings of personal liking or taste, it is no\nproblem if different people call different people or things\n“enemy” or “delicious”. But when someone uses\nmoral language and calls someone “vicious”,\n“odious”, or “depraved”, she “expresses\nsentiments, in which, he expects, all his audience are to concur with\nhim” (Hume 1751: 260). It is this expectation of concurrence\ncharacteristic of moral sentiments that pushes us towards a\n“common point of view” (ibid.) in moral judging. \n\nHume's suggestion is that such a point of view is achieved by\nsetting aside our own interests, current disposition, and relation to\nthe agent or those affected by her, and varying position, and\nsympathizing with the effects of a person's actions on those\naround him: \nThe only point of view, in which our sentiments\nconcur with those of others, is, when we consider the tendency of any\npassion to the advantage or harm of those, who have any immediate\nconnexion or intercourse with the person possess'd of it.\n(T 602–3)  \n(More precisely, to avoid the virtue in rags problem, we\nlook to the fitness of people's character traits for producing\nsuch effects.) Hume remarks that this sort of correction for\nvariability and distance is common to all the senses. As Geoffrey\nSayre-McCord (1994) has argued, such a perspective is not one of an\nomniscient ideal observer, but rather a point of view we all could\nrealistically occupy. Otherwise it couldn't be appealed to in an\nexplanation of how we actually come to approve of certain things. \n\nAdam Smith presents a different theory about the nature and\nmechanisms of sympathy and consequently moral and evaluative approval.\nFor Smith, the key mechanism of sympathy is imaginatively placing\noneself in another's position, or what would now be called\nsimulation (Gordon 1995), rather than mere emotional\ncontagion, association, or inference. In Smith's official\ndefinition (from which he sometimes departs), sympathy consists in a\nmatch between what one takes the other to actually feel and what one\nfeels oneself as a result of putting oneself in the other's\nshoes. Approbation is the pleasant feeling that results from perceiving\nthis coincidence (TMS 56 note a). Although this account of ‘sense\nof propriety’ is sometimes described as Smith's theory of\nmoral judgment, he regards it as a perfectly general account of\nevaluation, encompassing belief, sense of humour, or business\ndecisions. When it comes to judgments of moral merit or demerit, or the\nqualities of deserving praise or blame, what counts is our sympathy\nwith the gratitude and resentment of those affected\nby the action, on the one hand, and with the agent's motives, on\nthe other. Like Hume, Smith recognizes that moral approval requires\ndeparting from one's personal point of view: \n\nBut [resentment and gratitude], as well as all the other passions of\nhuman nature, seem proper and are approved of, when the heart of every\nimpartial spectator entirely sympathizes with them, when every\nindifferent by-stander entirely enters into, and goes along with them.\n(TMS 81) \n\nThe figure of an impartial spectator also plays a key role in\nSmith's account of self-directed moral judgment or conscience.\nSmith argues that reflection on our own motives requires that we\ndistance ourselves from our agential standpoint and \n endeavour to view them … with the eyes of other people, or as other people\nare likely to view them. (TMS 128) \n Our original motive for doing\nso is our desire for the approval of those we care about. But\nexperience teaches us we can't please every actual spectator, so \nwe soon learn to set up in our own minds a judge between\nourselves and those we live with. (TMS 152n)  \nWe then judge\nourselves and potentially guide our action by the imagined responses of\nan impartial and well-informed spectator. \n\nMichael Slote's recent sentimentalist account picks up the\nthread of empathy/sympathy-based theories. Slote's claim is that\nmoral approval is constituted and explained by empathizing with an\nagent's motives: \n\n[I]f agents' actions reflect empathic concern for (the well\nbeing or wishes of) others, empathic beings will feel warmly or\ntenderly toward them, and such warmth and tenderness empathically\nreflect the empathic warmth or tenderness of the agents. …\n[S]uch empathy with empathy … also constitutes moral approval,\nand possibly admiration as well, for agents and/or their actions.\n(Slote 2010: 34–35) \n\nSome people's actions exhibit empathy toward others. This\nempathy is a warm feeling. When we empathize with the agent, we come to\nshare this warm feeling. And this empathetic warm feeling constitutes\nmoral approval. In contrast, unempathetic actions manifest a coldness\ntowards others. Since moral approval and disapproval “enter into\nthe making of moral judgments”, Slote believes empathy can\nexplain our intuitions and judgments. More precisely, \ndifferences in (the strength of) our empathic reactions (or\ntendencies to react) to various situations correspond pretty well to\ndifferences in the (normative) moral evaluations we tend to make about\nthose situations. (Slote 2010: 21) \n For example, we naturally\nflinch more strongly from causing harm to someone than from allowing\nthe same harm to happen. This, for Slote, basically accounts for the\ncommonsense deontological distinction between the seriousness of the\nwrong of doing harm rather than allowing it to happen. \n\nSlote's account has been criticized from within the\nsentimentalist camp. Jesse Prinz (2011) notes that the view has\ndifficulty with disapproval: failure to empathize is not the same thing\nas disapprobation, nor does it have the same kind of motivational\neffect. Julia Driver (2011) points out that people such as autists, who\nare (according to some views) incapable of empathy can nevertheless\nmorally approve or disapprove of things. Slote's view also faces\nchallenges of both necessity and sufficiency, in that it seems possible\nthat we approve of un-empathetic actions (such as doing something out\nof a sense of duty, or doing the right thing for the wrong reason), and\nthat there are empathetic actions we don't approve of (such as\nempathy-motivated helping of one victim at the expense of many others\nwho are less close or similar to the agent). Nor do all agents we\ndisapprove of lack empathy. As Justin D'Arms (2011) observes, a\nstern father may disapprove of a teenage daughter's love affair\nwithout there being any coldness in her for him to catch. \n\nEven if these criticisms of Slote are justified, empathetic feelings\nmay enter into the explanation of moral judgment more indirectly. Shaun\nNichols (2004) shares the Humean ambition of explaining moral thought\nwithout assuming an innate moral capacity or sense. Instead, Nichols\nassumes that normal people have a generic capacity to be guided by\nnorms or rules of various kinds, and certain non-moral emotional\ndispositions, such as the disposition to have an aversive response to\nsuffering in others. These simple features help explain various\nfeatures of moral thought, Nichols believes. One explanandum is the\ndistinction that people, including very young children, make between\nviolations of authority-independent and universally applicable moral\nrules and authority-dependent and local conventional rules. \n\nNichols's hypothesis is that people regard a rule-violation as\nauthority-independently wrong when the rule in question is\naffect-backed, that is, when it prohibits actions that we\nindependently have a negative emotional reaction towards (Nichols 2004:\n62). One important source of support for this claim is that people who\nlack the relevant affective response, such as psychopaths, appear to\nfail at distinguishing between the two kinds of rules, even though\ntheir rational capacities are intact. Moral judgments, nevertheless,\nare applications of rules, and do not require the presence of on-line\naffect. This view was anticipated by some earlier sentimentalists. Adam\nSmith noted that we make the “greater part of” our moral\njudgments on the basis of general rules, which are for him based on\ninduction from emotional responses to particular cases (TMS 377), and\nEdward Westermarck held that many judgments are “applications of\nsome accepted general rule”, whose acceptance is ultimately\nexplained by the existence of an “emotional sanction” in\nthe judge's mind (Westermarck 1906: 6). \n\nNichols believes that his sentimental rules account also offers an\nexplanation of universality of certain norms. We do not have to assume\nthat people have an innate tendency to regard causing harm to innocents\nas morally wrong. Instead, it is plausible that of the various norms\nthat different societies have come up with, those that resonate with\nour non-moral emotional dispositions enjoy a higher ‘cultural\nfitness’ (Nichols 2004: 127) and thus become more prevalent over\ntime. Since we can account for (nearly) pan-cultural moral rules as\nwell as moral judgment without appeal to dedicated innate mechanisms,\nNichols (2005) concludes that morality is an evolutionary by-product\nrather than an adaptation. \n\nSentimentalism is commonly understood as a thesis about moral\njudgments or concepts. Moral thought involves or\nrefers to our sentiments. It turns out that this can mean a number of\ndifferent things. Also, moral language somehow or other\nexpresses or refers to sentiments. \n\nOn non-cognitivist views, moral thoughts are constituted by\nsentiments. To think that X is wrong is, at least in part, to have a\nnegative sentiment towards X, or perhaps to have a higher-order\npositive attitude towards a negative sentiment towards X. Here is the\nmost famous argument in favour of non-cognitivism: \n\nThe Argument from Internalism \n\nThe argument is clearly related to arguments from practicality\nagainst rationalism (see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement),\n but\nthe second premise and the conclusion are about moral judgments\nthemselves rather than about the processes that result in moral\njudgment. The first premise postulates an internal connection between\n(first-personal, present-directed) moral judgment and motivation. This\nis now generally treated as a conceptual question about our\ncommon concept of moral judgment. Weak Internalists believe, roughly,\nthat judging that I morally ought to stop downloading movies entails\nthat I have some motivation to stop downloading movies. Otherwise I\ndon't genuinely regard the action as morally wrong, although I\nmay pay lip service to it. My moral convictions are manifest in my\nmotivational tendencies, if not always in action. \n\nWeak (unlike Strong) Internalists don't deny that the link\nbetween judgment and action is fallible: we suffer from weakness of the\nwill or buckle under social pressure. But they insist that there is an\nessential link between judgment and motivation, even if it is sometimes\nindirect. The point of thinking in moral terms in the first place\nisn't to discover some facts about the universe, but to get\nourselves to act in ways that allow us to live together and reap the\nbenefits of cooperation. Simon Blackburn (1988) and Allan Gibbard\n(1990) point out that any evolutionary benefits moral thought might\nhave depend on its practicality. Community-Wide Internalists says that\neven if it is conceivable that there are individuals who are\nentirely indifferent to their moral judgments, internalists claim that\nno member of a community could be credited with a genuine\nmoral stance, if no one in the community was motivated by their\njudgments (Lenman 1999; Tresan 2009). Weak Internalists are committed\nto the impossibility of there being amoralists (Brink 1986;\nSvavarsdottir 1999), agents who make genuine first-personal moral\njudgments while never having any corresponding motivation, while\nCommunity-Wide Internalists only deny the possibility of amoralist\ncommunities. (For a more thorough discussion, see the entry on \n Moral Motivation.) \n\nThe second premise of the argument is a thesis in the philosophy of\nmind. It says that mental states with propositional content divide into\ntwo fundamentally different kinds that play a differential role in\nguiding action. Some mental states represent how things are. Beliefs\nare the paradigmatic case. They provide a partial map of the world.\nSomething has gone wrong if the content of the belief does not match\nhow things are. This idea of a mind-to-world direction of fit\nof a belief that p is cashed out by Michael Smith as the\ntendency to go out of existence when perceiving that not-p\n(Smith 1987). If you believe that you car is working well but it\nrefuses to start when you try, you tend to stop believing it works\nwell, other things being equal. Other mental states are not\nrepresentational, though they may have the same propositional content\nas beliefs. If you want your car to work well and notice that it\nrefuses to start, your desire does not tend to go out of existence.\nRather, it moves you to do something you believe would make the car\nwork, such as call a mechanic. It has a world-to-mind direction of\nfit. Although particular ways of drawing the distinction remain\ncontroversial, the key idea that representational beliefs themselves\nare motivationally inert is widely accepted. \n\nFinally, the conclusion comes in different strengths. Traditional\nnon-cognitivists believe that moral judgments simply are non-cognitive\nstates (For the ‘at least in part’ proviso, see the\ndiscussion of hybrid views in Section 3.5). But what kind of states?\nThey are clearly not mere desires, since we can desire things we\ndon't regard as desirable. Early non-cognitivists talked about a\nspecial ‘ethical feeling’ (Ayer 1936), identified in\nphenomenological terms. But there doesn't seem to be any\ncommon phenomenological character to all the various moral thoughts we\nhave. So contemporary non-cognitivists appeal to the functional\nrole of moral attitudes instead, to their distinctive part in our\noverall psychology. Blackburn's (1998) idea is that moral\nthoughts involve higher-order attitudes towards desires and\npreferences. When I morally disapprove of polluting the environment, I\ndon't just desire not to pollute, but I also applaud others who\nare averse to it and dislike those who fail to share my desire.\nHere's how Blackburn describes this sort of emotional ascent: \n\n[A]t the bottom we start with pure preferences. Rising up we come to\npreferences that we prefer others to share. Rising further we come to\npreferences that we ‘demand’ of others; that is, if they do\nnot share them we find ourselves averse or in opposition to them. Here,\naccording to me, we begin to enter the territory of ethics. (Blackburn\n2002: 125) \n\nWhen I morally disapprove of something, I also have these\nhigher-order attitudes towards my own attitudes: I prefer not to desire\nwhat I disapprove of. This doesn't guarantee that I will always\nhave the first-order desires, so the link between judgment and\nmotivation is defeasible. \n\nGibbard (1990), in turn, identifies narrowly moral judgments with\njudgments about the rationality of guilt and resentment. To think that\nstealing is wrong, for example, is to think it rational to feel guilt\nfor stealing and resent others for stealing (in the absence of\nconditions like ignorance or force that excuse the agent). To think\nthat something is rational or makes sense, in turn, is to accept norms\nthat permit it. On Gibbard's original account, norm-acceptance is\na basic kind of non-cognitive state, an evolutionary adaptation for\nlinguistically achieved coordination that is not analyzable in terms of\nother attitudes (1990: ch. 4). It is non-cognitive, because it is\nessentially a motivational tendency to act or feel in ways that we are\nprepared to avow in discussion about what to do. In later work, he\nconsiders normative thoughts as contingency plans that settle\nwhat to do in actual and non-actual situations (Gibbard 2003). These\nthoughts are defeasibly motivating, just as the Argument from\nInternalism requires. \n\nThe above argument concerns moral judgment as a psychological state,\na kind of thought. But the term ‘judgment’ is sometimes\nalso used for linguistic utterance or sentence containing moral terms.\nLikewise, the term ‘non-cognitivism’ is also used for a\nthesis about moral language. To minimize confusion, this entry will\ntalk about moral terms and sentences when it comes to linguistic\nentities, and reserve the term ‘expressivism’ for the\nlinguistic thesis. Bearing these terminological stipulations in mind,\nany argument for non-cognitivism can be extended to an argument for\nexpressivism with the addition of some deceptively simple premises: \n\nPremise 4 is the key addition. It is not the only way to arrive at a\nbroadly expressivist theory in ethics—earlier forms, such as\nemotivism (Ayer 1936; Stevenson 1944) and universal prescriptivism\n(Hare 1952, 1963) relied on the problematic assumption that the meaning\nof a sentence is to be understood on the basis of the effects it is\nused to achieve or the speech act it is used to perform. Metasemantic\nPsychologism doesn't make this assumption, but simply derives the\nmeaning of linguistic expressions from the thoughts that they express,\nrather than their truth-conditions or the possible worlds they rule\nout, as standard semantics does. As Allan Gibbard puts it, \nA\nnormative sentence, the expressivist says, expresses a state of mind;\nits meaning is explained not by giving its truth conditions but by\ntelling what state of mind it expresses. (1990: 92) \n\nIt is essential to understanding expressivism that\nexpressing a thought is not the same thing as\nreporting a thought. Consider the following pair of non-moral\nsentences, as uttered by me: \nThe sun is shining. \n\nI believe that the sun is shining.  \nThe first expresses the belief that the sun is shining. It\ndoesn't say anything about me, but rather something about the\nweather. The second sentence, in contrast, reports my belief. It is\nabout my psychology, not about the weather. It is perfectly possible\nthat the second sentence is true while the first is false (maybe\nI'm fooled by a very bright lamp outside my window), so they\nclearly do not mean the same. Mark Schroeder (2010a) has recently\nemphasized that the core expressivist claim is that the sentence\n“Murder is wrong” is related to disapproval of murder in\njust the same way as the sentence “The sun is shining” is\nrelated to the belief that the sun is shining, whatever that is. The\nonly difference is that the expressed state is\nnon-representational. \n\nThis has significant semantic consequences, to be sure. Since\nnon-representational states lack truth-conditions, expressivists cannot\nexplain the inferential relations among them in the usual way.\nThey'll have to account for the incompatibility of “Kissing\ncousins is wrong” and “Kissing cousins is not wrong”,\nfor example, in terms of disagreement in attitude (Stevenson 1937) or\nin plan (Gibbard 2003). Attempts to do so have proven controversial, to\nsay the least. For discussion, see the entry on\n Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism. \n\nAlthough it is definitive of expressivism that the meanings of moral\nsentences are explained without appealing to their truth-conditions, it\nis important to note that contemporary expressivists do not deny that\nit makes sense to talk about moral truth or even moral facts. This is\nan important part of their programme of capturing the ‘realist\nsurface’ of ordinary moral talk. Blackburn emphatically endorses\na minimalist or deflationist theory of truth and facts, according to\nwhich the truth predicate is only a handy device for endorsing\npropositions without necessarily mentioning them, as when we say\n“Everything the Pope says is true”. As Blackburn puts\nit:  To say that an ethical view is true is just to reaffirm it, and so\nit is if we add the weighty words ‘really’,\n‘true’, ‘fact’, and so on.  To say that it is\nobjectively true is to affirm that its truth does not vary with what\nwe happen to think about it, and once more this is an internal,\nfirst-order ethical position. (Blackburn 1998: 296) \n\nGiven minimalism, many questions that might at first sight seem\nmetaethical, second-order questions about ethics turn out to\nbe first-order questions within ethics. Is it an objective\nfact that it is wrong to force a woman to wear a veil outside her home?\nAs the expressivist hears this question, it is about how we should\nrespond to forcing women to wear a veil—perhaps more\nspecifically, whether it is acceptable for someone to force a woman to\nwear a veil if he happens to believe it is morally or religiously\nrequired. That is a first-order ethical question about whether our\nreactions to this kind of behaviour should hang on the agents'\nown opinions concerning it. In answering it, we thus deploy our\nfirst-order ethical opinions, possibly rethinking them in the light of\nrecognizing that others hold opposing views. \n\nIf we answer that forcing women to wear a veil is\nobjectively wrong, we are against it regardless of what the agents\nthemselves think of it. Indeed, since we are against it in this way, we\nregard a potential change in our own opinion in favour of\nforcing women to wear a veil as a change for the worse, and are\ndisposed to resist it. This is what it is, for an expressivist, to\nregard a moral claim as true independently of anyone's opinion of\nit. Expressivism is thus consistent with objectivist first-order views\nand is not committed to the idea that were we to come to feel\ndifferently about ethical issues, ethical facts themselves would\nchange. \n\nThe extent to which expressivism can accommodate moral truth, facts,\nand objectivity has created no small amount of unclarity about what the\nreal difference between expressivist and non-expressivist views really\nis (see Dreier 2004). To make things even more confusing, contemporary\nexpressivists also condone talk of moral beliefs, as long as they are\nunderstood as whatever states sentences express, representational or\nnon-representational. Perhaps the key difference is simply that\nexpressivists are committed to the priority of non-representational\nattitudes in metasemantic explanation. For a more detailed discussion,\nsee again the entry on\n Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism. \n\nSentimentalists need not think that moral judgments just are\nsentiments or attitudes of some sort. They might also be\nbeliefs about sentiments or the disposition to cause\nsentiments. The related semantic view is that moral sentences are about\nthe speaker's (or someone else's) sentiments or\ndispositions to cause sentiments. Although it is surprisingly unusual\nto do so, it is important to distinguish these views about judgments,\nconcepts, and language from similar-sounding views about properties and\nfacts, since the arguments for and against differ. This section will\nfocus solely on the first kind of issue. \n\nThe simplest semantic account along these lines is Speaker\nSubjectivism, according to which the truth condition of an\nutterance of “Stealing is wrong” is that the speaker\ndisapproves of stealing. This disapproval need not consist simply in a\nnegative sentiment towards stealing, but may also be thought of, in a\nGibbard-like fashion, as endorsement of a moral standard or norm that\nprohibits stealing. In other words, the speaker reports the\nsame attitude that expressivists say the sentence expresses.\nThis view is suggested by some things that Hume says, in particular the\nfollowing: \n\n[W]hen you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean\nnothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a\nfeeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. (T 469) \n\nFor speaker subjectivism, there is a non-cognitive element to moral\njudgment, but moral sentences can nevertheless be given standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Its attraction is thus making sense of\njudgment internalism without the need for non-standard semantics. A\ngeneralized version of Speaker Subjectivism is Metaethical\nContextualism, according to which the content of a moral sentence\nof the form “A ought to f” is a proposition to the effect\nthat A ought to f relative to standards S, where S is determined by the\ncontext of utterance (Dreier 1990; Björnsson and Finlay 2010). For\ncontextualists, the standard need not be one that is endorsed by the\nspeaker (although it often is). \n\nThe standard objection to subjectivism and contextualism is the\nMissing Disagreement Problem. Suppose that Ann says “Eating\npeople is wrong” and Beth, a committed cannibal, replies\n“No, eating people is not wrong.” According to simple\nspeaker subjectivism, what Ann said is true if and only if Ann\ndisapproves of eating people, and what Beth said is true if and only if\nBeth doesn't disapprove of eating people. It can obviously be\nsimultaneously true that Ann disapproves of eating people and Beth\ndoesn't, so their utterances don't contradict each other.\nIndeed, since what Ann says is true on this picture, it looks like it\nshould be possible for Beth to say “What Ann says is true, but\neating people is not wrong”. So it seems they don't\ndisagree any more than if Ann had said “My name begins with an\nA” and Beth had said “No, my name begins with a B”.\nYet they do, so Speaker Subjectivism has a problem. \n\nContemporary subjectivists and contextualists are well aware of this\nproblem, and offer various suggestions to solve it. Gilbert\nHarman's response appeals to pragmatics. When we say that\nsomething is wrong, we presuppose that the hearer shares our\nmoral standards (Harman 2000: 36). Our conversation is about what the\ncontent of the standard we endorse is, or what it entails about a\nparticular case. These are issues about which we can genuinely\ndisagree. If, however, it turns out the hearer doesn't share the\nstandard, the conversation is defective, and the speaker and\nhearer are indeed talking past each other. According to Harman, the\nspeaker should then withdraw or explicitly relativize the assertion, or\nbe guilty of linguistic impropriety (ibid.). This is debatable at best,\nhowever. \n\nIn any case, this pragmatic strategy appears to unduly restrict the\nscope of possible disagreement, since it is possible to disagree with\npeople who are not part of the conversation. Gunnar Björnsson and\nStephen Finlay (2010) offer an alternative pragmatic proposal,\naccording to which expressions of disagreement do not target the\nproposition that the original utterance actually expressed (which may\nbe true relative to the speaker's standards) but rather a\ndifferent but suitably related proposition that is relevant to\nconversational purposes, such as persuading another or deciding what to\ndo. If Beth says to Ann “That's not true”, she may be\ntalking about the proposition that eating people is\nwrong-relative-to-Beth's-standards rather than what Ann strictly\nspeaking said. This suggestion is related to the third kind of\nsubjectivist response, which is retreat to the same notion that\nexpressivists use: the disagreement does not consist in contradictory\nbeliefs, but disagreement in attitude. Assume, for simplicity, that\ndisapproval involves desire to have the agent punished, and approval a\ndesire not to have the agent punished. Then even if Ann's and\nBeth's utterances don't contradict one another, they\ndisagree in the sense that it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy\nthe desires entailed by their sincere utterances when they issue a\nverdict on cannibalism. If Ann gets her way, Beth doesn't, and\nvice versa. \n\nAnother issue for Speaker Subjectivism is that the subject matter of\nthe moral thought is not distinctively evaluative: if Ellen is a\nPresbyterian and thinks that stealing is wrong, the content of\nEllen's thought might be just that stealing is such as to arouse\ndisapproval in Presbyterians. Someone else could have a thought with\nthe same content without thereby making a moral evaluation of stealing\n(Egan 2012: 566). The evaluative aspect is external to the belief, and\nconsists rather in something like identifying as a Presbyterian, which\ninvolves a desire-like attitude towards avoiding things that\ndon't fit the Presbyterian moral code. Consequently, there is no\ncommitment to a distinct kind of evaluative fact. It is not clear\nwhether this is a problem or an advantage for the theory—according to Jamie Dreier (2009), it is the latter. \n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views evade problems with Speaker\nSubjectivism with two moves. The first is idealization: the beliefs and\nsentences refer not to the speaker's views, but to those of a\nsuitably idealized subject (perhaps an idealized version of\nthe speaker). At the level of logical form, ought claims may have a\ntacit argument place for a standard, just as for contextualists—but the standard is context-invariant. The second is\ndispositionalization: the reference is not to anyone's actual\nsentiments, but to sentiments they would have in suitable\ncircumstances. Suggestions of this type of view can be found in Hume\nand Smith—recall their talk of correcting our\nsentiments by reference to the common point of view or the impartial\nspectator's response. Here is a recognizably Smithian formulation\nof this kind of view: \n\nTo judge that X is wrong is to believe that any informed impartial\nspectator would disapprove of X. \n\nRoderick Firth's (1952) Ideal Observer Theory is a\nmore contemporary variant of this kind of view. He formulates it as an\nanalysis of the meaning of ethical statements, but it can also be taken\nas an account of the corresponding thoughts. In general form, it is as\nfollows: \n\nTo judge that X has a moral property is to believe that any ideal\nobserver would have an ethically significant reaction to X in\nconditions ideal for doing so. \n\nBy an ‘ethically significant reaction’ Firth means \nthe kind of moral experience which we take to be evidence, under\nideal conditions, for the truth of our ethical judgments. (Firth\n1952: 326)  \nHe leaves it open whether the reaction is sentimental, so\nthere are possible variants of Ideal Observer Theory that are not\nsentimentalist. In specifying the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver, Firth uses a ‘pragmatic methodology’ of \nexamining the procedures which we actually regard, implicitly or\nexplicitly, as the rational ones for deciding ethical questions.\n(ibid. 332)  \nIf we actually disqualify someone's ethical\nverdicts because she is ignorant of non-moral facts, failure to vividly\nimagine what something would actually be like, partiality, non-moral\nemotions, and inconsistency, this shows that we implicitly regard moral\njudgements as valid only when made by an omniscient, omnipercipient,\nimpartial, dispassionate, consistent, but otherwise normal judge\n(ibid. 333–345). These are then the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver. \n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views avoid the Missing Disagreement Problem.\nFor example, if Ann believes that any informed impartial spectator\nwould disapprove of X and Beth believes it's not the case that\nany informed impartial spectator would not disapprove of X,\ntheir beliefs contradict each other and they straightforwardly\ndisagree.  However, this victory for idealized views is achieved by\ndetachment from people's own actual attitudes, which leads to the\nMissing Motivation Problem. The attraction that simple subjectivism,\ncontextualism, and non-cognitivism share is that if moral thoughts\nconsist in attitudes or beliefs about standards one endorses, their\nputative non-contingent connection to motivation is unproblematic. But\nhow could beliefs about dispositions to cause sentimental\nresponses in ideal subjects non-contingently motivate ordinary\nthinkers, given the Humean Theory of Motivation (Mackie 1980: 69)?\nSome might have the desire to do what an impartial spectator would\napprove of, but what about those who don't? As Richard Joyce (2013)\nhas put it, it appears that one may be just as unmoved by such\nthoughts as by the belief that drunken Vikings would mock the\nperformance of an action, and quite rationally so. \n\nA well-known response to a version of the Missing Motivation Problem\nis developed by Michael Smith (1994: 1997). Smith begins with the\ninitially appealing view that to think that something is desirable is\nnot just to desire it, but to believe that one would desire\nit, were one fully rational, where to be fully rational is to have no\nfalse beliefs, to have all the relevant true beliefs, and to have a\ncoherent and unified set of desires. Given that becoming fully rational\nmight itself change what's desirable for me, Smith prefers an\nIdeal Advisor model, according to which thinking that A-ing is\ndesirable for me is to think that a fully rational version of me would\nwant me to desire to A. Smith's claim is that attributing this\ncontent to people's normative beliefs makes best sense of their\n“inferential and quasi-inferential potentials” (1997: 103),\nalthough few are capable of articulating it. \n\nGiven this content for desirability beliefs, Smith poses the\nquestion: would S be more coherent, were she to believe that her fully\nrational counterpart would desire her to A and desire to A, or\nwere she to have have the same belief without the desire\n(Smith 1994)? Smith claims that the former belief-desire pair makes for\na more coherent psychology, other things being equal. Since rationality\nrequires coherence, rationality thus requires people's desires to\nline up with their desirability beliefs. So rational agents\nare motivated by their beliefs about their Ideal Advisors'\ndesires, and motivation is thus non-contingently linked with normative\njudgments. This view allows for the conceptual possibility of\namoralists, as long as they are\nirrational.         \n\nSmith's argument is about desirability or normative reason\nthoughts, not about moral judgments. But he proposes to bridge the gap\nby arguing that first, the desires of fully rational agents converge\nregardless of their starting points (Smith 1994), and second, that\namong these convergent desires are desires for the sort of things that\ncommonsense morality requires (Smith 2012). Both of these claims are\ncontroversial, and together make Smith a rationalist rather than\nsentimentalist ideal observer theorist. But there may be room for a\nsentimentalist theory to appropriate something like his model without\nits rationalist elements. That is, it might be a requirement of\nrationality that we are motivated to do what we believe an informed\nimpartial spectator would not resent us for, for example. For Adam\nSmith, the voice of an imagined impartial spectator is the voice of\nconscience, the part within us that stands in judgment of\nourselves. It is the “peculiar office” or function of\nconscience to “bestow censure or applause upon all the other\nprinciples of our nature” (TMS 191). So Adam Smith might argue\nthat an agent who believes that any impartial spectator would desire\nher to do A and fails to desire to A is less coherent (and thus less\nrational, other things being equal) than one who combines the belief\nwith a desire to A. What is decisive is that our beliefs about an ideal\nspectator's attitudes define where we ourselves stand, unlike our\nbeliefs about drunk Vikings, for example. \n\nThe cognitivist sentimentalist views discussed in the previous\nsection appealed to beliefs about dispositions to cause\nsentimental responses in certain kind of subjects. The other main type\nof cognitivist view, sensibility theory, regards judgments as\nbeliefs about merited responses (Wiggins 1987; McDowell 1998).\nSensibility theory begins with an analogy with secondary quality\nconcepts, such as colour concepts. These concepts, according to many,\nare concepts of mind-dependent qualities whose existence isn't\nindependent of human sensibility. On this view, to experience something\nas red, say, is experience it as being such as to look red to normal\nhuman beings in suitable conditions. \n\nThis is, to be sure, a controversial view, as many think that colour\nexperience presents its object as having a simple, non-dispositional\nproperty. Nevertheless, sensibility theorists believe it offers a\npartial analogy with moral experience, the difference being that value\nis \nconceived to be not merely such as to elicit the appropriate\n‘attitude’ … but rather such as to merit\nit. (McDowell 1985: 143)  \nWhen we conceive of value in this way,\nwe perceive there to be a reason for, say, admiring or\nemulating someone (McDowell 1979). \n\nThis state of perceiving or conceiving of there being a reason is a\nbelief of a unique and controversial sort. According to John McDowell\n(1978), it can explain a virtuous person's action without the\nhelp of a related desire playing a causal role (although we can rightly\nattribute a desire to a person as a consequence of their being\nmotivated by the perception of a reason). McDowell thus rejects the\nHumean Theory of Motivation (premise 2 in the Argument from\nInternalism). His arguments are inspired by his reading of Aristotle\nrather than the Early Modern sentimentalist tradition. The Argument\nfrom Uncodifiability is that explaining a virtuous person's\naction in terms of a desire for doing N things, where N is a natural\nproperty of actions, combined with the belief that something is N\nfalsely presumes that there is some finite and codifiable natural kind\nN corresponding to every virtuous quality in actions. \n\nTake honesty. It is not just a matter of always speaking truly, for\nexample, or not misleading others. Sometimes honesty requires being\nmore forthcoming with information, sometimes less (it is not dishonest\nnot to tell everything to a gossip journalist). On the Aristotelian\nview, there isn't a pattern that could be captured in\nnon-evaluative terms, and hence no explanation of action in terms of an\nindependently intelligible desire to instantiate such a pattern: \nOccasion by occasion, one knows what to do, if one does, not by\napplying universal principles but by being a certain kind of person:\none who sees situations in a certain distinctive way. (McDowell\n1979: 73)  \nThe distinctive way a virtuous person sees a situation is\nthat certain features, like someone's need to know something, are\nsalient to her: they silence other concerns. Other things do not stand\nout as calling for action, and this suffices to explain what the agent\ndoes. \n\nA familiar objection is that it is possible for someone to share the\nvirtuous person's belief or “conception of the\nsituation” but nevertheless lack the motivation. McDowell denies\nthis:  \n [T]he relevant conceptions are not so much as possessed\nexcept by those whose wills are influenced appropriately.\n(McDowell 1978: 87)  \n One argument in favour of this is that there is a\ndifference between being virtuous and being continent. Both kinds of\nagents do the right thing—for example, both remain faithful to\ntheir partner. But the continent agent has to struggle with competing\ndesires that cloud their attention on the noble and the fine. She has\nto muster willpower to keep from temptation. The difference between her\nand the virtuous person, on this picture, is not in the first instance\na conative one, but a difference in what is salient, which is\nsimultaneously a cognitive and affective difference. As David\nMcNaughton maintains, “a way of seeing a situation may itself be\na way of caring or feeling” (McNaughton 1988: 113). A consequence\nof this view is that the process of coming to appreciate practical\nreasons will involve shaping the agent's motivational\nsensitivities and may itself be akin to a non-rational conversion\nrather than to rational deliberation from existing motives (McDowell\n1995: 100–101). \n\nPurported states of mind with both conative and cognitive features\nare often derogatorily labeled “besires” (Altham 1986) by\nthose who don't believe in them. The basic argument in defense of\nthe Humean theory, presented notably by Michael Smith (1994: 119–125),\nis that beliefs and desires are modally separable: it is at\nleast conceivable, and according to Smith actual, that someone\nmaintains the belief that they ought to do something while losing the\nassociated desire, due to depression, say. In response, McDowell would\nhave to insist that in becoming depressed, one's conception of\nthe situation changes, even if one maintains (or acquires) a deflated\nbelief—the sort of cognitive state that a merely continent\nperson has that overlaps with the virtuous person's conception.\nThis is a less outrageous move than is often assumed. After all, it is\ncommonsensical to say that a depressed person sees things differently,\neven if some aspect of continuity is retained. \n\nSensibility theories belong in the category Justin D'Arms and\nDaniel Jacobson (2000a) have labelled neo-sentimentalism. It\nis, officially, the view that evaluative concepts are concepts\nof appropriateness of sentimental responses. (As discussed in \nSection 4.3, neo-sentimentalists often make related metaphysical claims about\nevaluative properties.) That is, to think that something is\nshameful is to think that shame is appropriate or that there is\nsufficient reason for it. Gibbard's account is a non-cognitivist\nvariant of this view, since for him thoughts about appropriateness are\nnon-cognitive, whereas McDowell and Wiggins's view is\ncognitivist, since according to them thoughts about merit are beliefs\n(or, perhaps, besires). \n\nA key motivation for neo-sentimentalism is that making a judgment\nabout desirability or shamefulness is distinct from desiring or being\nashamed. The point of using and introducing normative concepts is to\nguide our attitudes rather than just express or report them. A clear\nadvantage of this view is that it promises to account for the rich\nvariety of evaluative judgments we have—we don't just\nhave thoughts about right and wrong, but also about who's\nenviable or admirable or detestable or funny. \n\nNeo-sentimentalism faces a variety of challenges. Francois Schroeter\n(2005) argues that warranted emotional responses do not determine the\nextension the most important evaluative concepts, such as\ndangerous or wrong, but only minor ones that make\nexplicit reference to emotion, such as fearful or\nshameful. Schroeter contends that the ultimate criterion for\ndetermining whether something is dangerous, for example, is whether it\nis liable to cause harm, where harm can be understood in\nresponse-independent terms, such as loss of bodily integrity (Schroeter 2005: 343). In\nwork in preparation, D'Arms and Jacobson respond by pointing out\nthat not everything that threatens to violate bodily integrity is\ndangerous, nor is everything that is dangerous a threat to bodily\nintegrity (or some other response-independent feature). Our inquiry\ninto what is dangerous will be ultimately about the fittingness of\nfear, even if we can use response-independent characterizations (is it\nlikely to kill or hurt someone?) as useful rules of thumb in reasoning\nabout danger or other evaluative features. \n\nShaun Nichols (2008) criticizes neo-sentimentalist accounts on the\nbasis that they cannot make sense of moral judgment in young children.\nIf neo-sentimentalists are right, to think that something is wrong, for\nexample, is to think that guilt is fitting for doing it—but,\nNichols claims, children who distinguish moral from conventional\nviolations do not yet possess the concept of guilt. This is an\nempirically fraught issue, since it is not easy to determine either\nwhether children make full-blown moral judgments or experience guilt.\nBut there is some evidence that very young children (from 22 months on)\nexhibit behavioural signs of guilt (such as gaze avoidance and bodily\ntension) after a mishap (Kochanska et al. 2002). Perhaps the more\ninteresting question is the development of the sense of appropriateness\nof emotional responses. \n\nD'Arms and Jacobson themselves say that both varieties of\nneo-sentimentalism face what they call the Conflation Problem (2000a:\n732). In general terms, it is that for any attitude Y, S may think that\nY is appropriate towards X without thinking that X is Y-able, and vice\nversa. If a dictator will kill a hundred people unless I admire him, I\nmay think it is appropriate for me to admire him to save all those\nlives. Nevertheless, I may think the dictator is not admirable. If a\ncolleague gets a promotion, I may think she is enviable. Nevertheless,\nI may not think it is appropriate for me to envy my colleague, as it\nwould manifest pettiness and worsen the atmosphere of the\ndepartment. \n\nSince most responses to the Conflation Problem draw on metaphysical\nconsiderations about right and wrong kinds of reasons for attitudes,\nthey will be discussed in Section 4.3. It is, however, worth noting\nhere that some deny there is a genuine problem. What seem to be wrong\nkind of reasons for an attitude are not, in fact, reasons for the\nattitude at all, but for wanting to have it (Gibbard 1990;\nWay 2012). The dictator's threat is no reason for me to admire him,\nsince it's not the sort of thing to which I can directly\nrespond with admiration. (Nor does the thought that envy would be\npetty directly reduce envy, sadly.) I can, and probably should,\nrespond to it by wanting to admire him, and trying to bring\nit about that I admire him. But, on this line of response, the thought\nI have isn't that I have sufficient reason to admire the dictator, but\nrather that I have sufficient reason to want to admire him. As these\nare distinct thoughts, there is no conflation: even in the presence of\nthe threat (or, more generally, any intuitively wrong kind of reason\nfor an attitude), I don't find the attitude itself an appropriate or\nrational response. Conversely, in the case of the enviable colleague,\nI do find envy appropriate, given her promotion, but nevertheless take\nmyself to have sufficient reason to want and try to bring about not\nenvying her, given the bad consequences for the departmental\natmosphere. (For further discussion, see also the entry on Fitting Attitude Theories of\nValue.) \n\nHybrid theories solve the problem of fitting together the\nrepresentational and practical aspects of moral judgment by arguing\nthat both cognitive and non-cognitive states are in play somehow: moral\njudgments have both a sentimental and a non-sentimental aspect. Several\noptions have been explored recently. Hybrid expressivists argue that\nmoral sentences express both kinds of state. Hybrid state theorists\nclaim that there are psychological states that have both\nrepresentational and non-representational aspects. Moral thought\npluralists distinguish between several kinds of moral thought. \n\nHybrid expressivism comes in many varieties. Some take the\nbehaviour of pejoratives such as ‘frog’ (for a\nFrench person) as the model for their account. Calling someone a\n‘frog’ conveys both a belief that the person is French and\na negative attitude toward the French. Daniel Boisvert (2008) argues\nthat a normative utterance like “Stealing is wrong”\nsimilarly expresses both a belief that stealing is wrong (which, for\nBoisvert, is the belief that it has whatever natural property the\ncorrect moral theory says it has) and disapproval of stealing. On his\nview, the belief and attitude are determined by the meaning of the term\nindependently of the speaker's views, just as in the case of\n‘frog’. \n\nIn contrast, Michael Ridge's ‘ecumenical\nexpressivism’ (Ridge 2006) involves speaker-relativity.\nRidge's theory is complex and evolving, but the basic idea is\nsimple enough. Take the judgment that I must tell the truth to the\njudge. As a first approximation, such judgment consists in approval of\nactions of a certain kind, and the belief that telling the truth to the\njudge is an action of that kind (cf. Barker 2000). Maybe I approve of\nactions that maximize utility, and believe that telling the truth to\nthe judge maximizes utility. \n\nA little less roughly, the judgment amounts to thinking that any\nacceptable standard for practical reasoning requires me to tell the\ntruth to the judge. And this, in turn, is a matter of having a\nnormative perspective N, and having the representational belief that\nany standard admitted by N requires me to tell the truth to the judge\n(Ridge forthcoming). The first of these is a complex desire-like state—roughly, embracing a policy that admits a set of standards as\nauthoritative. (In the example, such standards are utilitarian, but\ndifferent people have different normative perspectives.) The second is\nan ordinary belief about these very normative standards: that they\nrequire telling the truth to the judge. \n\nRidge argues that this type of view accounts for the attractions of\nnon-cognitivism, chiefly avoiding problematic ontological commitment to\nnon-deflationary moral facts, and explaining practicality. Having a\nnormative perspective involves a desire-like attitude towards what one\nbelieves to be required by certain standards, practically rational\nagents form an instrumental desire to perform such actions. The\ncognitive element serves to explain the compositionality and\ninferential features of moral language. For example, the judgment\nexpressed by “Either there is nothing wrong with watching a film\nevery night or Jesse is going to hell” consists of a normative\nperspective N and belief that either no standard admitted by N forbids\nwatching a film every night or Jesse is going to hell. Validity of\ninferences is then understood in terms of avoiding inconsistency of the\nassociated beliefs. There is no need for a separate logic of attitudes.\n(For worries about hybrid expressivism, see Schroeder 2009.) \n\nJesse Prinz's (2007) account of moral judgment can be\nclassified as a hybrid state theory. The key to his view is\nhis theory of emotions (Prinz 2004), according to which they are\nperceptions of patterns of bodily changes that represent what they are\n“set up to be set off by”—what it is their function\nto detect—just the same way as any other psychological states\ndo on teleological theories of representation. For Prinz, a\nmoralsentiment is a disposition to respond to certain actions\nwith a range of self- and other-directed blame- or praise-constituting\nemotions, such as guilt, contempt, anger, and gratitude. (He also calls\nit a moral rule—to have internalized a rule against\nstealing consists in being disposed to respond negatively to stealing.)\nA moral judgment consists in the emotion that results from\nactivating a sentiment, such as anger at stealing or shame for fleeing.\nThe anger represents stealing as being such as to cause disapprobation\nin the judge—that is, as morally wrong, according to\nPrinz's moral metaphysics (see Section 4.1). This means the\njudgment can be true or false. It also motivates punishing the agent.\nOther emotions, and hence judgments, have different motivational\neffects—disgust may motivate to avoid the agent instead. \n\nIn addition to the standard internalist argument, Prinz employs the\nArgument from Parsimony. He claims that empirical research (some of\nwhich was discussed in Section 2.1) shows that moral judgments are\naccompanied by emotions, influenced by emotions, and give rise to\nemotions. Prinz acknowledges that non-sentimentalists may have a story\nto tell about all of these phenomena, but the simplest explanation is\nthat moral concepts are themselves constituted by emotions or emotional\ndispositions (Prinz 2007: 21–47). One challenge to Prinz's\nview is thus the seeming possibility of non-emotional moral\njudgment. \n\nFinally, moral thought pluralism is a very new approach,\nalthough Elizabeth Radcliffe (2006) argues that Hume himself\ndistinguished between two kinds of moral thought. Linda Zagzebski\n(2003) and Uriah Kriegel (2012) argue in different ways that there are\ntwo kinds of moral judgment, one of which contains an affective\nelement. Antti Kauppinen (forthcoming a) distinguishes between moral\nappearances, which are constituted by manifestations of\nsentiments we expect others to share, and moral judgments,\nwhich are (implicitly) beliefs about what would be permitted,\nrequired, or recommended by standards an ideal subject would\nendorse. Moral appearances are taken to be parallel to perceptual\nappearances—non-doxastic states that attract assent to their\npropositional contents\n(see Section 5.1). As with other appearances, the existence of moral\nthoughts that are not judgments is clearest in cases in which they\nclash with judgment. \n\nKauppinen draws on the observation that it can seem to us that what\nwe do is wrong even when we sincerely believe it is right, or vice\nversa. He maintains that moral seemings have a distinctive\nphenomenological and motivational character, which is best explained by\ntheir being sentimental in nature. Motivational internalism is thus\ntrue of moral appearances. Since appearances cause moral beliefs, the\ntwo kinds of thought often co-occur. But moral beliefs can be arrived\nat and held independently of moral appearances. This accounts for the\nforce of motivational externalist objections and the possibility of\namoralism. Since the beliefs are ordinary descriptive ones, there is no\nneed for a separate moral semantics. Pluralist views thus split the\ndifference between non-cognitivist and cognitivist sentimentalism: each\nis, broadly speaking, true of one important kind of moral thought (in\ncontrast to hybrid views, according to which each thought has both\nnon-cognitive and cognitive elements). \n\nIt is an appealing thought that moral (and other evaluative) facts\nand properties are not just brutely out there independently of human\nthought and sensibility. Take the evaluative property of being funny.\nHow could something be funny, if no actual human being was ever amused\nby it? How could something be outrageous if it failed to generate any\noutrage when known about, even in those who care about the victim? For\nsentimentalists, value, including moral value, is\nanthropocentric (D'Arms and Jacobson 2006). \n\nSentimentalists agree with error theorists that sui\ngeneris, non-natural moral facts would be queer, and that\nmind-independent natural facts are unfit for the role of moral facts.\nNon-cognitivist sentimentalists treat moral facts as\nprojections of moral attitudes. Although there is excellent\nreason to think Hume wasn't a projectivist, he gave one of the\nclassic formulations in saying that taste \nhas a productive\nfaculty, and gilding and staining all natural objects, borrowed from\ninternal sentiment, raises in a manner a new creation. (1751:\n269)  \nWe take a sentimental response in ourselves, say envy, and\nattribute to the worldly object a feature it doesn't really have,\nsuch as being enviable. \n\nError theorists treat this projection as much the same as the\nattribution of agency to clouds or trees by some primitive culture: a\npredictable false belief. Contemporary expressivists, in contrast,\nbelieve that attribution of moral facts and properties serves a\npurpose. It enables us to express our commitments in a way that\nprovides a focal point for disagreement and debate. As discussed above,\non deflationary views of truth and facts, it is a first-order question\nwhether some attribution is in error or not. \n\nA distinctive kind of sentimentalist moral metaphysics is endorsed\nby cognitivist sentimentalists who believe that moral and evaluative\nfacts are metaphysically determined by some sort of sentimental\nresponses. According to such views, moral properties are\nresponse-dependent in one way or another. Several varieties\nwill be discussed below. For a brief overview of the different types of\nresponse-dependence accounts and their relation to other main views in\nmoral metaphysics, see the\n Response-Dependence Supplement. \n\nThe simplest way to link moral properties with our emotional or\nconative responses would be to say that what makes something wrong is\nthat it is disapproved of, or bad that it is not desired. No one holds\na view this elementary, since it entails that an undetected murder\nisn't morally wrong, for example. It also leaves undetermined\nwhose disapproval is at issue—what if one person disapproves of\nan action but someone else approves? Simple Subjectivism improves on it\nby indexing moral properties to subjects and referring to\ndispositions to cause responses rather than actual responses.\nWhat makes something wrong-for-Mary, for example, is that Mary would\ndisapprove of it, were she aware of it. A related relativist proposal\nis that something is wrong-for-Mary if and only if Mary accepts a\nnormative standard or framework that prohibits it (Harman 1975). \n\nAs noted in Section 2, subjectivists or contextualists about moral\nsemantics need not think that there are specifically evaluative\nproperties at all, only natural properties that can be conceived of\nunder an evaluative mode of presentation that involves a non-cognitive\nelement. Some nevertheless do so. Edward Westermarck maintained that \n[T]o name an act good or bad, ultimately implies that it is apt\nto give rise to an emotion of approval or disapproval in him who\npronounces the judgment. (Westermarck 1906: 4).  \nAccording to\nJesse Prinz, \n An action has the property of being morally wrong\n(right) just in case there is an observer who has a sentiment of\ndisapprobation (approbation) toward it. (Prinz 2007: 92) \n(Recall that for Prinz a sentiment is a disposition to feel\nvarious emotions, so wrongness doesn't hang on someone actually\nhaving a negative reaction to something.) But this claim is highly\nimplausible, given that wrongness is unindexed. It is true of almost\nanything that someone will disapprove of it, and someone else will\napprove of it. Thus, female genital cutting, for example, is\nsimultaneously both (absolutely) right and wrong. This is a\nsteep theoretical cost. \n\nThe Missing Rigidity Problem for Simple Subjectivism is that it\nseems to entail that if we were to begin to approve of slavery, slavery\nwould come to be morally right—it would be true that we would\nrespond to it positively when encountering it, say. But surely the\ncorrect description of such a scenario would not be that slavery has\nbecome right, but that we have become worse people (Broad 1944/5: 151).\nThe Missing Fallibility Problem, which also has to do with tying value\nclosely to our actual responses, is that a simple subjectivist view\nseems to leave insufficient room for mistakes about value. If\nwhat's right is determined by what I approve, I can only be\nmistaken about what's right if I'm mistaken about what I in\nfact approve. But it is very implausible that the remedy for moral\nmistakes is better introspection. \n\nParalleling the case of moral judgment, problems with Simple\nSubjectivism motivate a move to Ideal Dispositionalism. According to\nthis type of view, the extension of moral or evaluative properties is\ndetermined by the sentimental responses of idealized subjects of some\nsort, or responses under idealized conditions. Consequently, the\nMissing Fallibility Problem is handily skirted: we can no doubt be\nmistaken about what an ideal observer would approve. \n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views also avoid the Missing Rigidity\nProblem. Depending on the details, it may suffice to idealize the\nsubject of the sentiments: maybe no impartial spectator would approve\nof slavery, even if the majority of people were to have a pro-slavery\nsensibility. In case the idealization process is path-dependent (so\nthat the outcome depends on the unidealized initial sentiments of the\nsubject), Ideal Dispositionalists may make a rigidification move\n(Wiggins 1987: 206). They can say that the starting point for\nidealization is constituted by actually normal sentiments,\nwhich include a strong desire not to be at the mercy of the good will\nof others, among others. Thus, rigidified ideal observers would\ndisapprove of slavery, even if it became statistically normal to\napprove of it. \n\nIdeal Dispositionalism comes in several varieties, which often\ncorrespond to views about the content of moral judgment (Firth 1952;\nLewis 1989; Smith 1994). Even if they avoid problems with fallibility\nand rigidity, there are a number of further challenges. Five will be\ndiscussed here. \n\nFirst, the Euthyphro Dilemma derives its name from the Platonic\ndialogue in which Socrates argues against a version of Divine Command\ntheory. Applied to subjectivism, it can be presented as follows: \n\nIt is clear that subjectivist accounts with any kind of reductive\nambition cannot embrace the first horn of the dilemma (see below for\nnon-reductivist accounts). So it is the second horn that they must\nface. What exactly is the problem with it? According to Russ\nShafer-Landau, it is that \nit may be impossible to craft a set of\n[non-evaluative] constraints on attitude formation such that the\nemerging attitudes yield prescriptions that match up with our views\nabout what constitutes paradigmatically moral and immoral\nbehaviour (Shafer-Landau 2003: 41)  \nThe challenge is that ideal\nobservers, when defined in non-evaluative terms, might approve of bad\nthings, like ethnic cleansing, which would counterintuitively entail\nthat ethnic cleansing would be morally right. \n\nHowever, Shafer-Landau admits that there is no knock-down argument\nto the effect that any idealization in non-evaluative terms will yield\ncounterintuitive results. Here a Humean might draw comfort from her\nexplanatory theory: if our most robust actual moral intuitions\nare explained by the sentimental responses we have when we approximate\nthe Common Point of View, as the Humean claims, it is after all highly\nunlikely that the anyone who successfully occupies that perspective\nwould approve of something we actually find a paradigmatic moral wrong,\nsuch as genocide. \n\nMichael Huemer offers a different angle on the second horn. He says\nthat if an ideal observer \nhas no moral reason for desiring what\nhe does, then his desires are arbitrary and have no moral import. Why\nwould someone's desiring or approving of something for no\nreason make that thing good? (Huemer 2005: 63)  \nThe problem\nwith this line is that it does not follow from the fact that something\nis not approved for a moral reason that it is approved for\nno reason. There is something about an action in virtue of\nwhich it would be approved of by any ideal observer: perhaps it\ninvolves keeping one's promise. The Ideal Observer theorist says\nthat what makes this natural fact a right-making feature is precisely\nthat it would be approved of by any ideal observer. \n\nPerhaps the real challenge that the Euthyphro poses concerns the\nnormative authority of the responses of any kind of\nsubject defined in non-evaluative terms. One way to develop this\nchallenge may be called the Missing Normativity Problem. Many believe\nthat moral rightness or wrongness are categorically\nreason-giving features of actions. Everyone, regardless of their\ninterests and desires, has a reason to refrain from morally wrong\nbehaviour. Suppose, then, that to be wrong is to be such as to be\ndisapproved of by any ideal observer. On a reductivist view, this is a\nnatural property of the action, specified in non-normative terms. The\nchallenge is: why would such a natural property be categorically\nreason-giving? Why should people care about doing only things that\nwould not be disapproved of by a hypothetical spectator? \n\nAs Johnston puts it, \nTo say that something would be valued\nunder condition K is not thereby to commend it, but only to make a\ndescriptive remark about its relation to certain psychological\nconditions. (Johnston 1989: 157)  \nSimilarly, Blackburn notes that\nevaluative judgments are \nmore like verdicts than\nhypotheses about the suspected reactions of some other group under some\nputative circumstances. (Blackburn 1993: 274)  \nThese challenges\nmay be ways of spelling out the force of G. E. Moore's (1903)\nfamous Open Question Argument: since it makes sense to grant that some\nX would be disapproved of by any impartial, informed, but otherwise\nnormal observer, but nevertheless deny that X is morally wrong, there\nis reason to think that being disapproved of by an ideal observer is\nnot the same thing as being morally wrong. To be sure, the Open\nQuestion Argument is contentious, and there are a number of standard\nresponses: perhaps the identity of the properties is a\nposteriori, like that of water and H2O (Brink 1989), or\nperhaps it is an unobvious conceptual truth that we can read off the\nplatitudes surrounding our concepts (Smith 1994). (For discussion of\nthe Open Question Argument, see the entry on\n moral naturalism.) \n\nThe Missing Normativity Problem is certainly one of the main\noutstanding challenges to any reductivist version of sentimentalism.\nOne direction in which a solution might be sought is drawing on the\nkind of response I suggested might be given to the Missing Motivation\nProblem. Suppose there is a rational requirement for any agent to care\nabout what their ideal advisor or any impartial spectator would\nendorse, for example. If we have to care about what our ideal advisor\nwould want us to do in order to be coherent, or perhaps in order to be\nself-governing agents in the first place, then the reactions of a\nsuitable subject in suitable circumstances will be normative for us,\nregardless of our contingent desires and interests. To be sure, this\nkind of constitutivist sentimentalist response is yet to be\ndefended in print. \n\nThird, Nick Zangwill (2003) argues that response-dependence theories\ncan't account for acting from the motive of duty. It seems we can\ndo something just because it is the right thing to do. When we do so,\nour reason isn't always that we want others, even ideal\nobservers, to approve of us or be disposed to do so (Zangwill 2003:\n286). This is something that Adam Smith clearly recognized. He\ndistinguished between being motivated by love of praise and by love of\npraise-worthiness (TMS 132–3, 147). The latter, however, he\nidentified with desire for self-approbation (the approval of the\nimagined impartial spectator) and for “possessing those\nqualities, and performing those actions, which we love and admire in\nother people” (TMS 150), which is for a wise man “the\nprincipal object, about which he can or ought to be anxious.”\n(TMS 136) Doing something out of the motive of duty is more plausibly\nunderstood in terms of dread of “doing any thing which can render\nus the just and proper objects of the hatred and contempt of our\nfellow-creatures” (TMS 137), such as failing to do our duty. It\nis not obvious that the kind of motivations that Smith describes amount\nto the “arrant cynicism” Zangwill charges\nresponse-dependence accounts with (2003: 287), even though they involve\ndesire for approval. \n\nThe fourth issue is the Indeterminacy Problem. Given a\ncharacterisation of an ideal observer, is there really such a thing as\nan action that would be approved of by any ideal observer?\nHere is how Richard Brandt formulated the objection: \n\nThe fact of ethnology and psychological theory suggest that there\ncould (causally) be two persons, both “ideal observers” in\nFirth's sense, who would have different or even opposed reactions\n(approval, experience of apparent requiredness) with respect to the\nsame act, say on account of past conditioning, a different system of\ndesires, etc. (Brandt 1955: 408) \n\nIf ideal observers disagree, there is, according to the theory, no\nfact of the matter. This problem derives from an essential feature of\nidealized dispositional theories: the idealization begins from what\npeople are actually like, and the process may not guarantee convergence\nin the relevant respects. The only two possibilities are going\nrelativist (as Brandt himself does) or defining the process of\nidealization so as to guarantee convergence. The latter, however,\nthreatens to disengage the ideal responses from motivation and lose the\nconnection between values and beings like us. \n\nFinally, the Unmotivated Idealization Problem is that it is not\nobvious that the move from actual responses or dispositions to ideal\ndispositions has a rationale that is consistent with the core ideas of\nresponse-dependence theory. David Enoch (2005) has recently made a\nforceful case for this problem. He notes that if there are\nresponse-independent facts, it makes good sense to privilege responses\nof certain kind of subjects in certain conditions, because such\nfeatures of subjects and conditions are conducive to tracking the\nresponse-independent facts. But that option is obviously closed for the\nsubjectivist. \n\nEnoch claims that there is no real alternative rationale that is not\nad hoc or that doesn't tacitly rely on response-independent\nrealism. For example, appealing to our actual justificatory practice,\nin which we may privilege responses under full imaginative\nacquaintance, for example, is not an option, since that practice is\nitself best explained by the underlying assumption that there are\nmind-independent moral facts (Enoch 2005: 774). However, Hume might\nobject that the rationale for stepping back from our actual sentimental\nresponses is avoiding “continual contradictions in society and\nconversation” and other practical problems (see Section 2.2). If\nthis is right, our actual justificatory practice and the privileged\nplace it gives to reflectively corrected responses thus has an\nexplanation and rationale that do not presuppose mind-independent\nevaluative facts. (For a different response based on the idea that\nuninformed desires are not really desires for a certain option but only\nfor what the option is falsely thought to be, see Sobel 2009.) \n\nFor sensibility theories, an evaluative property is not a\ndisposition to cause responses in us, but the property of\nmeriting a response from us. A sensibility theory version of\nthe response-dependence equation looks like this: \n\nX is M if and only if X merits R / any virtuous\nsubject S would respond to X with R in ideal circumstances \n\nIt is an obvious and familiar complaint against views of this type\nthat the analysis is uninformative. After all, normative terms\noccur on both sides of the equation: the right-hand side refers to\nmeriting and virtuous subjects. There is no attempt\nto reduce evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones. Neither\nresponses nor properties have metaphysical priority, but are instead\n“siblings” (McDowell 1987). One argument in favour of this\nis the claim that the relevant response cannot be identified\nindependently of the (concept of the) property (Wiggins 1987: 195).\nSensibility theorists nevertheless claim that the non-reductive\nelucidation offers an advantage over primary quality views, according\nto which moral properties have no essential relation to us. \n\nIn response to this point, Terence Cuneo (2001: 581) distinguishes\nbetween strong and weak primary quality views. The latter do claim that\nmoral properties must be characterized in terms of appropriate\nresponses, but nevertheless deny that kindness, say, is\nconstituted by meriting responses—it is rather a\nmind-independent feature in virtue of which responses are merited. It\nis thus not clear whether the no-priority view has an advantage over\nweak primary quality views. \n\nSensibility theories are a species of what is often called a Fitting\nAttitudes (FA) Analysis of value (Rabinowicz and\nRønnow-Rasmussen 2004). The general form of an FA analysis is\nthe following: \n\nX is E if and only if, and because, R is an appropriate or\nfitting response to X / there is sufficient reason to\nrespond to X with R. \n\nThe ‘because’ indicates that the direction of\nmetaphysical explanation is from fittingness of attitudes to the\nproperty, and not the other way: something is good because it is\nfitting to desire it, and not fitting to desire because it is good.\nThis rules out weak primary quality views, which accept that value and\nfitting attitudes go together, but claim that it is value that makes\nthe attitude fitting and not vice versa. Some identify FA analyses with\nneo-sentimentalism (Tappolet 2011), but this is a theoretically\nunhelpful classification, since many forms of FA analysis regard the\nappropriateness or fittingness of attitudes itself as either a\nmind-independent normative fact that can be intellectually intuited\n(such as Ewing 1948) or as a truth determined by what would be\nrationally or reasonably accepted (such as Scanlon 1998). These FA\nviews thus significantly depart from the key motivations for\nsentimentalism, and are better classified as FA variants of\nnon-naturalism and constructivism. \n\nThe specific features of sentimentalist FA analyses come out most\nnotably in the responses that sentimentalists can give to the\nmetaphysical echo of the Conflation Problem, namely the Wrong Kind of\nReasons problem. This is the problem that what makes a response\nappropriate or gives sufficient reason for it may be something that has\nnothing to do with the relevant value. If an evil demon threatens to\nsmite you unless you admire it for its threat, you may have sufficient\nreason to admire the demon (Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen\n2004). But that doesn't mean the demon is admirable—quite\nthe contrary. In the jargon, admiration is not a fitting\nresponse to the demon, since it is appropriate for the wrong kind of\nreason. \n\nThere are various proposals to distinguish between right and wrong\nkind of reasons for attitudes, not all of which are sentimentalist\n(e.g., Parfit 2011). Justin D'Arms and Daniel Jacobson (2000b)\npresent a distinctively sentimentalist alternative. Their piecemeal\nsolution appeals to alethic standards of correctness derived\nfrom the content of the attitude in question. Assuming that an emotion\nhas a cognitive component that presents or construes things as being in\na certain way (see Section 5.1), it can be either accurate or\ninaccurate, depending on whether things are that way. The right kind of\nreasons for or against the attitude are those that bear on its\naccuracy. As they put it, \n An emotional episode presents its\nobject as having certain evaluative features; it is unfitting …\nwhen its object lacks those features. (2000b: 73) \n\nThe example D'Arms and Jacobson use is envy. According to\nthem, it broadly speaking presents a rival as having a desirable\npossession in a negative light. The right kind of reasons bearing on\nwhether a rival is enviable are thus those that have to do with what\nshe possesses and its desirability relative to what you have. If a\ncolleague gets a promotion you wanted, envy may be fitting in this\nsense, and consequently, given a fitting attitudes account of\nevaluative properties, the colleague will be enviable. This is the case\neven if envy is morally or prudentially inappropriate—the\nlatter kind of reasons do not bear on the fittingness of envy. \n\nAdam Smith offers an alternative sentimentalist account of\nfittingness in criticizing the intuitionist FA analyses of his\ntime: \n\n[T]here are some modern systems, according to which virtue consists\nin propriety; or in the suitableness of the affection from which we\nact, to the cause or object which excites it … None of those\nsystems either give, or even pretend to give, any precise or distinct\nmeasure by which this fitness or propriety of affection can be\nascertained or judged of. That precise and distinct measure can be\nfound nowhere but in the sympathetic feelings of the impartial and\nwell-informed spectator. (TMS 346) \n\nA natural take on this is that Smith accepts the FA analysis that an\naction is wrong if and only if it is fitting to resent the agent for\nit, for example. But he then gives a distinctively sentimentalist cast\non what it is for something to be fitting. This normative fact\nconsists in the response being endorsed by an impartial and\nwell-informed spectator. Kauppinen (forthcoming b) argues that if such\nendorsement is understood as approval of manifesting the\nattitude by doing what the attitude by its nature motivates one to do,\nand not only approval of having the attitude, Smithian\nsentimentalists can avoid the Wrong Kind of Reason problem. For\nexample, admiration essentially motivates emulation (Schroeder\n2010b). It is fitting only when an ideal subject of a suitable kind\nwould approve of emulating its object. In contrast, it is appropriate\nfor the wrong kind of reason when an ideal subject would only approve\nof having the attitude but not manifesting it. Insofar as a subject\ncan be ideal in many ways—such as morally or\naesthetically—this type of analysis allows distinguishing\nbetween morally and aesthetically fitting responses. \n\nHume famously argued that we cannot infer an ‘ought’\nproposition from an ‘is’ proposition, because the former\nintroduces “a new relation” of an entirely different kind\n(T 469). This means we cannot come to know moral truths by theoretical\nreasoning from known non-moral truths. This argument is based on\nmetaphysical and explanatory arguments to the effect that moral truths\naren't the sort of relations or facts that reasoning can discover\n(see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement).\n The consequence is that ethics is epistemically\nautonomous. In this, epistemic sentimentalists agree with\nintuitionists, but they deny that basic moral propositions are\nself-evident, so we cannot come to know their truth merely by\nunderstanding them either. Sentimentalists also reject the Kantian idea\nthat pure practical reason can yield moral knowledge. Instead, we come\nto know basic moral truths by way of emotional experience. \n\nEpistemic sentimentalists do not, to be sure, claim that we should\njust go with the gut and throw reason to the wind. Hume was emphatic\nthat theoretical reasoning is typically needed to establish the true\nnature and consequences of the actions and characters that we judge\n(e.g., Hume 1751: 268–269). Nor do sentimentalists deny that we\ncan reason from basic moral principles to derived principles or\nverdicts with the help of factual premises. It is only the basic moral\nbeliefs that cannot (or need not) be inferred from other moral or\nnon-moral truths that are held to be supported by emotional\nexperience. \n\nTalk of a moral sense suggests an epistemic picture according to which\nmoral knowledge is similar to knowledge acquired by other senses.  We\nsimply attend to something, and immediately, without any kind of\nreasoning, just know whether it's right or wrong, just as we come to\nknow the colour or shape of a car just by looking at it. This picture\nof immediate knowledge surely has some commonsensical appeal—I\ndon't have to spend a lot of time thinking about whether torturing a\ndog is wrong. And it is no doubt often the case that belief in the\npresence of the wrong-making natural properties (such as intentionally\ncausing excruciating pain to a whimpering dog) triggers an emotional\nreaction in us. It is plausible, and supported by empirical data (see Section 2.1), that the emotional response\noften precedes and perhaps causes the moral judgment. But is it a\nperception or something analogous? \n\nIn the case of ordinary perceptual experience, an object\ninstantiates an observable property, such as being red, and this causes\nus (in the right way) to have a corresponding phenomenal representation\nof the object, such as a visual experience of a red object in front of\nus (Audi 2013). Many believe that this experience is not itself a\nbelief, since the two can come apart: I can believe that a stick in the\nwater is straight while it nevertheless perceptually appears to me that\nit is not straight. However, in an ordinary case, having a perceptual\nexperience provides (propositional) justification for the corresponding\nbelief, at least according to epistemological internalists.\nEpistemologists debate whether this requires only the absence of\ndefeaters or also some type of warrant to rule out skeptical scenarios\n(see Tucker (ed.) 2013).  \n\nSo is there such a thing as emotional moral perception? The answer\ndepends, in part, on the nature of emotions. On Hume's view, a\npassion is “an original existence” which “contains\nnot any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other\nexistence” (T 415). If this is the case, then emotional\nexperience cannot justify belief the same way contentful perceptual\nexperience does. Most contemporary epistemic sentimentalists reject\nHume's theory of emotions. Instead, they subscribe to some\nvariety of a representational theory of emotions, motivated by the\nthought that emotions can be assessed as appropriate or fitting or even\nrational (de Sousa 1987). This suggests that emotions are\nabout something—that they have intentional\ncontent. \n\nOne representational theory holds that emotions involve or consist\nin a judgment that the target of the emotion (such as flying\non an airplane) has the property that is the formal object of\nthe emotion (such as being dangerous in the case of fear) (Kenny 1963;\nLyons 1980). Sabine Roeser (2011) defends this type of account in the\nmoral case. According to her, moral emotions are “at the same\ntime both value judgments and affective states” (Roeser 2011:\n149). On her view, they constitute intuitions just in the same sense as\ntraditional intuitionists claim: they are direct apprehensions of\nnon-natural states of affairs. (This is a clear case in which epistemic\nand metaphysical variants of sentimentalism come apart.) Any view of\nthis type faces the challenge of explaining why our emotions would\nreliably track such non-natural facts. If being wrong has nothing to do\nwith being such as to arouse a disapproving reaction in us in some\nsuitable circumstances, why should we think that there is a reliable\nconnection between being wrong and our disapproval? Beside the\nreliability concern, there is also the worry that value judgments in\ngeneral are not self-justifying, so it is not clear why judgments\nembedded in emotion would justify further belief. \n\nIn any case, it is a well-known problem with judgmental theories of\nemotion in general that emotions can be recalcitrant, that is,\ncome apart from our judgments. We can be hopeful while believing our\nprospects are dim, or worried in spite of judging that everything is\nall right. This motivates many to regard emotions as being or\ncontaining or being analogous to perceptions, in particular\nevaluative perceptions (de Sousa 1987; Tappolet 2000, 2011; Helm 2001;\nPrinz 2004, 2007; Zagzebski 2003; Goldie 2007; Döring 2007). On\nthis type of view, emotions and perceptual experiences have many common\nfeatures: they are spontaneous, informationally encapsulated (that is,\nrelatively independent from the subject's beliefs and desires),\nhave a characteristic phenomenology, have conceptual (and/or\nnon-conceptual) content, and represent or construe the world as being\nin a certain (evaluative) way without involving judgment or belief.\nConsequently, they can non-inferentially but defeasibly justify\nevaluative belief just as sense perceptions can justify empirical\nbelief. \n\nThe main challenge for the perceptual analogy is capturing the\ncausal element that seems essential to genuine perception: is\nthe wrongness of an action the sort of thing that can cause us to have\na feeling of disapprobation, for example? It certainly seems plausible\nthat what we literally perceive is the property that grounds the\nwrongness of the action, such as the shooting of a peaceful\ndemonstrator by a police officer, and then respond to it with an\nemotional reaction, which construes the action as wrong. If so, perhaps\nit is better to think of emotions as quasi-perceptual\nappearances that constitute moral intuitions rather than\nperceptions (Kauppinen 2013). On this view, emotions\ndon't represent things as having certain properties in virtue of\nbeing triggered by those properties when functioning properly, as Prinz\n(2004) claims, but rather in virtue of their phenomenal character. The\nway an emotion feels is not irrelevant to how it construes its object.\nThe feelings involved in anger, for example, aren't directionless\nsensations, but have a qualitative character in virtue of which anger\npresents its object as offensive (Kriegel forthcoming). \n\nAs with the judgmentalist view, there is room for perceptualist or\nquasi-perceptualist views that are not committed to sentimentalist\nmetaphysics, such as Tappolet (2011), as well as those that are, such\nas Prinz (2007). It is much easier for the latter to explain why\nemotions should be thought of as ways of accessing evaluative truths.\nThey can offer a constitutive explanation of the reliability\nof the responses: since the facts are constitutively linked to\nemotional responses, there is good reason to think emotional responses\ntrack them, at least in suitable conditions. \n\nThe plausibility of the analogy or identity between emotions and\nperceptions hangs on the details. Critics like Mikko Salmela (2011) and\nMichael Brady (2011) point to various differences in cognitive\nprocessing and reason-responsiveness. Perceptualists and\nquasi-perceptualists also need to make clear which emotions can justify\nand when. Even if moral perception (or sentimental intuition) is\nepistemically as good as sense perception, we know that in some\ncircumstances our senses are not reliable. But how do we know which\ncircumstances? This calibration challenge was already noted by\nHutcheson: \n\nBut may there not be a right or wrong state of our moral sense, as\nthere is in our other senses, according as they represent their objects\nto be as they really are, or represent them otherwise? So may not our\nmoral sense approve that which is vicious, and disapprove virtue, as a\nsickly palate may dislike grateful food, or a vitiated sight\nmisrepresent colours or dimensions? Must we not know therefore\nantecedently what is morally good or evil by our reason, before we can\nknow that our moral sense is right? (Hutcheson 1728: 177) \n\nHutcheson's response was to point out that even if moral sense\ncan mislead, it doesn't follow that reason is needed to\nprovide a standard for it, or that it's capable of doing so.\nAfter all, it's not by reasoning that we fundamentally correct\nmistakes of colour perception. Rather, we try to ascertain which\ncircumstances are conducive to properly functioning perception (perhaps\nby way of an a priori inquiry) and then try to place ourselves\nin such circumstances and look again. What the suitable circumstances\nin the moral case are like depends on the nature of moral facts. For\nrelativists like Prinz (2007), the only thing that matters is that our\nreactions genuinely reflect our sentiments towards the action. For\nideal dispositionalists, David Lewis offers a basic recipe: \n\nTo find out whether we would be disposed, under ideal conditions, to\nvalue it, put yourself in ideal conditions, if you can, making sure you\ncan tell when you have succeeded in doing so. Then find out whether you\nvalue the thing in question, i.e., whether you desire to desire it. If\nyou do, that confirms that it is a value. (Lewis 1989: 117) \n\n(Note that Lewis's suggestion seems to involve a kind of\ninference from the proposition that I'm in ideal\nconditions and the proposition that I value x to x being valuable. If\nso, his model is not a perceptualist one.) For Lewis himself, the ideal\nconditions for valuing are those of full imaginative acquaintance with\nthe object. For Hume and Smith, the ideal conditions of moral judging\ninvolve occupying the ‘common point of view’ or the\nperspective of an impartial and well-informed spectator. As discussed\nin Section 2.2, they both believe that achieving this requires\nsympathizing (or empathizing) with the feelings or reactive attitudes\nof those immediately affected while controlling for predictable\ndistortions. Unless they are felt from the common point of view, our\nemotional responses will not reliably track the response-dependent\nmoral facts. Contrary to the way psychologists sometimes represent\nHume, he thus does not condone relying on just any flashes of\naffect. \n\nNot all epistemic sentimentalists subscribe to the perceptualist\nmodel. One alternative is provided by John Allman and Jim Woodward\n(2008), who argue that moral intuitions (in the sense of immediate\njudgments resulting from what psychologists call System 1) involving\nemotional processing can reliably track moral facts after a suitable\nkind of implicit learning. They draw on empirical work on the\ndevelopment of expertise. In implicit learning, the learner,\nsuch as a novice nurse, is repeatedly exposed to certain cues, (such as\nbabies manifesting different symptoms), makes certain decisions to act\n(giving certain kind of treatment to the baby), and then receives\nclear, independent feedback on whether the decisions were correct (the\nsymptoms either go away or get worse) (Kahneman and Klein 2009). As a\nresult, the learner may become an expert, who is able to respond\nimmediately and appropriately to situations without necessarily being\nable to articulate why. Allman and Woodward's suggestion is that\na similar kind of training of our emotional responses is possible in\nthe moral case. \n\nThe core challenge for this type of view is that there is a\ndifference between training emotions to be responsive to potentially\nmorally relevant information, such as \nmental states of\nothers and their likely behavior in interactive situations, as well as\nthe likely consequences of such behaviour (Allman and Woodward\n2008: 173),  \nand training them to be responsive to moral facts\nthemselves. It is not clear whether there is any analogue to the\nunambiguous and independent negative feedback that a nurse receives\nafter giving the wrong treatment in the case of making a mistaken moral\njudgment. \n\nA very different non-perceptualist suggestion is made by Shaun\nNichols and Michael Gill. It draws on the empirical assumption that\nmany core moral judgments are explained by emotions or affect-backed\nrules, and cannot be either explained or justified by reasoning alone\n(see Section 2.2). One way to respond to realizing this is giving up\nour emotion-based moral convictions. But Nichols and Gill argue that is\nproblematic: \n\nThe evidence suggests that if the influence of emotion is\neliminated, one's pattern of moral judgment will be incongruous\nor bizarre to commonsense—one's pattern of moral judgment\nwill look to be not merely a refinement or revision of commonsense\nmorality but a very different thing altogether. (Nichols and Gill 2008:\n152) \n\nGiven that our actual judgments are largely explained by affective\nresponses to rule-prohibited actions, we have to either accept that\nemotions can justify or “give up the bulk of commonsense\nmorality” (Nichols and Gill 2008: 153) This argument\ndoesn't claim that emotions track moral truth or provide some\nkind of internalist epistemic justification. It simply appeals to the\nundesirable pragmatic consequences of rejecting the influence of\nemotion. We'd have to regard our opposition to incest,\nsacrificing one to save many, and privileging the near and the dear as\nunjustified. There are, to be sure, error theorists who happily embrace\nthis conclusion. Even non-error theorists might say the sort of\nconsiderations that Nichols and Gill put forward cannot show that\nemotion-based moral beliefs are epistemically justified. \n\nThe empirical data suggesting that at least some moral beliefs are\nbased on emotional responses has been claimed by some to undercut their\njustification. Most prominently, Joshua Greene (Greene et al. 2001;\nGreene 2008; Greene et al. 2009) and Peter Singer (2005) have argued\nthat deontological (more precisely, non-utilitarian) moral\ntheories are unwarranted rationalizations of gut reactions that are\noutputs of the Intuitive System. In contrast, utilitarian judgments are\nheld to result from conscious processing by the Reasoning System, and\ntherefore to be justified. Although some things that Greene and Singer\nsay impugn emotion-based judgments as such, their main argument is best\nconstrued as follows:  The first two premises of the argument are empirical. Most\nevidence for them comes from studies of Trolley Cases. In Bystander, a\nperson has to choose between letting a trolley run over and kill five\npeople and hitting a switch to divert it to a side track, on which it\nwill run over and kill one. In Footbridge, a person has to choose\nbetween letting a trolley kill five and pushing a heavy man off the\nbridge, so that the trolley will only kill the heavy man. Most people\nthink it is permissible to turn the trolley in Bystander, but not to\npush the heavy man in Footbridge, even though both scenarios pit the\ndeath of one against the death of five. Greene's hypothesis that the\nnon-utilitarian response to Footbridge is caused by an automatic\naffective process is supported by neuroimaging, cognitive load, and\nreaction-time studies (Greene et al. 2001; Greene et al. 2008), as\nwell as studies of patients with brain damage to emotion-processing\nareas (according to Koenigs et al. 2007 such patients have more\nutilitarian responses). Variation of details of cases suggests that\nthese processes are responsive to the use of personal force (Greene et\nal. 2009)—for example, people are less likely to condemn\ndropping the heavy man if the agent uses a switch to open a trap door\nin the footbridge. \n\nPremise 3 of the reconstructed argument is a substantive moral\nassumption. Selim Berker argues on this basis that\n“neuroscientific results are actually doing no work” (2009:\n294) in the argument. But as Greene (manuscript) plausibly notes,\nestablishing the factual premises of the argument is not nothing. If\nthey are accepted, the non-utilitarian who relies on commonsense\nintuitions faces the unpleasant task of arguing that personal force or\ndistance are, after all, morally relevant considerations. Greene also\nprovides some independent argument that affective processes as such are\nlikely to fail at tracking moral truth. The idea is that the relevant\nnegative feelings are ultimately explained as evolutionarily adaptive\n“point-and-shoot” responses to life in small-scale\nsocieties (cf. Singer 2005: 347–348). As such, they are likely to\nbe unreliable, at least in circumstances in which we can harm or help\nat long distance. \n\nSome responses to this argument simply challenge the empirical data.\nPerhaps most effectively, Guy Kahane et al. (2012) broaden the\ninvestigation from the trolley cases, and find that when deontological\nresponses are counterintuitive (such as when one must choose between\nhonesty and lying to prevent serious harm), the patterns that Greene\nobserves are reversed: it is the subjects who give a deontological\nresponse who manifest controlled processing, while utilitarian\nresponses are automatic. Kahane (2012) concludes that the most\nplausible hypothesis is that the Reasoning System gets involved when we\nbalance other considerations against the initial verdict of our\nIntuitive System, regardless of whether the intuition is utilitarian or\ndeontological. This supports no debunking conclusions, nor the superior\nrationality of utilitarianism. Taking a different line, some Kantians,\nsuch as Allan Wood (2011), simply declare the intuitions irrelevant to\njustifying deontological theory. On their picture, it is pure practical\nreason that justifies moral judgments, so what causes most\npeople's reactions is neither here nor there. \n\nFinally, while Greene makes a plausible case that some emotional\nprocesses are sensitive to morally irrelevant factors, it is\nquestionable whether this generalizes. Sentimentalists like Nichols and\nHume who deny that the relevant emotions are adaptations seem to avoid\nthe point-and-shoot charge, if they are right. Reflection on the\nprocess that results in our verdicts might increase rather than\ndiminish our confidence. In this vein, Hume notes at the very end of\nthe Treatise that once we see the origin of our moral\njudgments in sympathy felt from the common point of view, we\n“must certainly be pleas'd to see moral distinctions\nderiv'd from so noble a source” (T 619). Our moral sense \nmust certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself, it\napproves of those principles, from whence it is deriv'd, and\nfinds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin\n(T 619) \n\nWhat this brief account suggests is that when we engage in a process\nof what would now be called wide reflective equilibrium, in\nwhich we try to find the best fit for our particular and general moral\nconvictions and known psychological and sociological facts, including\nfacts about the origin of our moral convictions, we will\nreflectively endorse those moral convictions that result from\nimpartial sympathy. After all, if Hume and Smith are on the right track\nin their explanatory hypotheses, such responses are sensitive to\nfeatures like contributing to the general good, violating trust, or\nbeing used as a mere means, regardless of whether the actions in\nquestion redound to our self-interest or affect our near and dear. On\nthe other hand, if we come to believe that some moral belief of ours\nreflects partiality or the influence of mere distance, we lose\nconfidence in it. On this coherentist picture, then, we assess the\nimplications of moral psychological hypotheses on the basis of\nsubstantive convictions that we hold, such as our approval of unbiased\njudgment. At least if emotions are perceptions or quasi-perceptions of\nvalue, emotion-based beliefs start out with initial credibility in this\nreflective equilibrium process. Its outcome may well be opting for\nembracing rather than rejecting the right kind of emotion-based\njudgments.","contact.mail":"kauppina@tcd.ie","contact.domain":"tcd.ie"}]
