Born into a German-Jewish\nfamily, she was forced to leave Germany in 1933 and lived in Paris for\nthe next eight years, working for a number of Jewish refugee\norganisations. In 1941 she immigrated to the United States and soon\nbecame part of a lively intellectual circle in New York. She held a\nnumber of academic positions at various American universities until\nher death in 1975. She is best known for two works that had a major\nimpact both within and outside the academic community. The first,\nThe Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was a\nstudy of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that generated a wide-ranging\ndebate on the nature and historical antecedents of the totalitarian\nphenomenon. The second, The Human Condition, published in\n1958, was an original philosophical study that investigated the\nfundamental categories of the vita activa (labor, work,\naction). In addition to these two important works, Arendt published a\nnumber of influential essays on topics such as the nature of\nrevolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age. At the\ntime of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes of\nher last major philosophical work, The Life of the Mind,\nwhich examined the three fundamental faculties of the vita\ncontemplativa (thinking, willing, judging).\n\n\n\nHannah Arendt, one of the leading political thinkers of the twentieth\ncentury, was born in 1906 in Hanover and died in New York in 1975. In\n1924, after having completed her high school studies, she went to\nMarburg University to study with Martin Heidegger. The encounter with\nHeidegger, with whom she had a brief but intense love-affair, had a\nlasting influence on her thought. After a year of study in Marburg,\nshe moved to Freiburg University where she spent one semester\nattending the lectures of Edmund Husserl. In the spring of 1926 she\nwent to Heidelberg University to study with Karl Jaspers, a\nphilosopher with whom she established a long-lasting intellectual and\npersonal friendship. She completed her doctoral dissertation, entitled\nDer Liebesbegriff bei Augustin (hereafter LA) under Jaspers’s\nsupervision in 1929. She was forced to flee Germany in 1933 as a\nresult of Hitler’s rise to power, and after a brief stay in Prague and\nGeneva she moved to Paris where for six years (1933–39) she worked for\na number of Jewish refugee organisations. In 1936 she separated from\nher first husband, Günther Stern, and started to live with\nHeinrich Blücher, whom she married in 1940. During her stay in\nParis she continued to work on her biography of Rahel\nVarnhagen, which was not published until 1957 (hereafter RV). In\n1941 she was forced to leave France and moved to New York with her\nhusband and mother. In New York she soon became part of an influential\ncircle of writers and intellectuals gathered around the journal\nPartisan Review. During the post-war period she lectured at a\nnumber of American universities, including Princeton, Berkeley and\nChicago, but was most closely associated with the New School for\nSocial Research, where she was a professor of political philosophy\nuntil her death in 1975. In 1951 she published The Origins of\nTotalitarianism (hereafter OT), a major study of the Nazi and\nStalinist regimes that soon became a classic, followed by The\nHuman Condition in 1958 (hereafter HC), her most important\nphilosophical work. In 1961 she attended the trial of Adolf Eichmann\nin Jerusalem as a reporter for The New Yorker magazine, and\ntwo years later published Eichmann in Jerusalem (hereafter\nEJ), which caused a deep controversy in Jewish circles. The same year\nsaw the publication of On Revolution (hereafter OR), a\ncomparative analysis of the American and French revolutions. A number\nof important essays were also published during the 1960s and early\n1970s: a first collection was entitled Between Past and Future\n(hereafter BPF), a second Men in Dark Times (hereafter MDT),\nand a third Crises of the Republic (hereafter CR). At the\ntime of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes on\nThinking and Willing of her last major philosophical\nwork, The Life of the Mind, which was published posthumously\nin 1978 (hereafter LM). The third volume, on Judging, was\nleft unfinished, but some background material and lecture notes were\npublished in 1982 under the title Lectures on Kant’s Political\nPhilosophy (hereafter LKPP). \n\nHannah Arendt was one of the seminal political thinkers of the\ntwentieth century. The power and originality of her thinking was\nevident in works such as The Origins of Totalitarianism,\nThe Human Condition, On Revolution and The Life\nof the Mind. In these works and in numerous essays she grappled\nwith the most crucial political events of her time, trying to grasp\ntheir meaning and historical import, and showing how they affected our\ncategories of moral and political judgment. What was required, in her\nview, was a new framework that could enable us to come to terms with\nthe twin horrors of the twentieth century, Nazism and Stalinism. She\nprovided such framework in her book on totalitarianism, and went on to\ndevelop a new set of philosophical categories that could illuminate\nthe human condition and provide a fresh perspective on the nature of\npolitical life. \n\nAlthough some of her works now belong to the classics of the Western\ntradition of political thought, she has always remained difficult to\nclassify. Her political philosophy cannot be characterized in terms of\nthe traditional categories of conservatism, liberalism, and socialism.\nNor can her thinking be assimilated to the recent revival of\ncommunitarian political thought, to be found, for example, in the\nwritings of A. MacIntyre, M. Sandel, C. Taylor and M. Walzer. Her name\nhas been invoked by a number of critics of the liberal tradition, on\nthe grounds that she presented a vision of politics that stood in\nopposition some key liberal principles. There are many strands of\nArendt’s thought that could justify such a claim, in particular, her\ncritique of representative democracy, her stress on civic engagement\nand political deliberation, her separation of morality from politics,\nand her praise of the revolutionary tradition. However, it would be a\nmistake to view Arendt as an anti-liberal thinker. Arendt was in fact\na stern defender of constitutionalism and the rule of law, an advocate\nof fundamental human rights (among which she included not only the\nright to life, liberty, and freedom of expression, but also the right\nto action and to opinion), and a critic of all forms of political\ncommunity based on traditional ties and customs, as well as those\nbased on religious, ethnic, or racial identity. \n\nArendt’s political thought cannot, in this sense, be identified either\nwith the liberal tradition or with the claims advanced by a number of\nits critics. Arendt did not conceive of politics as a means for the\nsatisfaction of individual preferences, nor as a way to integrate\nindividuals around a shared conception of the good. Her conception of\npolitics is based instead on the idea of active citizenship, that is,\non the value and importance of civic engagement and collective\ndeliberation about all matters affecting the political community. If\nthere is a tradition of thought with which Arendt can be identified,\nit is the classical tradition of civic republicanism originating in\nAristotle and embodied in the writings of Machiavelli, Montesquieu,\nJefferson, and Tocqueville. According to this tradition politics finds\nits authentic expression whenever citizens gather together in a public\nspace to deliberate and decide about matters of collective\nconcern. Political activity is valued not because it may lead to\nagreement or to a shared conception of the good, but because it\nenables each citizen to exercise his or her powers of agency, to\ndevelop the capacities for judgment and to attain by concerted action\nsome measure of political efficacy. \n\nIn what follows, we reconstruct Arendt’s political philosophy\nalong four major themes: (1) her conception of modernity, (2) her\ntheory of action, (3) her theory of judgment, and (4) her conception\nof citizenship. \n\nIn her major philosophical work, The Human Condition, and in\nsome of the essays collected in Between Past and Future,\nArendt articulated a fairly negative conception of modernity. In these\nwritings Arendt is primarily concerned with the losses incurred as a\nresult of the eclipse of tradition, religion, and authority, but she\noffers a number of illuminating suggestions with respect to the\nresources that the modern age can still provide to address questions\nof meaning, identity, and value. \n\nFor Arendt modernity is characterized by the loss of the\nworld, by which she means the restriction or elimination of the\npublic sphere of action and speech in favor of the private world of\nintrospection and the private pursuit of economic interests. Modernity\nis the age of mass society, of the rise of the social out of\na previous distinction between the public and the private, and of the\nvictory of animal laborans over homo faber and the\nclassical conception of man as zoon politikon. Modernity is\nthe age of bureaucratic administration and anonymous labor, rather\nthan politics and action, of elite domination and the manipulation of\npublic opinion. It is the age when totalitarian forms of government,\nsuch as Nazism and Stalinism, have emerged as a result of the\ninstitutionalization of terror and violence. It is the age where\nhistory as a “natural process” has replaced history as a\nfabric of actions and events, where homogeneity and conformity have\nreplaced plurality and freedom, and where isolation and loneliness\nhave eroded human solidarity and all spontaneous forms of living\ntogether.  Modernity is the age where the past no longer carries any\ncertainty of evaluation, where individuals, having lost their\ntraditional standards and values, must search for new grounds of human\ncommunity as such. \n\nThis is Arendt’s vision of modernity, a vision which, at first sight,\nappears quite stark and unredeeming. It is worth pointing out,\nhowever, that Arendt’s negative appraisal of modernity was shaped by\nher experience of totalitarianism in the twentieth century, and that\nher work provides a number of important insights that may help us to\naddress certain problematic features of the modern age. In her\npolitical writings, and especially in The Origins of\nTotalitarianism, Arendt claimed that the phenomenon of\ntotalitarianism has broken the continuity of Occidental history, and\nhas rendered meaningless most of our moral and political categories.\nThe break in our tradition has become irrevocable after the tragic\nevents of the twentieth century and the triumph of totalitarian\nmovements East and West. In the form of Stalinism and Nazism,\ntotalitarianism has exploded the established categories of political\nthought and the accepted standards of moral judgment, and has thereby\nbroken the continuity of our history. Faced with the tragic events of\nthe Holocaust and the Gulag, we can no longer go back to traditional\nconcepts and values, so as to explain the unprecedented by means of\nprecedents, or to understand the monstrous by means of the familiar.\nThe burden of our time must be faced without the aid of tradition, or\nas Arendt once put it, “without a bannister” (RPW, 336).\nOur inherited concepts and criteria for judgment have been dissolved\nunder the impact of modern political events, and the task now is to\nre-establish the meaning of the past outside the framework of any\ntradition, since none have retained their original validity. It is the\npast, then, and not tradition, that Arendt attempts to preserve from\nthe rupture in modern time-consciousness. Only by reappropriating the\npast by means of what Arendt called “the deadly impact of new\nthoughts” (MDT, 201) can we hope to restore meaning to the\npresent and throw some light on the contemporary situation. \n\nThe hermeneutic strategy that Arendt employed to re-establish a link\nwith the past is indebted to both Walter Benjamin and Martin\nHeidegger.  From Benjamin she took the idea of a fragmentary\nhistoriography, one that seeks to identify the moments of rupture,\ndisplacement and dislocation in history. Such fragmentary\nhistoriography enables one to recover the lost potentials of the past\nin the hope that they may find actualization in the present. From\nHeidegger she took the idea of a deconstructive reading of the Western\nphilosophical tradition, one that seeks to uncover the original\nmeaning of our categories and to liberate them from the distorting\nincrustations of tradition. Such deconstructive hermeneutics enables\none to recover those primordial experiences (Urphaenomene)\nwhich have been occluded or forgotten by the philosophical tradition,\nand thereby to recover the lost origins of our philosophical concepts\nand categories. \n\nBy relying on these two hermeneutic strategies Arendt hopes to redeem\nfrom the past its lost or “forgotten treasure,” that is,\nthose fragments from the past that might still be of significance to\nus. In her view it is no longer possible, after the collapse of\ntradition, to save the past as a whole; the task, rather, is to redeem\nfrom oblivion those elements of the past that are still able to\nilluminate our situation. To re-establish a linkage with the past is\nnot an antiquarian exercise; on the contrary, without the critical\nreappropriation of the past our temporal horizon becomes disrupted,\nour experience precarious, and our identity more fragile. In Arendt’s\nview, then, it is necessary to redeem from the past those moments\nworth preserving, to save those fragments from past treasures that are\nsignificant for us. Only by means of this critical reappropriation can\nwe discover the past anew, endow it with relevance and meaning for the\npresent, and make it a source of inspiration for the future. \n\nThis critical reappropriation is facilitated, in part, by the fact\nthat after the rupture in modern time-consciousness the past may\n“open up to us with unexpected freshness and tell us things no\none has yet had ears to hear” (BPF, 94). The breakdown of\ntradition may in fact provide the great chance to look upon the past\n“with eyes undistorted by any tradition, with a directness which\nhas disappeared from Occidental reading and hearing ever since Roman\ncivilization submitted to the authority of Greek thought” (BPF,\n28–9). \n\nArendt’s return to the original experience of the Greek polis\nrepresents, in this sense, an attempt to break the fetters of a\nworn-out tradition and to rediscover a past over which tradition has\nno longer a claim. Against tradition Arendt sets the criterion of\ngenuineness, against the authoritative that which is forgotten,\nconcealed, or displaced at the margins of history. Only by operating\nagainst the grain of traditionalism and the claims of conventional\nhistoriography can the past be made meaningful again, provide sources\nof illumination for the present, and yield its treasures to those who\nsearch for them with “new thoughts” and saving acts of\nremembrance. \n\nArendt articulates her conception of modernity around a number of key\nfeatures: these are world alienation, earth\nalienation, the rise of the social, and the victory of\nanimal laborans. World alienation refers to the loss of an\nintersubjectively constituted world of experience and action by means\nof which we establish our self-identity and an adequate sense of\nreality. Earth alienation refers to the attempt to escape from the\nconfines of the earth; spurred by modern science and technology, we\nhave searched for ways to overcome our earth-bound condition by\nsetting out on the exploration of space, by attempting to recreate\nlife under laboratory conditions, and by trying to extend our given\nlife-span. The rise of the social refers to the expansion of the\nmarket economy from the early modern period and the ever increasing\naccumulation of capital and social wealth. With the rise of the social\neverything has become an object of production and consumption, of\nacquisition and exchange; moreover, its constant expansion has\nresulted in the blurring of the distinction between the private and\nthe public. The victory of animal laborans refers to the\ntriumph of the values of labor over those of homo faber and\nof man as zoon politikon. All the values characteristic of\nthe world of fabrication — permanence, stability, durability\n— as well as those characteristic of the world of action and\nspeech — freedom, plurality, solidarity — are sacrificed\nin favor of the values of life, productivity and abundance. \n\nArendt identifies two main stages in the emergence of modernity: the\nfirst, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, corresponds to\nworld alienation and the rise of the social, the second, from the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, corresponds to earth alienation and\nthe victory of animal laborans. She also identifies a number\nof causes: the discovery of America and the corresponding shrinking of\nthe earth, the waves of expropriation started during the Reformation,\nthe invention of the telescope challenging the adequacy of the senses,\nthe rise of modern science and philosophy and subsequently of a\nconception of man as part of a process of Nature and History, and the\nexpansion of the realm of the economy, of the production and\naccumulation of social wealth. \n\nArendt’s interpretation of modernity can be criticized on a\nnumber of grounds. We focus attention here on two categories employed\nby Arendt, those of nature, and the social. With\nrespect to the category of nature, Arendt oscillates between two\ncontrasting accounts. According to the first account, the modern age,\nby elevating labor, the most natural of human activities, to the\nhighest position within the vita activa, has brought us too\nclose to nature. Instead of building and preserving the human artifice\nand creating public spaces for action and deliberation, we are reduced\nto engage in the activity of sheer survival and in the production of\nthings that are by definition perishable. According to the second\naccount, however, the modern age is characterized by a growing\nartificiality, by the rejection of anything that is not\nman-made. Arendt cites the fact that natural processes, including that\nof life itself, have been recreated artificially by means of\nscientific experiment, that our natural environment has been\nextensively transformed and in some instances entirely replaced by\ntechnology, and that we have searched for ways to overcome our natural\ncondition as earth-bound creatures by setting out on the exploration\nof space and envisaging the possibility of inhabiting other\nplanets. All this leads to a situation where nothing around us will be\na naturally given event, object, or process, but will instead be the\nproduct of our instruments and the will to refashion the world in our\nimage. \n\nThese two accounts are difficult to reconcile, since in the former we\nhave nature intruding upon and even destroying the human artifice,\nwhile in the latter we have art (techne) expanding upon and\nreplacing everything natural or merely given. The result is to endow\nnature with an ambiguous status, since in the former case the victory\nof animal laborans indicates our subjection to natural\nprocesses, while in the latter case the expansion of scientific\nknowledge and of technological mastery indicates the overcoming of all\nnatural limits. The modern world would thus appear to be too natural\nand too artificial, too much under the dominance of labor and the\nlife-process of the species, as well as too much under the dominance\nof techne. \n\nWith respect to the second category, that of the social, Arendt was\nunable to account for certain important features of the modern\nworld. Arendt identifies the social with all those activities formerly\nrestricted to the private sphere of the household and having to do\nwith the necessities of life. Her claim is that, with the tremendous\nexpansion of the economy from the end of the eighteenth century, all\nsuch activities have taken over the public realm and transformed it\ninto a sphere for the satisfaction of our material needs. Society has\nthus invaded and conquered the public realm, turning it into a\nfunction of what previously were private needs and concerns, and has\nthereby destroyed the boundary separating the public and the\nprivate. Arendt also claims that with the expansion of the social\nrealm the tripartite division of human activities has been undermined\nto the point of becoming meaningless. In her view, once the social\nrealm has established its monopoly, the distinction between labor,\nwork and action is lost, since every effort is now expended on\nreproducing our material conditions of existence. Obsessed with life,\nproductivity, and consumption, we have turned into a society of\nlaborers and jobholders who no longer appreciate the values associated\nwith work, nor those associated with action. \n\nFrom this brief account it is clear that Arendt’s concept of the\nsocial plays a crucial role in her assessment of modernity. I would\nargue, however, that it blinds her to many important issues and leads\nher to a series of questionable judgments. In the first place,\nArendt’s characterization of the social is overly\nrestricted. She claims that the social is the realm of labor, of\nbiological and material necessity, of the reproduction of our\ncondition of existence.  She also claims that the rise of the social\ncoincides with the expansion of the economy from the end of the\neighteenth century.  However, having identified the social with the\ngrowth of the economy in the past two centuries, Arendt cannot\ncharacterize it in terms of a subsistence model of simple reproduction\n(Benhabib 2003, Ch. 6; Bernstein 1986, Ch. 9; Hansen 1993, Ch. 3;\nParekh 1981, Ch. 8). Secondly, Arendt’s identification of the\nsocial with the activities of the household is responsible for a major\nshortcoming in her analysis of the economy. She is, in fact, unable to\nacknowledge that a modern capitalist economy constitutes a structure\nof power with a highly asymmetric distribution of costs and\nrewards. By relying on the misleading analogy of the household, she\nmaintains that all questions pertaining to the economy are\npre-political, and thus ignores the crucial question of economic power\nand exploitation (Bernstein 1986, Ch. 9; Hansen 1993, Ch. 3; Parekh\n1981, Ch. 8; Pitkin 1998; Pitkin 1994, Ch. 10, Hinchman and Hinchman;\nWolin 1994, Ch. 11, Hinchman and Hinchman). Finally, by insisting on\na strict separation between the private and the public, and between\nthe social and the political, she is unable to account for the\nessential connection between these spheres and the struggles to redraw\ntheir boundaries.  Today many so-called private issues have become\npublic concerns, and the struggle for justice and equal rights has\nextended into many spheres. By insulating the political sphere from\nthe concerns of the social, and by maintaining a strict distinction\nbetween the public and the private, Arendt is unable to account for\nsome of the most important achievements of modernity — the\nextension of justice and equal rights, and the redrawing of the\nboundaries between the public and the private (Benhabib 2003, Ch. 6;\nBernstein 1986, Ch. 9; Dietz 2002, Ch. 5; Pitkin 1998; Pitkin 1995,\nCh. 3, Honig; Zaretsky 1997, Ch. 8, Calhoun and McGowan). \n\nArendt’s theory of action and her revival of the ancient notion of\npraxis represent one of the most original contributions to\ntwentieth century political thought. By distinguishing action\n(praxis) from fabrication (poiesis), by linking it\nto freedom and plurality, and by showing its connection to speech and\nremembrance, Arendt is able to articulate a conception of politics in\nwhich questions of meaning and identity can be addressed in a fresh\nand original manner. Moreover, by viewing action as a mode of human\ntogetherness, Arendt is able to develop a conception of participatory\ndemocracy which stands in direct contrast to the bureaucratized and\nelitist forms of politics so characteristic of the modern epoch. \n\nIn what follows, we focus on some of the key components of\nArendt’s theory of action, such as freedom, plurality and\ndisclosure. We then examine the links between action and narrative,\nthe importance of remembrance, and of what may be called\n“communities of memory.” We then show the connection\nbetween action, power and the space of appearance. Lastly, we look at\nthe remedies for the unpredictability and irreversibility of action,\nnamely, the power of promise and the power to forgive. \n\nFor Arendt, action is one of the fundamental categories of the human\ncondition and constitutes the highest realization of the vita\nactiva. Arendt analyzes the vita activa via three\ncategories which correspond to the three fundamental activities of our\nbeing-in-the-world: labor, work, and action. Labor is the activity\nwhich is tied to the human condition of life, work the activity which\nis tied to the condition of worldliness, and action the activity tied\nto the condition of plurality. For Arendt each activity is autonomous,\nin the sense of having its own distinctive principles and of being\njudged by different criteria. Labor is judged by its ability to\nsustain human life, to cater to our biological needs of consumption\nand reproduction, work is judged by its ability to build and maintain\na world fit for human use, and action is judged by its ability to\ndisclose the identity of the agent, to affirm the reality of the\nworld, and to actualize our capacity for freedom. \n\nAlthough Arendt considers the three activities of labor, work and\naction equally necessary to a complete human life, in the sense that\neach contributes in its distinctive way to the realization of our\nhuman capacities, it is clear from her writings that she takes action\nto be the differentia specifica of human beings, that which\ndistinguishes them from both the life of animals (who are similar to\nus insofar as they need to labor to sustain and reproduce themselves)\nand the life of the gods (with whom we share, intermittently, the\nactivity of contemplation). In this respect the categories of labor\nand work, while significant in themselves, must be seen as\ncounterpoints to the category of action, helping to differentiate and\nhighlight the place of action within the order of the vita\nactiva. \n\nThe two central features of action are freedom and\nplurality. By freedom Arendt does not mean the\nability to choose among a set of possible alternatives (the freedom of\nchoice so dear to the liberal tradition) or the faculty of liberum\narbitrium which, according to Christian doctrine, was given to us\nby God. Rather, by freedom Arendt means the capacity to begin, to\nstart something new, to do the unexpected, with which all human beings\nare endowed by virtue of being born. Action as the realization of\nfreedom is therefore rooted in natality, in the fact that\neach birth represents a new beginning and the introduction of novelty\nin the world. \n\nTo be sure, Arendt recognizes that all activities are in some way\nrelated to the phenomenon of natality, since both labor and work are\nnecessary to create and preserve a world into which new human beings\nare constantly born. However, of the three activities, action is the\none most closely connected with natality, because by acting\nindividuals re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their\nbirth. For Arendt, the beginning that each of us represents by virtue\nof being born is actualized every time we act, that is, every time we\nbegin something new. As she puts it: “the new beginning inherent\nin birth can make itself felt in the world only because the newcomer\npossesses the capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting\n” (HC, 9). \n\nArendt also stresses the fact that since action as beginning is rooted\nin natality, since it is the actualization of freedom, it carries with\nit the capacity to perform miracles, that is, to introduce what is\ntotally unexpected. “It is in the nature of beginning”\n— she claims — “that something new is started which\ncannot be expected from whatever may have happened before. This\ncharacter of startling unexpectedness is inherent in all beginnings\n… The fact that man is capable of action means that the\nunexpected can be expected from him, that he is able to perform what\nis infinitely improbable. And this again is possible only because each\nman is unique, so that with each birth something uniquely new comes\ninto the world ” (HC, 177–8). \n\nThe birth of every individual is thus the promise of a new beginning:\nto act means to be able to disclose one’s self and to do the\nunanticipated; and it is entirely in keeping with this conception that\nmost of the concrete examples of action in the modern age that Arendt\ndiscusses are cases of revolutions and popular uprisings. Her claim is\nthat “revolutions are the only political events which confront\nus directly and inevitably with the problem of beginning,” (OR,\n21) since they represent the attempt to found a new political space, a\nspace where freedom can appear as a worldly reality. The favorite\nexample for Arendt is the American Revolution, because there the act\nof foundation took the form of a constitution of liberty. Her other\nexamples are the revolutionary clubs of the French Revolution, the\nParis Commune of 1871, the creation of Soviets during the Russian\nRevolution, the French Resistance to Hitler in the Second World War,\nand the Hungarian revolt of 1956. In all these cases individual men\nand women had the courage to interrupt their routine activities, to\nstep forward from their private lives in order to create a public\nspace where freedom could appear, and to act in such a way that the\nmemory of their deeds could become a source of inspiration for the\nfuture. In doing so, according to Arendt, they rediscovered the truth\nknown to the ancient Greeks that action is the supreme blessing of\nhuman life, that which bestows significance to the lives of\nindividuals. \n\nIn the book On Revolution Arendt devotes much attention to\nthe rediscovery of this truth by those who participated in the\nAmerican Revolution. In her view the Founding Fathers, although they\nmight have pretended that they longed for private life and engaged in\npolitics only out of a sense of duty, made clear in their letters and\nrecollections that they had discovered unexpected delights in action\nand had acquired a taste for public freedom and for earning\ndistinction among their peers. \n\nPlurality, to which we may now turn, is the other\ncentral feature of action. For if to act means to take the initiative,\nto introduce the novum and the unexpected into the world, it\nalso means that it is not something that can be done in isolation from\nothers, that is, independently of the presence of a plurality of\nactors who from their different perspectives can judge the quality of\nwhat is being enacted. In this respect action needs plurality in the\nsame way that performance artists need an audience; without the\npresence and acknowledgment of others, action would cease to be a\nmeaningful activity. Action, to the extent that it requires appearing\nin public, making oneself known through words and deeds, and eliciting\nthe consent of others, can only exist in a context defined by\nplurality. \n\nArendt establishes the connection between action and plurality by\nmeans of an anthropological argument. In her view just as\nlife is the condition that corresponds to the activity of\nlabor and worldliness the condition that corresponds to the\nactivity of work, so plurality is the condition that\ncorresponds to action. She defines plurality as “the fact that\nmen, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world,” and says\nthat it is the condition of human action “because we are all the\nsame, that is, human, in such a way that nobody is ever the same as\nanyone else who ever lived, lives, or will live ” (HC,\n7–8). Plurality thus refers both to equality and\ndistinction, to the fact that all human beings belong to the\nsame species and are sufficiently alike to understand one another, but\nyet no two of them are ever interchangeable, since each of them is an\nindividual endowed with a unique biography and perspective on the\nworld. \n\nIt is by virtue of plurality that each of us is capable of acting and\nrelating to others in ways that are unique and distinctive, and in so\ndoing of contributing to a network of actions and relationships that\nis infinitely complex and unpredictable. This network of actions is\nwhat makes up the realm of human affairs, that space where individuals\nrelate directly without the intermediary of things or matter —\nthat is, through language. Let us examine briefly this connection\nbetween action and language. \n In The Human Condition Arendt stresses repeatedly that\naction is primarily symbolic in character and that the web of human\nrelationships is sustained by communicative interaction (HC,\n178–9, 184–6, 199–200). We may formulate it as\nfollows. Action entails speech: by means of language we are\nable to articulate the meaning of our actions and to coordinate the\nactions of a plurality of agents.  Conversely, speech entails\naction, not only in the sense that speech itself is a form of\naction, or that most acts are performed in the manner of speech, but\nin the sense that action is often the means whereby we check the\nsincerity of the speaker. Thus, just as action without speech runs the\nrisk of being meaningless and would be impossible to coordinate with\nthe actions of others, so speech without action would lack one of the\nmeans by which we may confirm the veracity of the speaker. As we shall\nsee, this link between action and speech is central to Arendt’s\ncharacterization of power, that potential which springs up between\npeople when they act “in concert,” and which is actualized\n“only where word and deed have not parted company, where words\nare not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil\nintentions but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to\nviolate and destroy but to establish relations and create new\nrealities ” (HC, 200). \n\nLet us now turn to an examination of the disclosing power of action\nand speech. In the opening section of the chapter on action in The\nHuman Condition Arendt discusses one of its central functions,\nnamely, the disclosure of the identity of the agent. In action and\nspeech, she maintains, individuals reveal themselves as the unique\nindividuals they are, disclose to the world their distinct\npersonalities. In terms of Arendt’s distinction, they reveal\n“who” they are as distinct to “what” they are\n— the latter referring to individual abilities and talents, as well as\ndeficiencies and shortcomings, which are traits all human beings\nshare.  Neither labor nor work enable individuals to disclose their\nidentities, to reveal “who” they are as distinct from\n“what” they are. In labor the individuality of each person\nis submerged by being bound to a chain of natural necessities, to the\nconstraints imposed by biological survival. When we engage in labor we\ncan only show our sameness, the fact that we all belong to the human\nspecies and must attend to the needs of our bodies. In this sphere we\ndo indeed “behave,” “perform roles,” and\n“fulfill functions,” since we all obey the same\nimperatives. In work there is more scope for individuality, in that\neach work of art or production bears the mark of its maker; but the\nmaker is still subordinate to the end product, both in the sense of\nbeing guided by a model, and in the sense that the product will\ngenerally outlast the maker. Moreover, the end product reveals little\nabout the maker except the fact that he or she was able to make it. It\ndoes not tell us who the creator was, only that he or she had certain\nabilities and talents. It is thus only in action and speech, in\ninteracting with others through words and deeds, that individuals\nreveal who they personally are and can affirm their unique identities.\nAction and speech are in this sense very closely related because both\ncontain the answer to the question asked of every newcomer: “Who\nare you?” This disclosure of the “who” is made\npossible by both deeds and words, but of the two it is speech that has\nthe closest affinity to revelation. Without the accompaniment of\nspeech, action would lose its revelatory quality and could no longer\nbe identified with an agent. It would lack, as it were, the conditions\nof ascription of agency. \n\nWe have seen, then, how through action and speech individuals are able\nto disclose their identities, to reveal their specific uniqueness\n— their who — as distinct from their personal\nabilities and talents — their what. However, while\nengaging in speech and action individuals can never be sure what kind\nof self they will reveal. Only retrospectively, that is, only through\nthe stories that will arise from their deeds and performances, will\ntheir identity become fully manifest. The function of the storyteller\nis thus crucial not only for the preservation of the doings and\nsayings of actors, but also for the full disclosure of the identity of\nthe actor. The narratives of a storyteller, Arendt claims, “tell\nus more about their subjects, the ‘hero’ in the center of\neach story, than any product of human hands ever tells us about the\nmaster who produced it” (HC, 184). Without a Plato to tell us\nwho Socrates was, what his conversations with fellow Athenian citizens\nwere like, without a Thucydides to set down Pericles’ Funeral\nSpeech and refashion it in his powerful and dramatic style, we would\nnot have known what made Socrates and Pericles such outstanding\npersonalities, nor would the reason for their uniqueness have been\nmade fully manifest. Indeed, it is one of Arendt’s most important\nclaims that the meaning of action itself is dependent upon the\narticulation retrospectively given to it by historians and\nnarrators. \n\nStorytelling, or the weaving of a narrative out of the actions and\npronouncements of individuals, is partly constitutive of their\nmeaning, because it enables the retrospective articulation of their\nsignificance and import, both for the actors themselves and for the\nspectators.  Being absorbed by their immediate aims and concerns, not\naware of the full implications of their actions, actors are often not\nin a position to assess the true significance of their doings, or to\nbe fully aware of their own motives and intentions. Only when action\nhas run a certain course, and its relationship to other actions has\nunfolded, can its significance be made fully manifest and be embodied\nin a narrative, whether of poets or historians. The fact that this\nnarrative is temporally deferred, that it is at some distance from the\nevents it describes, is one of the reasons why it can provide further\ninsight into the motives and aims of the actors. \n\nNarratives can thus provide a measure of truthfulness and a greater\ndegree of significance to the actions of individuals. But they also\npreserve the memory of deeds through time, and in so doing, they\nenable these deeds to become sources of inspiration for the future,\nthat is, models to be imitated, and, if possible, surpassed. One of\nthe principal drawbacks of action, Arendt maintains, is to be\nextremely fragile, to be subject to the erosion of time and to\nforgetfulness; unlike the products of the activity of work, which\nacquire a measure of permanence by virtue of their sheer facticity,\ndeeds and words do not survive their enactment unless they are\nremembered. Remembrance alone, the retelling of deeds as\nstories, can save the lives and deeds of actors from oblivion and\nfutility. And it is precisely for this reason, Arendt points out, that\nthe Greeks valued poetry and history so highly, because they rescued\nthe glorious (as well as the less glorious) deeds of the past for the\nbenefit of future generations (HC, 192 ff; BPF, 63–75). It was\nthe poet’s and the historian’s political function to preserve the\nmemory of past actions and to make them a source of instruction for\nthe future. Homer was known as the “educator of Hellas,”\nsince he immortalized for all those who came after him the events of\nthe Trojan War; Thucydides, in his History of the Peloponnesian\nWar, told a story of human ambition and folly, of courage and\nunchecked greed, of ruthless struggle and inevitable defeat. In their\nwork the past became a repository of instruction, of actions to be\nemulated as well as deeds to be shunned. Through their narratives the\nfragility and perishability of human action was overcome and made to\noutlast the lives of their doers and the limited life-span of their\ncontemporaries. \n\nHowever, to be preserved, such narratives needed in turn an audience,\nthat is, a community of hearers who became the transmitters of the\ndeeds that had been immortalized. As Sheldon Wolin has aptly put it,\n“audience is a metaphor for the political community whose nature\nis to be a community of remembrance” (Wolin 1977, 97). In other\nwords, behind the actor stands the storyteller, but behind the\nstoryteller stands a community of memory. \n\nIt was one of the primary functions of the polis to be\nprecisely such a community, to preserve the words and deeds of its\ncitizens from oblivion and the ravages of time, and thereby to leave a\ntestament for future generations. The Greek polis, beyond\nmaking possible the sharing of words and deeds and multiplying the\noccasions to win immortal fame, was meant to remedy the frailty of\nhuman affairs. It did this by establishing a framework where action\nand speech could be recorded and transformed into stories, where every\ncitizen could be a witness and thereby a potential narrator. What the\npolis established, then, was a space where organized\nremembrance could take place, and where, as a result, the\nmortality of actors and the fragility of human deeds could be\npartially overcome. \n\nThe metaphor of the polis recurs constantly in the writings\nof Arendt. This is indeed a ‘metaphor’ because in\nemploying this term Arendt is not simply referring to the political\ninstitutions of the Greek city-states, bounded as they were to their\ntime and circumstance, but to all those instances in history where a\npublic realm of action and speech was set up among a community of free\nand equal citizens.  “The polis, properly speaking, is\nnot the city-state in its physical location; it is the organization of\nthe people as it arises out of acting and speaking together, and its\ntrue space lies between people living together for this purpose, no\nmatter where they happen to be” (HC, 198). Thus the famous\nmotto: “Wherever you go, you will be a polis”\nexpressed the conviction among the Greek colonists that the kind of\npolitical association they had set up originally could be reproduced\nin their new settlements, that the space created by the “sharing\nof words and deeds” could find its proper location almost\nanywhere. \n\nFor Arendt, therefore, the polis stands for the\nspace of appearance, for that space “where I\nappear to others as others appear to me, where men exist not merely\nlike other living or inanimate things, but to make their appearance\nexplicitly.” Such public space of appearance can be always\nrecreated anew wherever individuals gather together politically, that\nis, “wherever men are together in the manner of speech and\naction” (HC, 198–9). However, since it is a creation of action,\nthis space of appearance is highly fragile and exists only when\nactualized through the performance of deeds or the utterance of words.\nIts peculiarity, as Arendt says, is that “unlike the spaces which\nare the work of our hands, it does not survive the actuality of the\nmovement which brought it into being, but disappears not only with the\ndispersal of men — as in the case of great catastrophes when the body\npolitic of a people is destroyed — but with the disappearance or arrest\nof the activities themselves. Wherever people gather together, it is\npotentially there, but only potentially, not necessarily and not\nforever” (HC, 199). \n\nThe space of appearance must be continually recreated by action; its\nexistence is secured whenever actors gather together for the purpose\nof discussing and deliberating about matters of public concern, and it\ndisappears the moment these activities cease. It is always a potential\nspace that finds its actualization in the actions and speeches of\nindividuals who have come together to undertake some common\nproject. It may arise suddenly, as in the case of revolutions, or it\nmay develop slowly out of the efforts to change some specific piece of\nlegislation or policy. Historically, it has been recreated whenever\npublic spaces of action and deliberation have been set up, from town\nhall meetings to workers’ councils, from demonstrations and\nsit-ins to struggles for justice and equal rights. \n\nThis capacity to act in concert for a public-political purpose is what\nArendt calls power. Power needs to be distinguished\nfrom strength, force, and violence (CR, 143–55). Unlike\nstrength, it is not the property of an individual, but of a plurality\nof actors joining together for some common political purpose. Unlike\nforce, it is not a natural phenomenon but a human creation, the\noutcome of collective engagement. And unlike violence, it is based not\non coercion but on consent and rational persuasion. \n\nFor Arendt, power is a sui generis phenomenon, since it is a\nproduct of action and rests entirely on persuasion. It is a product of\naction because it arises out of the concerted activities of a\nplurality of agents, and it rests on persuasion because it consists in\nthe ability to secure the consent of others through unconstrained\ndiscussion and debate. Its only limitation is the existence of other\npeople, but this limitation, she notes, “is not accidental,\nbecause human power corresponds to the condition of plurality to begin\nwith” (HC, 201). It is actualized in all those cases where\naction is undertaken for communicative (rather than strategic or\ninstrumental) purposes, and where speech is employed to disclose our\nintentions and to articulate our motives to others. \n\nArendt maintains that the legitimacy of power is derived from the\ninitial getting together of people, that is, from the original pact of\nassociation that establishes a political community, and is reaffirmed\nwhenever individuals act in concert through the medium of speech and\npersuasion. For her “power needs no justification, being\ninherent in the very existence of political communities; what it does\nneed is legitimacy ... Power springs up whenever people get together\nand act in concert, but it derives its legitimacy from the initial\ngetting together rather than from any action that then may\nfollow” (CR, 151). \n\nBeyond appealing to the past, power also relies for its continued\nlegitimacy on the rationally binding commitments that arise out of a\nprocess of free and undistorted communication. Because of this, power\nis highly independent of material factors: it is sustained not by\neconomic, bureaucratic or military means, but by the power of common\nconvictions that result from a process of fair and unconstrained\ndeliberation. \n\nPower is also not something that can be relied upon at all times or\naccumulated and stored for future use. Rather, it exists only as a\npotential which is actualized when actors gather together for\npolitical action and public deliberation. It is thus closely connected\nto the space of appearance, that public space which arises out of the\nactions and speeches of individuals. Indeed, for Arendt, “power\nis what keeps the public realm, the potential space of appearance\nbetween acting and speaking men, in existence.” Like the space\nof appearance, power is always “a power potential and not an\nunchangeable, measurable and reliable entity like force or strength\n… [it] springs up between men when they act together and\nvanishes the moment they disperse” (HC, 200). \n\nPower, then, lies at the basis of every political community and is the\nexpression of a potential that is always available to actors. It is\nalso the source of legitimacy of political and governmental\ninstitutions, the means whereby they are transformed and adapted to\nnew circumstances and made to respond to the opinions and needs of the\ncitizens. “It is the people’s support that lends power to the\ninstitutions of a country, and this support is but the continuation of\nthe consent that brought the laws into existence to begin with\n… All political institutions are manifestations and\nmaterializations of power; they petrify and decay as soon as the\nliving power of the people ceases to uphold them” (CR, 140). \n\nThe legitimacy of political institutions is dependent on the power,\nthat is, the active consent of the people; and insofar as governments\nmay be viewed as attempts to preserve power for future generations by\ninstitutionalizing it, they require for their vitality the continuing\nsupport and active involvement of all citizens. \n\nThe discussion of Arendt’s theory of action so far has stressed\na number of features, chief among which is action’s capacity to\ndisclose the identity of the agent, to enable freedom to appear and be\nactualized as a worldly reality, to create and sustain a public space\nof appearance, and to make possible the generation of power. We have\nalso emphasized the importance of narrative and remembrance, of the\nretrospective articulation of the meaning of action by means of\nstorytelling and its preservation through a community of memory. In\nconclusion, we examine two other features of action,\nnamely, unpredictability and\nirreversibility, and their respective remedies, the\npower of promise and the power to forgive. \n\nAction is unpredictable because it is a manifestation of freedom, of\nthe capacity to innovate and to alter situations by engaging in them;\nbut also, and primarily, because it takes place within the web of\nhuman relationships, within a context defined by plurality, so that no\nactor can control its final outcome. Each actor sets off processes and\nenters into the inextricable web of actions and events to which all\nother actors also contribute, with the result that the outcome can\nnever be predicted from the intentions of any particular actor. The\nopen and unpredictable nature of action is a consequence of human\nfreedom and plurality: by acting we are free to start processes and\nbring about new events, but no actor has the power to control the\nconsequences of his or her deeds. \n\nAnother and related reason for the unpredictability of action is that\nits consequences are boundless: every act sets in motion an unlimited\nnumber of actions and reactions which have literally no end.  As\nArendt puts it: “The reason why we are never able to foretell\nwith certainty the outcome and end of any action is simply that action\nhas no end” (HC, 233). This is because action “though it\nmay proceed from nowhere, so to speak, acts into a medium where every\naction becomes a chain reaction and where every process is the cause\nof new processes … the smallest act in the most limited\ncircumstances bears the seed of the same boundlessness, because one\ndeed, and sometimes one word, suffices to change every\nconstellation” (HC, 190). \n\nClosely connected to the boundlessness and unpredictability of action\nis its irreversibility. Every action sets off processes which cannot\nbe undone or retrieved in the way, say, we are able to undo a faulty\nproduct of our hands. If one builds an artifact and is not satisfied\nwith it, it can always be destroyed and recreated again. This is\nimpossible where action is concerned, because action always takes\nplace within an already existing web of human relationships, where\nevery action becomes a reaction, every deed a source of future deeds,\nand none of these can be stopped or subsequently undone. The\nconsequences of each act are thus not only unpredictable but also\nirreversible; the processes started by action can neither be\ncontrolled nor be reversed. \n\nThe remedy which the tradition of Western thought has proposed for the\nunpredictability and irreversibility of action has consisted in\nabstaining from action altogether, in the withdrawal from the sphere\nof interaction with others, in the hope that one’s freedom and\nintegrity could thereby be preserved. Platonism, Stoicism and\nChristianity elevated the sphere of contemplation above the sphere of\naction, precisely because in the former one could be free from the\nentanglements and frustrations of action. Arendt’s proposal, by\ncontrast, is not to turn one’s back on the realm of human affairs, but\nto rely on two faculties inherent in action itself, the faculty of\nforgiving and the faculty of\npromising. These two faculties are closely connected,\nthe former mitigating the irreversibility of action by absolving the\nactor from the unintended consequences of his or her deeds, the latter\nmoderating the uncertainty of its outcome by binding actors to certain\ncourses of action and thereby setting some limit to the\nunpredictability of the future. Both faculties are, in this respect,\nconnected to temporality: from the standpoint of the present\nforgiving looks backward to what has happened and absolves the actor\nfrom what was unintentionally done, while promising looks forward as\nit seeks to establish islands of security in an otherwise uncertain\nand unpredictable future. \n\nForgiving enables us to come to terms with the past and liberates us\nto some extent from the burden of irreversibility; promising allows us\nto face the future and to set some bounds to its unpredictability. As\nArendt puts it: “Without being forgiven, released from the\nconsequences of what we have done, our capacity to act would, as it\nwere, be confined to one single deed from which we could never\nrecover; we would remain the victims of its consequences\nforever.” On the other hand, “without being bound to the\nfulfillment of promises, we would never be able to keep our\nidentities; we would be condemned to wander helplessly and without\ndirection in the darkness of each man’s lonely heart” (HC,\n237). Both faculties, in this sense, depend on plurality, on\nthe presence and acting of others, for no one can forgive himself and\nno one can feel bound by a promise made only to one’s self. At the\nsame time, both faculties are an expression of human freedom,\nsince without the faculty to undo what we have done in the past, and\nwithout the ability to control at least partially the processes we\nhave started, we would be the victims “of an automatic necessity\nbearing all the marks of inexorable laws” (HC, 246). \n\nOne of the most enduring contributions of Arendt’s political\nthought is to be found in her reflections on judgment which were to\noccupy the last years of her life. Together with the theory of action,\nher unfinished theory of judgment represents her central legacy to\ntwentieth century political thought.  We now explore some of the key\naspects of her theory of judgment, and will examine its place in the\narchitectonic of Arendt’s theory of politics. \n\nArendt’s theory of judgment was never developed as systematically or\nextensively as her theory of action. She intended to complete her\nstudy of the life of the mind by devoting the third volume to the\nfaculty of judgment, but was not able to do so because of her untimely\ndeath in 1975. What she left was a number of reflections scattered in\nthe first two volumes on Thinking and Willing (LM,\nvol. I; vol. II), a series of lectures on Kant’s political philosophy\ndelivered at the New School for Social Research in the Fall of 1970\n(LKPP), an essay entitled “Thinking and Moral\nConsiderations” written at the time she was composing The\nLife of the Mind (TMC, 417–46), and two articles included in\nBetween Past and Future where judgment and opinion are\ntreated in relation to culture and taste (“The Crisis in\nCulture” – BPF, 197–226) and with respect to the question\nof truth (“Truth and Politics” – BPF,\n227–64). However, these writings do not present a unified theory of\njudgment but, rather, two distinct models, one based on the standpoint\nof the actor, the other on the standpoint of the spectator, which are\nsomewhat at odds with each other. Arendt’s writings on the theme of\njudgment can be seen to fall into two more or less distinct phases, an\nearly one in which judgment is the faculty of political actors acting\nin the public realm, and a later one in which it is the privilege of\nnon-participating spectators, primarily poets and historians, who seek\nto understand the meaning of the past and to reconcile us to what has\nhappened. In this later formulation Arendt is no longer concerned with\njudging as a feature of political life as such, as the faculty which\nis exercised by actors in order to decide how to act in the public\nrealm, but with judgment as a component in the life of the mind, the\nfaculty through which the privileged spectators can recover meaning\nfrom the past and thereby reconcile themselves to time and,\nretrospectively, to tragedy. \n\nIn addition to presenting us with two models of judgment which stand\nin tension with each other, Arendt did not clarify the status of\njudgment with respect to two of its philosophical sources, Aristotle\nand Kant. The two conceptions seem to pull in opposite directions, the\nAristotelian toward a concern with the particular, the Kantian toward\na concern with universality and impartiality. \n It would appear, therefore, that Arendt’s theory of judgment not only\nincorporates two models, the actor’s — judging in order to act\n— and the spectator’s — judging in order to cull meaning\nfrom the past — but that the philosophical sources it draws upon\nare somewhat at odds with each other. \n\nArendt’s concern with judgment as the faculty of retrospective\nassessment that allows meaning to be redeemed from the past originated\nin her attempt to come to terms with the twin political tragedies of\nthe twentieth century, Nazism and Stalinism. Faced with the horrors of\nthe extermination camps and what is now termed the Gulag, Arendt\nstrove to understand these phenomena in their own terms, neither\ndeducing them from precedents nor placing them in some overarching\nscheme of historical necessity. This need to come to terms with the\ntraumatic events of the twentieth century, and to understand them in a\nmanner that does not explain them away but faces them in all their\nstarkness and unprecedentedness, is something to which Arendt returns\nagain and again. Our inherited framework for judgment fails us\n“as soon as we try to apply it honestly to the central political\nexperiences of our own time” (UP, 379). Even our ordinary\ncommon-sense judgment is rendered ineffective, since “we are\nliving in a topsy-turvy world, a world where we cannot find our way by\nabiding by the rules of what once was common sense” (UP,\n383). \n\nThe crisis in understanding is therefore coeval with a crisis in\njudgment, insofar as understanding for Arendt is “so closely\nrelated to and interrelated with judging that one must describe both\nas the subsumption of something particular under a universal\nrule” (UP, 383). Once these rules have lost their validity we\nare no longer able to understand and to judge the particulars, that\nis, we are no longer able to subsume them under our accepted\ncategories of moral and political thought. Arendt, however, does not\nbelieve that the loss of these categories has brought to an end our\ncapacity to judge; on the contrary, since human beings are\ndistinguished by their capacity to begin anew, they are able to\nfashion new categories and to formulate new standards of judgment for\nthe events that have come to pass and for those that may emerge in the\nfuture. \n\nFor Arendt, therefore, the enormity and unprecedentedness of\ntotalitarianism have not destroyed, strictly speaking, our ability to\njudge; rather, they have destroyed our accepted standards of judgment\nand our conventional categories of interpretation and assessment, be\nthey moral or political. And in this situation the only recourse is to\nappeal to the imagination, which allows us to view things in\ntheir proper perspective and to judge them without the benefit of a\npre-given rule or universal. For Arendt, the imagination enables us to\ncreate the distance which is necessary for an impartial judgment,\nwhile at the same time allowing for the closeness that makes\nunderstanding possible. In this way it makes possible our\nreconciliation with reality, even with the tragic reality of the\ntwentieth century. \n\nArendt’s participation at the trial of Eichmann in the early sixties\nmade her once more aware of the need to come to terms with a reality\nthat initially defied human comprehension. How could such an ordinary,\nlaw-abiding, and all-too-human individual have committed such\natrocities? The impact of the trial also forced her to raise another\nproblem concerning judgment, namely, whether we are entitled to\npresuppose “an independent human faculty, unsupported by law and\npublic opinion, that judges anew in full spontaneity every deed and\nintent whenever the occasion arises” (PRD, 187). \n\nArendt returned to this issue in The Life of the Mind, a work\nwhich was meant to encompass the three faculties of thinking, willing,\nand judging. In the introduction to the first volume she declared that\nthe immediate impulse to write it came from attending the Eichmann\ntrial in Jerusalem, while the second, equally important motive, was to\nprovide an account of our mental activities that was missing from her\nprevious work on the vita activa. It was Eichmann’s absence\nof thinking, his “thoughtlessness,” that struck her most,\nbecause it was responsible in her view for his inability to judge in\nthose circumstances where judgment was most needed. “It was this\nabsence of thinking,” she wrote, “that awakened my\ninterest. Is evil-doing … possible in default of not just\n‘base motives’ ... but of any motives whatever …\nMight the problem of good and evil, our faculty for telling right from\nwrong, be connected with our faculty of thought?” (LM, vol. I,\n4–5). \n\nArendt attempted a reply by connecting the activity of thinking to\nthat of judging in a twofold manner. First, thinking — the\nsilent dialogue of me and myself — dissolves our fixed habits of\nthought and the accepted rules of conduct, and thus prepares the way\nfor the activity of judging particulars without the aid of\npre-established universals. It is not that thinking provides judgment\nwith new rules for subsuming the particular under the\nuniversal. Rather, it loosens the grip of the universal over the\nparticular, thereby releasing judgment from ossified categories of\nthought and conventional standards of assessment. It is in times of\nhistorical crisis that thinking ceases to be a marginal affair,\nbecause by undermining all established criteria and values, it\nprepares the individual to judge for him or herself instead of being\ncarried away by the actions and opinions of the majority. \n\nThe second way in which Arendt connected the activity of thinking with\nthat of judging is by showing that thinking, by actualizing the\ndialogue of me and myself which is given in consciousness, produces\nconscience as a by-product. This conscience, unlike the voice\nof God or what later thinkers called lumen naturale, gives no\npositive prescriptions; it only tells us what not to do, what\nto avoid in our actions and dealings with others, as well as what to\nrepent of. Arendt notes in this context that Socrates’ dictum\n“It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong,” and his\nproposition that “It would be better for me that my lyre or a\nchorus I directed should be out of tune and loud with discord, and\nthat multitudes of men should disagree with me, rather than that I,\nbeing one, should be out of harmony with myself and\ncontradict me,” derive their validity from the idea that there\nis a silent partner within ourselves to whom we render account of our\nactions (TMC, 29–30; 35). What we fear most is the anticipation of the\npresence of this partner (i.e., our conscience) who awaits us at the\nend of the day. \n\nArendt also remarks that thinking, as the actualization of the\ndifference given in consciousness, “is not a prerogative of the\nfew but an ever-present faculty in everybody; by the same token,\ninability to think is not a failing of the many who lack brain power,\nbut an ever-present possibility for everybody” (LM, vol. I,\n191). For those who do engage in thinking, however, conscience emerges\nas an inevitable by-product. As the side-effect of thinking,\nconscience has its counterpart in judgment as the by-product of the\nliberating activity of thought. If conscience represents the inner\ncheck by which we evaluate our actions, judgment represents the outer\nmanifestation of our capacity to think critically. Both faculties\nrelate to the question of right and wrong, but while conscience\ndirects attention to the self, judgment directs attention to the\nworld. In this respect, judgment makes possible what Arendt calls\n“the manifestation of the wind of thought” in the sphere\nof appearance. \n\nThe foregoing account has explored the way in which Arendt attempted\nto connect the activity of thinking to our capacity to judge. To be\nsure, this connection of thinking and judging seems to operate only in\nemergencies, in those exceptional moments where individuals, faced\nwith the collapse of traditional standards, must come up with new ones\nand judge according to their own autonomous values. There is, however,\na second, more elaborated view of judgment which does not restrict it\nto moments of crisis, but which identifies it with the capacity to\nthink representatively, that is, from the standpoint of everyone\nelse. Arendt called this capacity to think representatively an\n“enlarged mentality,” adopting the same terms that Kant\nemployed in his Third Critique to characterize aesthetic judgment. It\nis to this work that we must now turn our attention, since Arendt\nbased her theory of political judgment on Kant’s aesthetics rather\nthan on his moral philosophy. \n\nAt first sight this might seem a puzzling choice, since Kant himself\nbased his moral and political philosophy on practical reason and not\non our aesthetic faculties. Arendt, however, claimed that the\nCritique of Judgment contained Kant’s unwritten political\nphilosophy, and that the first part of it, the “Critique of\nAesthetic Judgment,” was the most fruitful basis on which to\nbuild a theory of political judgment, since it dealt with the world of\nappearances from the point of view of the judging spectator and took\nas its starting point the faculty of taste, understood as a faculty of\nconcrete and embodied subjects (BPF, 219–20). \n\nFor Arendt the capacity to judge is a specifically political ability\ninsofar as it enables individuals to orient themselves in the public\nrealm and to judge the phenomena that are disclosed within it from a\nstandpoint that is relatively detached and impartial. She credits Kant\nwith having dislodged the prejudice that judgments of taste lie\naltogether outside the political realm, since they supposedly concern\nonly aesthetic matters. She believes, in fact, that by linking taste\nto that wider manner of thinking which Kant called an “enlarged\nmentality” the way was opened to a revaluation of judgment as a\nspecific political ability, namely, as the ability to think in the\nplace of everybody else. It is only in Kant’s Critique of\nJudgment that we find a conception of judgment as the ability to\ndeal with particulars in their particularity, that is, without\nsubsuming them under a pre-given universal, but actively searching the\nuniversal out of the particular. Kant formulated this distinction as\nthat between determinant and reflective judgments.\nFor him judgment in general is the faculty of thinking the particular\nas contained under the universal. If the universal, (the rule,\nprinciple, or law) is given, then the judgment which subsumes the\nparticular under it is determinant. If, however, only the particular\nis given and the universal has to be found for it, then the judgment\nis reflective. For Kant determinant judgments were cognitive, while\nreflective judgments were non-cognitive. Reflective judgment is seen\nas the capacity to ascend from the particular to the universal without\nthe mediation of determinate concepts given in advance; it is\nreasoning about particulars in their relation to the universal rather\nthan reasoning about universals in their relation to the\nparticular. In the case of aesthetic judgment this means that one can\nunderstand and apply the universal predicate of beauty only through\nexperiencing a particular object that exemplifies it. Thus, upon\nencountering a flower, a unique landscape, or a particular painting, one\nis able to say that it is an example of beauty, that it possesses\n“exemplary validity.” \n\nFor Arendt this notion of exemplary validity is not restricted to\naesthetic objects or to individuals who exemplified certain virtues.\nRather, she wants to extend this notion to events in the past that\ncarry a meaning beyond their sheer enactment, that is, to events that\ncould be seen as exemplary for those who came after. It is here that\naesthetic judgment joins with the retrospective judgment of the\nhistorian. The American and French Revolutions, the Paris Commune, the\nRussian soviets, the German revolutionary councils of 1918–19, the\nHungarian uprising of 1956, all these events possess the kind of\nexemplary validity that makes them of universal significance, while\nstill retaining their own specificity and uniqueness. Thus, by\nattending to these events in their particularity the historian or\njudging spectator is able to illuminate their universal import and\nthereby preserve them as “examples” for posterity. \n\nFor Arendt it is the spectators who have the privilege of judging\nimpartially and disinterestedly, and in doing so they exercise two\ncrucial faculties, imagination and common sense.\nImagination is the faculty of representing in one’s mind that which\nhas already appeared to one’s senses. Through the imagination one can\nrepresent objects that are no longer present and thus establish the\ndistance necessary for an impartial judgment. Once this distancing has\noccurred, one is in a position to reflect upon these representations\nfrom a number of different perspectives, and thereby to reach a\njudgment about the proper value of an object. \n\nThe other faculty that spectators have to appeal to is common sense or\nsensus communis, since without it they could not share their\njudgments or overcome their individual idiosyncrasies. Kant believed\nthat for our judgments to be valid we must transcend our private or\nsubjective conditions in favor of public and intersubjective ones, and\nwe are able to do this by appealing to our community sense, our\nsensus communis. \n\nThe criterion for judgment, then, is communicability, and the\nstandard for deciding whether our judgments are indeed communicable is\nto see whether they could fit with the sensus communis of\nothers. Arendt points out that the emphasis on the communicability of\njudgments of taste, and the correlative notion of an enlarged\nmentality, link up effortlessly with Kant’s idea of a united mankind\nliving in eternal peace. She argues that “It is by virtue of\nthis idea of mankind, present in every single man, that men are human,\nand they can be called civilized or humane to the extent that this\nidea becomes the principle not only of their judgments but of their\nactions. It is at this point that actor and\nspectator become united; the maxim of the actor and the\nmaxim, the ‘standard,’ according to which the spectator\njudges the spectacle of the world, become one” (LKPP, 75). \n\nIn her reflections on Kant’s Third Critique Arendt acknowledges the\nlinks between the standpoint of the actor and that of the\nspectator. Let us now examine the way in which judgment operates from\nthe standpoint of the actor. \n\nArendt presented a model of judgment in the essays “The Crisis\nin Culture” and “Truth and Politics” which could be\ncharacterized as far more ‘political’ than the one\npresented so far. In these essays, in fact, she treated judgment as a\nfaculty that enables political actors to decide what courses of action\nto undertake in the public realm, what kind of objectives are most\nappropriate or worth pursuing, as well as who to praise or blame for\npast actions or for the consequences of past decisions. In this model\njudgment is viewed as a specifically political ability,\nnamely, as “the ability to see things not only from one’s own\npoint of view but from the perspective of all those who happen to be\npresent,” and as being “one of the fundamental abilities\nof man as a political being insofar as it enables him to orient\nhimself in the public realm, in the common world” (BPF,\n221). Arendt claims that “the Greeks called this ability [to\njudge] phronesis, or insight, and they considered it the\nprincipal virtue or excellence of the statesman in distinction from\nthe wisdom of the philosopher. The difference between this judging\ninsight and speculative thought lies in that the former has its roots\nin what we usually call common sense, which the latter constantly\ntranscends.  Common sense … discloses to us the nature of the\nworld insofar as it is a common world; we owe to it the fact that our\nstrictly private and ‘subjective’ five senses and their\nsensory data can adjust themselves to a non-subjective and\n‘objective’ world which we have in common and share with\nothers. Judging is one, if not the most, important activity in which\nthis sharing-the-world-with-others comes to pass” (BPF,\n221). \n\nMoreover, in discussing the non-coercive character of judgment, the\nfact that it can only appeal to but never force the agreement of\nothers, she claims that “this ‘wooing’ or persuading\ncorresponds closely to what the Greeks called peithein, the\nconvincing and persuading speech which they regarded as the typically\npolitical form of people talking with one another” (BPF, 222).\nSome commentators have claimed that there is a contradiction in\nArendt’s employment of the Aristotelian notion of phronesis\nalongside Kant’s idea of an “enlarged mentality,” since\nthey supposedly pull in opposite directions, the former toward a\nconcern with the particular, the latter toward universality and\nimpartiality. However, this contradiction is more apparent than real,\nsince Kant’s theory of aesthetic judgment is a theory of\nreflective judgment, that is, of those judgments where the\nuniversal is not given but must be searched out of the particular. In\nthis respect the theory of aesthetic judgment to which Arendt appeals\ndoes have close affinities with Aristotle’s notion of\nphronesis: both are concerned with the judgment of\nparticulars qua particulars, not with their subsumption under\nuniversal rules. If a distinction is to be made, it has more to do\nwith the mode of asserting validity: In Aristotle\nphronesis is the privilege of a few experienced individuals\n(the phronimoi) who, over time, have shown themselves to be\nwise in practical matters; the only criterion of validity is their\nexperience and their past record of judiciuos actions. In the case of\njudgments of taste, on the other hand, individuals have to appeal to\nthe judgments and opinions of others, and thus the validity of their\njudgments rests on the consent they can elicit from a community of\ndifferently situated subjects. \n\nFor Arendt the validity of political judgment depends on our ability\nto think “representatively,” that is, from the standpoint\nof everyone else, so that we are able to look at the world from a\nnumber of different perspectives. And this ability, in turn, can only\nbe acquired and tested in a public forum where individuals have the\nopportunity to exchange their opinions on particular matters and see\nwhether they accord with the opinions of others. In this respect the\nprocess of opinion formation is never a solitary activity; rather, it\nrequires a genuine encounter with different opinions so that a\nparticular issue may be examined from every possible standpoint until,\nas she puts it, “it is flooded and made transparent by the full\nlight of human comprehension” (BPF, 242). Debate and discussion,\nand the capacity to enlarge one’s perspective, are indeed crucial to\nthe formation of opinions that can claim more than subjective\nvalidity; individuals may hold personal opinions on many subject\nmatters, but they can form representative opinions only by\nenlarging their standpoint to incorporate those of others. As Arendt\nsays: \nOpinions, in fact, are never self-evident. In matters of opinion, but\nnot in matters of truth, “our thinking is truly discursive,\nrunning, as it were, from place to place, from one part of the world\nto another, through all kinds of conflicting views, until it finally\nascends from these particularities to some impartial generality”\n(BPF, 242). In this respect one is never alone while forming an\nopinion; as Arendt notes, “even if I shun all company or am\ncompletely isolated while forming an opinion, I am not simply together\nonly with myself in the solitude of philosophical thought; I remain in\nthis world of universal interdependence, where I can make myself the\nrepresentative of everybody else” (BPF, 242). \n\nThe representative character of judgment and opinion has important\nimplications for the question of validity. Arendt always stressed that\nthe formation of valid opinions requires a public space where\nindividuals can test and purify their views through a process of\nmutual debate and enlightenment. She was, however, quite opposed to\nthe idea that opinions should be measured by the standard of truth, or\nthat debate should be conducted according to strict scientific\nstandards of validity. In her view, truth belongs to the realm of\ncognition, the realm of logic, mathematics and the strict sciences,\nand carries always an element of coercion, since it precludes debate\nand must be accepted by every individual in possession of her rational\nfaculties. Set against the plurality of opinions, truth has a despotic\ncharacter: it compels universal assent, leaves the mind little freedom\nof movement, eliminates the diversity of views and reduces the\nrichness of human discourse. In this respect, truth is anti-political,\nsince by eliminating debate and diversity it eliminates the very\nprinciples of political life. As Arendt writes, “The trouble is\nthat factual truth, like all other truth, peremptorily claims to be\nacknowledged and precludes debate, and debate constitutes the very\nessence of political life. The modes of thought and communication that\ndeal with truth, if seen from the political perspective, are\nnecessarily domineering; they don’t take into account other people’s\nopinions, and taking these into account is the hallmark of all\nstrictly political thinking” (BPF, 241). \n\nArendt’s defense of opinion is motivated not just by her belief that\ntruth leaves no room for debate or dissent, or for the acknowledgment\nof difference, but also by her conviction that our reasoning faculties\ncan only flourish in a dialogic context. She cites Kant’s remark that\n“the external power that deprives man of the freedom to\ncommunicate his thoughts publicly deprives him at the same time of his\nfreedom to think,” and underlines the fact that for Kant the\nonly guarantee of the correctness of our thinking is that “we\nthink, as it were, in community with others to whom we communicate our\nthoughts as they communicate theirs to us” (BPF, 234–5). She\nalso quotes Madison’s statement that “the reason of man, like\nman himself, is timid and cautious when left alone, and acquires\nfirmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is\nassociated” (BPF, 234). \n\nThe appeal to Kant and Madison is meant to vindicate the power and\ndignity of opinion against those thinkers, from Plato to Hobbes, who\nsaw it as mere illusion, as a confused or inadequate grasp of the\ntruth. For Arendt opinion is not a defective form of knowledge that\nshould be transcended or left behind as soon as one is in possession\nof the truth. Rather, it is a distinct form of knowledge which arises\nout of the collective deliberation of citizens, and which requires the\nuse of the imagination and the capacity to think\n“representatively.” By deliberating in common and engaging\nin “representative thinking” citizens are in fact able to\nform opinions that can claim intersubjective validity. It is important\nto stress that Arendt does not want to dismiss the philosophers’\nattempt to find universal or absolute standards of knowledge and\ncognition, but to check their desire to impose those standards upon\nthe sphere of human affairs, since they would eliminate its plurality\nand essential relativity. The imposition of a single or absolute\nstandard into the domain of praxis would do away with the\nneed to persuade others of the relative merits of an opinion, to\nelicit their consent to a specific proposal, or to obtain their\nagreement with respect to a particular policy. Indeed, for Arendt the\nimposition of such a standard would mean that individuals would no\nlonger be required to exercise their judgment, develop their\nimagination, or cultivate an “enlarged mentality,” since\nthey would no longer need to deliberate in common. Strict\ndemonstration, rather than persuasive argumentation, would then become\nthe only legitimate form of discourse. \n\nNow, we must be careful not to impute to Arendt the view that truth\nhas no legitimate role to play in politics or in the sphere of human\naffairs. She does indeed assert that “All truths — not\nonly the various kinds of rational truth but also factual truth\n— are opposed to opinion in their mode of asserting\nvalidity” (BPF, 239), since they all carry an element of\ncompulsion. However, she is only preoccupied with the negative\nconsequences of rational truth when applied to the sphere of politics\nand collective deliberation, while she defends the importance of\nfactual truth for the preservation of an accurate account of the past\nand for the very existence of political communities. Factual truth,\nshe writes, “is always related to other people: it concerns\nevents and circumstances in which many are involved; it is established\nby witnesses and depends upon testimony … It is political by\nnature.” It follows, therefore, that “facts and opinions,\nthough they must be kept apart, are not antagonistic to each other;\nthey belong to the same realm. Facts inform opinions, and opinions,\ninspired by different interests and passions, can differ widely and\nstill be legitimate as long as they respect factual truth. Freedom of\nopinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed and the\nfacts themselves are not in dispute. In other words, factual truth\ninforms political thought just as rational truth informs philosophical\nspeculation” (BPF, 238). \n\nThe relationship between facts and opinions is thus one of mutual\nentailment: if opinions were not based on correct information and the\nfree access to all relevant facts they could scarcely claim any\nvalidity. And if they were to be based on fantasy, self-deception, or\ndeliberate falsehood, then no possibility of genuine debate and\nargumentation could be sustained. Both factual truth and the general\nhabit of truth-telling are therefore basic to the formation of sound\nopinions and to the flourishing of political debate. Moreover, if the\nrecord of the past were to be destroyed by organized lying, or be\ndistorted by an attempt to rewrite history, political life would be\ndeprived of one of its essential and stabilizing elements. In sum,\nboth factual truth and the practice of truth-telling are essential to\npolitical life. The antagonism for Arendt is between rational\ntruth and well-grounded opinion, since the former does not allow for\ndebate and dissent, while the latter thrives on it. Arendt’s defense\nof opinion must therefore be understood as a defense of political\ndeliberation, and of the role that persuasion and dissuasion play in\nall matters affecting the political community. Against Plato and\nHobbes, who denigrated the role of opinion in political matters,\nArendt reasserts the value and importance of political discourse, of\ndeliberation and persuasion, and thus of a politics that acknowledges\ndifference and the plurality of opinions. \n\nIn this last section, we reconstruct Arendt’s conception of\ncitizenship around two themes: (1) the public sphere, and (2)\npolitical agency and collective identity, and to highlight the\ncontribution of Arendt’s conception to a theory of democratic\ncitizenship. \n\nFor Arendt the public sphere comprises two distinct but interrelated\ndimensions. The first is the space of appearance, a space of\npolitical freedom and equality which comes into being whenever\ncitizens act in concert through the medium of speech and\npersuasion. The second is the common world, a shared and\npublic world of human artifacts, institutions and settings which\nseparates us from nature and which provides a relatively permanent and\ndurable context for our activities. Both dimensions are essential to\nthe practice of citizenship, the former providing the spaces where it\ncan flourish, the latter providing the stable background from which\npublic spaces of action and deliberation can arise. For Arendt the\nreactivation of citizenship in the modern world depends upon both the\nrecovery of a common, shared world and the creation of numerous spaces\nof appearance in which individuals can disclose their identities and\nestablish relations of reciprocity and solidarity. \n\nThere are three features of the public sphere and of the sphere of\npolitics in general that are central to Arendt’s conception of\ncitizenship. These are, first, its artificial or constructed\nquality; second, its spatial quality; and, third, the\ndistinction between public and private\ninterests. \n\nAs regards the first feature, Arendt always stressed the artificiality\nof public life and of political activities in general, the fact that\nthey are man-made and constructed rather than natural or given. She\nregarded this artificiality as something to be celebrated rather than\ndeplored. Politics for her was not the result of some natural\npredisposition, or the realization of the inherent traits of human\nnature. Rather, it was a cultural achievement of the first order,\nenabling individuals to transcend the necessities of life and to\nfashion a world within which free political action and discourse could\nflourish. \n\nThe stress on the artificiality of politics has a number of important\nconsequences. For example, Arendt emphasized that the principle of\npolitical equality does not rest on a theory of natural rights or on\nsome natural condition that precedes the constitution of the political\nrealm. Rather, it is an attribute of citizenship which individuals\nacquire upon entering the public realm and which can be secured only by\ndemocratic political institutions. \n\nAnother consequence of Arendt’s stress on the artificiality of\npolitical life is evident in her rejection of all neo-romantic appeals\nto the volk and to ethnic identity as the basis for political\ncommunity. She maintained that one’s ethnic, religious, or racial\nidentity was irrelevant to one’s identity as a citizen, and that it\nshould never be made the basis of membership in a political\ncommunity. \n\nArendt’s emphasis on the formal qualities of citizenship made her\nposition rather distant from those advocates of participation in the\n1960s who saw it in terms of recapturing a sense of intimacy, of\nwarmth and authenticity. For Arendt political participation was\nimportant because it permitted the establishment of relations of\ncivility and solidarity among citizens. She claimed that the ties of\nintimacy and warmth can never become political since they represent\npsychological substitutes for the loss of the common world.  The only\ntruly political ties are those of civic friendship and solidarity,\nsince they make political demands and preserve reference to the\nworld. For Arendt, therefore, the danger of trying to recapture the\nsense of intimacy and warmth, of authenticity and communal feelings is\nthat one loses the public values of impartiality, civic friendship,\nand solidarity. \n\nThe second feature stressed by Arendt has to do with the\nspatial quality of public life, with the fact that political\nactivities are located in a public space where citizens are able to\nmeet one another, exchange their opinions and debate their\ndifferences, and search for some collective solution to their\nproblems. Politics, for Arendt, is a matter of people sharing a common\nworld and a common space of appearance so that public concerns can\nemerge and be articulated from different perspectives. In her view, it\nis not enough to have a collection of private individuals voting\nseparately and anonymously according to their private\nopinions. Rather, these individuals must be able to see and talk to\none another in public, to meet in a public-political space, so that\ntheir differences as well as their commonalities can emerge and become\nthe subject of democratic debate. \n\nThis notion of a common public space helps us to understand how\npolitical opinions can be formed which are neither reducible to\nprivate, idiosyncratic preferences, on the one hand, nor to a\nunanimous collective opinion, on the other. Arendt herself distrusted\nthe term “public opinion,” since it suggested the mindless\nunanimity of mass society. In her view representative opinions could\narise only when citizens actually confronted one another in a public\nspace, so that they could examine an issue from a number of different\nperspectives, modify their views, and enlarge their standpoint to\nincorporate that of others. Political opinions, she claimed, can never\nbe formed in private; rather, they are formed, tested, and enlarged\nonly within a public context of argumentation and debate. \n\nAnother implication of Arendt’s stress on the spatial quality of\npolitics has to do with the question of how a collection of distinct\nindividuals can be united to form a political community. For Arendt\nthe unity that may be achieved in a political community is neither the\nresult of religious or ethnic affinity, not the expression of some\ncommon value system. Rather, the unity in question can be attained by\nsharing a public space and a set of political institutions, and\nengaging in the practices and activities which are characteristic of\nthat space and those institutions. \n\nA further implication of Arendt’s conception of the spatial quality of\npolitics is that since politics is a public activity, one cannot be\npart of it without in some sense being present in a public space. To\nbe engaged in politics means actively participating in the various\npublic forums where the decisions affecting one’s community are\ntaken. Arendt’s insistence on the importance of direct participation\nin politics is thus based on the idea that, since politics is\nsomething that needs a worldly location and can only happen in a\npublic space, then if one is not present in such a space one is simply\nnot engaged in politics. \n\nThis public or world-centered conception of politics lies also at the\nbasis of the third feature stressed by Arendt, the distinction between\npublic and private interests. According to Arendt,\npolitical activity is not a means to an end, but an end in itself; one\ndoes not engage in political action to promote one’s welfare, but to\nrealize the principles intrinsic to political life, such as freedom,\nequality, justice, and solidarity. In a late essay entitled\n“Public Rights and Private Interests” (PRPI) Arendt\ndiscusses the difference between one’s life as an individual and one’s\nlife as a citizen, between the life spent on one’s own and the life\nspent in common with others. She argues that our public interest as\ncitizens is quite distinct from our private interest as\nindividuals. The public interest is not the sum of private interests,\nnor their highest common denominator, nor even the total of\nenlightened self-interests. In fact, it has little to do with our\nprivate interests, since it concerns the world that lies beyond the\nself, that was there before our birth and that will be there after our\ndeath, a world that finds embodiment in activities and institutions\nwith their own intrinsic purposes which might often be at odds with\nour short-term and private interests. The public interest refers,\ntherefore, to the interests of a public world which we share as\ncitizens and which we can pursue and enjoy only by going beyond our\nprivate self-interest. \n\nArendt’s participatory conception of citizenship provides the best\nstarting point for addressing both the question of the constitution of\ncollective identity and that concerning the conditions for\nthe exercise of effective political agency. \n\nWith respect to the first claim, it is important to note that one of\nthe crucial questions at stake in political discourse is the creation\nof a collective identity, a “we” to which we can appeal\nwhen faced with the problem of deciding among alternative courses of\naction. Since in political discourse there is always disagreement\nabout the possible courses of action, the identity of the\n“we” that is going to be created through a specific form\nof action becomes a central question. By engaging in this or that\ncourse of action we are, in fact, entering a claim on behalf of a\n“we,” that is, we are creating a specific form of\ncollective identity. Political action and discourse are, in this\nrespect, essential to the constitution of collective identities. \n\nThis process of identity-construction, however, is never given once\nand for all and is never unproblematic. Rather, it is a process of\nconstant renegotiation and struggle, a process in which actors\narticulate and defend competing conceptions of cultural and political\nidentity. Arendt’s participatory conception of citizenship is\nparticularly relevant in this context since it articulates the\nconditions for the establishment of collective identities. Once\ncitizenship is viewed as the process of active deliberation about\ncompeting identities, its value resides in the possibility of\nestablishing forms of collective identity that can be acknowledged,\ntested, and transformed in a discursive and democratic fashion. \n\nWith respect to the second claim, concerning the question of political\nagency, it is important to stress the connection that Arendt\nestablishes between political action, understood as the active\nengagement of citizens in the public realm, and the exercise of\neffective political agency. This connection between action and agency\nis one of the central contributions of Arendt’s participatory\nconception of citizenship. According to Arendt, the active engagement\nof citizens in the determination of the affairs of their community\nprovides them not only with the experience of public freedom and\npublic happiness, but also with a sense of political agency and\nefficacy, the sense, in Thomas Jefferson’s words, of being\n“participators in government.” In her view only the\nsharing of power that comes from civic engagement and common\ndeliberation can provide each citizen with a sense of effective\npolitical agency. Arendt’s strictures against political representation\nmust be understood in this light. She saw representation as a\nsubstitute for the direct involvement of the citizens, and as a means\nwhereby the distinction between rulers and ruled could reassert\nitself. As an alternative to a system of representation based on\nbureaucratic parties and state structures, Arendt proposed a federated\nsystem of councils through which citizens could effectively determine\ntheir own political affairs. For Arendt, it is only by means of direct\npolitical participation, that is, by engaging in common action and\ncollective deliberation, that citizenship can be reaffirmed and\npolitical agency effectively exercised.","contact.mail":"maurizio.pde@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
