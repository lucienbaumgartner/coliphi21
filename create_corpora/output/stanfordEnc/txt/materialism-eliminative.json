Descartes famously challenged much of what\nwe take for granted, but he insisted that, for the most part, we can\nbe confident about the content of our own minds. Eliminative\nmaterialists go further than Descartes on this point, since they\nchallenge the existence of various mental states that Descartes took\nfor granted.\n\nIn principle, anyone denying the existence of some type of thing is an\neliminativist with regard to that type of thing. Thus, there have been\na number of eliminativists about different aspects of human nature in\nthe history of philosophy. For example, hard determinists like\n Holbach\n (1770) are eliminativists with regard to free will because they claim\nthere is no dimension of human psychology that corresponds to our\ncommonsense notion of freedom. Similarly, by denying that there is an\nego or persisting subject of experience,\n Hume\n (1739) was arguably an eliminativist about the self. Reductive\nmaterialists can be viewed as eliminativists with respect to an\nimmaterial soul. \nNevertheless, contemporary eliminative materialism—the sort of\neliminativism that denies the existence of specific types of mental\nstates—is a relatively new theory with a very short history. The\nterm was first introduced by James Cornman in a 1968 article entitled\n“On the Elimination of ‘Sensations’ and\nSensations” (Cornman, 1968). However, the basic idea goes back\nat least as far as C.D. Broad’s classic, The Mind and its\nPlace in Nature (Broad, 1925). Here Broad discusses, and quickly\nrejects, a type of “pure materialism” that treats mental\nstates as attributes that apply to nothing in the world (pp.\n607–611). Like many future writers (see section 4.1 below),\nBroad argued that such a view is self-contradictory since it\n(presumably) presupposes the reality of misjudgments which are\nthemselves a type of mental state. \nApart from Broad’s discussion, the main roots of eliminative\nmaterialism can be found in the writings of a number of mid-20th\ncentury philosophers, most notably\n Wilfred Sellars,\n W.V.O. Quine,\n Paul Feyerabend,\n and\n Richard Rorty.\n In his important 1956 article, “Empiricism and the Philosophy\nof Mind”, Sellars introduced the idea that our conception of\nmentality may be derived not from direct access to the inner workings\nof our own minds, but instead from a primitive theoretical framework\nthat we inherit from our culture. While Sellars himself regarded this\ntheoretical framework as empirically correct, his claim that our\nconception of the mind is theory-based, and at least in principle\nfalsifiable, would be influential to later supporters of\neliminativism. \nIn articles such as “Mental Events and the Brain” (1963),\nPaul Feyerabend explicitly endorsed the idea that common-sense\npsychology might prove to be radically false. Indeed, Feyerabend held\nthat practically any version of materialism would severely undermine\ncommon-sense psychology. Like many of his contemporaries, Feyerabend\nargued that common-sense mental notions are essentially non-physical\nin character. Thus, for him, any form of physicalism would entail that\nthere are no mental processes or states as understood by common-sense\n(1963, p. 295). \nLike Feyerabend, Quine also endorsed the idea that mental notions like\nbelief or sensation could simply be abandoned in favor of a more\naccurate physiological account. In a brief passage in Word and\nObject (1960), Quine suggests that terms denoting the physical\ncorrelates of mental states will be more useful and, as he puts it,\n“[t]he bodily states exist anyway; why add the others?”\n(p. 264). However, Quine goes on to question just how radical an\neliminativist form of materialism would actually be, implying no\nsignificant difference between explicating mental states as\nphysiological states, and eliminating mental state terms in favor of\nphysical state terms. He asks, “Is physicalism a repudiation of\nmental objects after all, or a theory of them? Does it repudiate the\nmental state of pain or anger in favor of its physical concomitant, or\ndoes it identify the mental state with a state of the physical\norganism (and so a state of the physical organism with the mental\nstate)” (p. 265)? Quine answers this question by rejecting it,\nsuggesting there is no interesting difference between the two cases:\n“Some may therefore find comfort in reflecting that the\ndistinction between an eliminative and an explicative physicalism is\nunreal” (p. 265). \nHere we see a tension that runs throughout the writings of many early\neliminative materialists. The problem involves a vacillation between\ntwo different conditions under which mental concepts and terms are\ndropped. The first scenario proposes that certain mental concepts will\nturn out to be empty, with mental state terms referring to nothing\nthat actually exists. Historical analogs for this way of understanding\neliminativism are cases where we (now) say it turned out there are no\nsuch things, such as demons and crystal spheres. The second scenario\nsuggests that the conceptual framework provided by neurosciences (or\nsome other physical account) can or should come to replace the\ncommon-sense framework we now use. Unlike the first scenario, the\nsecond allows that mental state terms may actually designate something\nreal—it’s just that what they designate turn out to be\nbrain states, which will be more accurately described using the\nterminology of the relevant sciences. One possible model for this way\nof thinking about eliminativism might be the discontinuance of talk\nabout germs in favor of more precise scientific terminology of\ninfectious agents. Given these two different conceptions, early\neliminativists would sometimes offer two different characterizations\nof their view: (a) There are no mental states, just brain\nstates and, (b) There really are mental states, but they are\njust brain states (and we will come to view them that way). \nThese alternative ways of understanding eliminative materialism\nproduced considerable confusion about what, exactly, eliminative\nmaterialism entailed. Moreover, since it was difficult to see how the\nsecond version was significantly different from various forms of\nreductive materialism (hence, Quine’s skepticism about the\ndifference between elimination and explication) it also raised doubts\nabout the distinctiveness of eliminative materialism. \nMuch of this was brought to light in the discussion generated by an\ninfluential 1965 article by Richard Rorty entitled, “Mind-Body\nIdentity, Privacy, and Categories”. Rorty’s so-called\n“disappearance” theory appeared to openly endorse both\nconceptions of eliminative materialism, suggesting that sensations do\nnot actually exist and that they are nothing but brain processes (p.\n28). As one might expect, the ensuing discussion focused on getting\nclear on what Rorty’s theory actually claimed (for doubts about\nRorty’s status as a true eliminative materialist, see Ramsey\n(forthcoming)). For example, Cornman’s article introducing the\nphrase ‘eliminative materialism’ claimed that Rorty was\narguing that talk about sensations denotes brain states in much the\nsame way that talk about Zeus’s thunderbolts (allegedly) denotes\nelectrical discharges. Unfortunately, besides suggesting a\nquestionable perspective on reference, this interpretation raised\nfurther questions about what distinguished eliminativism from\nreductionism. In one helpful article by William Lycan and George\nPappas (1972)—entitled, appropriately enough, “What Is\nEliminative Materialism?”—the authors convincingly argued\nthat you can’t have it both ways. You can either claim that\ncommon sense mental notions do not pick out anything real and that\nmental terms are empty, in which case you are a true eliminative\nmaterialist; or you can claim that mental notions can be, in some way,\nreduced to neurological (or perhaps computational) states of the\nbrain, in which case you are really just a good-old fashioned\nmaterialist/reductionist. In a follow-up article, Steven Savitt (1974)\nintroduced the distinction between ontologically conservative\n(reductive) and ontologically radical (eliminative) theory change,\nwhich helped to further clarify and distinguish the central claims of\neliminative materialism as it is understood today. \nIn more recent history, eliminative materialism has received attention\nfrom a broader range of writers, including many concerned not only\nwith the metaphysics of the mind, but also the process of theory\nchange, the status of semantic properties, the nature of psychological\nexplanation and recent developments in\n cognitive science.\n Much of this attention has been fostered by the husband-wife team of\nPaul and Patricia Churchland, whose writings have forced many\nphilosophers and cognitive scientists to take eliminativism more\nseriously. In his 1981 article, “Eliminative Materialism and the\nPropositional Attitudes”, Paul Churchland presents several\narguments in favor of dropping commonsense psychology that have shaped\nthe modern debate about the status of ordinary notions like belief.\nPatricia Churchland’s provocative 1986 book,\nNeurophilosophy, suggests that developments in neuroscience\npoint to a bleak future for commonsense mental states. Another\ninfluential author has been Stephen Stich. His important 1983 book,\nFrom Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against\nBelief, argues that even conventional\n computational psychology—which\n is often assumed to vindicate common-sense\npsychology—should reject taxonomies for cognitive states that\ncorrespond with belief-desire psychology. These authors’ views\nare discussed in more detail in Sections 3 and 4 below. \nModern versions of eliminative materialism claim that our common-sense\nunderstanding of psychological states and processes is deeply mistaken\nand that some or all of our ordinary notions of mental states will\nhave no home, at any level of analysis, in a sophisticated and\naccurate account of the mind. In other words, it is the view that\ncertain common-sense mental states, such as beliefs and desires, do\nnot exist. To establish this claim, eliminativists typically endorse\ntwo central and controversial claims which we will examine below. Much\nof our discussion will focus upon our notion of belief, since it\nfigures so prominently in contemporary discussions of eliminative\nmaterialism. However, many of the arguments presented below are\nthought to generalize to other mental notions—especially other\npropositional attitudes.  \nThe standard argument for eliminative materialism begins with the\nSellarsian thesis that we employ a theoretical framework to explain\nand predict intelligent behavior. Because this position claims that we\nuse a theory when employing mental idiom, it is often referred to as\nthe “theory-theory” (see the entry on\n folk psychology as a theory),\n and is endorsed not only by eliminative materialists, but by many\nrealists about mental states as well (like Sellars). Folk psychology\nis assumed to consist of both generalizations (or laws) and specific\ntheoretical posits, denoted by our everyday psychological terms like\n‘belief’ or ‘pain’. The generalizations are\nassumed to describe the various causal or counterfactual relations and\nregularities of the posits. For instance, a typical example of a folk\npsychological generalization would be: \nAdvocates of the theory-theory claim that generalizations like these\nfunction in folk psychology much like the laws and generalizations of\nscientific theories. At the same time, many theory-theorists allow\nthat the laws of folk psychology are learned more informally than\nscientific theories, as part of our normal development (see, for\nexample, P. M. Churchland, 1981 and Lewis, 1972). \nAccording to theory-theorists, the posits of folk psychology are\nsimply the mental states that figure in our everyday psychological\nexplanations. Theory-theorists maintain the (controversial) position\nthat, as theoretical posits, these states are not directly observed,\nthough they are thought to account for observable effects like overt\nbehavior. Theory-theorists also claim that common-sense assigns a\nnumber of properties to these states, such as causal, semantic and\nqualitative features. For instance, the theory-theory claims\ncommon-sense assigns two sorts of properties to beliefs. First, there\nare various causal properties. Beliefs are the sort of states that are\ncaused in certain specific circumstances, interact with other\ncognitive states in various ways, and come to generate various sorts\nof behavior, depending on the agent’s other desires and mental\nstates. As functionalists have claimed, these causal roles appear to\ndefine our ordinary notion of belief and distinguish them from other\ntypes of mental states. Second, beliefs have\n intentionality;\n that is, they each express a proposition or are about a particular\nstate of affairs. This inherent intentionality (also called\n“meaning”, “content”, and “semantic\ncharacter”), is commonly regarded as something special about\nbeliefs and other propositional attitudes. Moreover, as we will see\nbelow, it is also a popular target of eliminative materialists who\nchallenge the propriety and explanatory value of beliefs. \nAlthough eliminative materialists have traditionally appealed to\nsomething like the idea that our folk conception of the mind is a\ntheory, as suggested by the theory-theory, it does not actually \nrequire  that our commonsense mental notions are embedded in a\ntheoretical framework used for explaining and predicting. Virtually\nany sort of embedding conceptual framework could be proposed in\nsupport of the first step of the eliminativist argument. In fact,\nalthough it is seldom recognized, the only thing eliminative\nmaterialism actually requires is the relatively weak assumption that\nwe have mental concepts (i.e., concepts of mental states and\nprocesses) and that those concepts assign certain properties to those\nmental states and processes. Even opponents of the theory-theory will\ntypically allow that we possess  some  sort of conception of\nmental states like beliefs or pains and that such a conception (at\nleast tacitly) assigns to their corresponding mental entities a\nvariety of intrinsic, relational, intentional, phenomenal, causal, and\ntemporal properties. Anyone who denies this would be denying that we\npossess notions of mental states – a highly implausible\nview. \nThe second component of eliminative materialism is the thesis that\nfolk psychology is profoundly wrong about the actual nature of the\nmind/brain. Eliminative materialists argue that the central tenets of\nfolk psychology radically misdescribe cognitive processes;\nconsequently, the posits of folk psychology have no role to play in a\nserious scientific theory of the mind because the posits pick out\nnothing that is real. Like dualists, eliminative materialists insist\nthat ordinary mental states cannot be reduced to or identified with\nneurological events or processes. However, unlike dualists,\nstraightforward eliminativists claim there is nothing more to the mind\nthan what occurs in the brain. The reason mental states are\nirreducible is not because they are non-physical; rather, it is\nbecause mental states, as described by common-sense psychology, do not\nreally exist.  \nTo see all of this a little better, it will help to return to the\nimportant distinction made by Steven Savitt discussed in Section 1\nbetween ontologically conservative (or retentive) theory change on the\none hand, and ontologically radical (or eliminative) theory change on\nthe other hand. Ontologically conservative theory change occurs when\nthe entities and posits of the replaced theory are relocated, often\nwith some degree of revision, in the replacing theory. For example, as\nour theory of light was gradually replaced by our understanding of\nelectro-magnetic radiation, our conception of light was dramatically\ntransformed as we recognized ways in which our old conception was\nmistaken or incomplete. Nevertheless, at no point did we come to say\nthat there is really no such thing as light. Rather, light was\neventually identified with a form of electro-magnetic radiation. \nBy contrast, our notion of demons did not come to find a new home in\ncontemporary theories of mental disorder. There is nothing in the\ntheories of schizophrenia, Tourette’s Syndrome, neuro-pathology\nor any of the other modern explanations for bizarre behavior, that we\ncan sensibly identify with malevolent spirits with supernatural\npowers. The notion of a demon is just too far removed from anything we\nnow posit to explain behavior that was once explained by demonology.\nConsequently, the transition from demonology to modern accounts of\nthis behavior was ontologically radical. We dropped demons from our\ncurrent ontology, and came to realize that the notion is\nempty—it refers to nothing real.  \nEliminative materialists claim that an ontologically radical theory\nchange awaits the theoretical posits of folk psychology in a manner\nsimilar to these cases. With straightforward eliminativism, just as we\ncame to understand that there are no such things as demons (because\nnothing at all like demons appear in modern accounts of strange\nbehavior), so too, eliminative materialists argue that various folk\npsychological concepts—like our concept of belief—will\neventually be recognized as empty posits that fail to correspond with\nanything that actually exists. Since there is nothing that has the\ncausal and semantic properties we attribute to beliefs (and many other\nmental states) it will turn out that there really are no such\nthings.  \nIt should be noted that a somewhat similar framework for understanding\neliminative materialism is provided by David Lewis’s discussion\nof functional definitions in psychology (1972) (see the entry on\n functionalism).\n In Lewis’s account, our commonsense mental notions can be\ntreated as functionally defined theoretical terms that appear in a\nchain of Ramsey-sentences. The Ramsey-sentences are a formal\nreconstruction of the platitudes of commonsense psychology. They\nprovide a set of roles or conditions that more or less must be met for\nthe instantiation of any given state. If nothing comes close to\nactually filling the roles specified by this framework for a certain\nstate, then we are warranted in saying that the theoretical posit in\nquestion doesn’t refer and there is no such thing. Eliminative\nmaterialists claim that this is precisely what will happen with at\nleast some of our folk mental notions. \nWe have been treating eliminative materialism as a metaphysical claim\nabout the ontological status of the posits of commonsense psychology;\nas the claim that there exists nothing that corresponds to the concept\nin question — it picks out nothing real. This is analogous to\nwhat happened in the case of demons and crystal spheres. Because there\nare no such things, these concepts have no role to play in a proper\nscientific ontology. However, in recent years the term\n‘eliminativism’ has been applied to a very different type\nof ontological stance toward the posits of commonsense psychology.\nThis alternative stance is that although the commonsense concept does\nindeed correspond with something real, the kind in question is, for a\nhost of reasons, ill-suited for serious scientific theorizing. Thus,\ndropping the commonsense concept from science is, at least in part,\ndue to pragmatic considerations about proper scientific practice.\nIrvine and Sprevak refer to this as “discourse\neliminativism” (Irvine and Sprevak, forthcoming). With\nconventional eliminative materialism, any token invoking of the mental\nstate concept or term will designate nothing — the concept or\nterm has no identifiable intentional object. By contrast, with this\nalternative picture, particular uses of a mental state concept or term\nmay indeed refer to some actual neurological state or condition that\nshares many of the features associated with the concept in question.\nHowever, because no legitimate scientific type maps properly onto the\nfolk psychological type, the latter should be dropped from the\ncategories of scientific psychology. So with this alternative\ninterpretation of eliminativism, the alleged problem with folk\npsychology has more to do with the classification system it provides\nfor certain types of mental states or processes; its criteria for\ndemarcation and categorization are grossly ill-suited for cognitive\nscience. The unscientific nature of the category may be due to a\nvariety of considerations (or combination of considerations) including\n(but not limited to) demarcation criteria that are overly subjective\nor context dependent, cut across more natural kinds, reduce to wildly\ndisjunctive arrays of real properties, fail to yield useful\ngeneralizations, collapse together useful levels of analysis, and so\non. Thus, this alternative conception of eliminativism is the exact\nconverse of certain forms of instrumentalism. Whereas an\ninstrumentalist might claim that there are no X’s, but we should\ncontinue invoking or talking about X’s in science for pragmatic\nreasons, a proponent of this alternative picture of eliminativism says\nthere really are X’s, but we should stop using the category in\nscience for pragmatic reasons. \nTo see this a little better, consider our concept of weed. It\nis used in everyday life to pick out certain actual plants, but the\ncategory is badly ill-suited for science. The category of weeds is\nhighly subjective and cross-classifies a number of natural floral\nkinds. While it would be wrong to say there are no such things as\nweeds, the notion does not belong in the science of botany. The\nalternative conception of eliminativism is based on the idea that\ncertain commonsense psychological categories should be regarded as\nsimilar to the category of weeds. Although the folk notion in question\nmay correspond with something actual, the folk category should be\ndropped from the sciences of the mind because it is inappropriate for\nserious scientific theorizing and explanation. \nAn illustration of this alternative picture of eliminativism is\nprovided by Paul Griffiths’ account of our commonsense notion of\nemotion (Griffiths, 1997). Griffiths argues that the category of\nemotion should be dropped from scientific psychology and replaced with\ncategories that are better grounded in scientific psychology and\nneuroscience. He points out that the folk concept cuts across three\ndifferent kinds of affective states: affect programs, higher cognitive\nemotions and social constructions. Affect programs are basic and\nautomatic states such as fear or anger that have an evolutionary basis\nand that are triggered by specific conditions. By contrast, higher\ncognitive emotions, like jealousy or shame, and social constructions\nare much less automatic and more easily influenced by a broader range\nof factors like higher-order thoughts or cultural conditioning.\nGriffiths argues that these psychological types are almost certainly\nsubserved by radically different cognitive mechanisms and consequently\nshould not be lumped together under some superordinate commonsense\ncategory of emotion. Griffiths develops a similar line of argument\nagainst emotion based upon levels of analysis and the difference\nbetween function-based taxonomies as opposed to lineage-based\ntaxonomies. \nA comparable type of outlook is endorsed by Edouard Machery with\nregard to our concept of (ironically) concepts (Machery,\n2008). Machery argues that because our folk notion of concept\ncorresponds to such a heterogeneous group of scientific kinds of\nstored information — including prototypes, exemplars, and\ntheories — then psychologists would be better off just using\nthese scientific categories and abandoning talk of concepts\naltogether. Similar sorts of arguments have been leveled against the\nfolk categories of belief (Stich, 1983), pain (Hardcastle, 1999),\nconsciousness (Irvine, 2012), and mental illness (Murphy and Stich,\n1999). \nOne problem with this gloss on eliminativism is that it often depends\nupon controversial normative claims about appropriate scientific\ntaxonomies. Many deny that, say, the highly disjunctive nature of a\ncommonsense notion is sufficient justification for dropping it. If it\nwas, we would eliminate the categories of memory and inference from\nscientific psychology. While authors like Griffiths and Machery\npresent very sophisticated arguments involving specific details about\nthe categories in question, most of these arguments either explicitly\nor tacitly make claims about the requirements of proper scientific\ncategorization that are highly contentious in the philosophy of\nscience (see, for example, the discussion in Machery, 2010). \nA second and more serious problem is that this alternative conception\nof eliminative materialism is not, strictly speaking, a type of\neliminative materialism. The claim that some category possesses\nmembers but the category itself is nevertheless ill-suited for science\nis not just a weaker version of the claim that a category is\nill-suited for science because it has no members. Say what\nyou will about weeds, clothing, pets and other kinds that are not\nscientifically respectable, it is clearly wrong to suggest these\nthings are not real. Thus, to avoid confusion, it would probably help\nif a term other than ‘eliminativism’ was adopted to\ndesignate this alternative conception. Irvine and Sprevak’s\n‘discourse eliminativism’ is problematic because, besides\nwrongly implying it is a version of eliminativism, there can also be\ndiscourse changes that involve the elimination of a term but where the\nrelevant relabeled category is fully retained. The term\n‘consumption’ has been dropped from our scientific\nnomenclature, but it successfully referred to the legitimately\ntaxonomized disease we now refer to as ‘tuberculosis’.\nPerhaps a phrase like ‘category dissolution’ or\n‘conceptual fragmentation’ would more accurately capture\nthe sort of thing that people like Griffiths and Machery have in\nmind. \nBecause eliminative materialism is grounded in the claim that common\nsense psychology is radically false, arguments for eliminativism are\ngenerally arguments against the tenability of folk\npsychology. These arguments typically fall into one of two major\nfamilies. One family involves arguments stemming from a broad range of\nconsiderations that pertain to the assessment of theories in general.\nThe second family focuses upon deficiencies that are unique to folk\npsychology and its central posits.  \nPatricia and Paul Churchland have offered a number of arguments based\non general considerations about theory evaluation. For example, they\nhave argued that any promising and accurate theory should offer a\nfertile research program with considerable explanatory power. They\nnote, however, that common-sense psychology appears to be stagnant,\nand there is a broad range of mental phenomena that folk psychology\ndoes not allow us to explain. Questions about why we dream, various\naspects of mental illness, consciousness, memory and learning are\ncompletely ignored by folk psychology. According to the Churchlands,\nthese considerations indicate that folk psychology may be in much\nworse shape than we commonly recognize (P. M. Churchland, 1981; P.S.\nChurchland, 1986). Another argument that appeals to general\ntheoretical considerations offers an inductive inference based on the\npast record of folk theories. Folk physics, folk biology, folk\nepidemiology and the like all proved to be radically mistaken. Since\nfolk theories generally turn out to be mistaken, it seems quite\nimprobable that folk psychology will turn out true. Indeed, since folk\npsychology concerns a subject that is far more complex and difficult\nthan any past folk theory, it seems wildly implausible that this one\ntime we actually got things right (Churchland, P.M. 1981).  \nThese general theoretical arguments do not seem to have significantly\nundermined the intuitive support that folk psychology enjoys. In\nresponse to the charge that folk psychology is stagnant, many have\nargued that this assessment is unfair, and that folk psychology has\nactually stimulated a number of fruitful research programs in\nscientific psychology (Greenwood, 1991; Horgan and Woodward, 1985).\nMoreover, defenders of folk psychology note that it hardly follows\nfrom the observation that a given theory is incomplete, or fails to\nexplain everything, that it is therefore radically false (Horgan and\nWoodward, 1985). Defenders of folk psychology object that these\ntheoretical considerations cannot outweigh the evidence provided by\neveryday, ordinary experience of our own minds, such as our\nintrospective experience, which seems to vividly support the reality\nof mental states like beliefs. \nRegarding this last point, eliminativists like the Churchlands warn\nthat we should be deeply suspicious about the reliability of\nintrospective “evidence” about the inner workings of the\nmind. If inner observation is as theory-laden as many now suppose\nouter perception to be, what we introspect may be largely determined\nby our folk psychological framework. In other words,\n“introspecting” beliefs may be just like people\n“seeing” demonic spirits or celestial spheres (Churchland,\nP.M., 1988). This skepticism about the reliability of introspection is\nbolstered by empirical work that calls into question the reliability\nof introspection (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). As we will see in Section\n3.3, the idea that introspection offers an illusory image of the mind\nis gaining popularity not just with regard to information bearing\nstates like beliefs, but also with regard to phenomenal states like\nqualia. \nThe second family of eliminative materialist arguments focuses upon\nidiosyncratic features of folk-psychological posits and ultimately\ndenies that these features will be accommodated by a scientific\naccount of the mind. The most widely discussed features are two\nassociated with the apparent linguistic nature of beliefs and other\npropositional attitudes. First, as a number of philosophers have\nrecently noted, propositional attitudes appear to have a form similar\nto public language sentences, with a compositional structure and\nsyntax. For example, a person’s belief that, say, the president\ndislikes terrorists appears to be composed of the concepts “THE\nPRESIDENT”, “DISLIKES”, and\n“TERRORISTS”, and differs from the belief that terrorists\ndislike the president by virtue of something analogous to syntactic\narrangement. Second, beliefs resemble public sentences in that they\nhave semantic properties. Beliefs, like public linguistic\nrepresentations, are about different states of affairs. Both of these\nquasi-linguistic features of propositional attitudes—their\nalleged sentential structure and their semantic (or intentional)\nproperties—have been used by philosophers to mount arguments for\neliminativism. \nSome writers have emphasized the apparent mismatch between the\nsentential structure of propositional attitudes on the one hand, and\nthe actual neurological structures of the brain on the other hand.\nWhereas the former involves discrete symbols and a combinatorial\nsyntax, the latter involves action potentials, spiking frequencies and\nspreading activation. As Patricia Churchland (1986) has argued, it is\nhard to see where in the brain we are going to find anything that even\nremotely resembles the sentence-like structure that appears to be\nessential to beliefs and other propositional attitudes. \nIn response to this line of reasoning, many have argued that it is\nmistake to treat folk psychology as committed to a quasi-linguistic\nstructure to propositional attitudes (Horgan and Graham, 1991;\nDennett, 1991). And even for those who find this reading of folk\npsychology plausible, there is a further difficulty regarding the\nrelevance of neuroscience for determining the status of folk\npsychology. Some, such as Zenon Pylyshyn (1984), have insisted that\njust as the physical circuitry of a computer is the wrong level of\nanalysis to look for computational symbol structures, so too, the\ndetailed neurological wiring of the brain is the wrong level of\norganization to look for structures that might qualify as beliefs.\nInstead, if we view the mind as the brain’s program, as many\nadvocates of classical AI do, then folk posits exist at a level of\nanalysis that is more abstract than the neuro-physical details.\nConsequently, many realists about the posits of folk psychology\ndiscount the importance of any apparent mis-match between neurological\narchitecture and the alleged linguistic form of propositional\nattitudes (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; McLaughlin & Warfield,\n1994). \nThe second type of argument against beliefs focuses upon their\nsemantic properties and concludes that these sorts of properties make\npropositional attitudes ill-suited for even a computational theory of\nthe mind. Stephen Stich (1983) has emphasized that folk psychology\nindividuates beliefs by virtue of their semantic properties, e.g., we\ntaxonomize states like beliefs by virtue of what they are about.\nHowever, according to Stich, there are a host of reasons for rejecting\na semantic taxonomy for scientific psychology. Semantic taxonomies\nignore causally salient aspects of cognitive states, involve a high\ndegree of vagueness, and break down in the case of the mentally ill or\nthe very young. In place of the semantic individuation method adopted\nby folk psychology, Stich argues for a syntactic taxonomy that is\nbased upon the causally relevant syntactic or physical properties of a\ngiven cognitive state. \nYet, as Stich himself notes, even if it should turn out that folk\nposits do not belong in a scientific psychology, more is needed to\nestablish that they do not actually exist. After all, we do not doubt\nthe existence of several sorts of things (e.g., chairs, articles of\nclothing) that are defined in ways that make them ill-suited for\nscience. Thus, Stich’s account is not truly eliminativist for\nthe reasons we saw in Section 2.3: his prescription is for a\nscientifically superior taxonomy that still involves belief-like\nstates. Moreover, if our best scientific account posited states that\nshare many features with beliefs, such as similar causal roles, then\neven if the two taxonomies pulled apart in certain cases, we may still\nregard folk psychology as, in some sense, vindicated. While the\nscientific taxonomy may not list beliefs as basic cognitive states, it\ncould conceivably still provide the resources for developing a realist\ninterpretation of these and other folk psychological states. \nOne way to get a stronger eliminativist conclusion would be to argue\nthat there is nothing posited in a scientific account of cognition\nthat shares the central properties we attribute to folk psychological\nstates, at any level of analysis. For example, Ramsey, Stich\nand Garon (1990) have argued that if certain\n connectionist\n models of memory and inference prove successful, then this would form\nthe basis for eliminative materialism regarding states like\npropositional memories. Since some connectionist models store\ninformation in a highly distributed manner, there are no causally\ndiscrete, semantically evaluable data structures that represent\nspecific propositions. It is not just that these models lack the sort\nof sentential, compositional representations assumed in more\ntraditional (or “language of thought”) models. Rather, it\nis that in these networks there are no causally distinct structures\nthat stand for specific states of affairs. Consequently, there do not\nappear to be any structures in these networks that might serve as\ncandidates for beliefs and other propositional attitudes. This is\nnoteworthy since many critics of eliminativism claim it is virtually\nimpossible to imagine what a psychological theory would look like that\ndoesn’t invoke propositional attitudes to explain cognition\n(Hannan, 1993). If Ramsey, Stich and Garon are right, certain\nconnectionist models may, for the first time, provide us with a\nplausible account of cognition that supports the denial of belief-like\nstates. More recently, Ramsey (2007) has argued that this earlier\nargument does not go far enough, insisting that connectionist models\nof this sort not only fail to invoke inner representations that are\nsufficiently similar to the posits of folk psychology, but that they\ndon’t actually invoke inner representational states at all. \nRamsey, Stich and Garon’s argument assumes that in highly\ndistributed networks, it is impossible to specify the semantic content\nof elements of the network that are causally responsible for various\ncognitive episodes. Some have responded to their argument by\nsuggesting that, with highly sophisticated forms of analysis, it\nactually is possible to pick out causally relevant pieces of stored\ninformation (Forster and Saidel, 1994). Others have argued that, like\nthe Churchlands, Ramsey, Stich and Garon have offered a mistaken\ninterpretation of folk psychology, suggesting it requires far less in\nthe way of explicit, discrete structures than they suggest (Dennett,\n1991; Heil, 1991). This is a common criticism of eliminative\nmaterialism, and we will look at it more closely in Section 4.3. \nAnother development in cognitive science that has pushed some people\nin the direction of eliminativism is the attempt to understand\ncognitive systems as neither classical nor connectionist computational\ndevices, but rather as dynamic systems, described using the\nmathematical framework of dynamic systems theory (Beer, 2000; van\nGelder, 1992; Port and van Gelder, 1995). This approach is often\nconjoined with some version of embodied cognition, as both place a\nstrong emphasis on the way cognitive agents move about and interact\nwith their environment. While neither the dynamic nor the embodied\napproaches are inherently anti-representational in nature, at least\nsome authors have employed them to develop accounts of cognitive\nprocesses that abandon inner representational states altogether. For\nexample, Anthony Chemero has promoted what he calls radical\nembodied cognitive science (Chemero, 2009). This theoretical\nframework treats the cognitive agent and environment as a complex\ncoupled system best explained by a mix of dynamics and James\nGibson’s ecological theory of perception (Gibson, 1950). Chemero\nexplicitly endorses eliminativism by rejecting the traditional\nassumption that agents solve problems and navigate through the world\nby consulting mental representations. He thus joins others in the\ncognitive science community, like artificial intelligence researcher\nRodney Brooks (Brooks, 1991), who have tried to account for cognition\nwithout invoking representational entities. Of course, it is too early\nto know how successful these non-representational approaches will\nultimately be, and many defenders of representationalism argue that\nthese efforts are not likely to account for more sophisticated\nrepresentation-hungry tasks like planning (Clark and\nToribio, 1994). \nA related theoretical development in the philosophy of cognitive\nscience that also pushes a strong anti-representational perspective,\nat least for basic cognitive states, and that has its roots in the\nembodied, embedded tradition is radical enactivism. Authors\nlike Daniel Hutto and Erik Myin reject the traditional\ninformation-processing outlook and insist that whey they call the\n“hard problem of content”— the problem of providing\na naturalistic account of the semantic properties of representational\ncontent (as opposed to mere co-variation) — is probably\nunsolvable for most inner states commonly thought as mental\nrepresentations (Hutto and Myin, 2012). Thus, Hutto and Myin join\nother authors who have endorsed eliminativism about mental\nrepresentations by focusing upon the problematic nature of\ncontent. \nAlthough most discussions regarding eliminativism focus on the status\nof our notion of belief and other propositional attitudes, some\nphilosophers have endorsed eliminativist claims about the phenomenal\nor qualitative states of the mind (see the entry on\n qualia).\n For example, Daniel Dennett (1978) has argued that our concept of\n pain\n is fundamentally flawed because it includes essential properties,\nlike infallibility and intrinsic awfulness, that cannot co-exist in\nlight of a well-documented phenomenon know as “reactive\ndisassociation”. In certain conditions, drugs like morphine\ncause subjects to report that they are experiencing excruciating pain,\nbut that it is not unpleasant. It seems we are either wrong to think\nthat people cannot be mistaken about being in pain (wrong about\ninfallibility), or pain needn’t be inherently awful (wrong about\nintrinsic awfulness). Dennett suggests that part of the reason we may\nhave difficulty replicating pain in computational systems is because\nour concept is so defective that it picks out nothing real. A similar\nview about pain has been offered by Valerie Hardcastle (1999).\nHardcastle argues that the neurological basis for pain sensations is\nso complex that no one thing answers to our folk conception. However,\ndespite her own characterication of pain as a “myth”,\nHardcastle’s arguments appear to be aimed not at showing that\npain is unreal, but rather that it is actually a more complicated\nphenomenon than suggested by our folk conception. \nIn another well-known article, “Quining Qualia” (1988),\nDennett challenges not just our conception of pain, but all of our\ndifferent notions of qualitative states. His argument focuses on the\napparently essential features of qualia, including their inherent\nsubjectivity and their private nature. Dennett discusses several\ncases—both actual and imaginary—to expose ways in which\nthese ordinary intuitions about qualia pull apart. In so doing,\nDennett suggests our qualia concepts are fundamentally confused and\nfail to correspond with the actual inner workings of our cognitive\nsystem. \nSome writers have suggested an eliminativist outlook not just with\nregard to particular states of consciousness, but with regard to\nphenomenal consciousness itself. For example, Georges Rey (1983, 1988)\nhas argued that if we look at the various neurological or cognitive\ntheories of what consciousness might amount to, such as internal\nmonitoring or the possession of second-order representational states,\nit seems easy to imagine all of these features incorporated in a\ncomputational device that lacks anything we intuitively think of as\n“real” or robust consciousness. Rey suggests that the\nfailure of these accounts to capture our ordinary notion of\nconsciousness may be because the latter corresponds with no actual\nprocess or phenomenon; the “inner light” we associate with\nconsciousness may be nothing more than a remnant of misguided\nCartesian intuitions (see also Wilkes, 1988; 1995 and Irvine and\nSprevak, forthcoming). \nA somewhat similar outlook has been proposed by Keith Frankish and\nothers, and is commonly referred to as “Illusionism” about\nconsciousness, a label designed to help indicate why it seems\nto us that phenomenal consciousness is real (Frankish, 2016, 2017).\nIllusionism is motivated in part by broader theoretical\nconsiderations, such as the problematic nature of consciousness from\nthe standpoint of physicalism and the observation that even reductive\naccounts of phenomenal experience typically suggest some sort of\nmisapprehension of what is really going on. Illusionism claims that\nintrospection involves something analogous to ordinary sensory\nillusions; just as our perceptual systems can yield states that\nradically misrepresent the nature of the outer world, so too,\nintrospection yields representations that substantially misrepresent\nthe actual nature of our inner experience. In particular,\nintrospection represents experiential states as having phenomenal\nproperties—the infamous and deeply problematic\nwhat-it-is-likeness of our qualitative mental states. Illusionists\nclaim that these phenomenal properties do not exist, making them\neliminativists about phenomenal consciousness. What is real are\nquasi-phenomenal properties—the non-phenomenal properties of\ninner states that are detected by introspection and misrepresented\nas phenomenal. \nAn obvious challenge for such a view is explaining how we can\nexperience something as having feature X without such as\nexperience actually involving the real experience of X. It\ncould be argued that even if the what-it-is-likeness is a feature of\nhow we introspectively represent certain mental states, it would\nnevertheless be a real aspect of introspection—a feature that is\nperhaps relocated, but not removed. Famously, the illusion/reality gap\nseems to collapse when it comes to our inner experiences; as Searle\nputs it, “where conscoiusness is concerned the existence of\nthe appearance is the reality” (Searle, 1997, p.122,\nitalics in original). Frankish insists that we can introspectively\nrepresent ourselves as having a certain type of experience without\nactually having that type of experience: “...when we think we\nare having a greenish experience we are in fact merely misrepresenting\nourselves as having one” (Frankish, 2016, p. 33). Illusionism\nthereby forces us to reconsider the sort of access we have to our own\nexperiential states. \nLike any theory that challenges our fundamental understanding of\nthings, eliminative materialism has been subjected to a variety of\ncriticisms. Here, I’ll discuss four that have received\nconsiderable attention in recent years. \nMany writers have argued that eliminative materialism is in some sense\nself-refuting (Baker, 1987; Boghossian, 1990, 1991; Reppert, 1992). A\ncommon way this charge is made is to insist that a capacity or\nactivity that is somehow invoked by the eliminativist is itself\nsomething that requires the existence of beliefs. One popular\ncandidate for this activity is the making of an assertion. The critic\ninsists that to assert something one must believe it. Hence, for\neliminative materialism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist\nherself must believe that it is true. But if the eliminativist has\nsuch a belief, then there are beliefs and eliminativism is thereby\nproven false. \nEliminativists often respond to this objection by first noting that\nthe bare thesis that there are no beliefs is not itself contradictory\nor conceptually incoherent. So properly understood, the complaint is\nnot that eliminative materialism (qua-proposition) is self-refuting.\nRather, it is that the eliminativist herself is doing something that\ndisconfirms her own thesis. In the above example, the disconfirming\nact is the making of an assertion, as it is alleged by the critic that\nwe must believe anything we assert with public language. However, this\nlast claim is precisely the sort of folk-psychological assumption that\nthe eliminative materialist is suggesting we should abandon. According\nto eliminative materialism, all of the various capacities that we now\nexplain by appealing to beliefs do not actually involve beliefs at\nall. So the eliminativist will hold that the self-refutation critics\nbeg the question against eliminative materialism. To run this sort of\nobjection, the critic endorses some principle about the necessity of\nbeliefs which itself presupposes that eliminative materialism must be\nfalse (P. S. Churchland, 1986; Cling, 1989; Devitt, 1990; Ramsey,\n1991). \nA more sophisticated version of the self-refutation ojection has been\noffered by Paul Boghossian with regard to eliminativist arguments\nbased on the content of psychological states. Boghossian maintains\nthat arguments for irrealism about the content of propositional\nattitudes work just as well in support of irrealism about all forms of\ncontent, including the content of ordinary linguistic expressions.\nMoreover, he argues that different forms of irrealism about linguistic\ncontent presuppose robust semantic notions, such as realist\nconceptions of truth and reference. This leads to the incoherent\nposition that, for example, there are no truth conditions and yet\ncertain sentences (or beliefs) about content are false (Boghossian,\n1990, 1991). In response, Michael Devitt and Georges Rey argue that\nBoghossian’s argument, despite its sophistication, nevertheless\nbegs the question by ascribing to the eliminativist some version of\ntruth-conditional semantics, whereas many eliminativists would reject\nsuch a view of linguistic expressions. While eliminativists would need\nto construct some sort of non-truth-conditional semantics, Devitt and\nRey argue that the challenge of such a project reveals only that\neliminativism is implausible, not that it is, as Boghossian claims,\nincoherent (Devitt, 1990; Devitt and Rey, 1991). \nIn section 2, we saw that eliminative materialism typically rests upon\na particular understanding of the nature of folk psychology. The next\ncriticism of eliminative materialism challenges the various\ncharacterizations of folk psychology provided by its\nadvocates—in particular the view set forth by advocates of the\ntheory-theory. This criticism comes from two very distinct traditions.\nThe first tradition is at least partly due to the writings of\nWittgenstein (1953) and Ryle (1949), and insists that (contra many\neliminativists) common sense psychology is not a quasi-scientific\ntheory used to explain or predict behavior, nor does it treat mental\nstates like beliefs as discrete inner causes of behavior (Bogdan,\n1991; Haldane, 1988; Hannan, 1993; Wilkes, 1993). What folk psychology\nactually does treat beliefs and desires as is much less clear in this\ntradition. One perspective (Dennett, 1987) is that propositional\nattitudes are actually dispositional states that we use to adopt a\ncertain heuristic stance toward rational agents. According to this\nview, our talk about mental states should be interpreted as talk about\nabstracta that, although real, are not candidates for straightforward\nreduction or elimination as the result of cognitive science research.\nMoreover, since beliefs and other mental states are used for so many\nthings besides the explanation of human behavior, it is far from clear\nthat our explanatory theories about inner workings of the mind/brain\nhave much relevance for their actual status. \nDefenders of eliminative materialism often point out that folk\ntheories typically have many functions beyond explaining and\npredicting, but that doesn’t alter their theoretical status nor\ninnoculate their posits from elimination (P.M. Churchland, 1993).\nMoreover, as we saw at the end of Section 2.1, while eliminativists\nhave typically framed the vulnerability of commonsense mental notions\nin terms of a false folk psychological theory, it is important to note\nthat, at least in principle, eliminativism does not require such an\nassumption. Indeed, eliminativism only requires two basic claims: 1)\nthat we share concepts of mental states that include some\nsort of requirements that any state or structure must meet to qualify\nas a mental state of that sort, and 2) the world is such that nothing\ncomes close to meeting those requirements. The first of these claims\nis not terribly controversial and while the requirements for beliefs\nmight come as part of an explanatory theory, they don’t need to.\nHence, one common criticism of eliminativism—that our invoking\nof beliefs and desires is not a theoretical or quasi-scientific\nendeavor—has very limited force. Cherubs, presumably, are not\npart of any sort of quasi-scientific theory, yet this alone is no\nreason to think they might exist. Even if it should turn out that we\ndo not (or do not simply) posit beliefs and other propositional\nattitudes as part of some sort of explanatory-predictive framework, it\nmay still turn out that there are no such things. \nThe second perspective criticizing the theory-theory is based on\nresearch in contemporary cognitive science, and stems from a different\nmodel of the nature of our explanatory and predictive practices\n(Gordon, 1986, 1992; Goldman, 1992). Known as the\n “simulation theory”,\n this alternative model holds that we predict and explain behavior not\nby using a theory, but by instead running an off-line simulation of\nhow we would act in a comparable situation. That is, according to this\npicture, we disconnect our own decision-making sub-system and then\nfeed it pretend beliefs and desires (and perhaps other relevant data)\nthat we assume the agent whose behavior we are trying to predict is\nlikely to possess. This allows us to generate both predictions and\nexplanations of others by simply employing cognitive machinery that we\nalready possess. In effect, the simulation theory claims that our\nreasoning about the minds and behavior of others is not significantly\ndifferent from putting ourselves in their shoes. Thus, no full-blown\ntheory of the mind is ever needed. Simulations theorists claim that,\ncontrary to the assumptions of eliminative materialism, no theory of\nthe mind exists that could one day prove false. \nBoth sides of this debate between the theory-theory and the simulation\ntheory have used empirical work from developmental psychology to\nsupport their case (Stich and Nichols, 1992; Gordon, 1992). For\nexample, theory-theorists have noted that developmental psychologists\nlike Henry Wellman and Alison Gopnik have used various findings to\nsuggest that children go through phases that are analogous to the\nphases one would go through when acquiring a theory (Gopnik and\nWellman, 1992). Moreover, children appear to ascribe beliefs to\nthemselves in the same way they ascribe beliefs to others.\nTheory-theorists have used considerations such as these to support\ntheir claim that our notion of belief is employed as the posit of a\nfolk theory rather than input to a simulation model. At the same time,\nsimulation theorists have employed the finding that 3-year-olds\nstruggle with false belief ascriptions to suggest that children are\nactually ascribing their own knowledge to others, something that might\nbe expected on the simulation account (Gordon, 1986). \nHowever the debate between simulation theorists and theory theorists\nturns out, or whether some sort of hybrid combination of the two\nproves correct, we should once again bear in mind the point made at\nthe end of Section 2.1. Since even the most ardent simulation theorist\nwill allow that we have mental concepts, it is doubtful that the\nsimulation perspective actually poses a significant threat to\neliminativism, and it seems possible for there to be a version of\neliminative materialism that could be reconstructed within the\nsimulation framework, even for beliefs and desires. For example, it is\nat least conceivable that the decision-making machinery that is taken\noff-line to simulate the reasoning of another person could take as\ninput cognitive states other than beliefs and desires, but that we\nsomehow mistakenly conceptualize as beliefs and desires. On\nthis admittedly speculative scenario, our ability to predict and\nexplain the behavior of others would be simulation-based, and yet our\nconception of how minds work would be so far off that an eliminativist\nverdict would be appropriate. \nEven among theory-theorists there is considerable disagreement about\nthe plausibility of eliminative materialism. A third criticism of\neliminative materialism is that it ignores the remarkable success of\nfolk psychology, success that suggests it offers a more accurate\naccount of mental processes than eliminativists appreciate. Apart from\nthe strong intuitive evidence that seems to reveal beliefs and\ndesires, we also enjoy a great deal of success when we use common\nsense psychology to predict the actions of other people. Many have\nnoted that this high degree of success provides us with something like\nan inference-to-the-best-explanation argument in favor of common sense\npsychology and against eliminativism. The best explanation for the\nsuccess we enjoy in explaining and predicting human and animal\nbehavior is that folk psychology is roughly true, and that there\nreally are beliefs (Kitcher, 1984; Fodor, 1987; Lahav, 1992). \nA common eliminativist response to this argument is to re-emphasize a\nlesson from the philosophy of science; namely, that any\ntheory—especially one that is as near and dear to us as folk\npsychology—can often appear successful even when it completely\nmisrepresents reality. History demonstrates that we often discount\nanomalies, ignore failures as insignificant, and generally attribute\nmore success to a popular theory than it deserves. Like the proponents\nof vitalism or phlogiston theory, we may be blind to the failings of\nfolk psychology until an alternative account is in hand (P. M.\nChurchland, 1981; P. S. Churchland, 1986). \nWhile many defenders of folk psychology insist that folk psychology is\nexplanatorily strong, some defenders have gone in the opposite\ndirection, arguing that it is committed to far less than\neliminativists have typically assumed (Horgan, 1993; Horgan and\nGraham, 1991; Jackson and Pettit, 1990). According to these writers,\nfolk psychology, while indeed a theory, is a relatively\n“austere” (i.e., ontologically non-committal) theory, and\nrequires very little for vindication. Consequently, these authors\nconclude that when properly described, folk psychology can be seen as\ncompatible with a very wide range of neuroscientific or cognitive\ndevelopments, making eliminative materialism possible but\nunlikely. \nOf course, folk theories are like any theories in that they can be\npartly right and partly wrong. Even writers who are sympathetic to\neliminativism, such as John Bickle and Patricia Churchland (Bickle,\n1992; P.M. Churchland, 1994) point out that the history of science is\nfilled with with cases where the conceptual machinery of a flawed\ntheory is neither smoothly carried over to a new theory, nor fully\neliminated. Instead, it is substantially modified and reworked, with\nperhaps only some of its posits being dropped altogether. Thus,\nfull-blown eliminative materialism and complete reductionism are\nend-points on a continuum with many possibilities falling somewhere in\nbetween. The term “revisionary materialism” is often\ninvoked to denote the view that the theoretical framework of folk\npsychology will only be eliminated to a degree, and that various\ndimensions of our commensense conception of the mind will be at least\npartly vindicated. \nOne final argument against eliminative materialism comes from the\nrecent writings of a former supporter, Stephen Stich (1991, 1996).\nStich’s argument is somewhat complex, but it can be presented in\noutline form here. Earlier we saw that eliminative materialism is\ncommitted to the claim that the posits of folk psychology fail to\nrefer to anything. But as Stich points out, just what this claim\namounts to is far from clear. For example, we might think that\nreference failure occurs as the result of some degree of mismatch\nbetween reality and the theory in which the posit is embedded. But\nthere is no clear consensus on how much of a mismatch is necessary\nbefore we can say a given posit doesn’t exist. Stich offers a\nvariety of reasons for thinking that there are fundamental\ndifficulties that will plague any attempt to provide principled\ncriteria for distinguishing cases of reference success from cases of\nreference failure. Consequently, the question of whether a theory\nchange should be ontologically conservative or radical has no clear\nanswer. Because eliminative materialism rests on the assumption that\nfolk psychology should be replaced in a way that is ontologically\nradical, Stich’s account pulls the rug out from under the\neliminativist. Of course, this is a problem for the folk psychology\nrealist as well as the eliminativist, since Stich’s skeptical\nargument challenges our grounds for distinguishing the two. \nEliminative materialism entails unsettling consequences not just about\nour conception of the mind, but also about the nature of morality,\naction, social and legal conventions, and practically every other\naspect of human activity. As Jerry Fodor puts it, “if\ncommonsense psychology were to collapse, that would be, beyond\ncomparison, the greatest intellectual catastrophe in the history of\nour species …” (1987, p. xii). Thus, eliminative\nmaterialism has stimulated various projects partly designed to\nvindicate ordinary mental states and establish their respectability in\na sophisticated account of the mind. For example, several projects\npursued by philosophers in recent years have attempted to provide a\nreductive account of the semantic content of propositional attitudes\nthat is entirely naturalistic (i.e., an account that only appeals to\nstraightforward causal-physical relations and properties). Much of the\nimpetus for these projects stems in part from the recognition that\neliminative materialism cannot be as easily dismissed as earlier\nwriters, like C. D. Broad, had originally assumed. \nOf course, some claim that these concerns are quite premature, given\nthe promissory nature of eliminative materialism. After all, a pivotal\ncomponent of the eliminativist perspective is the idea that the\ncorrect theory of the mind, once discovered by psychologists, will not\nreveal a system or structure that includes anything like common-sense\nmental states. Thus, for eliminative materialism to get off the\nground, we need to assume that scientific psychology is going to turn\nout a certain way. But why suppose that before scientific psychology\ngets there? What is the point of drawing such a drastic conclusion\nabout the nature of mentality, when a central premise needed for that\nconclusion is a long ways from being known? \nOne response an eliminativist might offer here would be to consider\nthe broader theoretical roles eliminative materialism can play in our\nquest for a successful theory of the mind. Various writers have\nstipulated necessary conditions that any theory of the mind must meet,\nand on some accounts these conditions include the explication of\nvarious mental states as understood by common sense. According to this\nview, if a theory doesn’t include states that correspond with\nbeliefs, or provide us with some sort of account of the nature of\nconsciousness, then it needn’t be taken seriously as a complete\naccount of “real” mental phenomena. One virtue of\neliminative materialism is that it liberates our theorizing from this\nrestrictive perspective. Thus, the relationship between eliminative\nmaterialism and science may be more reciprocal than many have assumed.\nWhile it is true that eliminative materialism depends upon the\ndevelopment of a radical scientific theory of the mind, radical\ntheorizing about the mind may itself rest upon our taking seriously\nthe possibility that our common sense perspective may be profoundly\nmistaken.","contact.mail":"wramsey@unlv.edu","contact.domain":"unlv.edu"}]
