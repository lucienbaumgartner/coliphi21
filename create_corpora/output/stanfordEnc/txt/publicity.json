This entry\nwill mostly be dealing with the latter meaning. In everyday life,\ncalls for more transparency or openness in political and economic life\nmay seem rather uncontroversial. Still, the precise reasons why and\nthe extent to which publicity should be guaranteed are not\nstraightforward. Moral and political philosophers, along with social\nscientists, have until now provided us with only fragmentary elements\nin this respect. We shall review here what has been gathered so\nfar.\n\n\nThis entry unfolds in three parts. We start with hypothetical\npublicity, and singularly with Immanuel Kant’s publicity test,\ncontrasting his position with the one of Henry Sidgwick and looking\nboth at the justification and implications of the Kantian test\n (§1).\n More precisely, our focus in this first part will be on two\nquestions. First, what (if anything) justifies the importance of this\ntest? Second,what are its implications for moral and political\nphilosophy in general and for actual publicity in particular?\nHypothetical publicity may appear to some readers as the only\ngenuinely philosophical development on publicity, which justifies \nwhy we will examine it first.\n\n\nWe then look more closely at actual publicity, focusing on\ntwo moments of our political life (voting and deliberation) and two of\nits actors (citizens and representatives)\n (§2).\n Authors such as John Stuart Mill and Jon Elster will be our guides\nhere. Secret ballots have not always been the rule. Hence, shifting\naway from open vote gave rise to fascinating debates, especially in\nthe British 19th century. We then move to the analysis of reasons for\nand against public deliberation, Elster’s argument from the civilizing\nforce of hypocrisy being our starting point here. At least two central\nquestions should be kept in mind while reading this second part of the\nentry. First, are the arguments in favor of open/secret voting\ndifferent from those in favor of open/secret deliberation? Second, how\nmuch weight should be attached, in philosophical arguments about\npublicity, to empirical claims, and have philosophers paid enough\nattention to relevant empirical complexities?\n\n\nIn the third section, we introduce the reader to a few\ndimensions of the concept of publicity as it is used in John Rawls’s\nwork. As for many other questions, Rawls has revived the topic. The\nideas of “public rules” and “public reason”\nhave now become important in political philosophy. We shall briefly\npresent and discuss them.\n\nKant’s hypothetical publicity test appears in the second appendix to\nhis Zum ewigen Frieden (Perpetual Peace) (1795\n[1923:  381]).[1]\n He writes: \nAll actions relating to the right of other human beings are wrong if\ntheir maxim is incompatible with\n publicity.[2] \nThere are at least three interesting issues here. First, what is the\njustification for such a publicity test? Is there any reason to\nsuspect any connection between the ability to stand publicity and the\nrightness of a position? Second, which maxims of action and, more\ngenerally, which moral theories are likely not to pass such a\npublicity test? Third, what does this test entail with regard to the\nneed for actual publicity? Answering each of these questions\nrequires some degree of hermeneutics, especially when it comes to\ninferring the meaning of words such as “incompatible” and\n“publicity”. \nSome interpretation issues can be quickly disposed of. First,\nthe Kantian test applies specifically to political maxims and\nis the equivalent in that sphere of the more general categorical\n imperative.[3]\n This is why Kant refers to it as the “transcendental principle\nof the publicity of public law” (1795 [1923: 382]).\nSecond, it is plausible to read the Kantian test as a merely\nnegative one: whether a maxim would pass the test only means\nthat one necessary condition for its rightness has been satisfied. It\nwill therefore not be sufficient to guarantee that all successful\nmaxims are right. This is suggested both by the expression\n“wrong if” and by Kant’s explicit statement: “this\nprinciple is, furthermore, only negative, i.e., it only serves for the\nrecognition of what is not just to\n others”.[4]\n Such a reading entails a difference with the categorical imperative\ninsofar as the latter is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor permissibility. Third, it is also clear from the\nprinciple that neither an action itself, nor the actual motives\nunderlying such an action (Davis 1991: 418) need to be able to be\nsuccessfully disclosed in order to guarantee that they are not wrong.\nThe test only applies to the maxim of such an action, which\nalready indicates one respect in which such a hypothetical test could\npossibly leave room for actual secrecy. This is true notwithstanding\nthe plausibility of Luban’s following claim:  \nthe best way to make sure that officials formulate policies that\ncould withstand publicity is by increasing the likelihood\nthat policies will withstand publicity (Luban 1996:\n 157).[5] \nNow, what does Kant mean when he uses the word\n“publicity”? Were we to face an actual public, we\ncould give it a more or less demanding interpretation, ranging from\nmerely general knowledge (each of us actually knows or is able to\nknow) or mutual knowledge (each of us knows, and knows that the others\nknow), to critical debate where what we know is being actively\ndiscussed (Luban 1996: 169–172). The latter form of publicity,\nwhile seeming much richer and appealing, probably does not fit the\nKantian\n text.[6]\n It could itself be understood in two ways. Either, publicity would be\ntaken as a synonym of debateability, i.e., the fact that the\nmaxim be such as to be deemed minimally appropriate for public\ndiscussion, in which case the test would probably not exclude much.\nWere it alternatively to be taken as referring to the ability of a\nmaxim to pass the filter of actual public debate and be\naccepted by its participants, the test would then have a very\ncontingent outcome, depending on the real public we are facing. \nIn fact, we can try to ascertain whether publicity should be\nunderstood as general knowledge, mutual knowledge, or publicity as the\noutcome of public\n debate.[7]\n What matters much more however, in the context of understanding the\nnature of the Kantian test, is that Kant is referring to an ideal\nand rational public (Davis 1992:\n 180f.).[8]\n The test is thus hypothetical, not only because it does not\nnecessarily require actual publicity (as we shall see), but\nalso because any outcome of actual publicity would inevitably remain\nat best a rough approximation of what the test would lead us to with\nan ideal\n public.[9] \nWith this reference to an ideal and rational public in mind, we may\nthen proceed with the interpretation of the concept of\nincompatibility (Luban 1996: 172–176; Davis 1992: 170).\nThe two notions should be understood jointly as Kant’s following quote\ndemonstrates:  \nA maxim which I cannot divulge without defeating my own purpose must\nbe kept secret if it is to succeed; and, if I cannot publicly avow it\nwithout inevitably exciting universal opposition to my project, the\nnecessary and universal opposition which can be foreseen a priori is\ndue only to the injustice with which the maxim threatens everyone\n(1795 [1924: 381]).  \nThe idea of necessary opposition present here can hardly make\nsense if it is not used with reference to an ideal public.\nNow, in order to give substance to what such an incompatibility could\nmean more precisely, let us briefly turn to Sidgwick’s views on covert\nutilitarianism before coming back to Kant. \nAs we shall see in\n Section 2,\n classical utilitarians such as Bentham and especially John S. Mill\nwere rather sympathetic to the idea of publicity. Still, it is also\namong utilitarians that we find one of the strongest principled\ndefenses of secrecy. Sidgwick defends the idea that it may be\nnecessary for utilitarianism to go under cover, and that this does not\nhave to be considered unjust. In his Methods of Ethics\n(1874), he writes: \n[…] on Utilitarian principles, it may be right to do and\nprivately recommend, under certain circumstances, what it would not be\nright to advocate openly; it may be right to teach openly to one set\nof persons what it would be wrong to teach to others; it may be\nconceivably right to do, if it can be done with comparative secrecy,\nwhat it would be wrong to do in the face of the world; and even, if\nperfect secrecy can be reasonably expected, what it would be wrong to\nrecommend by private advice or example […]. Thus the\nUtilitarian conclusion, carefully stated, would seem to be this; that\nthe opinion that secrecy may render an action right which would not\notherwise be so should itself be kept comparatively secret; and\nsimilarly it seems expedient that the doctrine that esoteric morality\nis expedient should itself be kept esoteric. Or if this concealment be\ndifficult to maintain, it may be desirable that Common Sense should\nrepudiate the doctrines which it is expedient to confine to an\nenlightened few. And thus a Utilitarian may reasonably desire, on\nUtilitarian principles, that some of his conclusions should be\nrejected by mankind generally; or even that the vulgar should keep\naloof from his system as a whole, in so far as the inevitable\nindefiniteness and complexity of its calculations render it likely to\nlead to bad results in their hands. (Sidgwick 1874 [1893:\n487–489]) \nAs in the Kantian case, Sidgwick not only deals with secret actions,\nbut with the secrecy of doctrines underlying such actions. Two of his\npoints are worth stressing. First, the relative\nconfidentiality of a given practice or—more importantly for\nus—of its maxim may not only be acceptable, but may even be a\nnecessary condition for the moral acceptability of such a\npractice—which is then the reverse of what Kant defends.\nUtilitarians may indeed consider some practices acceptable on the\ncondition that they remain marginal. And keeping such practices\nconfidential may be required for them not to spread around. Secrecy\nwould thus not only be allowed in this case. It would also be\nrequired. Second, there is a doctrine of\nmeta-secrecy at play as well, as Sidgwick’s argument applies\non top of actions to both maxims and meta-maxims. For him, the very\nidea that utilitarianism may allow and even require such covert\nactions should itself be kept relatively secret. As Luban puts it,\n \nnot only is it best if utilitarianism is not widely believed, but it\nis best if the very fact that the belief in utilitarianism has been\nsuppressed by the “enlightened few” is not widely\nbelieved. This is no longer Government House utilitarianism. It is\nconspiratorial utilitarianism (Luban 1996: 167).  \nWith the aim of identifying the exact implications of Kant’s and\nSidgwick’s views, let us look first more closely at the examples they\nactually provide in the course of their discussion. We shall begin\nwith Sidgwick who contrasts two cases: lying and\n celibacy.[10]\n The argument unfolds as follows. First, some types of\nbehavior are morally acceptable only provided that they remain (very)\nrestricted in\n scope.[11]\n If lying and celibacy were to become widely practiced, this would\nbecome a problem for utilitarians, according to Sidgwick. However, as\nlong as they remain marginally practiced to an extent that is\njustified on utilitarian grounds, they should be accepted.\nSecond, the question arises as to whether we should recognize\nall this publicly. Albeit not raising any difficulty in the case of\n celibacy,[12]\n publicly abandoning an absolute prohibition on lying might not be\nacceptable for utilitarians. Sidgwick writes: \n… assuming that general unveracity and general celibacy would\nboth be evils of the worst kind, we may still all regard it as\nlegitimate for men in general to remain celibate if they like, on\naccount of the strength of the natural sentiments prompting to\nmarriage, because the existence of these sentiments in ordinary human\nbeings is not affected by the universal recognition of the legitimacy\nof celibacy: but we cannot similarly all regard it as legitimate for\nmen to tell lies if they like, however strong the actually existing\nsentiment against lying may be, because as soon as this legitimacy is\ngenerally recognized the sentiment must be expected to decay and\nvanish (Sidgwick 1874 [1893: 486]). \nIt is worth emphasizing that Sidgwick clearly states that the need for\nsecrecy in the case of lying arises only because we are dealing with a\ngeneral public that is not constituted of only enlightened\nutilitarians. For Sidgwick considers that  \nif therefore we were all enlightened Utilitarians, it would be\nimpossible for any one to justify himself in making false statements\nwhile admitting it to be inexpedient for persons similarly conditioned\nto make them; as he would have no ground for believing that persons\nsimilarly conditioned would act differently from himself (Sidgwick\n1874 [1893: 486–487]; Piper 1978: 190f).  \nHowever, once we assume that we do not live in such an ideal\nworld populated by only enlightened utilitarians, we may want to\nkeep our complex moral rules secret in order to avoid\ncounterproductive consequences from an utilitarian perspective. Such\nconsequences may flow from various sources, such as a lack of time\n(e.g., people spending too much time finding out what the fair action\nwould be), misunderstandings possibly due to inadequate cognitive\nabilities (e.g., construing too broadly the class of cases in which\nlying would be acceptable from a utilitarian point of view, leading to\na spread of lying) or from distrust towards utilitarianism (e.g.,\nprinciples having a larger number of exceptions generating more doubts\nabout their cogency than elegant and exceptionless ones). \nNotice moreover the difference between the Sidgwickian argument, as\nillustrated by these two examples, and another utilitarian argument\nthat would justify “self-effacement”, i.e., the idea that\nto remain able to reach its goals, utilitarianism should go totally\nundercover. In other words, even enlightened utilitarians should stop\nbeing motivated by it. The argument is the following one: being\nmotivated by a utilitarian goal may impede our ability actually to\nreach this very goal. For instance, truly believing\nin the value of an artistic project independently of its ability to\nbring about happiness is more likely to generate welfare maximization\nthan being motivated towards this project out of a commitment to\nutilitarianism. In other words, a society committed to utilitarian\nprinciples may well turn out to be a less happy one than a society\nrelying on a given set of common sense principles. If this is true, we\nwould not only have an argument, for “Government House\nutilitarianism” (i.e., for utilitarian principles being relied\nupon only by the enlightened few), or for its stronger\n“meta-secrecy” version (of which a few enlightened would\nstill be aware). We would in fact have a case for something even more\nradical: the full self-effacement of utilitarianism for utilitarian\nreasons, i.e., even enlightened utilitarians would have to forget\nabout it if they are really committed\n utilitarians.[13] \nIn short, Sidgwick’s argument explicitly refers to a\nnon-ideal public (“society as actually\nconstituted”, “mankind in general” or “the\nvulgar”, as opposed to “an ideal community of enlightened\nUtilitarians”). And his view then has to do with a logic of\nconfinement (necessary to preserve the practice’s acceptability)\nrequiring in cases such as legitimate lying—as opposed to\ncelibacy—a certain degree of concealment given the fact that\nmany of us are not enlightened utilitarians. In other words, several\nof the reasons for secrecy that could underlie Sidgwick’s view on the\nlying case would not apply if we were all enlightened utilitarians. It\nis worth stressing however that, besides the\n“self-effacement” argument, Piper has argued that there\nmay be utilitarian grounds for secrecy in an ideal community\nof enlightened utilitarians as well. For knowing that in such a\nsociety, e.g., promises might not necessarily be\nkept—keeping them depending in each case on the outcome of a\nutilitarian calculus—will cause significant\ncoordination problems due to lack of predictability of other\npeople’s action. In the absence of secrecy, such an ideal society\nwould then become less efficient (Piper 1978: 198–199). \nInterestingly enough, while Kant’s test refers to an ideal public, the\nexamples he provides us with have to do—as in Sidgwick’s\ndiscussion—with a non-ideal public. As we shall see\nhowever, the mechanisms on which Kant’s argument rest differ from\nthose on which Sidgwick’s does. Two cases are being envisaged:\nrebellion and secession. Let us begin with the former. Kant asks:\n“Is rebellion a legitimate means for a people to employ in\nthrowing off the yoke of an alleged tyrant (non titulo, sed\nexercitio talis)?” (1795 [1923: 382]). The publicity test\nis used here in two ways. First, Kant claims that the open\nacknowledgment of the maxim of rebellion “would make its own\npurpose impossible” (1795 [1923: 382]). The argument is the\nfollowing. A person cannot be said to be the chief if the people may\nsometimes employ force against him (chief-with-absolute-power\nassumption). The establishment of a state requires a chief in this\nsense (no-state-without-chief assumption). Therefore publicizing the\nmaxim of rebellion would make the establishment of a state impossible.\nThis is valid however only if we accept the two assumptions mentioned\nabove. Second, the chief himself may publish the maxim\naccording to which rebellion will be sanctioned with death, “for\nwhen he knows he possesses irresistible power […] he need not\nfear vitiating his own purpose by publishing his maxims” (1795\n[1923: 383]). And it is because of such irresistibility that publishing\nthis maxim will not be self-frustrating. Again, Kant does not say\nwhether in a non-ideal situation in which nobody is in a position to\nhave absolute power, the fact that publishing the same maxim would\nfrustrate its very purpose would also mean that this is an\nunjust maxim. And what is also worth stressing is that such\npurpose frustration does not imply approval by an ideal and\nrational public. It merely derives from power relations. Hence, were\nwe to adopt the same line of argument, we could conclude that the\nstronger a despotic power, the larger the spectrum of maxims that may\npass the publicity test, a conclusion that Kant implicitly endorses in\nthe case of maxims of international\n law.[14] \nThe rebellion example illustrates the difficulty involved in moving\nfrom the hypothetical test to real life situations. What is at stake\nis our understanding of what “compatibility” could\nplausibly mean once we move from an ideal to a non-ideal public. The\ntension in Kant’s text is the following. As we keep reading the\ngeneral part of his argument, it all looks as if reference is made to\nthe universal acceptability of a maxim in the eyes of an ideal and\nrational public. The rebellion as well as the other examples he gives\nhowever (1795 [1923:  383–384]) all rely on a\n“self-frustration” (or counter-productivity) mechanism.\nThe latter may certainly have a direct connection with what it may be\nrational for the beneficiaries and victims of a maxim to do. Kant\nremains unclear however about the connection between such\npreoccupations and the just or unjust nature of a maxim. \nLet us then take the secession example: \n“If a smaller State is situated as to break up the territory of\na larger one, and continuous territory is necessary to the\npreservation of the larger, is the latter not justified in subjugating\nthe smaller and incorporating it?”. We easily see that the\ngreater power cannot afford to let this maxim become known; otherwise\nthe smaller states would very early unite, or other powers would\ndispute the prey, and thus publicity would render this maxim\nimpracticable. This is a sign that it is illegitimate. (1795 [1923:\n384]) \nAgain, Kant refers here to the risk that defense strategies of the\npotential losers of a maxim’s implementation may render the latter\nless efficacious, if not totally inefficacious. There are at least two\ndifficulties with this. First, in a real life context (e.g.,\nCuba or Chechnya type) in which the large state knows that other small\nor large states are unlikely to intervene in such situations,\npublicity would not make the maxim impracticable. Hence, the\nmaxim could in principle still be fair if we were to follow\nthe Kantian logic. Second (and conversely), take a domestic\nanalogy involving a state fighting a local mafia. Were the state to\nannounce in advance that it will run a special anti-mafia operation on\na given day, any benefits from a surprise intervention would vanish.\nIn other words, a maxim stated precisely enough to include the date of\nthe police intervention could not be publicized. All the local Mafiosi\nwould seek to hide themselves on that very day, hence making the\nintervention totally useless. This will not suffice to convince us\nhowever—even if we were ideal and rational observers—that\nthe planned police intervention (and the maxim on which it would be\ngrounded) is unjust. \nBoth Sidgwick’s and Kant’s examples rely on non-ideal publics.\nAdmittedly they do so in a slightly different manner. Kant’s ideal\npublic apparently sticks to the role of a judge whereas Sidgwick’s\nideal community of utilitarians is taken as a set of actors whose\nunderstanding of the rules is likely to affect their actual behavior.\nHowever, the reasons justifying secrecy in the examples each of them\ngives are of a very different nature. For Sidgwick’s illustrations do\nnot necessarily involve power relation problems. They rather imply\nmotivational or cognitive dimensions. What matters as well for our\npurposes is that whereas the examples given by Sidgwick properly\nillustrate the logic of his argument, those provided by Kant do not\nreally enlighten us further, for the idea of purpose frustration (or\n“self-frustration”) mobilized in the rebellion and\nsecession cases is certainly not applicable once we shift to an ideal\npublic. Therefore, we shall now rely on four examples distinct from\nthose of Kant in order to ascertain the meaning and implications that\ncould be attached to the Kantian test insofar as maxims that have to\ndo with actual publicity are concerned. \nLet us ask ourselves first whether Sidgwick’s covert utilitarianism\nwould be unable to pass Kant’s publicity test. As we have seen, this\ndoctrine states that we should keep secret the very idea that some\nprinciples and actions should remain secret. This means that, even at a\nvery high level of generality, there is no way we could submit any\nmaxim for assessment to the ideal public, unless such a maxim makes no\ndirect reference to the problem of publicity. What about the following\nmaxim however : “any means should be deemed appropriate if they\nserve the utilitarian ideal”? Utilitarians will claim that an\nideal public should at least consider utilitarianism a plausible\ndoctrine. And it is therefore unlikely that the Kantian test will lead\nto a “necessary and unanimous” rejection of this proposed\nhigher-order formulation of the maxim. Hence the test may be passed\nsuccessfully, without any discussion on the issue of publicity. Of\ncourse, one may find such a maxim totally unjust for other reasons.\nBut Kant himself does not seem to claim that his test should be seen\nas a sufficient test for justice anyway. \nOur second example comes from actual Freedom of Information (FoI)\nregimes. That a public authority may have to minimally justify each of\nits significant decisions will seem totally sound. In principle, this\nshould also hold each time a public authority denies access to a\ndocument requested by a citizen on the basis of his FoI right. The\ncitizen should know whether it is, e.g., on privacy, on trade secret\nor, on State security grounds that access is being denied to the\ndocument he wants to double-check. There are cases however in which\ndisclosing the exact reason why access to a document is denied would\nunavoidably entail the disclosure of the document’s very content. One\ncould deny access with no overt justification, implying that\ndisclosing the precise ground for denial would be equivalent\nto disclosing the document’s very content. Along the same lines, an\nauthority could even refuse to deny or confirm the very\nexistence of the requested document—which is known in US\nlaw as a Glomar\n response.[15] \nAgain, one may well propose a higher-order principle accounting for a\nGlomar type of response:  \nwhenever access to a document may be denied on a legitimate basis and\ndisclosing either the basis for denial or even the very existence of\nthe document would jeopardize the pursuit of this very goal, a\njustification for denial or even the confirmation of the document’s\n(non)-existence may be withheld.  \nSo long as the set of such legitimate bases for denial is publicly\ndiscussed and (procedural) checks are being put in place to make sure\nthat access is not denied on other grounds, there is no\nreason to believe that publicizing such a maxim will be\nself-frustrating in presence of a real public, nor that such a maxim\nshould be rejected by an ideal public. Admittedly, the Glomar doctrine\nembodies some extent of “meta-secrecy”. However, it does\nnot go as far as a meta-secrecy “à la Sidgwick”.\nFor the very possibility that a state may sometimes act on secret\ngrounds is not publicly denied, nor are the grounds for justifiable\nGlomar responses necessarily left outside the sphere of public\n discussion.[16] \nThird example. Suppose that the true goal of the judiciary were to\npromote peace and stability rather than justice. However, let us\nassume as well that letting people believe that the genuine goal of\nsuch institutions is justice would best guarantee peace, for decision\nacceptance would be enhanced accordingly if such decisions were\nperceived as just (Luban 1996: 160). In such a world, there is no\nquestion that peace would better be pursued by keeping it secret as\nthe true goal of judiciary. The maxim may be:  \nact in a way such that if peace is best pursued by letting people\nthink (wrongly) that it is in fact justice that is being pursued, you\nshould let people think so.  \nPublicizing such a maxim may be “self-frustrating” and\nwould therefore not pass the Kantian test. \nHowever, besides asking ourselves whether such self-frustratingness is\nwhat accounts for the possibly unjust nature of the maxim, we may\nprovide a higher order formulation of the maxim:  \nAct in a way such that if one legitimate goal is best pursued by\nletting people think (wrongly) that it is in fact another legitimate\ngoal that is being pursued, you should let people think so.  \nThis higher-order maxim’s publication is not self-frustrating\n(even in a case in which we assume that the legitimacy of each goal\nhas been examined in detail, along with the legitimacy of other\ngoals). Of course, this does not end the discussion since, in case we\nwere to grant priority to justice over peace, the maxim’s\nimplementation could still lead to injustice, which the Kantian test\ndoes not exclude anyway. \nLet us finally move to an example that deals again with real Freedom\nof Information (FoI) regimes. One of the surprises of such regimes is\nthat, as a matter of fact, their very existence remains rather\nconfidential in many countries. Citizens do not seem to exercise their\nright of access to state-detained documents as much as one might\nexpect. This could be regarded as unfortunate. One may as well\nconsider it necessary, however, at least if we find meaningful the\nidea of an optimal level of confidentiality of FoI regimes.\nThis optimal level would consist in some active citizens being\nmaximally aware of its existence, and all civil servants being as\nlittle aware of it as possible. For if (non-ideal) civil servants know\nthat they are potentially being watched, they may admittedly try to\nchange their behavior for the better. However, they may simultaneously\nwant to hide even further the more problematic aspects of their\nbehavior (e.g., through shifting from written to oral discussions). In\nother words, in order for the fundamental FoI right to be maximally\neffective, its existence and exercise may have to remain relatively\ncovert (or unequally known). \nWhat should an ideal public think about the following maxim then:\n“In order for a legitimate goal to be pursued, while the goal\nitself would be fully public (here: the accountability of public\nauthorities), while the social expectations of citizens towards civil\nservants would be fully transparent, some of the means enabling such\ncitizens to ensure the accountability of public authorities may remain\ncovert”? Not each and every such covert means is acceptable.\nHowever, the one consisting in a right to ask for a copy of\nadministrative documents may very well be so. Of course, publicizing a\nlower order version of this maxim may be self-frustrating, hence\nincapable of passing the Kantian test. But again, this does not seem\nto be sufficient to discard this lower order maxim as being unjust,\nnor does it mean that a higher-order translation of it (as suggested\nabove) would be unable to pass the Kantian test. \nThese four examples leave us with two important open questions on the\nKantian test. First, how should we assess the test’s importance if\nthe level of generality at which the maxim of an action should be\nphrased cannot be normatively fixed? As we have illustrated above, the\nlower the level of generality at which a maxim is phrased, the higher\nthe risk that its publicity would be self-frustrating, and vice versa\n(Luban 1996: 189–191). No doubt, the test would be\nover-exclusive if we were forced to phrase our maxims at a\nvery low level of generality. This is clear when we think about\nkeeping secret the date of a currency devaluation or of a police\nintervention to trap criminals, the location of a stock of weapons in\ntimes of peace or of the place where an unjustly threatened writer is\nbeing sheltered. Kant himself never suggests that all secret actions\nshould be ruled out by his test. The problem is that as long as we do\nnot have any indication as to the appropriate level of generality at\nwhich an action’s maxim should be tested, the opposite risk of\nunder-exclusiveness becomes hard to avoid as our four\nexamples above illustrate. Perhaps our expectations towards such a\ntest are too high however, as they often tend to be towards other\nhypothetical devices as well, such as the Rawlsian veil of ignorance\nor hypothetical social contracts. \nSecond, it is not entirely clear why self-frustratingness (or\npurpose-frustratingness) should be read as an indicator of injustice.\nIn other words, whenever the Kantian test bites, why would this tell\nus anything about the just or unjust nature of a maxim and the actions\nthat fall under\n it?[17]\n And answering this question would be even more crucial for those\nwho—contrary to us—view the publicity test as a necessary\nand sufficient condition for permissibility. What we need\nthen is an account of the “intrinsic connection” between\nself-frustratingness and injustice—in the same way as one may\nask why, for (neo-) contractarians there should be a significant\nconnection between (hypothetical) insurance and justice. Such an\naccount is however not provided by Kant who claims about the principle\nthat “like an axiom, it is indemonstrably certain” (1795\n[1923: 382]). One sound suggestion is Luban’s (Luban 1996: 191). Imagine\nthat making the maxim of my action public would frustrate my ability\nto reach this maxim’s very goal. This can be taken as a sign of\nthe injustice of this maxim only if the frustration-generating\nmechanism is at least in part based itself on morally justifiable\ngrounds. But if publicizing a doctrine generates distrust from a real\naudience merely because of people’s attraction for simplicity or\nnon-demandingness, the frustration flowing from such a distrust should\nhardly be considered relevant to the assessment of the maxim’s\n(in)justice. \nActual publicity can be looked at through the prism of hypothetical\npublicity. However, philosophers have been approaching the issue from\nother angles as well. Their arguments have mobilized both empirical\nassumptions and philosophical claims regarding the purpose of voting\nand political representation, the importance of participation and\ndeliberation, etc. Hereinafter, we will examine more closely arguments\nin favor or against actual publicity in the political arena. In order\nto do so, we will restrict ourselves to two modes of political action\n(vote and deliberation) and two types of actors (electors and\nrepresentatives). In so doing, we will consider two types of\nrelationships: horizontal ones (among voters or among\nrepresentatives) and vertical ones (between voters and\nrepresentatives). Notice already that the view one favors regarding\nthe function attached to one’s vote as a member of the electorate and\nto one’s activity as a representative will have an impact on the\nreasons why publicity may matter and the extent to which it does. \nBefore engaging in this philosophical discussion, let us clarify what\nthe arguments developed below may show for one significant practical\nevolution, i.e., the development of Freedom of Information (FoI)\nregimes in democratic countries during the second half of the 20th\n century.[18]\n Such regimes have been set up with the view of allowing citizens to\nparticipate more actively in public affairs, enabling them to have\naccess to the detail of most administrative documents in due\n time.[19]\n Hence, not only MPs but civil servants become more effectively\naccountable. This means that citizens are not forced simply to accept\npackage deals from their representatives at the time of elections.\nThey can question the practicalities of implementation at any\ntime. \nNot only does the enactment of FoI regimes provide opportunities for\nmultiple interactions between active citizens and state authorities, they also force us to weigh the relative importance of open government\nvis a vis other fundamental rights or the public interest in general.\nSpecific grounds for denying access to administrative documents\ninclude the protection of privacy, property rights (e.g., trade\nsecrets), secrecy easing the gathering of information from third\nparties (e.g., executive\n privilege[20]\n or medical secrecy), paternalistic justifications (e.g., in the case\nof technical documents that could be misinterpreted), state interests\n(e.g., in defense and terrorism matters or international\nnegotiations), and economic efficiency (e.g., in public procurement, the\ncontent of the offer made by competitors being only disclosed after\nthe final decision). Sometimes, such grounds for secrecy will justify\nstrict denial of access. On other occasions, the disclosure of\ninformation will be deferred (e.g., through declassification\nprocedures) or be selective (e.g., to some types of actors only). This\nvariety of potential justifications of secrecy and the diverse ways of\naccommodating the conflicting values constitute a largely unexplored\nterrain for applied political philosophy. Here, we will focus only on\ngeneral reasons to promote or restrict actual publicity. \nLet us look at voting first. We may begin with the view according to\nwhich the electoral process aims only at aggregating people’s\nindividual preferences regarding the type of decisions they consider\nin their own interest (rather than in the public interest). Under such\na view, there is no strong case for making sure that my fellow citizen\nbe able to know what my actual preferences are. This is especially\nsignificant when it comes to direct democracy (e.g., referendum).\nHowever, in cases involving representation, there may still be good\nreasons under this view of democracy, for representatives to know\nwhich type of electors exactly they are representing, hence for open\nballots. In other words, even under an “aggregation of private\ninterests” view of democracy, there may be a case for open\nballots. This case will have nothing to do with the need for fellow\nvoters to know about their neighbor’s actual preferences, though. Only\ntheir representatives need to know about them. \nLet us now move to a different conception of democracy, the one\nadvocated by John Stuart Mill: \nIn any political election, even by universal suffrage (and still more\nobviously in the case of a restricted suffrage), the voter is under an\nabsolute moral obligation to consider the interest of the public, not\nhis private advantage, and give his vote, to the best of his judgment,\nexactly as he would be bound to do if he were the sole voter, and the\nelection depended upon him alone. This being admitted, it is at least\na prima facie consequence that the duty of voting, like any\nother public duty, should be performed under the eye and criticism of\nthe public; every one of whom has not only an interest in its\nperformance, but a good title to consider himself wronged if it is\nperformed otherwise than honestly and carefully. Undoubtedly neither\nthis nor any other maxim of political morality is absolutely\ninviolable; it may be overruled by still more cogent considerations.\nBut its weight is such that the cases which admit of a departure from\nit must be of a strikingly exceptional character (1861 [1991:\n355]). \nJ.S. Mill later discusses whether such reasons to depart from\npublicity do hold—an issue to which we shall return. What\nmatters here however is that once we consider that voters are supposed\nto vote according to what they believe would promote the public\ninterest, rather than their own private\n interests,[21]\n the case for publicity is reversed. On the one hand, if we can\nassociate to such a conception of voting one of representation\naccording to which representatives are supposed to defend the public\ninterest rather than the class interests of their identifiable\n electors,[22]\n the case for vertical publicity weakens. For knowing who their\nelectors actually are may induce MPs to stick to a defense of their\nactual electors rather than to promote the public interest at large.\nOn the other hand, the very act of taking part in an election acquires\na non-private dimension, such that we should consider ourselves\naccountable towards our fellow citizens (horizontal accountability).\nAnd this view according to which we should regard ourselves as\nhorizontally accountable towards those who may be affected by the\nconsequences of our choices clearly supports the case against secret\nballots. For J.S. Mill, this is a very significant reason for open\nballots. In fact, he even stresses that, as electors, we should see\nourselves accountable not only towards fellow electors, but also to\nnon-electors whenever the franchise is not as universal as it\ncould be (which generates the risk of electors voting only to defend\ntheir class interests as\n voters).[23]\n The example from Mill’s times is the one of women, who were excluded\nfrom “manhood suffrage”. Present day illustrations could\nrefer to non-national residents excluded from the right to vote or to\nthose below the age of\n majority.[24] \nJohn Stuart Mill was not the first to write about vote secrecy.\nAuthors such as Cicero (III.15),\n Montesquieu,[25]\n Rousseau[26] and\n Tocqueville[27]\n had also expressed their views on the matter. And J.S. Mill’s\nintervention is in fact part of a lively debate that had been going on\nin England for several\n decades.[28]\n He writes: \nIt may, unquestionably, be the fact that if we attempt, by publicity,\nto make the voter responsible to the public for his vote, he will\npractically be made responsible for it to some powerful individual,\nwhose interest is more opposed to the general interest of the\ncommunity than that of the voter himself would be if, by the shield of\nsecrecy, he were released from responsibility altogether. When this is\nthe condition, in a high degree, of a large proportion of the voters,\nthe ballot may be the smaller evil. When the voters are slaves,\nanything may be tolerated which enables them to throw off the yoke.\nThe strongest case for the ballot is when the mischievous power of the\nFew over the Many is increasing […]. \nBut in the more advanced states of modern Europe, and especially in\nthis country, the power of coercing voters has declined and is\ndeclining; and bad voting is now less to be apprehended from the\ninfluences to which the voter is subject at the hands of others than\nfrom the sinister interests and discreditable feelings which belong to\nhimself, either individually or as a member of a class. To secure him\nagainst the first, at the cost of removing all restraint from the\nlast, would be to exchange a smaller and a diminishing evil for a\ngreater and increasing one […] (J.S. Mill, 1861 [1991:\n 355–357]).[29] \nBrennan & Pettit (1990) revived J.S. Mill’s argument, endorsing\nthe view that while we should not assume that people will generally\ntend to vote according to their private interest whenever voting is\nsecret, unveiling the vote would certainly encourage further the\npractice of voting in accordance with what one considers to be the\ncommon good (Brennan & Pettit 1990: 325–329). They argue as\nwell that the case for open vote is especially strong in pluralistic\nsocieties involving large\n electorates.[30] \nStill, J.S. Mill’s lesser evil type of justification for open votes\nhas been rejected in the past on at least three grounds.\nFirst, one could question the very purpose that J.S. Mill\nascribes to voting. Hence, some of the protagonists of the 19th\ncentury British debate criticized the view according to which voting\nshould be regarded as a trust rather than a\n right.[31]\n This entails, in contrast with J.S. Mill’s view, that ballot\nsecrecy is not even a lesser evil. It is no evil at all.\nSecond, one may disagree with Mill at the factual\nlevel rather than at the normative one. James Mill, his father,\nclearly agreed with his son on the purpose of voting, referring\nexplicitly on various occasions to the idea of a trust. In his long\nessay “On the Ballot”, he states that “The voter for\na member of Parliament has a trust placed in his hands, on the\ndischarge of which the highest interests of his country\n depend”.[32]\n However, James Mill considered—in opposition to his son’s\nview—that the negative consequences attached to the secret\nballot were not only less weighty than its advantages, but devoid of\nany weight at\n all.[33]\n This entails that for James Mill as well, introducing secrecy of vote\nwas not even a lesser evil reform. It did not involve any evil at all.\nThird , let us consider Bentham’s position. Although he does\nnot refer explicitly to the trust-based view of voting, he considers\nthat voters should be influenced by tutelary motives. For\nhim,  \nin judging whether a motive ought to be referred to the class of\nseductive or tutelary motives, it is necessary to\nexamine whether, in the case in question, it tends […] to\nfavour the greatest or the smallest number (Bentham 1843 [1999:\n 145]).[34] \nAfter balancing the pros and cons of publicity, Bentham concludes:\n \nThe system of secresy has therefore a useful tendency in those\ncircumstances in which publicity exposes the voter to the influence of\na particular interest opposed to the public interest. Secresy is\ntherefore in general suitable in elections.  \nIn contrast with James Mill, Bentham’s argument is of the lesser-evil\ntype. But contrary to J.S. Mill, it is a lesser-evil argument in favor\nof secrecy rather than\n publicity.[35] \nSuch developments may be dismissed as being of merely historical\ninterest. And indeed, except for Brennan & Pettit’s (1990) paper,\nthere is not much debate today anymore about the suitability of secret\nballot. Rather, the whole debate on secrecy seems to have shifted its\nfocus to parliamentary debate and to administrative activity (FoI).\nStill, there are at least three lessons to be learnt from the old\n“secret ballot” debate, over and above the fact that vote\nsecrecy should not be seen as entailing no costs at all.\nFirst, already at that time, there were attempts at\nenvisaging simultaneously the questions of vote secrecy in the case of\nelectors and in the case of\n representatives.[36]\n And the interesting fact is that we do not have today a clear theory\ntelling us why we should have secret ballots for electors and open\nvotes in plenary parliamentary sessions. Simply referring to the fact\nthat representatives are accountable to their electors (vertical\naccountability) in a sense in which electors are not to their fellow\ncitizens (horizontal accountability) seems insufficient in that\nrespect. Ceteris paribus, the importance of horizontal\naccountability, insofar as it emphasizes the need to minimally justify\nour decisions to those who may suffer from their consequences, could\nsuffice to justify openness. Moreover, it is probably also\ninsufficient to claim that the fact that representatives may lose\ntheir job as a result of electoral discontent is not as problematic as\nthe fact that electors could lose their job if their employer were to\nknow about who they voted for. This does not mean that differences are\nabsent. Ceteris paribus, a representative has more power for\nexample than a\n citizen.[37]\n What we need to ask ourselves is whether this is sufficient to\njustify a different of treatment between the two categories with\nregard to vote publicity. \nSecond, open vote in parliament may not only give room to\npressure from your actual electors, it may also lead to pressure from\nthose who did not actually vote for you or from well-organized lobbies\ndefending some specific interests. This is probably one of the\nconcerns today in many countries. Publicity allows the electors to use\nthe stick/threat of non-reelection in full knowledge of what a\nrepresentative actually did. Still, it allows as well other actors to\ndo so, who may neither be the representative’s actual electors, nor\nlobbies acting in the name of the general interest. The employers and\nlandowners may not pressure employees and landless people anymore.\nStill, lobbyists representing the former may still be pressuring the\nMPs elected by the latter, with comparable results. This indicates how\npressure made possible through publicity may force representatives to\ntake directions that do not fit with the view of the public interest\ndefended by those who elected them. Pressure is a double-edged sword.\nThis may call for at least mixed systems, to which we shall come back\nshortly. Perhaps this may even justify taking more seriously the\npossibility of vote anonymity in parliament, provided that the number\nof votes for and against each proposal be known anyway. \nFinally, one may consider that the only way of dealing with\nsuch issue will consist in obtaining empirical evidence on the\nrespective effects of secrecy and publicity and weighing them\n up.[38]\n More principled arguments could be developed however. Such principled\narguments could take at least two (non-exclusive) forms. According to\none strategy, even in a society where the level of coercion on voters\nis very weak on average, it is reasonable to assume that those who\nwill suffer most from such risk of coercion (given their higher\ndependence on others) are the least advantaged. There may thus be a\nmaximin case for secret ballots on such grounds, putting\npriority on the protection of the most vulnerable. The other strategy\nwould consist in stressing the fact that the extent to which\nintimidation and coercion on voters obtains in a given society may\nfluctuate, hence evolve at some point for the worse, in line with\npolitical or economic degradations, including good results of\nintimidating extreme right or left parties or a higher vulnerability\ndue to growing unemployment rates. A preventive approach\nwould thus consist in saying that once coercion would increase to an\nextent such that it would become worrying (provided that there are\nlevels of coercion that would not be worrying in the first place), it\nwould then be too late to switch back to secret vote. This could\njustify preserving vote secrecy all along (and possibly banning, e.g.,\nvoting via mail or the internet insofar as they do not guarantee\nsecrecy strictly enough), even when the risk of coercion or\nintimidation is currently\n negligible.[39] \nLet us now turn to the issue of public deliberation. Notice first that\nthe arguments for open ballots invoked above in the context of an\n“aggregation of private interests” view of voting, equally\njustify the publicity of debates taking place between\nrepresentatives. This may have to do with the mere need to\n“learn about each other”. In other words, in a system in\nwhich vertical accountability matters, it is essential both for\ncitizens to know exactly what their representatives think and do, and\nfor representatives to know more than once every four years how the\nelectorate reacts to their arguments and decisions. \nLearning about each other is one thing. Learning\nfrom each other (about facts, what to think or how to act) is\nanother,\n however.[40]\n Publicity is not supposed to allow only for citizens and their\nrepresentatives to act upon fixed preferences regarding their private\nor even the public interests. The interactions that publicity allows\nfor are also potentially rich in transformative power. Such a dynamic\nimpact can take various forms. Publicity of deliberations between\nrepresentatives may play an exemplary role for citizens (both\nprocedurally and substantively), as suggested for instance by Jeremy\nBentham, who writes that  \nthe order which reigns in the discussion of a political assembly, will\nform by imitation the national spirit. This order will be reproduced\nin clubs and inferior assemblies, in which the people will be pleased\nto find the regularity of which they have formed the idea from the\ngreater model (Bentham 1843 [1999:\n 31]).[41] \nSimilarly, we have seen that open ballots can force electors to\nrestrict themselves in public to positions that they would be able to\njustify to other fellow citizens. And this is true even when\ntheir fellow citizens are not especially educated, as J.S. Mill\nargued: \nThe notion is itself unfounded, that publicity, and the sense of being\nanswerable to the public, are of no use unless the public are\nqualified to form a sound judgment. It is a very superficial view of\nthe utility of public opinion to suppose that it does good only when\nit succeeds in enforcing a servile conformity to itself. To be under\nthe eyes of others—to have to defend oneself to others—is\nnever more important than to those who act in opposition to the\nopinion of others, for it obliges them to have sure ground of their\nown. Nothing has so steadying an influence as working against\npressure. Unless when under the temporary sway of passionate\nexcitement, no one will do that which he expects to be greatly blamed\nfor, unless from a preconceived and fixed purpose of his own; which is\nalways evidence of a thoughtful and deliberate character, and, except\nin radically bad men, generally proceeds from sincere and strong\npersonal convictions. Even the bare fact of having to give an account\nof their conduct is a powerful inducement to adhere to conduct of\nwhich at least some decent account can be given. If any one thinks\nthat the mere obligation of preserving decency is not a very\nconsiderable check on the abuse of power, he has never had his\nattention called to the conduct of those who do not feel under the\nnecessity of observing that restraint. Publicity is inappreciable,\neven when it does no more than prevent that which can by no\npossibility be plausibly defended—than compel deliberation, and\nforce every one to determine, before he acts, what he shall say if\ncalled to account for his actions (1861 [1991:\n 360–361])[42] \nNow, representatives can civilize their electorate through public\ndeliberation, as suggested by Bentham. And voters may well be\ncivilized by their not-necessarily-civilized fellow voters (and\nnon-voters) in case of open ballots, as J.S. Mill argued. Jon Elster\npresents still another view according to which the publicity of\ndeliberation would help citizens civilizing their\nrepresentatives. Hereinafter, we briefly elaborate on what Elster\nrefers to as “the civilizing force of hypocrisy”. The\ncentral passage is the following: \nGenerally speaking, the effect of an audience is to replace the\nlanguage of interest by the language of reason and to replace\nimpartial motives by passionate ones. The presence of a public makes\nit especially hard to appear motivated merely by self-interest. Even\nif one’s fellow assembly members would not be shocked, the audience\nwould be. In general, this civilizing force of hypocrisy is a\ndesirable effect of publicity. […] Publicity does not eliminate\nbase motives, but forces and induces speakers to hide them (Elster\n1998a: 111; Naurin 2003). \nElster’s idea can be presented in two steps. The first one is the\nfiltering step. The public is meant to hold normative expectations\nregarding what representatives are supposed to\n say.[43]\n One of these expectations is that any overt reference to mere\nself-interest in the course of justifying their position would be seen\nas\n unacceptable[44]—which\n leaves open the question whether a reference to the self-interest of\ntheir class of electors\n would.[45]\n Another expectation could be that representatives justify their\nposition through a reference to minimally general principles.\nFinally, there would also be a social norm favoring arguing over\n bargaining,[46]\n such that whenever the debate would have to take place in public,\ndeliberation oriented towards the force of the better argument would\nbe promoted. This will entail at the very least the need to disguise\novert threats as warnings (Elster 1998a: 103–104). We may\nmultiply the number of such expectations. Such normative expectations\nregarding acceptable discourse will act as a filter on what the\nrepresentatives are allowed to say. Notice that it is not hypocrisy as\nsuch that filters out the set of unacceptable speech elements.\nHowever, it allows the representative to engage into a discourse in\nwhich he does not necessarily believe. In other words, this\naccount does not necessarily presuppose a normative expectation among\nthe public that politicians ought to be\n sincere.[47]\n Actually, hypocrisy is rather an enabling factor (allowing for an\ninitial gap between what is said and thought) than a cleaning up\nfactor. \nDoes the argument presuppose that voters be on average more civilized\nthan their representatives? At least two types of answers can be\nprovided. First, there are reasons of principle to\ndoubt that representatives be on average wiser (or more\ncommitted to the common good) than their electorate. As Luban\nwrites, \n… the empirical validity of the publicity principle turns not\non whether the Many are ignorant or wrong-headed, but on whether their\nleaders are less ignorant or less wrong-headed. No doubt the Wise are\nfew; and the leaders are few; but it hardly follows that the leaders\nare wise. Before we reject the publicity principle because the leaders\nknow best, we must have reason to believe that the leaders know\nbetter. And to find that out, we must look carefully at the variety of\nmechanisms by which decision-making elites are actually selected. If\nactual selection mechanisms choose randomly between the Many and the\nWise, or affirmatively disfavor the Wise, then the foolishness of the\nmany is irrelevant: the Few in official positions have no reason to\nsuppose that their policy brainstorms are any less foolish (Luban\n1996: 193). \nSecond, the average level of civilization may be less\nrelevant than the presence of at least a minority of\ncivilized members. As J.S. Mill puts it, “[…] cases exist\n[…] in which almost the only restraint upon a majority of\nknaves consists in their involuntary respect for the opinion of an\nhonest minority” (1861 [1991: 362]). In line with this Millian\nview, were the average level of civilization among representatives\nhigher or equivalent to the one obtaining within the electorate,\npublicity could still increase in absolute terms the amount of\ncivilized persons attending the representative’s discourse, adding\ncivilized members of the public to those who are civilized in\nparliament. Hence, through such a sampling effect, if we\nagree with Mill that the mere presence of a civilized minority can\nmake some difference, a larger absolute size of such a minority might\nbe relevant. As for Elster, he explicitly relies more directly on a\nmultiplier effect, insisting that “a small group of\nimpartially minded individuals might induce many others to mimic their\nimpartiality out of self-interest” (Elster 1995: 249). And as\nElster points out, this is even more true whenever there is\nuncertainty as to who these impartially minded people are\n(Elster 1995: 248).  \nNow, here comes a second step in Elster’s argument (Elster 1986,\n§II). There is an additional normative expectation: once\nrepresentatives commit themselves in public to a given view, they are\nnot supposed to switch to another view unless they can justify such a\ndeparture (Elster 1998a: 104). As Elster puts it,  \npublic speaking is subject to a consistency constraint. Once a speaker\nhas adopted an impartial argument because it corresponds to his\ninterest or prejudice, he will be seen as opportunistic if he deviates\nfrom it when it ceases to serve his needs (Elster 1998a:\n 104).[48] \nCitizens may be more or less vigilant regarding compliance with such a\n“consistency through time” requirement. Still, it is\nlikely to have some weight. \nFurthermore, as representatives cannot publicly depart from the\nprincipled views they have expressed earlier, they may begin believing\nin what they say, even though they may not have been holding such\nviews at the time they began expressing\n them.[49]\n Hence, being forced to restrict oneself to publicly acceptable views\nmay turn out to influence what one eventually believes,\ninsofar as in order to reduce the dissonance between what one says and\nwhat one believes, one may come genuinely to believe what one is\nexpected to say. Civilizing people’s speech will eventually civilize\ntheir mind (and hopefully in turn their non-linguistic actions)\nand—so Elster claims—“on the average, […]\nyield more equitable outcomes” (Elster 1995: 251). What begins\nas a strategic use of a non-self-interested arguments ends up leading\nto preference change (Fearon 1998: 54).  \nNotice that Goodin has proposed an alternative account to the\ncognitive dissonance reduction one. For him, people do have a latent\nmoral sense and having to state arguments in public acts as a\nreminder of what they already agree with. They may not\nnecessarily have connected the issue at stake with the principles they\ndo endorse\n otherwise.[50]\n One possible way of contrasting Goodin’s alternative with the\ncognitive dissonance view is the following. What is at stake would be\nas much a matter of reducing dissonance between what one says and what\none genuinely believes, as one of reducing dissonance between two\nseparate beliefs one holds. \nHaving offered an account of Elster’s idea of the civilizing force of\nhypocrisy, there are at least two empirical questions to be asked.\nFirst, are Elster’s factual assumptions empirically plausible? Second,\nare there no other negative side effects related to publicity that\ncould outweigh the benefits identified by Elster? In the next section,\nwe provide elements that may be relevant to answering the latter\nquestion. Let us briefly address the first challenge here. Naurin\n(2004) provides interesting evidence in this respect. On the one hand,\nhe refers to a study by Joerges & Neyer (1997) that looks closely\nat European Union comitology committees. Their study indicates that\npublic-spirited deliberation can be present in such committees whose\nexistence is unknown to most people. This may seem reassuring as it\ncould suggest that publicity is not necessary to foster truly\ndeliberative behavior. However, on the other hand, Naurin refers to\nevidence from Eliasoph (1998: 7) suggesting in the case of activists\nthat, while in backroom conversations they tend to express themselves\nwith reference to justice and common good concerns, shifting to a\nfront stage context also increases their use of self-regarding\narguments. Naurin’s (2004) own empirical data illustrate a similar\ntrend in the case of industry lobbyists in the European Union context.\nIn other words, a forum-like type of behavior would already be present\nin the lobby corridor. Surprisingly enough, bringing lobbyists from\nthe backstage to the front stage would actually make things\nworse from the point of view of reducing reference to mere\nself-interest. One should admittedly be cautious in extrapolating such\n results.[51]\n Still, both Eliasoph and Naurin identify a phenomenon that actually\ngoes in the opposite direction of what Elster’s view implies. This is\nclearly a serious challenge to his theory. \nThe variety of effects of publicity on the nature of the deliberation\nprocess is clearly an understudied matter. We have already looked at\nsome impacts, asking ourselves whether publicity substitutes\npublic-interest-oriented to self-regarding arguments, and whether it\nleads to a shift from bargaining to deliberation. Here, leaving\nElster’s account aside for a moment, we go on with examining other\ndimensions of what can be referred to—in an admittedly vague\nmanner—as the quality of the debate. For one central problem\nwith publicity is that besides being possibly beneficial in some\nrespects, it may also modify the nature of the discussion in ways that\nare not desirable. One such negative side-effect, as\nidentified by James Madison in 1787 in the case of the American\nConstitutional Convention, is the following: \nHad the members committed themselves publicly at first, they would\nhave afterwards supposed consistency required them to maintain their\nground, whereas by secret discussion no man felt himself obliged to\nretain his opinions any longer than he was satisfied of their\npropriety and truth, and was open to the force of\n argument.[52] \nThe idea of sticking to a position and not being ready to depart from\nit despite the existence of good arguments can be a problem for at\nleast two\n reasons.[53]\n Consensus will be harder to reach because of it, which matters\nwhenever agreement can be reached only by consensus (be it in a\ndeliberation or in a bargaining type of context). More importantly, we\nmay be worried not so much about the lack of sincerity of the actors,\nbut certainly about the loss in debate\n spontaneity.[54]\n Unless the deliberating parties are able to try out ideas out of the\nblue with the risk of having to abandon them straightaway (trial and\nerror), to show\n hesitation,[55]\n to re-consider the issues again and again with a fresh eye, the\nactual deliberation may not be more than the juxtaposition of\npre-prepared statements with no actual interaction taking\n place.[56]\n For the public may view hesitation and trial and error as signs of a\nlack of commitment, which may disadvantage those representatives truly\ntaking part in the discussion, hence inhibiting them from adopting a\ngenuinely deliberative posture. And as Naurin puts it,  \n[…] if deliberation is about transforming preferences, and\npublicity forces you to know what you want and stand by your position,\nthen “public deliberation” is something of a contradiction\nin terms (Naurin 2003: 32).  \nWe value deliberation as a true living interaction with real\ntransformative power, there might then be a strong case for at least\nsome proportion of political deliberation taking place behind\nclosed-doors, despite the latter’s negative\n side-effects.[57] \nMeade & Stasavage (2008) document another way in which publicity\nmight negatively affect the quality of deliberation. They deal with\nthe specific case of central banks and whether minutes of board\nmeetings should be released. Based on empirical evidence, they show\nhow, under conditions of publicity, the fact that expert advisors may\nhave career concerns reduces the chances of dissent being expressed\nduring deliberation. Here, what is at stake is not whether one sticks\nto one’s own initial position (posture problem). Rather, it\nhas to do with whether one is ready to show disagreement with the\nposition taken by another expert who is highly regarded and\nhas spoken first (dissent\n problem).[58]\n Hence, publicity might generate disincentives both to openly changing\none’s mind and, in some contexts, to dissenting with other\n(authoritative) people’s views. \nChambers (2004) points at still another negative impact of publicity\non the quality of deliberation. Discussion behind closed doors will\nadmittedly tend to allow for the expression of particularistic (which\ndoes not necessarily mean “self-serving”) reasons that\nwould not pass the test of actual publicity. However, while making\ndeliberation public might force the deliberating parties both to\nprovide the best possible reasons in support of their claims\n(Socratic effect) and to provide public reasons (democratic\neffect) in the sense of reasons that should refer to the public\ninterest and be acceptable to a wide audience in a pluralistic\nsociety, one problem\n remains.[59]\n For publicity also tends as a matter of fact to favor reasons that\nare “plebiscitory” in the sense of shallow or\nmanipulative (Chambers 2004: 393). Moving from private,\nparticularistic reasons to truly public reasons may then often have an\nassociated price, i.e., shifting from profound (private) reasons to\nshallow (public) reasons. Admittedly, the reason why they are shallow\nmight have to do with the need for a common denominator (which could\nbe needed as well in a deliberation behind closed doors). However, it\nis plausible that it may also have to do with an attempt at pleasing\nthe public (populism). \nThese are just a few illustrations of possible negative side effects\nof bringing deliberation under the public eye. It may become less\nlively (in the sense of being a real interaction), leave room to less\ndissent in the presence of an authoritative member, and favor the more\nshallow types of arguments, no matter how rational and public they\nare. It matters to identify exactly which benefits and which negative\nside effects are attached to actual publicity and secrecy, and what\ntheir respective weight could be. It is true in this respect that the\nargument may be of a different nature or at least carry a different\nweight depending on whether one deals with voting or deliberation. For\ninstance, the importance of learning from each other (rather than\nsimply about each other) may provide a strong argument for public\ndeliberation without necessarily being sufficient to entail the need\nfor open ballots. \nOnce all normative and empirical dimensions have been carefully\nconsidered, one may want to adopt a firm standpoint regarding the need\nfor publicity or secrecy in deliberation and voting in general.\nHowever, we may also want to try to mix secrecy and publicity\nin ways that allow for more optimal schemes, providing us with the\nbest of both worlds. Let us illustrate this through pointing at two of\nsuch schemes. First, Bentham refers to a system obtaining in the\nPolish Permanent Council in the late 18th century by which an open\nvote was followed by a secret vote on the very same issue (Bentham\n1843 [1999: 147–148]). Second, Elster argues that a\nconstitution-making process  \nought to contain elements of both secrecy (committee discussion) and\npublicity (plenary assembly discussions). With total secrecy, partisan\ninterests and logrolling come to the forefront, whereas full publicity\nencourages grandstanding and rhetorical overbidding. Conversely,\nsecrecy allows for serious discussion, whereas publicity ensures that\nany deals struck are capable of withstanding the light of day (Elster\n1998a: 117).  \nOne can thus mix both publicity and secrecy in the case of voting\n(Bentham) or deliberation (Elster), through a succession of openness\nand secrecy\n (Bentham)[60]\n or secrecy and openness\n (Elster).[61]\n One could also envisage to mix public deliberation and secret vote\n(which is probably a correct description of what happens during\nelectoral periods in many democratic countries), or, conversely,\nsecret deliberation and public vote (which is what actually takes\nplace in parliamentary systems with secret commissions in which\nplenary debates take a purely formal dimension). Each of such mixes\nmay have specific properties that could be studied further. \nHaving looked at both hypothetical publicity and actual publicity, let\nus now turn to examine the place of publicity within the political\nphilosophy of John Rawls. We shall analyse two distinct conceptions of\npublicity that arise in his writings. The first relates to the\ndoctrine of public reason. The second relates to the doctrine\nof public rules. Though we begin with some remarks about\npublic reason, we shall focus predominantly on public rules, as this\nidea is less familiar. \nStated in a quite general way, the doctrine of public reason holds\nthat, when justifying the exercise of political power, we ought to\nappeal exclusively to reasons that all “citizens as free and\nequal may reasonably be expected to endorse in the light of principles\nand ideals acceptable to their common human reason” (Rawls 1996,\n137). So as to highlight their shared nature, we can call\nthese public reasons. \nIn contrast with public reasons, there are non-public\nreasons. These reasons are controversial, in the sense that they\nare not reasons that we can expect all reasonable citizens to accept.\nTheir possibility emerges from the fact of reasonable pluralism (Rawls\n1996: 36–39), which refers to the idea that, in any\nsociety in which basic rights are protected, citizens will inevitably\ndisagree about the worth of competing conceptions of the good life.\nThe doctrine of public reason states that, because certain reasons are\ncontroversial, we ought not to appeal to them when making the case for\nthe political legislation we support. In this respect, the doctrine\ncalls for a kind of justificatory restraint (Rawls\n1996:\n 447).[62] \nTo illustrate, let us consider the case of a Christian, who is opposed\nto abortion for religious reasons. The doctrine of public reason holds\nthat, even though this citizen may act on these reasons in her own\npersonal life, she ought not to appeal to her religious beliefs in\norder to oppose the legal right to abortion. This is because her\nChristian reasons are not ones that we can reasonably expect others to\nendorse. Instead, if she wishes to oppose the legislation, she must\noffer reasons that are shared by all reasonable citizens (Rawls\n1996: 243 n. 32). \nOne concern with the doctrine of public reason is that, by asking\ncitizens to set aside certain controversial reasons in political\ndecision-making, it invites them to misrepresent their beliefs in\nvarious ways. This is the Insincerity Objection. For example, the\nChristian who is prohibited from appealing to her religious beliefs in\norder to oppose the legal right to abortion may decide to offer an\nargument that she does not find persuasive, but that she hopes others\nwill, in order to advance her political agenda. This may be\nobjectionable for a number of reasons, including because it may reduce\nthe quality of political deliberation (Quong 2011:\nch. 9; Schwartzman 2011). \nA further concern is that the doctrine of public reason proves too\nmuch. This is because we disagree about almost all values, including\npolitical values. Even when we use political power in seemingly just\nways, such as in the name of equality of opportunity, say, we must\nappeal to controversial reasons that are not widely accepted. Does it\nfollow that we cannot reasonably expect citizens to endorse those\nreasons, and, if so, isn’t the doctrine of public reason too\nrestrictive? Or, despite such disagreement, can we still reasonably\nexpect their endorsement? If so, why can’t we also reasonably\nexpect citizens to endorse other controversial reasons, such as those that\nderive from religious beliefs? Proponents of the doctrine must answer\nthese questions by explaining why we may treat disagreements about\npolitical values differently from disagreements about conceptions of\nthe good life. For this reason, we can call it the Asymmetry Objection\n(Caney 1995; Fowler & Stemplowska 2015; Sandel 1994; Waldron\n1994). \nThe precise formulation of the doctrine of public reason is subject to\nfurther variation. Among other factors, it will depend upon (1) how we\ndiscriminate between the reasons that we can and cannot reasonably\nexpect others to endorse; (2) whether its demands apply\nbroadly to any matter of public concern or narrowly\nonly to the essentials of a political constitution (Kelly 2013; Quong\n2011: ch. 9); and (3) whether we acknowledge that there may be\nconditions under which the doctrine is defeated by other\nconsiderations, such concerns for religious salvation, say (Rawls\n1996: 152; Clayton & Stevens 2014). \nThough the arguments we discuss below provide partial answers to these\nquestions, we shall not explicitly discuss these issues here. Instead,\nour goal is to outline the various arguments in defence of the idea of\npublic reason. These arguments clarify the demands of public reason,\nas well as inform our later analysis of public rules. \nWe can distinguish three distinct justifications for the doctrine,\neach of which finds support within Rawls’s texts: \nThe Political Autonomy Argument begins with the claim that each\ncitizen has a weighty interest in being politically\nautonomous—that is, in freely identifying with the\nconstraints that she faces, such that she fully comprehends and\nendorses the justification of those constraints (Rawls 1996:\n 402).[63]\n Only by justifying the exercise of political power by appeal\nexclusively to public reasons can we protect citizens’ interest\nin political\n autonomy.[64]\n After all, what distinguishes public reasons from non-public reasons\nis that the former are ones that we can reasonably expect everyone to\nendorse and to act upon. \nOne objection to this argument comes from those who deny that citizens\nhave a weighty interest in being politically autonomous. This is\nbecause it is possible to justify the kind of justificatory restraint\nimposed by the doctrine of public reason only if this interest is\nsufficiently weighty. If the interest were not very\nweighty, or if there were no interest at all, then it is difficult to\nsee why we ought to exercise the kind of justificatory restraint that\nthe doctrine of public reason calls for, especially since it prevents\nus from appealing to a certain class of sound reasons (Raz 1986; Wall\n1998). \nThe second justification for the doctrine of public reason is the\nCivic Friendship Argument. On this view, we can justify the doctrine\nby appeal to its role in enabling citizens jointly to maintain just\ninstitutions, and thereby realise a form of civic friendship.\nPublic reason is central to this task since the joint pursuit\nof justice is possible only if citizens “affirm the same\npolitical conception of justice” and so “share one very\nbasic political end” (Rawls 1996: 202). \nPolitical autonomy and civic friendship are distinct ideals. Unlike\npolitical autonomy, civic friendship is an essentially common\ngood—its benefits cannot be enjoyed by an individual in\nisolation but can be enjoyed only with others. Only citizens who\nrelate to each other in a particular way—that is, as joint\npursuers of a shared conception of justice—can enjoy this kind\nof civic friendship (Rawls 1996: 204; Leland & Wietmarschen\n2017; Lister 2013; Ebels-Duggan 2010; Schwarzenbach 1996, 2005; Watson & Hartley 2018).\nElaborating upon the idea of essentially common goods, Rawls\nwrites, \nThat there should be such a political and social good is no more\nmysterious than that members of an orchestra, or players on a team, or\neven both teams in a game, should take pleasure and a certain (proper)\npride in a good performance, or in a play of the game, one that they\nwill want to remember (Rawls 1996: 204). \nThe success of the Civic Friendship Argument depends upon two claims.\nThe first is that it is not possible, or at least it is much more\ndifficult, for citizens to realise civic friendship in ways other than\nby upholding the doctrine of public reason. Some deny this claim,\ninstead maintaining that forms of democracy that do not uphold the\ndoctrine of public reason can fare equally as well in this regard\n(Billingham 2016; Caney 1995). The second is that citizens’\ninterest in realising civic friendship is sufficiently weighty so as\nto justify the kind of restraint imposed by the doctrine of public\nreason (Caney 1995). \nThe third justification of the doctrine of public reason is the\nStability Argument. This argument emphasizes the alleged psychological\nfact that citizens are more likely to support principles and\ninstitutions that they themselves see as just (Rawls 1996:\n140–4; Weithman 2011). This implies that, if we want to extend\nthe life-expectancy of our institutions, then we should favour\nprinciples and institutions that will predictably generate their own\nsupport (Freeman 2007b: ch. 3). This counts in favour of the doctrine\nof public reason, whose defining claim is that we may appeal only to\nthose reasons that we can reasonably expect others to endorse. \nUnlike the previous two arguments, the Stability Argument is purely\ninstrumental. Its sees citizens’ support of the principles and\ninstitutions to which they are subject as valuable only insofar as\nit enhances the stability of those principles and institutions. Of\ncourse, this is not to say that stability is always valuable: instead,\nthe stability of a set of institutions is valuable only if\nthose institutions meet other moral standards, such as if they treat\ncitizens justly. \nWhereas the doctrine of public reason restricts the reasons to which\nwe may appeal, the doctrine of public rules regulates the character of\nthe requirements that principles of justice may\n produce.[65]\n More specifically, it states that we have weighty reasons to prefer\nprinciples of justice that can serve as a public standard, in the\nsenses that they are (i) not self-effacing; and yield demands (ii)\nthat are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and (iii) compliance\nwith which is sufficiently verifiable to others (Rawls 1996:\n66–67; Rawls 1999a: 48–49; see also Williams 1998: 233).\nWe explain each of these properties in turn. \nFirst, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they\nare not self-effacing - that is, only if the success of the\nprinciples from which the rules derive does not depend upon some\ncitizens being ignorant of these principles, or upon some citizens\nbeing ignorant of others’ knowledge of these principles (see\n section 1.3.1).\n In other words, the idea of publicity requires mutual knowledge, and\nnot mere general knowledge (see\n section 1.1).\n In clarifying what he means by a public system of rules, Rawls\nwrites, \nI mean then that everyone engaged in it knows what he would know if\nthese rules and his participation in the activity they define were the\nresult of an agreement… He also knows that the others know this\nand that they know that he knows this, and so on (1999a:\n 48).[66] \nSecond, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they\nprovide sufficiently determinate and accessible standards of moral\npermissibility, such that a “person taking part in an\ninstitution knows what the rules demand of him” (Rawls 1999a:\n48). This has two components. First, principles pass the test of\ndeterminacy only if they are not so vague that they are incapable\nof producing clear\n directives.[67]\n Second, principles pass the test of accessibility not merely\nwhen citizens can attain knowledge of how they would be required to\nact if they were to have the relevant empirical information, but\ninstead only if citizens are in fact able to attain knowledge of that\nempirical information (Rawls 1996: 182; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008:\n41). \nThird, principles of justice provide a public standard only if\ncompliance with their demands is sufficiently verifiable to\nothers. For Rawls, what matters is not only that “the\ninstitutions of the basic structure are just” but also that\n“everyone recognizes this” (1996: 66). This\ntest of verifiable compliance therefore requires the\npossibility of widespread knowledge of the extent to which citizens\ndischarge their duties. This test is most plausibly understood as an\naggregative one. For example, the duty not to litter is verifiable to\nothers in virtue of the fact that we can attain knowledge of the\nextent to which others on aggregate refrain from littering,\neven though we may not be able to attain knowledge of the extent to\nwhich any given citizen refrains from\n littering.[68] \nRawls appeals to the doctrine of public rules in order to justify\nseveral features of his view, including the idea that the principles\nof justice should govern the distribution of social primary goods\nrather than the distribution of welfare. Part of what justifies this\nverdict is that, because it is not feasible accurately to measure\nwelfare, principles that refer to welfare fail the test of\naccessibility. Accordingly, these principles “run afoul of the\n[publicity] constraint”, such that “In political life\ncitizens cannot sensibly apply or follow it” (Rawls 1996:\n182 n. 11; Rawls 1999b: 13 n. 3). Because of this, principles of\njustice that govern the distribution of welfare abrogate their chief\npurpose, which is “to provide a publicly recognized point of\nview from which all citizens can examine before one another whether\ntheir political and social institutions are just” (Rawls\n1996: 9). \nIn the same vein, Andrew Williams writes, \n…we have reason to reject conceptions of justice which, given\nthe fact of limited information, are too epistemically demanding to be\npublic and stable. We should, like Rawls, favour conceptions whose\nscope is restricted to publicly accessible phenomena (1998: 245). \nAn implication of the doctrine of public rules, therefore, is that we\nhave reasons to object to highly epistemically demanding principles of\njustice that fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or\nverifiable compliance. As an example of this, let us consider G.A.\nCohen’s claim that justice requires citizens to internalize an\negalitarian ethos that condemns self-serving behaviour and,\nsubject to a personal prerogative and special labour burdens, requires\ncitizens to be guided by a concern for the least advantaged when\nmaking occupational choices (2008: part 1). Rejecting this possibility\non the grounds that it violates the doctrine of public rules, Williams\nwrites that  \nit is quite possible that, in typical cases, we will lack a\nsufficiently precise public standard by which to justify, or\ncriticize, each other’s self-serving behavior (1998: 240).  \nThis is because, in order to calculate whether a citizen is acting in\naccordance with the demands with the egalitarian ethos, we would need\nto know which occupation available to her best serves the interests of\nthe least advantaged, as well as whether her choice to pursue an\nalternative occupation would be protected by either her personal\nprerogative or a concern for special labour burdens. \nThe success of Williams’s reply to Cohen depends partly upon the\nexistence of weighty reasons to endorse the doctrine of public rules.\nFor this reason, we shall now turn our attention to the various\narguments in defence of this doctrine. In particular, we highlight\nthree distinct justifications, each of which corresponds to an\nargument in defence of the doctrine of public reason. \nThe Political Autonomy Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules\nby appeal to its role in protecting political autonomy (Williams 1998:\n244). If citizens have no clear sense of what the principles of\njustice demand of them, then they lack awareness of the moral\nconstraints to which they are subject, and so are prevented from\nfreely identifying with those constraints. A similar threat to\npolitical autonomy arises when principles of justice fail the test of\nverifiable compliance. If citizens are freely to identify with the\nconstraints to which they are subject, it is important that they can\nrecognise these constraints as a product of others’ compliance\nwith principles of justice. \nThe second justification is the Civic Friendship Argument, according\nto which we should uphold the doctrine of public rules because of the\nrole it plays in realising civic friendship (Williams 1998: 244).\nAccording to this view, civic friendship can exist within a society\nonly when citizens are able justifiably to regard themselves and\nothers (and justifiably be regarded by themselves and others)\nas doing what is necessary to sustain reasonably fair terms of social\ncooperation. Publicity facilitates each of these ends. Just as members\nof an orchestra are denied a common good when they cannot hear, or\notherwise appreciate, their own or others’ contributions to\ntheir joint performance, so too citizens are denied the good of civic\nfriendship when they are denied awareness of their own or\nothers’ compliance with the principles of justice. \nFinally, the Stability Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules\non the grounds that its acceptance enhances “the long-term\nprobability of a society conforming with its conceptions of\njustice” (Williams 1998: 244). Again, this instrumental argument\nrelies upon the alleged psychological fact that citizens are more\nlikely to support principles and institutions that they perceive as\njust (Rawls 1996: 140–4). This supports the doctrine of\npublic rules insofar as citizens are more likely to perceive\nprinciples and institutions as just when the demands of justice are\nsufficiently determinate and accessible, and compliance with them is\nsufficiently verifiable to others (for objections: Caney 1995;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2008: 45–46). \nThe most sustained critique of the doctrine of public rules comes from\nG.A. Cohen (2008: ch. 8). Though he advances a number of distinct\nobjections to the doctrine, for reasons of space we shall focus on\nonly one element of his analysis, in which he disputes the claim that\nprinciples of justice must pass tests of determinacy, accessibility,\nand of verifiable compliance. Cohen denies that, in order to be valid,\nprinciples of justice must be capable of serving as a public standard.\nInstead, he maintains that we can rely solely upon citizens’\ngood faith efforts. This is the Good Faith Efforts Objection\n(Casal 2015; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015: ch. 8). \nIn support of this objection, let us consider a gender egalitarian\nethos that condemns women having to do more housework than men, for no\ngood reason. As with Cohen’s egalitarian ethos, this ethos may\nfail to provide a public standard by which to justify and to criticize\nour own and others’ sexist behaviour. This is because, in order\nto determine whether a husband who refuses to do the washing up\nbecause of backache is acting in accordance with the demands of the\ngender egalitarian ethos, we would need to know how severe his\nbackache is, as well as to compare the other domestic burdens that he\nhas borne with those that his wife bears. This makes the gender\negalitarian ethos highly epistemically demanding, such that it may\nfail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or verifiable\ncompliance (Cohen 2008: 359–60). However, it is intuitively\nimplausible to reject the gender egalitarian ethos on this basis.\nRather, in this case, justice requires “good-faith efforts, not\nomniscience” (Casal 2015:\n 822).[69] \nCohen offers a second case in support of the Good Faith Efforts\nObjection: \nDuring World War II in Britain, a social ethos induced people to\nsacrifice personal interests for the sake of the war effort, and\neveryone was expected, as a matter of justice, to “do his\nbit,” to shoulder his just share. It is absurd to suppose that\nsomeone could have stated precisely what amount of sacrifice that\ninjunction required, and it is true, therefore, that, with respect to\nmany people, one couldn’t tell, and with respect to some, they\ncouldn’t even themselves tell, whether they were sacrificing on\nthe required scale (2008: 353). \nCohen maintains that, rather than reject such an ethos on the grounds\nthat it is inconsistent with the demands of the doctrine of public\nrules, we should instead abandon the latter. What matters in these\ncases, Cohen thinks, is that citizens are able to make “a\nreasonably efficacious societywide good faith effort”\n(2008: 352 [emphasis in original]). \nIn reply to this objection, proponents of the doctrine of public rules\nmight circumscribe their claims, holding that we should prefer\nprinciples of justice that provide a public standard only under\ncertain conditions. One possibility is to relinquish the doctrine\nof public rules in those cases in which citizens are required to bear\ncosts that are much smaller than the benefits generated by good faith\nefforts to comply with those principles. This would explain why the\nindeterminacy, inaccessibility, and lack of verifiable compliance is\nnot troubling in the two cases we have just considered. In the first,\nthe gender egalitarian ethos requires citizens to bear minimal costs\nin the fight against sexism; and in the second, Cohen’s\nsacrifice ethos requires citizens to bear potentially larger costs,\nbut the reward is enormous. \nThis would not amount to an abandonment of the doctrine of public\nrules. Rather, according to this reply, we should prefer principles of\njustice that provide a public standard, except when there is not this\ndiscrepancy in costs. As the costs that citizens are required to bear\nincrease in comparison with the benefits they are required to\ngenerate, it becomes increasingly important that citizens know both\nwhat their duties demand of them and the extent to which others\ndischarge their duties. \nTwo reasons support this conviction. First, without determinate and\naccessible standards of moral permissibility, there is a risk that\nsome citizens will make larger sacrifices than what is morally\nrequired of them. When the costs involved are comparatively high, this\nis likely to be unfair. To illustrate this unfairness, we can consider\nthe case of an individual who internalises the egalitarian ethos, and\nwho takes on some gruelling occupation only because she fails to\nrecognise that, because of her personal prerogative, she would be\nmorally justified in pursuing a more enjoyable occupation.  \nSecond, it is sometimes reasonable for a citizen who makes\nconsiderable sacrifices to have assurance that other citizens\nare discharging their duties. This is because she knows that she is\nnot being exploited by non-compliers, and because she knows that, if\nshe were not to make such sacrifices, she would be free-riding on\nbenefits that others’ compliance brings (Mason 2012: 541).\nAgain, these concerns are likely to be more powerful when sacrifices\nrequired of citizens are comparatively high. \nThis reply to the Good Faith Efforts Objection is incomplete in\nmultiple ways. Proponents of this reply must specify the implications\nof their views in a larger range of cases, including those in which\nthe costs and benefits involved are of comparatively equal values\n(both high and low). Moreover, it also remains important to explain\nmore precisely how this reply relates to the three justifications for\nthe doctrine of public rules that we considered above. Meeting these\nchallenges is central to establishing the plausibility of the doctrine\nof public rules. \nWe began our exploration by looking at Kant’s hypothetical publicity\ntest. We asked ourselves whether there were good reasons to believe\nthat hypothetical publicity should be considered a sound requirement\nto test maxims of action. We also wondered whether hypothetical\npublicity entailed significant restrictions from the point of view of\nactual publicity. The answer appears to be rather negative in both\ncases. For, first, there does not seem to be any intrinsic\nrelationship between self-frustratingness and justice. To put things\nin another way, the less the effect of publicity is contingent, the\nmore we can doubt about its validity as a test of justice. And\nsecond, if no criterion is provided as to the level of\ngenerality at which the Kantian test should operate, we run both risks\nof under- and over-exclusiveness. Which maxims of action should be\ndeemed unjust is therefore left rather undefined by the test in most\ncases. \nWhile it is unclear whether the Kantian hypothetical publicity test\ncould (and should) be rescued, there is no doubt that actual publicity\nissues raise very interesting philosophical challenges. One of them\nhas to do with the articulation between, on the one hand, the function\nthat political philosophy ascribes to voting, representation and\ndeliberation, and, on the other hand, the types of effects that could\nbe expected from going public. In the course of our discussion, we\nalso tried to draw parallels and to identify differences between\nvoters and their representatives (e.g., through the idea of horizontal\naccountability) and between the voting and the deliberation debate.\nThe meaning of the publicity requirement may differ significantly as\nwell when we compare standard representative bodies (e.g.,\nparliaments) with the civil service or with “independent”\nbodies acting within a democratic context (e.g., central banks or\ncourts). Publicity in the latter case is likely to have both a meaning\nand consequences quite different from the ones attached to public\ndeliberation, e.g., in a parliament’s plenary session. \nMoreover, while we certainly did not question the possibility of\ndeveloping principled views in the field of actual publicity,\nfactual assumptions present in most of the key arguments in\nthis respect (e.g., in those of J.S. Mill or Elster) require more\nextensive empirical research. The results that we reported from some\nof these empirical investigations are potentially rich in consequences\nfor our normative theories. The data gathered by Naurin (2004) and\nMeade & Stasavage (2008) are especially important in this respect.\nAs is the case with other issues in political philosophy, there is\ncertainly a need here for philosophers to engage in a dialogue with\nsocial scientists. \nFinally, we briefly presented Rawls’s uses of the idea of publicity.\nThe variety of ways in which he refers to it certainly shows the need\nfor a more substantial mapping enterprise, at a strictly conceptual\nlevel. This could in turn indicate reasons to develop philosophical\narguments in new directions.","contact.mail":"t.parr@warwick.ac.uk","contact.domain":"warwick.ac.uk"}]
