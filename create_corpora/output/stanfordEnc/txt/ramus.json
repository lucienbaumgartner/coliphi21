Yet in his day\nhe gained an impressive number of followers and admirers, and his\nworks influenced the curriculum of many European universities.\nAccording to scholars such as Walter J. Ong, Ramus’ frequently\nreprinted books on logic “could in no real sense be considered\nan advance or even a reform” (Ong 1958: 5). Yet, it was mainly\non the basis of these books that he acquired an impressive reputation\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\n\n\nWe must look at Ramus as a typical phenomenon of the sixteenth century\nand its unceasing religious controversies. It was also a period of\nstate building, during which Italian humanism was transformed into its\nNorthern European counterpart. Ramus himself took part in this\nprocess. A Huguenot convert from Catholicism, he was one of the most\nfamous victims of the St. Bartholomew’s day massacre. From early\nyouth he fought against scholasticism and its interpretation of\nAristotle; and he tried to reform the contemporary university\ncurriculum in a way that would fulfill the new needs of the emerging\nstates. As a good humanist, he approached everything linguistically\nand rhetorically.\n\n\nThe extent to which he was, in reality, an offspring of the scholastic\ntradition has yet to be recognized. Although he attracted many ardent\nsupporters, a little scholastic anti-scholasticism was the main reason why\nhis revolt against traditional philosophy did not produce an entirely\nnew philosophical system. Ramus soon came to be considered, not an\ninnovative thinker, but an outmoded one.\n\n To gain a true picture of Petrus Ramus and his work, it is\nnecessary to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the enthusiasm\nof his admirers and hagiographical biographers and, on the other, the\nscholars who, from a philosophical or a scholastic perspective, have\ncriticized his lack of originality and consistency. Even among modern\nscholars there are different opinions of the significance or\nconsistency of his work. It is impossible to describe Ramus’\nthinking and to understand his importance without considering all\nsides of the story. He may never have intended to achieve what\nposterity has blamed him for not achieving.  Instead modern historians\nhave emphasized the huge impact his pedagogical ideas had for almost a\ncentury.\n\n\nOur information about Ramus’ life, apart from scattered\nbiographical notes in his own books, comes mainly from three of his\ncontemporaries: Johannes Thomas Freigius, Theophilus Banosius and\nNicolas Nancelius. Freigius and Banosius spent only brief periods with\nRamus and relied mostly on written sources. Banosius met Ramus once in\nHeidelberg in 1569, and Fregius’ time together with Ramus was\nlimited to the latter’s stay in Basel in\n1569–1570. Nancelius, however, was a close friend of his, first\nas a student and later as a colleague and collaborator; and the\naccount he produced is more exhaustive and better written. \nRamus was born in 1515 to a poor but, according to him, illustrious\nfamily who lived in a small village in Picardy not far from Noyon, the\nbirthplace of his contemporary, John Calvin (1509–1564). For\nsome time his father even had to earn his living as a charcoal-burner.\nLater Ramus’ enemies would ridicule his humble parentage.\nAccording to Skalnik, however, we should consider Ramus’\ndoctrine and his pedagogical program in the light of these\ncircumstances. After losing his father as a young boy, Ramus worked\nfor a short time as a foot-soldier and a servant before he got the\nopportunity to study in Paris, becoming a Master of Arts in 1536.\nNancelius praises his diligence and tells us that he earned his living\nby helping other students of greater means and consequently slept\nhardly more than three hours a night, resulting in a painful eye\ndisease (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 178). The lengthy\ncurriculum of the University of Paris was mostly governed by the\ndemands of the Church and strongly influenced by a scholastic\ntradition dating from the late Middle Ages. In 1529 Francis I had\nestablished several royal professorships and had also\nset up a special college with a more humanist curriculum, the\nCollège royal (later known as the Collège de France), in\norder to reduce the power of the university. \nOur knowledge of Ramus’ precise whereabouts and activities\nduring these first years in Paris is quite limited; but it is likely\nthat early on he began to criticize the role of scholasticism in\nuniversity education. He claimed that he had reacted from the very\nbeginning against the inconsistencies of the curriculum and of the\nteaching. As soon as he was allowed to give lectures, he tried to\nchange what he himself had found so unsatisfactory. His endeavors to\nreform the curriculum were not, however, appreciated by his\ncolleagues, who mounted strong resistance to them: his first\ntextbooks, Aristotelicae animadversiones and Dialecticae\ninstitutiones, both published in 1543, were censured and\neventually prohibited. He himself was briefly banned from teaching\nlogic and rhetoric. \nThe tension between Ramus and the university did not abate. In 1551,\nhowever, he was appointed to a regius (royal) professorship in eloquence and\nphilosophy. Holders of these chairs taught according to more humanist\nprinciples than those followed by university professors. The latter,\nfor instance, strenuously defended the medieval rules for pronouncing\nLatin and Greek, which Ramus ridiculed, just as he derided those who\ntried to develop a formal logic that departed from the normal way in\nwhich people talk and write. Importantly the royal professorships were\nseparated from the university and without any rules governing lectures\nor other duties, so the holders had a significant degree of\nindependence. Still more important were Ramus’ insistent\nendeavors to reform the university. Among other things he suggested\nthat the professors should be paid from public funds rather than by\nthe students. Skalnik has emphasized the significance of Ramus’\nprogram and dream of widening the scope of education to include even instruction\nof future craftsmen. Ramus argued unrelentingly in favor of a kind of\nmeritocracy that implied selecting officials and professors on the\nbasis of merits rather than lineage (Skalnik 2002: 41, 64 and\n157). \nRamus published many books during his career. More than fifty were\nprinted, and some came out in several editions. They vary in genre and\nlength from commentaries on classical texts to short tracts or\norations. His textbooks were widely read, but how the rules actually\nshould be used is more clearly displayed in his commentaries. It is\nsometimes difficult to distinguish Ramus’ works from those of\nhis closest colleague and friend, Omar Talon (c. 1510–1562). The\ntwo scholars influenced each other and exchanged ideas and texts.\nTalon’s Rhetorica (1548), for example, was essentially\na slightly revised version of Ramus’ Institutiones\noratoriae (1545). Nancelius describes an episode typical of this\nintricate friendship. Ramus, attacked by a colleague, took only three\ndays to produce a witty reply, which was printed a few days later with\nTalon’s name on the title-page, though the latter had barely\nseen the manuscript (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita:\n219–221). It was a great loss for Ramus when Talon died in\n1562. \nIn 1561 Ramus took the dramatic step of converting to\nProtestantism. As a Huguenot, he lost the influential support of the\nCardinal of Lorraine, which until then had been vital for his career\nadvancement. From now on he could only hope for the patronage of the\nking. He was forced to leave Paris and the university, spending some\nyears in Germany and Switzerland. He tried to obtain a chair in\nHeidelberg, where he took part in his first Protestant communion;\ndespite this, the other professors refused him the chair that had been\npromised to him by the Count Palatine, Fredrick III. His attempt to be\nappointed to a chair in Strasbourg was also unsuccessful. Therefore,\nin 1570 he returned to Paris, where he took up his former position as\nroyal professor, but without regaining his licentia docendi,\nhis right to teach at the university. This meant that he was no longer\npermitted to deliver lectures and therefore was unable to attract\nlarge audiences (Banosius 1577: 33; cf. Ong 1958: 28). Ramus remained\ncontroversial also among his Reformed brethren. He sided with a\nminority that argued for a congregational leadership against a\nPresbyterian polity. In this debate Ramus adamantly defied Theodore\nBeza, who had succeeded Calvin in Geneva as leader of the Reformed\nChurch. Beza was upset and even threatened Ramus with excommunication\n(Skalnik 2002: 88–147; Hotson 2007: 19). \nRamus was an extremely controversial figure. He acquired admirers and\nfriends as easily as he did opponents, critics and enemies—one\nof whom, according to an unreliable report, was responsible for his\ndeath. In spite of the differing accounts given by his biographers, we\nknow that Ramus was murdered during the St. Bartholomew’s day\nmassacre, which started on August 24, 1572. On the third day he was\ncaptured in his study at the Collège de Presles. His body was\nmutilated and perhaps decapitated before being thrown into the Seine.\nAlthough the king had ordered for him to be spared, we do not know why\nthese instructions were disobeyed. Since, however, Ramus was not\nkilled until the slaughter had almost died down, this may indicate\nthat the reasons for his murder went beyond his conversion to\nProtestantism. At any rate, he became a kind of martyr to his many\nfollowers. \nNancelius, in order to present an accurate portrait of Ramus, provides\nsome details about his way of life and his personality. He tells us\nthat Ramus was as dark-skinned as an Italian or a Spaniard, rather\ntall and had an impressively black and bushy beard, of which he was\nvery proud—once when the rector of the University of Paris\nordered all professors to shave, Ramus obeyed but stayed at home until\nhis beard had grown out again. His gait was graceful and regal, his\nposture striking and dignified. He seems to have been quite moderate\nin his drinking and eating habits. He spent most of his time reading,\nwriting and talking with friends. Nancelius also reports that Ramus\ntook a bath only once a year, but washed his hands, face and beard\ndaily in a mixture of water and white wine. Although as a professor he\nwas not allowed to marry, he did from time to time have female\nfriends. \nRamus is reputed to have had a very bad temper. Sometimes he even\nphysically attacked his young students, though apparently this did not\nprevent him from gaining many devoted disciples. He amassed a\nsubstantial fortune and made a provision in his will that this money\nshould be used to establish a chair of mathematics. Significantly, it\nwas not to be attached to the University of Paris but was instead to\nhave the same type of special conditions granted to royal\nprofessors. \nRamus often shifted his opinions and constantly made quite substantial\nchanges in his textbooks; sometimes he also reconsidered his views on\nimportant part of his writings, although he always stuck to the core\nof his program. During Ramus’ early years at the University of\nParis he devoted himself to the disciplines or arts of the traditional\ntrivium: grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. He formulated his\nideas on logic in 1540s and the early 1550s, and it is during this\nperiod that he gave most explicit expression to his\nanti-Aristotelianism. In 1555 he published a logic textbook in French,\nentitled Dialectique, which in many ways provided a clear\nindication of his ambitions and aims. Although he had become well\nknown for his Latin eloquence, he broke with the scholastic tradition\nby writing in the vernacular. The following year he published the same\nbook in Latin under the title Dialecticae libri duo\n(henceforth Dialectica). It was later printed in many\ndifferent languages, and hundreds of editions of the Latin version\nwere published. The book was widely disseminated and used at schools\nand universities throughout Europe, mostly in the Protestant\ncountries. \nRamus’ rhetoric textbook, the Institutiones rhetoricae,\nwritten with Talon, appeared in 1545 but with only Talon’s name\non the title-page. It was a kind of companion to the Dialecticae\ninstitutiones, published two years earlier. A second edition,\nentitled Rhetorica, though popular and frequently reprinted\nin new editions, never attained the diffusion and influence of his\nlogic textbook. During the late 1550s and the 1560s Ramus published\nhis lectures on the various arts, including physics and metaphysics.\nWhile his textbooks were succinctly organized according to very strict\nprinciples, the lectures (Scholae) were less laconic and\noffered more detailed discussion. They were later collected together\nand published as Scholae in liberales artes in a Basel\nedition of 1569. \nRamus also turned his hand to mathematics, although his knowledge of\nthe subject was limited. He had problems at first understanding the\nGreek mathematicians, and later he recalled his early encounter with\nthem:  \n…I threw away my drawing-board and ruler, and burst out in rage\nagainst mathematics, because it tortures so cruelly those who love it\nand are eager for it. (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 205)  \nAccording to Nancelius, Ramus used to gather around him in his own\nhouse a number of proficient mathematicians, so that they could help\nhim to understand what he would later teach his students. Yet, from\nthe very beginning, he was convinced of the importance of mathematics.\nNancelius thinks his master’s keen interest in mathematics was a\nconsequence of his banishment for some time from teaching philosophy\n(Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes, epistolae, orationes, p.\n409; Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 197–201; Goulding 2006:\n74, 2010: 20). In any case, he improved his abilities in both Greek\nand mathematics, and in his will he stipulated that the holder of the\nchair he wanted to endow should be an expert in both. Ong’s\nnegative judgment of Ramus’ mathematical abilities may be\ncorrect (Ong 1958: 27); nevertheless, his enthusiasm for this field\nwas crucial to the future history of Ramism. \nWhatever Ramus’ own mathematical abilities may have been, he\nconsistently demonstrated his conviction of its importance. He was\nconfident that there was a natural way to think and argue and also to\ncalculate. Arts should therefore always be built of parts that\nrepresent this true nature. Mathematics should mirror a natural\nmathematical thinking. We will see below how significant this thought\nwas for Ramus when he worked out his syllabus and his method. \nRamus addressed the challenge of his weak knowledge of mathematics not\nonly by improving his ability but also by grasping its history. It\nbecame essential for him not only to distinguish those who in the past\nhad contributed to make mathematics an art but also those who in\ndifferent ways had tried to undermine it. In his early writings, he\nseems mostly to have been focused on the natural aspects of\nmathematics and looked on it as an expression of natural dialectic;\nbut later on he turned his attention more to the practical or useful\naspects of mathematics. Goulding has explained this development in\ndetail, outlining how Ramus’ evaluation of Pythagoras evolved\nover time, until he eventually became more and more like Ramus\nhimself. He even condemned the way Euclid had, in his view, destroyed\nwhat was natural in mathematics and instead filled it with subtleties.\nIn the Prooemium mathematicum (1667) and later in Scholae\nmathematicae, he criticized the theoretical works of the ancient\nGreek mathematicians on the grounds that they were confusing and led\naway from the usefulness of the discipline for practitioners. He\nwanted “an art at once practical and methodical”. As\nGoulding points out, if the holder of his endowed chair of mathematics\nwas to be in a position to observe the provisions of his will, he\nwould have to be made in Ramus’ own image (Goulding 2010: 35f.,\n50 and 180). \nThus, while the early phase of Ramus’ academic career was\nconcentrated on the disciplines of the trivium, in the later\nperiod, from around 1560, he moved on to the quadrivium\n(arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), though in practice his\ninterest was largely restricted to mathematics. He could never fully\nendorse Copernicus’ new heliocentric astronomy because he was\nunable to accept an hypothesis as a scientific argument (see\n §2.4\n below). The famous Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601)\nleft a report of an encounter he had with Ramus in Augsburg in 1569,\nregistering his own amazement at this attitude. It was Brahe’s\nview that, according to Ramus, the astronomer’s task in\ndescribing the movements of the planets must be based solely on\nobservation: he was not allowed to use hypotheses such as assuming a\ncircular planetary movement. Ramus even promised to let anyone who\ncould create an astronomy without hypotheses take over his own royal\nchair. Of course, no one seriously claimed to have succeeded until\nKepler in 1597 mockingly declared himself entitled to it (Skalnik\n2002: 59; Hooykaas 1958: 64–67; Jardine & Segonds 2001). \nAlthough Ramus challenged the values and educational principles of\nscholasticism, he never attempted to discuss theological issues. His\nsole interest was in reforming the curriculum of the arts faculty.\nNancelius points out that Ramus’ large library had very few\nvolumes on theology, medicine or law (Nancelius Petri Rami\nVita: 273). Nevertheless, during his final years he wrote a book\non Christian theology, the Commentariorum de religione Christiana\nlibri quatuor, which was published posthumously. The most\nstriking feature of this work was that Ramus defined theology as the\nart of living virtuously, ars bene vivendi, adopting an\nessentially Zwinglian point of view. Theology may give us the rules by\nmeans of which we can and must live, but it cannot bring us salvation.\nIn a particularly interesting chapter of the treatise (I:8), Ramus\ndiscusses the meaning of predestination. Mostly he sided with a\nZwinglian against a Genevan position, as he did in the sacramental\ntheology. \nBanosius mentions that several of Ramus’ manuscripts were\ndestroyed or scattered at the time of his murder and that among these\nwere a commentary on Aristotle’s Politics and various\nworks on ethics and music (Banosius 1577: 39). Unfortunately, no trace\nof these writings has survived. Nancelius was eager to mention that he\nhad collaborated with Ramus in planning a long series of works on\nmathematics. For some reason, however, this corpus\nmathematicum was never printed and, along with many other\nmanuscripts, these works disappeared after Ramus’ assassination\n(Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 205 and 273 ). \nThe enormous impact of Ramus on European education in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries has seemed astonishing to some modern\nscholars; and among his harshest critics have been historians of\nlogic. Carl Prantl, for instance, claimed that Ramus had no talent\nwhatsoever for philosophy and logic (Prantl 1855–1870:\n157–169; cf. Kneale and Kneale 1962: 300–302); and Walter\nJ. Ong was also keen to point out his incompetence (Ong 1958: 7 and\n24). Without engaging in arguments with these scholars, it is still\nlegitimate to ask what it was that made Ramus so popular and so\ncontroversial. One key to understanding the impact of Ramism can be\nfound in his own statement, in the Scholae dialecticae, that\nthe aim of his reforms was to adapt Aristotle’s Organon\nto the service of learning, ad eruditionis usum. \nThe arts faculty was supposed to prepare young students for further\nstudies in theology, medicine or jurisprudence. Most students,\nhowever, never advanced to these higher faculties but left the\nuniversity for employment in the Church. The arts curriculum had been\ngeared toward this situation since the Middle Ages. The political\ndevelopments which led to the rise of a new kind of state in the\nRenaissance also affected the educational program of universities. In\nthe short term, rulers tried to find quick and practical solutions\nsuch as special colleges or special professorships; but in the long\nrun, more thorough measures, which included establishing new\ninstitutions and devising new curricula, were needed. The arts faculty\nhad gradually changed, and what we now call the humanities (history,\nliterature, rhetoric and ethics) had started to play a more important\nrole. The stress on some aspects of logic and metaphysics,\ncharacteristic of the medieval arts faculty, was becoming obsolete. A\nnew curriculum adjusted to the humanities was therefore necessary. \nRamus was most concerned about the obvious lack of efficiency of the\nscholastic curriculum that he had observed as a student. According to\nhim, students had to spend too many years learning too little of use\nfor them. He adopted as his motto a famous line by Vergil\n“Labor improbus omnia vincit” (Relentless work\novercomes everything; Georgics 1.145). From his own\nexperience, he knew the importance of hard work, and he wanted to make\nit possible for students of more humble means to study and, by\ndiligent application, reach their goals more quickly. Therefore, he\nneeded to make education much cheaper by shortening the amount of time\nstudents put into studying. To achieve this, he had to reflect on the\npedagogical means and goals (Hotson 2007: 39–51). \nRamus’ reform program may have been designed to respond to this\nneed. He became famous for his strong reaction against\nAristotle’s undisputed primacy in the medieval university\ncurriculum. According to his devoted biographer Freigius, his academic\ncareer began with a public disputation in 1536 where he defended the\nthesis “that everything Aristotle had said was false”\n(quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse). It\nis unlikely, however, that such a disputation ever took place since no\none apart from Freigius mentions it. Nevertheless, the episode was\nreferred to by many contemporaries, as well as by later historians,\nand certainly helped to associate Ramus’ name with all forms of\nanti-Aristotelianism (Ong 1958: 37–39). Although savage attacks\non Aristotle were not uncommon during the Reformation, Ramus’\ncriticism of his philosophy became one of the most famous outbursts of\nanti-Aristotelianism. Yet Ramus was hardly a typical anti-Aristotelian\nin the mold of Luther or other impassioned anti-intellectuals. Though\nmany of his followers could be considered zealots, he himself was\ninsistent on pointing out the difference between what he referred to\nas the true and the false Aristotle. Attacks on Aristotle were often\nlaunched by those who emphasized the fact that he had not been a\nChristian; some fanatics even thought that his philosophy had paved\nthe way for Satan. Ramus did not share this view. According to him, it\nwas not because Aristotle had been a pagan that he was wrong but\nrather because he had been misinterpreted by later commentators. \nRamus claimed that his work to reform the curriculum had begun during\nhis early schooldays. As a young student he had to endure the\ninadequate way in which Aristotle was taught; no one seemed to care if\nyoung boys could ever use what they had learnt. For Ramus, the main\nreason for reforming the curriculum was related to the usefulness of\neducation and not to the question of Aristotle’s role in it. In\nfact, he emphasized the value of Aristotelian philosophy. He\nconsidered Aristotle to be the most important of logicians, though he\npointed out that Aristotle had not invented the discipline of logic\nbut rather developed what his predecessors had hinted at. Even more\nsignificant for Ramus was the need to call attention to the damage\nthat the corpus Aristotelicum had suffered after\nAristotle’s death, which meant that we could not know for\ncertain what he had intended to say on any given question. Because of\nthe bad state in which Aristotle’s texts were transmitted, his\ncommentators, in their discussions of individual books of the\nMetaphysics and Physics, had taken up certain issues\nthat really belonged to logic. This is also why the Organon\ngives the impression of being an amalgamation of different subjects.\nRamus laid the blame for all of this on the shoulders of the ancient\nand medieval commentators who he thought had for centuries\nmisinterpreted the Greek philosopher owing to the poor condition of\nthe Aristotelian corpus. He also highlighted another circumstance that\nhelped to explain the confusions and obscurities that, in his view,\nwere scattered throughout Aristotle’s books. The Philosopher\nhimself had intentionally made his theories a little more abstruse\nthan they needed to be in order to sift the wheat from the chaff among\nhis disciples (Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, col. 68). \nTo Ramus, Aristotle was a Socratic philosopher, whose approach was\nbroadly in line with that of Cicero. By contrast, Aristotle’s\nfollowers, especially those belonging to the scholastic camp, were\nmerely a bunch of frauds:  \nLet us ignore all these Aristotelians and return to Aristotle, the\nauthor of such a noble discipline [i.e., philosophy], and to Cicero,\nwho tries to emulate Aristotle’s teaching and to imitate him.\n(Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes, epistolae, orationes, p.\n299) \nIn 1569 there was a furious exchange of letters between Ramus and one\nof the most prominent and learned Aristotelians of his day, Jacob\nSchegk (1511–1587), a professor at the University of\nTübingen. The conflict may not have been based solely on a\ndifference of philosophical opinions. Schegk had a grudge against\nRamus, who had pulled one of his books to pieces. The discussion\nnevertheless forced Ramus to reconsider some of his positions. \nRamus’ final contribution to the debate was entitled,\ncharacteristically, Defensio pro Aristotele adversus Jacobus\nScheccium, that is, a defense of Aristotle against Schegk. In\nthis work he makes clear the difference between his position, which he\nmaintained had also been that of Aristotle, and the view of Schegk and\nother Aristotelians. The question at stake was what logic really was:\nits definition, its limitations, its goal and its nature. According to\nthe Aristotelians, the different parts of the\nOrganon—the Categories, On\nInterpretation, the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics, the Topics and the Sophistical\nRefutations—corresponded to the different parts of logic.\nThere was, for instance, an essential difference between probability\n(the subject of the Topics) and certainty (dealt with in the\ntwo Analytics). \nTo understand Ramus’ line of reasoning we have to start with his\nfirm rejection of the basic Aristotelian conception of philosophy. The\nAristotelians defined philosophy as a habitus intellectualis,\na rational attitude toward being. In looking at being we can try to\nunderstand it; but we can also, as humans, use our knowledge to act\nrightly or wrongly toward other humans. For this reason, Aristotle\ndivided philosophy into a theoretical part and a practical part.\nLogic, however, does not fit into this division of philosophy because\nit does not give us any knowledge at all of being. It is instead a way\nof acquiring knowledge and of finding the truth. The Aristotelians\ntherefore called it a habitus instrumentalis, an instrumental\nattitude (the Greek term organon, traditionally used to\ndenote Aristotle’s logical writings, means instrument or tool).\nAccording to the Aristotelians, philosophy always concerns the\nrational aspects of human beings; their productive aspects, by\ncontrast, belong to the practical disciplines or arts. For the\nAristotelian, it was essential to separate science and philosophy from\nthe arts. Yet while Aristotle had firmly rooted his philosophical\ntheories in an attitude toward being, educational practice in schools\nwas concerned solely with theorems and rules. Young pupils had to\nstudy not being in a theoretical and abstract way but rather the items\nthat the teacher demanded them to learn, often by heart. \nThe Stoic conception of philosophy, therefore, was often far more\nsuitable to a classroom situation. For the Stoics, the universe was\nrationally organized in a way that was directly equivalent to human\nreason. They believed that there was a correspondence in the universe,\nor in nature, between order and reason and that the reason which\norganized and governed the universe was essentially the same as human\nreason. The connection between nature and reason could be studied from\nthree different perspectives: physical, ethical and rational or\nlogical. One consequence of the Stoic theory was that there must be an\nabsolute analogy between the contents of an art and those of nature,\nthat is, all arts must also be about nature or being. There could not\nbe a difference of rank between the parts of nature, nor between the\nparts of philosophy, as the Aristotelians thought. Another consequence\nwas that logic became an integral part of philosophy rather than an\ninstrument to be used by the other branches of the discipline. \nRamus’ way of looking at philosophy and logic was in many ways\nsimilar to that of the Stoics. His definition of philosophy as a\ncognitio artium liberalium, a knowledge of the liberal arts,\nreveals both the influence of Stoicism and of the medieval educational\ntradition. Ramus thus regarded logic as a part of philosophy and\ndefined it as an art that truly gives us knowledge of being.\nRamus’ followers often substituted the word doctrina\nfor cognitio, which made it even clearer that the perspective\nwas more pedagogical than ontological (cf. Ramus, Dialectica,\np. 11, where he uses another variant, defining philosophy as a\ncomprehensio praeceptorum, a collection of precepts). \nIt may seem that Ramus’ attitude toward Aristotle and the\nAristotelians was not very consistent. At times, he claimed to be the\nonly true Aristotelian and criticized the scholastic Aristotelians for\nmisinterpreting Aristotle. On other occasions, he maintained that the\nentire Aristotelian tradition, including Aristotle himself, was\ntotally wrong. This inconsistency is due to the fact that, true to his\nusual habit, he adopted different strategies in response to different\npolemical situations. Although Ramus was an offspring of the\nAristotelian tradition, he was also influenced by Ciceronian and Stoic\nideas. Only rarely did he directly attack Aristotle himself. So, for\nexample, whenever there was a clash between the Aristotelian and the\nStoic way of thinking, he tried to solve the problem by pointing out\ndifferences between Aristotle and his later commentators. \nRamus stressed that all arts should represent separate parts of\nnature. It would consequently be a serious mistake to confuse one art\nwith another. In the Posterior Analytics Aristotle had set\nout certain rules or laws for how a predicate should be related to a\nsubject in order to make a correct scientific proposition. Ramus took\nover these laws; but he applied them not only to propositions but also\nto the construction of entire arts. \nThe first law, the lex veritatis, or law of truth, stated\nthat every theorem in an art must be general and indispensable. For\nexample, a theorem stating that the angle of a triangle is a right\nangle would not be a false statement since there are indeed triangles\nwith right angles. But since it is not true in relation to all\ntriangles, such a theorem would violate the law of truth. A theorem\nwhich states that the sum of the degrees of the three angles of a\ntriangle is 180 would, however, be totally correct and generally\ntrue. \nThe second law was called the lex justitiae, or law of\njustice. Ramus regarded this as the most important of the three laws.\nIt ensured that justice was done to all the arts. No theorem belonging\nto one art should be allowed to trespass into the subject matter of\nanother, since that would be unjust. This law also demanded that all\nparts of an art should be homogeneous. It was on the basis of this law\nthat Ramus objected to Copernicus’ planetary hypothesis (see\n §1.4\n above). He held that Copernicus was not allowed to put forward\ntheories as to how the planets really moved in the heavens, which\nbelonged to the art astrophysics, while at the same time using\nmathematical hypotheses, which belonged to the art of mathematics. To\nRamus, this law was fundamental for the purpose of organizing a new\ncurriculum and was also, as we shall see, an important aspect of his\nmethod (Hooykaas 1958: 65). \nThe third law, the lex sapientiae, or law of wisdom, was the\nconcrete principle of how an art should be organized according to\ngeneral theorems. A more general theorem should always precede a less\ngeneral and more particular one. The theorem that an isosceles\ntriangle has angles which add up to a total of 180 degrees is quite\ncorrect; but since it is true for all triangles, it should precede\ntheorems applicable to specific kinds of triangle. \nThis way of treating philosophy as an aggregate of rigidly separated\narts may have had some pedagogical value, but it also raised\ndifficulties. Ramus, for instance, could not accept metaphysics as a\nseparate discipline, although in this case his nominalism was also in\noperation. By insisting that every art must have its correctly\nformulated theorems, organized from the more general to the more\nspecific, and that no theorem should be allowed to have reference to\nmore than one art, Ramus almost seems to impose a military discipline\non nature. Sometimes his followers defined philosophy as merely a\nmethodical collection of arts, a collectio methodica, which\nreveals even more clearly their understanding of the discipline. \nOn account of his idealistic belief in the correspondence between the\narts—including their concepts and words—and being, some\nscholars have assumed that Ramus was reliant on Platonism. In his\nearly writings he certainly assumed a clear metaphysical link between\nnature, mathematics and dialectic. Indeed, his contemporaries\nsometimes called him the Plato Gallicus, the French Plato;\nbut, in reality, the Platonic influences on him were rather vague and\noften concealed. Gradually, the Platonic ontological strains in his\nworks lost importance and faded away. Although he at times claimed to\nbe a Platonist, his references to Plato were mostly aimed at\ndistancing himself from Aristotle and, above all, from contemporary\nAristotelians. In practice, he was more often inspired by Cicero and\nby Stoicism than by Platonism. And despite his attacks on Aristotle,\nhe was essentially dependent on the scholastic tradition (cf.\nBruyère 1984, who takes the opposite view on this issue). \nLogic, according to the Ramist and Stoic perspective, is a part of\nphilosophy. Ramus rejected the Aristotelian definition of logic as a\nhabitus instrumentalis, since an instrumental attitude could\nbe considered to be an effect of logic but not equivalent to it.\nInstead he defined logic as the ars bene disserendi, the art\nof correctly discussing or analyzing something. Consequently, Ramus\nthought that logic was about being, which made the discipline of metaphysics\nsuperfluous. \nOne of the logic books that students had for centuries studied was the\nSummulae logicales of Petrus Hispanus (probably the same\nPetrus who was elected pope in 1276 and adopted the name John XXI).\nEven in the beginning of the sixteenth century the treatise was still\nin use and attracted severe criticism from humanists. Ramus stated\nexplicitly that he wanted to remove the Summulae from the\ncurriculum, and it was mainly this book that he was thinking about\nwhen he lamented his own youthful experiences of studying logic. His\ndevastating judgment on the book was that it had not made him  \nmore judicious in his studies of history and antiquity, nor more\nskilled in disputation, nor more competent at writing poetry, nor\nindeed more competent at anything at all…. (Ramus, Scholae\ndialecticae, in Scholae in liberales artes, col. 153)\n \nNevertheless, Ramus’ own dialectic showed many signs of\ninfluence from Summulae. Therefore, to understand the\ndevelopment of Ramist logic, we have to pay attention to this\nscholastic background, as well as to Cicero, who played a key role in\nthe advance of humanist logic. \nThe three main parts of Aristotle’s great work on logic, the\nOrganon, are represented by the Categories, the\nPrior and Posterior Analytics and the\nTopics. The categories (praedicamenta) are not only\ntreated as a formal part of a proposition but also, and most\nimportantly, as universals, which meant that their ontological status\nalso had to be considered. The other two parts of Aristotle’s\nlogic dealt with the problems of how to reach scientific and\ndialectical conclusions respectively: the Analytics is about\nfinding correct axioms and using them to acquire scientific knowledge;\nthe Topics teaches us how to discuss and treat those issues\nwhere it is impossible to attain the truth, so that we have to be\nsatisfied with seeking what is most probable. \nThe Stoics were inclined to concentrate on linguistic rather than\nontological issues. Cicero observed that the Aristotelians were mainly\ninterested in the aspect of logic that he called the ars\ninveniendi, that is, the art of finding the right arguments. The\nStoics, on the other hand, according to Cicero, were more concerned\nabout the different aspects of the judgments that we make. They wanted\nto analyze arguments. He called this kind of dialectic the ratio\ndisserendi, a definition that Ramus, via Agricola, rephrased as\nthe ars bene disserendi. While the Aristotelians thought that\nthe categories were the natural introduction to logic, the Stoics\npreferred judgment. \nDuring the Middle Ages both the Peripatetic and the Stoic views on\ndialectic were preserved, the latter via Cicero and Augustine. Petrus\nHispanus’ Summulae consisted of several treatises\n(tractatus). In the first of these students could learn how\nto construct a proposition. In the second Petrus discussed the five\npraedicabilia that made it possible to classify different\nkinds of propositions. The third tractatus dealt with the\nCategories, the fourth and the fifth with the problems that\nAristotle had taken up in his Prior Analytics and in his\nTopics. The last seven treatises were concerned with specific\nlogical problems such as significatio or suppositio.\nWith few exceptions these treatises do not correspond to any part of\nthe Organon; instead, they are for the most part related to\nthe parva logicalia, a form of medieval logical thinking\nwhich was especially repugnant to the humanists. The Posterior\nAnalytics was hardly considered at all. The main emphasis at\nschool was on teaching young boys to construct syllogisms. The purpose\nof the Summulae was not to train the students to reflect on\nthe problem of how to make scientifically correct conclusions but\nrather to prepare them for what they normally were expected to do: to\ntake part in endless series of disputations. In that respect the\nSummulae succeeded (cf. Ong 1958: 55–74). \nWhile, for Ramus, Petrus Hispanus’ Summulae was like a\nred rag to a bull, he willingly admitted that he had learned a great\ndeal from a more recent book on logic, De inventione libri\ntres by the Dutch humanist Rudolph Agricola (1443–1485).\nThis book, printed for the first time in 1515, was to a great extent\ninfluenced by humanism. In many ways Agricola’s logic was based\nless on Aristotle than on Cicero. Aristotle had considered the\nTopics or dialectic as a special kind of deduction. This was\nthe reason why Aristotelians wanted the study of logic to start with\nwhat Cicero and the humanists often called iudicium or\njudgment, to be learned from the Categories, On\nInterpretation and the two Analytics, before the student\nwent on to the Topics. But Agricola disagreed. In his view,\nyou must find the arguments before you can employ them in your\nargumentation. Aristotelians maintained instead that it was necessary\nto know what to do with arguments before you could go looking for\nthem. In fact, Agricola hardly touched on iudicium in the\nmore than 400 pages of his treatise. In concentrating on the\nTopics, it was much easier for him to lean on Cicero rather\nthan on Aristotle. The close connection between inventio, as\na part of logic, and the art of rhetoric made it seem, however, as if\nhumanists could not separate the two disciplines. Another weakness\nwhich Aristotelians often pointed out in Agricola and Ramus was that\nthey were not interested in finding answers to difficult questions but\nrather in finding good arguments to use in defending a certain thesis\n(Sellberg 1979: 58). \nRamus wanted to carry on from where Agricola had left off. So, he\nadded to inventio the other part of logic, iudicium.\nAlthough it never received as much attention as inventio,\niudicium became very controversial in Ramus’ account,\nand he therefore made large changes to his presentation of it. His\nmost detailed discussion of iudicium was in the 1566 edition\nof the Dialectica, but this was neither the most read nor the\nmost important edition. The shorter version, published in 1572, was\nmore suitable for schools and was therefore followed in most later\neditions. In the 1572 edition there are 32 chapters devoted to\ninventio and only 20 to iudicium. Every chapter was\ncarefully constructed with questions and definitions of the main\nproblems and with examples, mostly taken from ancient authors. \nIn his first treatise on logic, Dialecticae institutiones\n(1543) Ramus had divided iudicium into three parts:\nsyllogistic, method and a kind of doctrine of ideas. The third part\nwas an odd element added in order to demonstrate that logic had a\ndivine origin; three years later it was removed, never to return.\nThereafter, he adopted a two-fold division of iudicium into\nthe axiomaticum and the dianoeticum. In the former\npart students learnt to organize the arguments found in\ninventio into a proposition or—as Stoics and even Ramus\npreferred to call it—an axioma. The second part of\niudicium, the dianoeticum, was divided into\nsyllogistic and method. The most remarkable aspect of his treatment of\nsyllogistic was that Ramus admitted a syllogismus\nexpositorius, in which the conclusion did not have to be about\nsomething universal but could be about something individual, as we can\nsee from the example:  \nSocrates is a philosopher; he is also a human being; consequently,\nthere is at least one human being who is a philosopher. (Ramus,\nDialectica 1623: 71)   This type of conclusion would nowadays seem unscientific and\narbitrary; but the fact that Ramus included it tells us something\nabout his attitude toward logic. As we have seen, he thought that it\nwas basically a natural way to think, and he was determined to make it\nuseful for the humanities (§ 1.4). Given the Aristotelian demand that\na scientific conclusion should always be universal, it was extremely\ndifficult to deal with the uniqueness of history and literature in a\nscientific framework. This syllogism was an attempt to cope with that\ndifficulty. But it also reveals Ramus’ lack of interest in the\nproblem of how to acquire new knowledge. It shows that his aim was\ninstead to systemize and organize arguments. For Ramus, therefore,\nmethod became the most important part of logic. \nMethod was a topic of enormous interest during the sixteenth century.\nAristotle’s words in the Physics\n(184a10–22) were difficult to interpret, and all\nsides claimed an inheritance from him. Ramus’ interpretation of\nthe lines in question made it possible for him to maintain that his\nmethod was strictly Aristotelian. The Aristotelians, for their part,\nlargely followed Averroes’ commentary on this passage, which led\nto a very different conclusion (Ramus, Dialectica 1569:\n513–515). The problem was to determine whether method was a way\nof acquiring knowledge or of displaying it. Discussions about\nmethodological issues changed in this period from being merely\ncommentaries on Aristotle to taking into account a wide range of\nconsiderations, including ones belonging to medicine and geometry. The\nconcepts of analysis and synthesis, for example, were borrowed from\ngeometry and soon became the main principles of method. The problem\nfor many logicians was that it was impossible to find relevant\ndiscussions of these concepts in the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics, despite the titles of these treatises (Gilbert 1960:\n27–32). It became obvious that more than one method could exist\nand that there was a difference between methodus and\nordo. The latter term came to be applied to a pedagogical\nmethod, a way of teaching or displaying. But it was also necessary to\nthink about natural vs. artificial methodus and\nordo, as well as considering the correct way of proceeding\nfrom the general to the particular and vice versa. \nAmong Aristotelians there was considerable disagreement on these\nissues. But Ramus took an extreme position. He explicitly denied that\nthere could be more than one method and that there was any difference\nbetween methodus and ordo. As a consequence of his\ndefinition of an art, he could not accept any uncertainty as to how\none should proceed or as to whether the procedure should be natural or\nartificial. In his succinct Latin formulation, he claimed that what\nwas notiora nobis, more known to us, must be the same as what\nwas notiora naturae, more known to nature. What is more\ngeneral with respect to nature must consequently have priority in our\nmethod over what is more particular. If you see a living creature in\nthe distance, it is not until you are closer to it that you will be\nable to identify it as a human being, and it will take still more time\nbefore you can eventually recognize who it is. This example shows,\naccording to Ramus, that a method which proceeds from the general to\nthe particular is not arbitrary but natural (Ramus, Quod sit unica\ndoctrinae instituendae methodus, p. 117). Since it was obvious,\nat least to Ramus, that an argument is more general than an\naxioma, or proposition, and that an axioma is more\ngeneral than a syllogism, this proved that his way of organizing logic\nwas the correct one. The other arts should, of course, be constructed\nin the same way. In medicine, for example, it is natural to start with\nthe whole body before you go on to the limbs. When you cure a man who\nhas a wound on his forehead, you can either say that you cure him or\nhis whole body, but not that you cure his eyes or his belly, which,\nlike his forehead, are parts of his body (Ramus, Dialectica\n1569: 487). \nThis method was an important part of Ramus’ logic since it had\ndirect relevance for his philosophy as a whole. Every art must be\nfounded on it, given that it was not merely the correct but the only\nmethod. In describing the arts, he and his followers often used large\ndichotomies, set out in diagrams or bracketed tables; but it is important to\nnote that these dichotomies were an instrument to display the\nstructure of an art. They were not—as many historians have\nsupposed—the same thing as the method. Ramus thought it\nessential to construct a system of precepts arranged according to\ntheir degree of generalization, always starting with the more general\nand proceeding toward the more specific. This would make the method\nnatural, so that it reflects nature, just as the arts do. To stress\nthis point, Ramus in some of his writings preferred to call the second\npart of logic not iudicium but dispositio or\narrangement. \nConsidering Ramus’ desire to make logic responsive to the needs\nof the humanities, it is reasonable to ask whether the method was\napplicable to artificial products such as poetry or only to natural\nthings. Ramus was aware of the difficulty of demonstrating his natural\nmethod in literature. This was a particular problem for him since he\nwanted students to learn the method by reading the great authors of\nantiquity. According to him, the method was also used by poets like\nVirgil and Horace. He had to admit, however, that the ancients had\nsometimes intentionally departed from it. Therefore, in earlier\neditions of the Dialectica he had included another method, a\nmethodus prudentiae, which, as he pointed out, was really no\ndifferent from the one method. The confusion occasioned by this\nspecial method, however, led Ramus to remove it from later editions of\nthe treatise. Instead, he talked about a methodi secunda\nillustratio, that is, a second representation of the one method\n(Ramus, Dialectica 1623: 93; see Hotson 2007: 48). \nIt has already been pointed out that Ramus had little interest in the\nprecise requirements for attaining scientific knowledge but was\ninstead primarily concerned with curriculum reforms. Yet he by no\nmeans rejected Aristotelian epistemology, and he accepted that the\nprinciples of every art should be based on experience and observation.\nThe process of acquiring knowledge should consist of four steps, as we\ncan see in the following example. In the first place, we feel\nintoxicated. Secondly, we realize by means of observation\nthat this feeling may have been induced by wine, since we have\nconsumed a great deal of it. But is there actually a causal connection\nbetween our consumption of wine and our feeling of drunkenness? To\nestablish certain knowledge, it is necessary, thirdly, to examine by\nmeans of induction the effects of drinking wine, so that we\ncan conclude that the wine is genuinely the cause of our drunkenness.\nFourthly, we can by means of experience use our knowledge to\navoid getting drunk next time. \nAccording to Ramus, there are always three essential aspects of every\nart which need to be considered: nature, principles and practice\n(exercitatio). It was the third element, practice, which was\nessential, for it was through practice that one demonstrated that the\nart and its principles were correct. If they were correct, the art was\nuseful and constructed according to nature. All three elements were\nthus closely connected, and Ramus often presented the various arts by\nsetting out their three main parts (as, for instance, in the\nDialecticae institutiones). \nWe have seen that Ramus considered it extremely important to follow\nthe natural method. When, however, it came to practice, this was not\nalways possible. Sometimes it was necessary to start with the most\nparticular, at other times the most general. Practice, moreover,\nrequired analysis as well as synthesis. Ramus wanted students to learn\nlogic by reading and practicing the way we naturally think and argue.\nAn oration or even a poem could reveal how the principles of logic\nwork in practice. We should start by analyzing the text in order to\nsee how it is constructed according to logical principles: what\nproblem is being considered, what arguments are chosen and so on.\nAfter this has been done, the text is further analyzed with help of\nthe main parts of logic, inventio and iudicium, and\nafterwards by the minor parts: the propositions, syllogisms and\nsuchlike (Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, cols 192–193; Cf. Ong 1958:\n263–267). When the analysis is completed, it is time for\nstudents to move on to synthesis, the part of practice that Ramus\nusually referred to as genesis. At this stage students were\nexpected to imitate, more or less, the procedure which they had\npreviously studied by means of analysis. This was a crucial moment\nbecause they could now show how useful their studies had been by\ndemonstrating the ways in which they had benefited from their\ntheoretical knowledge. \nThe same procedure could be applied to any art since analysis involved\ntextual study. When reading Aristotle’s Physics or\nPliny’s Natural History, students did not examine\nnature but rather what the ancients thought about natural things.\nAlthough this made it possible for them to apply the same procedure,\nbut from a different angle, to other ancient texts, it also restricted\ntheir studies to a great extent by focusing solely on texts. It\ncertainly showed that Ramus’ real intention was to make the\ncurriculum useful to students of the humanities and to future scholars\nand also, by making the course of studies as short and effective as\npossible, to a new category of student, aiming for a different type of\noccupation (Hooykaas 1958: 22; Skalnik 2002: 8). \nAs a young lecturer Ramus was accused of violating the rules of the\nUniversity of Paris; and the specific charge was of combining the\ndifferent arts and bringing the study of ancient orators into them.\nThe university statutes prescribed that studies should proceed in a\nspecific order, starting with grammar, followed by rhetoric and so on.\nFor instance, students were expected to read Cicero’s orations\nbefore they went on to logic, which entailed memorizing a large number\nof rules and mnemonic aids such as the pons asinorum, which\nhelped them to find the correct middle terms for various types of\nsyllogism. This accusation may seem somewhat paradoxical given that\nRamus was very anxious not to confuse the arts in any way. Modern\nscholars have emphasized this point too much and overlooked the fact\nthat Ramus actually made a very clear distinction between manuals or\ntextbooks and practice. Nancelius describes the importance Ramus\nattached to combining the different arts in practice and notes that he\nintroduced an educational exercise at his own college, which,\naccording to Nancelius, made all his students more learned and better\norators than at other colleges. It was decisive for Ramus to teach his\ndisciples how to put their knowledge into practice. The curriculum\nthat he himself had followed in his youth, on the other hand, had\nforced students to complete the study of one art before proceeding to\nthe next. Ramus turned this upside down. The arts should be kept\ncompletely separate. When, however, students put what they had learned\ninto practice, they should not hesitate to combine the contents of\ndifferent arts. On the contrary, it was necessary for them to do so in\norder to make their studies truly useful (Nancelius Petri Rami\nVita: 189–193; Mack 2011: 9). \nRamus systematized the arts according to his method, which stated that\neach art or doctrina should have exclusive rights to its own\nprinciples. One result of this was that, as mentioned above, he\ntotally rejected metaphysics as a discipline, since ontological issues\ncould not be separated from logical ones. Another was that he defined\nrhetoric as having only two parts: style and delivery\n(elocutio and pronuntiatio). This was an extremely\nradical transformation of rhetoric, which was usually considered to\nhave three additional parts (inventio, iudicium and\nmemoria). It is easy to understand why he excluded\ninventio and iudicium from rhetoric, since he\nregarded them as belonging to dialectic. As Mack points out, this did\nnot in any way mean that Ramus thought that the practice of rhetoric\ncould be restricted solely to style and delivery. On the contrary, he\nstrongly maintained that all the parts of rhetoric and dialectic were\nclosely intertwined in performance; and Mack underlines that Ramus in\nno way wanted to reduce the scope of rhetoric:  \nRamus’ rhetoric and dialectic textbooks take a strongly\ndialectical approach to a syllabus which is primarily rhetorical.\n(Mack 2011: 13)  \nHowever, Ramus’ reason for removing memoria, memory,\nwas typically Ramist. All arts had to be methodologically adapted to\nnature. Since the natural order is also basically our normal way of\nthinking, a genuine knowledge of any art must always be easy for us to\nremember. Therefore, we do not need the aids supplied by\nmnemonics. \nAs has already been noted, Ramus’ endeavors to increase the\nefficiency of education and, in this way, make it possible for\nstudents of lesser means to study, pushed him to change the curriculum\nradically and shorten it. It would take no more than seven years to\ncomplete, which was a considerable reduction compared to all other\ncurricula. Nevertheless, he included some mathematical sub-disciplines\nsuch as mechanics that were normally not studied. His lectures on the\nhistory of mathematics revealed an increasing disapproval of the\nancient Greeks’ inclination for making mathematics too abstract\nand, consequently, neglecting its application; Euclid was considered\none of those who was most to blame. Ramus even censured Archimedes for\nnot having assigned sufficient importance to utility and for having\nbeen too prone to direct his projects towards pure contemplation.\nRamus himself lauded the way the German city of Nuremberg had instead\nsupported and encouraged the study of the mechanical arts; for him,\nsuch a syllabus was the key to the future (Ramus, Scholarum\nmathematicarum, p. 28 and Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, pp. 136–137, and see Hotson 2007:\n80). \nIn a letter of 1551 to his patron, the Cardinal of Lorraine, Ramus\nwrote that he had heard a rumor that he was considered to be an\nacademicus, that is, an adherent of the Academic school or,\nin other words, a skeptic, who taught his students to doubt. Although\nRamus firmly rejected this accusation, he had difficulties in clearing\nhimself of the charge (Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, p. 327). \nFrom the very beginning he had criticized the scholastics for\nphilosophizing, not in order to reach the truth, but to endorse the\nviews of their master. Ramus accused them of treating Aristotle as\ninfallible and said that in doing so they subordinated their own\nreason to blind faith in authority. In this respect, they were by no\nmeans true Aristotelians, for:  \nAristotle philosophized with the utmost freedom and, for the sake of\nthe truth, he held views with utter freedom, against the entire\ntradition of the past, including his teacher Plato. And he practiced\nthe art of logic not only in short debates but also in continuous\ndisputations, in which both sides of the question were discussed. It\nwas, in fact, his interpreters who rejected the freedom to seek and\ndefend the truth. (Ramus, Scholae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, col. 29) \nIf Freigius’ account of the 1536 disputation is correct (see\n §2.2\n above), this was one of the very few occasions when Ramus really did\nattack Aristotle. On the whole, as we have seen, he tried to separate\nAristotle from his later commentators, and he often explained the\nmistakes of Aristotelian philosophy as the result of bad interpreters\nwho had distorted Aristotle’s original meaning. For Ramus, as\nfor other humanists, the scholastics became the villains of the\nstory. \nIn the Prior and Posterior Analytics, Aristotle had\nset out a method of attaining reliable knowledge; and in the\nTopics he had dealt with all those instances where it was not\npossible to attain such knowledge. This latter part of logic was\ndominant in the tradition of inventio associated with\nAgricola (see\n §3.2\n above), where the standard practice, attributed to Aristotle by Ramus\nin the passage quoted above, was to discuss both sides of a question\n(in utramque partem disserere). This describes a\nconfrontational situation where one side argues against another,\nresulting in the victory of one or the other position. In such\ncircumstances, however, you can never say that the side which triumphs\nis the absolute winner, though you can come fairly close to a\ndefinitive resolution. In dialectical argumentation, therefore, we\nmust be satisfied with probabilities. But if the very best we can\nattain is probability, the knowledge we reach is not as certain as\nthat which results from a scientific demonstration. Consequently, it\nis more difficult to be fanatically devoted to a particular opinion.\nIn the wake of humanism, ancient skepticism had its own renaissance.\nRamus, however, in line with the majority of humanists, was more of an\neclectic than a skeptic. He regarded Galen as his ideal since he had\nborrowed from earlier thinkers what he considered to be good and\nuseful for his own theories (Ramus, Dialectica 1569: 11 and\n27). \nAdopting radical skepticism in this period would have laid Ramus open\nto the serious charge of holding dangerous philosophical or\ntheological views and even of atheism. It was therefore imperative for\nhim to refute this accusation. To his patron, the cardinal, who had\nexpressed concern over the claim that Ramus was an\nacademicus, he explained that the academici were\nmerely eclectics, who  \ndiffer from other philosophers as free men differ from slaves, as the\nwise differ from the reckless and as the steadfast differ from the\nobstinate.  \nNot surprisingly, Ramus declared that he would rather be a philosopher\nthan the slave of a philosopher (Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, pp. 55 and 89). There was no danger in\nallowing men to think freely, he maintained, since true reason can\nnever be wrong. As long as we used our ability to understand the\nnatural order, everything would turn out well in the end. Risks arose\nwhen we did not dare to trust our own reason but instead, like the\nscholastics, uncritically adopted the opinions of others. \nRamus’ belief in the freedom to philosophize and his eclecticism\ncaused difficulties for his followers. If they showed too much\nenthusiasm for Ramus’ ideas, would they not also be accused of\nbeing the slaves of their master? Ramus himself was aware of this\nproblem, a kind of “Catch 22” situation. “What\nprevents us”, he wrote,  \nfrom briefly playing Socrates and, having left aside all our trust in\nAristotelian authority, asking: is this the true and correct art of\ndialectic? Perhaps the Philosopher deceives us with his authority?\n(Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in liberales\nartes, col. 155)  \nHere we see the great respect that Ramus and his adherents had for\nSocrates, whom they regarded as their hero. Ramus associated his own\ndialectical procedure with the method used by Socrates,  \nwhose main intention was to draw those with whom he debated away from\nviews based on opinions and the testimonies of other people and to\nlead them toward mental composure and freedom of judgement ….\n(ibid.) \nAlthough his followers preferred to call their philosophy Socratic\nrather than Ramist, in order to avoid the accusation of slavish trust\nin his authority, this tactic was not very successful. One of his most\ndevoted disciples, Guilielmus Adolphus Scribonius, attacked another\nRamist for departing from the teaching of the Dialectica and\nfor criticizing Ramus. Yet, at the same time, he emphatically declared\nthat every adherent of Ramist philosophy must swear to the principle\nof libertas philosophandi, the freedom to philosophize.\nScribonius was certainly aware of the difficulty of striking a balance\nbetween total freedom and permitting support for a particular school.\nHe tried to resolve it by maintaining that while all philosophers were\nto some degree wrong, Ramus, like Socrates, had almost always been\nright. By adopting this position, however, he took some of the sting\nout of his own criticism of the insufficiently faithful Ramist, as the\nlatter was quick to point out (Sellberg 1979: 106–107). \nNeither Ramus nor his followers felt able to extend this freedom to\ntheological questions, though their scholastic opponents accused them\nof having done so. In the end, they had to concede so many\nrestrictions on the freedom to philosophize that hardly anything\nremained. \nSome of Ramus’ opponents called him usuarius or\nusurarius. Both words derive etymologically from the Latin verb\nuti, to use or to receive benefit from. The second term,\nusurarius, is directly related to usura, interest.\nIts application to Ramus was, no doubt, intended as a criticism,\nindicating that he was strutting around in borrowed finery, perhaps\ncombined with an imputation of avarice. According to Nancelius, his\nfortune was modest but still substantial enough for him to defray the\ncosts of endowing a professorship (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita:\n243). By insisting that studies should be useful, humanists were\nattacking the scholastics for promoting what they regarded as a\nuseless curriculum. Ramus, along with other humanists, often ridiculed\nthe meaningless rules and facts that young students were compelled to\nmemorize (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 212; cf. Ong 1958:\n321n). It is easy to see why such unsatisfactory practices in the\nuniversities were condemned and why a humanist like Ramus was deeply\nunsympathetic toward the bad Latin which scholastics regularlarly and\ndeliberately employed in disputations to express their logical type of\nlinguistic arguments:  \nIncredible as it seems, it is nevertheless true and can be found in\npublished books that at this famous university there have been\nteachers who stubbornly maintained and defended the view that Ego\namat (‘I loves’) is as correct as Ego amo\n(‘I love’). (Ramus, Scholae grammaticae, in\nScholae in liberales artes, col. 15) \nAs we have seen, Ramus wanted the study of every art to be directed\ntoward practice. There was no point in memorizing rules unless one\nalso learned how to use them. In this respect he was a pioneer in the\nfield of pedagogy. When lecturing, he would not rattle off one\nparagraph after another, but instead would comment on the text page by\npage, a habit which earned him the nickname paginarius, the\n“page man”. He set out to reform the curriculum, and he\nwrote books that would fit in with the new demands of the age. Not\nsurprisingly, his innovative ideas attracted interest from those\noutside the universities. The king of France and other rulers were\nkeen to hire well-educated officials for their expanding\nadministrations, enabling them to reduce their dependence on the\nchurch. They therefore lent their enthusiastic support to Ramus’\ncall for useful studies. \nAs a humanist, Ramus was also interested in including the humanities\nwithin the encyclopedia of learning. He himself intended to edit and\ncomment on every speech of Cicero. His lectures were famous and,\naccording to Nancelius, his spoken Latin was eloquent (Nancelius\nPetri Rami Vita: 207). Although he did not want rhetoric and\nphilosophy to be confused as arts, he certainly wanted logic and\nrhetoric to be integral parts of the student’s practice in every\ndiscipline; and he specifically wanted to make logic more useful for\nthe humanities (see\n §3.4\n above). \nRamus was neither a bad logician nor a bad philosopher. Nonetheless,\nhis work in these fields does not earn him a prominent\nplace in the history of logic or philosophy. But this was not what he\nset out to achieve. His goal was to reform university teaching of the\narts; and he deserves to be regarded as a pedagogical trailblazer,\neven though he perhaps lacked the originality and creativity of a\nthinker such as Jan Amos Comenius (1592–1670). \nNancelius reminds us that Ramus was accused by his opponents of  \nintroducing poets and orators into the schools, and of claiming that\nyou could derive from them the benefit not only of speaking well, but\nthe sure practice of the whole philosophy, especially ethics, rhetoric\nand logic. (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 213)  \nIt was not, in any case, his originality that brought him to a\nposition of eminence among his contemporaries. The reason for his\nenormous impact, within both the university and the wider society, was\nhis capacity to perceive new needs and to respond to new demands. His\nprogram of educational reform was, for instance, well suited to the\nReformation but even more so to the demands of the early modern\nstates, which needed better educated officials and manufacturers,\ncraftsmen and businessmen. Because Ramist logic made possible a more\nconcise presentation of different questions, it proved more\nadvantageous than scholasticism to Protestant theologians, who began\nto set out their doctrines in the form of loci or brief\npassages on a specific topic. Toward the end of the sixteenth century,\nseveral Protestant professors tried to combine the ideas of Ramus with\nthose of the Lutheran educational reformer Philipp Melanchthon\n(1497–1560). \nRamus appealed to statesmen and to humanists on account of his\nendeavors to promote the humanities, especially the study of ancient\nculture and languages. His anti-scholastic and anti-Aristotelian\noutbursts attracted other groups who, sometimes erroneously, regarded\nhim as an ally. The emphasis which he and other humanists laid on the\nusefulness of studies was a means to transform learned culture and\nadjust it to the new demands of modern states. \nFor the last 50 years Ramus has been at the center of considerable\nscholarly interest and activity. Modern scholars are divided on some\nbasic points. There are those such as Bruyère-Robinet who strongly\ndisagree with Ong’s disparaging opinion about Ramus as a philosopher\nand think instead that his departure from the Aristotelian tradition\nand all his writings stemmed from a Platonic ontological outlook,\nwhich he never abandoned. From such a point of view, Ramus was a\nconsistent philosopher and creator of a coherent system. Thus, his\ncensure of Aristotle was not directed only against scholastic abuse of\nAristotelianism.  Other scholars, however, are not so sure on this point and have\nresearched Ramus from other perspectives. The focus has gradually\nshifted from examining Ramus’ own works — even if several\nof his books have been edited, and various aspects of his textbooks,\nlectures and commentaries have been explored — to tracing their\nsignificance and influence. Studies have been devoted to his followers and to the political and\nsocial context in which he developed his ideas and not least to a\nbetter understanding of the impact his writings and his program had on\nthe education in early-modern Europe. We now know more about Ramus’\nown pedagogical ideas and his radical ambition to reform higher\neducation, as well as his political outlook, at least in general\nterms. We also know that, contrary to early assumptions, his ideas did\nnot have a confessional impact. His pedagogical program was not\ncarried out primarily at Reformed universities. Undoubtedly, however,\nhis violent death made him into a martyr for the Reformers and even\nfor other Protestants. Indeed, it was not at old and well-established\nuniversities that professors lectured from the Ramist textbooks but\ninstead at poorer and less renowned schools such as gymnasia\nor gymnasia illustria. From this perspective, the importance\nof Ramus’ program cannot be overestimated. In small Hanseatic cities\nand imperial counties and principalities, it became possible, thanks\nto the Ramist curriculum, to found schools and teach young students,\nin an adequate way, to fulfill a variety of future positions. Of\ncourse, the new pedagogical forms and syllabuses were not well\nreceived by everyone in the republic of learning. As has already been\nnoted, the humanists had difficulties accepting such condensed studies\nof classical literature, and anyone interested in digging deep into\nphilosophical problems was likely to find concise Ramist summaries\ninsufficient. As Hotson had demonstrated, this resistance did not\ndefeat the impact of the Ramist textbooks, but it did change it. At\nthe end of the 16th century, several authors and professors tried to\ncombine Ramist doctrine and the best of his ideas with a more thorough\noutline of Aristotelian philosophy, in order to produce a kind of\ncompendium or systematized presentation from which students could\nefficiently benefit in a relatively short space of time. Instead of\nspending several years reading Aristotle’s treatises, lengthy\ncommentaries or other ancient texts, a host of poor university\nstudents could study the Ramist compendia which replaced these\nworks. This sometimes makes it difficult to decide if a certain author\nshould be categorized as a Ramist, a semi-Ramist or\na Philippo-Ramist; but Wilson has suggested a conceivable way\nto determine if a logical textbook puts forward what she identifies as\na more Aristotelian logic of stasis or rather, in the Ramist manner, a\nlogic of dynamism. With the latter Wilson means a focusing on the\nmoving parts of logic like verbs rather than on nouns which the\nAristotelian textbooks seemed to prefer. She demonstrates a short way\nto arbitrate which of the two practices gain the upper hand by looking\non the system of chapters in the textbooks, of which those more\ncharacteristic of Aristotelianism begin with the predicables\nand the predicaments while the Ramist ones rather start\nwith inventio and then the headings cause, form, end and\neffect and so on. The inclination to either dynamism or stasis would\nthen be discernible even in all those textbooks that in a different\nextent were mixtures of a Ramist and an Aristotelian logic (Wilson\n2019; cf. Feingold 2001 & Freedman 1993). Studies of Ramus’ influence on learned and pedagogical programs\nhave been devoted to his many adherents in early modern Europe and to\nthe different circumstances in which these individuals developed his\ncurriculum. In Northern and Central Europe, Ramus’ textbooks, both in\nLatin and in the vernacular, were frequently used and admired but they\nalso aroused resistance (Reid and Wilson 2011; Knight and Wilson\n2019). There is also an increasing scholarly concentration on the\ninfluence of Ramus and Ramism on vernacular literature. The famous\n1555 edition of his dialectic in French was followed by others in\nvarious different vernaculars. And by employing the vernacular the\nworks of the Pléiade and of Ramus converged in Paris. Even\nthough scholars have tried to find more substantial links to the\nPléiade in other fields, few have been found. Frequent studies\non grammar and in particular on Ramus’ and Talon’s many rhetoric\ntextbooks have encouraged studies and debates about their impact on\nliterature and culture. Inspired by Tuve’s classic work on\nmetaphysical imagery, scholars have discussed what consequence of\nRamus’ putting the arts of rhetoric and dialectic into common practice\nmay have had. Another controversy concerns Ramus’ impact on literature and the\nhumanities. Grafton and Jardine have argued that Ramism meant a step\naway from humanism toward a kind of pragmatism; but against these\nconclusions, Henderson has maintained that even if Ramus wanted to\nachieve too much with his one method, his ambition had been to\nunite rhetoric with philosophy, including moral philosophy. On\nthe other hand, Sharratt has pinpointed Ramus’ lack of literary\nsensibility as a reason why he never succeeded in making his philosophy\na part of the humanist tradition. At English educational institutions,\nRamism often was considered a threat to the humanities (Grafton &\nJardine 1986, Henderson 1999, Couzinet 2015, Sharratt 1976 &\nFeingiold 2001).","contact.mail":"erland.sellberg@idehist.su.se","contact.domain":"idehist.su.se"}]
