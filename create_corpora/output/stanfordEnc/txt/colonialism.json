One of the difficulties in\ndefining colonialism is that it is hard to distinguish it from\nimperialism. Frequently the two concepts are treated as synonyms. Like\ncolonialism, imperialism also involves political and economic control\nover a dependent territory. The etymology of the two terms, however,\nprovides some clues about how they differ. The term colony comes from\nthe Latin word colonus, meaning farmer. This root reminds us\nthat the practice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of\npopulation to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent\nsettlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of\norigin. Imperialism, on the other hand, comes from the Latin term\nimperium, meaning to command. Thus, the term imperialism\ndraws attention to the way that one country exercises power over\nanother, whether through settlement, sovereignty, or indirect\nmechanisms of control.\n\n\nThe legitimacy of colonialism has been a longstanding concern for\npolitical and moral philosophers in the Western tradition. At least\nsince the Crusades and the conquest of the Americas, political\ntheorists have struggled with the difficulty of reconciling ideas\nabout justice and natural law with the practice of European\nsovereignty over non-Western peoples. In the nineteenth century, the\ntension between liberal thought and colonial practice became\nparticularly acute, as dominion of Europe over the rest of the world\nreached its zenith. Ironically, in the same period when most political\nphilosophers began to defend the principles of universalism and\nequality, the same individuals still defended the legitimacy of\ncolonialism and imperialism. One way of reconciling those apparently\nopposed principles was the argument known as the “civilizing\nmission,” which suggested that a temporary period of political\ndependence or tutelage was necessary in order for\n“uncivilized” societies to advance to the point where they\nwere capable of sustaining liberal institutions and\nself-government.\n\n\nThe goal of this entry is to analyze the relationship between Western\npolitical theory and the project of colonialism. After providing a\nmore thorough discussion of the concept of colonialism, this entry\nwill explain how European thinkers justified, legitimized, and\nchallenged political domination. The third section focuses on\nliberalism and the fourth section briefly discusses the Marxist\ntradition, including Marx’s own defense of British colonialism\nin India and Lenin’s anti-imperialist writings. The fifth\nsection provides an introduction to contemporary “post-colonial\ntheory.” This approach has been particularly influential in\nliterary studies because it draws attention to the diverse ways that\npostcolonial subjectivities are constituted and resisted through\ndiscursive practices. The final section will introduce an Indigenous\ncritique of settler-colonialism that emerges both as a response to\ncolonial practices of domination and dispossession of land, customs\nand traditional history and to post-colonial theories of universalism.\nThe goal of the entry is to provide an overview of the vast and\ncomplex literature that explores the theoretical issues emerging out\nof the experience of European colonization.\n\nColonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of\nexamples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent\nterritory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. The\nancient Greeks set up colonies as did the Romans, the Moors, and the\nOttomans, to name just a few of the most famous examples. Colonialism,\nthen, is not restricted to a specific time or place. Nevertheless, in\nthe sixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of\ntechnological developments in navigation that began to connect more\nremote parts of the world. Fast sailing ships made it possible to\nreach distant ports and to sustain close ties between the center and\ncolonies. Thus, the modern European colonial project emerged when it\nbecame possible to move large numbers of people across the ocean and\nto maintain political sovereignty in spite of geographical dispersion.\nThis entry uses the term colonialism to describe the process of\nEuropean settlement and political control over the rest of the world,\nincluding the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia. \nThe difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the\nterm is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and\nimperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit\nEurope economically and strategically. The term colonialism is\nfrequently used to describe the settlement of North America,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Brazil, places that were\ncontrolled by a large population of permanent European residents. The\nterm imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government\nadministers a territory without significant settlement; typical\nexamples include the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth\ncentury and the American domination of the Philippines and Puerto\nRico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely\nconsistent in the literature. Some scholars distinguish between\ncolonies for settlement and colonies for economic exploitation. Others\nuse the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are directly\ngoverned by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which\ninvolves indirect forms of domination. \nThe confusion about the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the\nway that the concept has changed over time. Although the English word\nimperialism was not commonly used before the nineteenth century,\nElizabethans already described the United Kingdom as “the\nBritish Empire.” As Britain began to acquire overseas\ndependencies, the concept of empire was employed more frequently.\nImperialism was understood as a system of military domination and\nsovereignty over territories. The day to day work of government might\nbe exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers\nwho paid tribute, but sovereignty rested with the British. The shift\naway from this traditional understanding of empire was influenced by\nthe Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards\neconomic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the\nnecessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late\ncapitalism. Thus, for Lenin and subsequent Marxists, imperialism\ndescribed a historical stage of capitalism rather than a\ntrans-historical practice of political and military domination. The\nlasting impact of the Marxist approach is apparent in contemporary\ndebates about American imperialism, a term which usually means\nAmerican economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is\nexercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001). \nGiven the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two\nterms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers\nto the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to\nthe twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation\nmovements of the 1960s. Post-colonialism will be used to describe the\npolitical and theoretical struggles of societies that experienced the\ntransition from political dependence to sovereignty. This entry will\nuse imperialism as a broad term that refers to economic, military,\npolitical domination that is achieved without significant permanent\nEuropean settlement. \nThe Spanish conquest of the Americas sparked a theological, political,\nand ethical debate about the use of military force to acquire control\nover foreign lands. This debate took place within the framework of a\nreligious discourse that legitimized military conquest as a way to\nfacilitate the conversion and salvation of indigenous peoples. The\nidea of a “civilizing mission” was by no means the\ninvention of the British in the nineteenth century. The Spanish\nconquistadores and colonists explicitly justified their activities in\nthe Americas in terms of a religious mission to bring Christianity to\nthe native peoples. The Crusades provided the initial impetus for\ndeveloping a legal doctrine that rationalized the conquest and\npossession of infidel lands. Whereas the Crusades were initially\nframed as defensive wars to reclaim Christian lands that had been\nconquered by non-Christians, the resulting theoretical innovations\nplayed an important role in subsequent attempts to justify the\nconquest of the Americas. The core claim was that the “Petrine\nmandate” to care for the souls of Christ’s human flock\nrequired Papal jurisdiction over temporal as well as spiritual\nmatters, and this control extended to non-believers as well as\nbelievers. \nThe conversion of the native peoples, however, did not provide an\nunproblematic justification for the project of overseas conquest. The\nSpanish conquest of the Americas was taking place during a period of\nreform when humanist scholars within the Church were increasingly\ninfluenced by the natural law theories of theologians such as St.\nThomas Aquinas. According to Pope Innocent IV, war could not be waged\nagainst infidels and they could not be deprived of their property\nsimply because of their non-belief. Under the influence of Thomism,\nInnocent IV concluded that force was legitimate only in cases where\ninfidels violated natural law. Nonbelievers had legitimate dominion\nover themselves and their property, but this dominion was abrogated if\nthey proved incapable of governing themselves according to principles\nthat every reasonable person would recognize. The Spanish quickly\nconcluded that the habits of the native Americans, from nakedness to\nunwillingness to labor to alleged cannibalism, clearly demonstrated\ntheir inability to recognize natural law. This account of native\ncustoms was used to legitimize the enslavement of the Indians, which\nthe Spanish colonists insisted was the only way to teach them\ncivilization and introduce them to Christianity. \nSome of the Spanish missionaries sent to the New World, however,\nnoticed that the brutal exploitation of slave labor was widespread\nwhile any serious commitment to religious instruction was absent.\nMembers of the Dominican order in particular noted the hypocrisy of\nenslaving the Indians because of their alleged barbarity while\npracticing a form of conquest, warfare, and slavery that reduced the\nindigenous population of Hispaniola from 250,000 to 15,000 in two\ndecades of Spanish rule. Given the genocidal result of Spanish\n“civilization,” they began to question the idea of a\ncivilizing mission. Bartolomé de Las Casas and Franciscus de\nVictoria were two of the most influential critics of Spanish colonial\npractice. Victoria gave a series of lectures on Indian rights that\napplied Thomism to the practice of Spanish rule. He argued that all\nhuman beings share the capacity for rationality and have natural\nrights that stem from this capacity. From this premise, he deduced\nthat the Papal decision to grant Spain title to the Americas was\nillegitimate. Unlike the position of Pope Innocent IV, Victoria argued\nthat neither the Pope nor the Spaniards could subjugate the Indians in\norder to punish violations of natural law, such as fornication or\nadultery. He noted that the Pope had no right to make war on\nChristians and take their property simply because they were\n“fornicators or thieves.” If this were the case, then no\nEuropean king’s dominion would ever be safe. Furthermore,\naccording to Victoria, the pope and Christian rulers acting on his\nmandate had even less right to enforce laws against unbelievers,\nbecause they were outside of the Christian community, which was the\ndomain of Papal authority (Williams 1990). \nDespite this strongly worded critique of the dominant modes of\njustifying Spanish conquest, Victoria concluded that the use of force\nin the New World was legitimate when Indian communities violated the\nLaw of Nations, a set of principles derivable from reason and\ntherefore universally binding. At first it might sound contradictory\nthat the Indians’ supposed violation of the natural law did not\njustify conquest but their violation of the Law of Nations, itself\nderived from natural law, did. Victoria emphasizes that the Law of\nNations is binding because “there exists clearly enough a\nconsensus of the greater part of the whole world” (391) and\nbecause the principles benefit “the common good of all.”\nThis distinction seems to rely on the assumption that other principles\nusually associated with natural law (such as the prohibitions on\nadultery and idolatry) only affect those who consent to the practices,\nwhereas violations of the Law of Nations (e.g. prohibitions on\npeaceful travel and trade) have consequences for those who do not\nconsent. Ultimately, Victoria’s understanding of the Law of\nNations led him to defend the practice of Spanish colonialism, even\nthough he emphasized that warfare should be limited to the measures\nrequired to attain the legitimate objectives of peaceful trade and\nmissionary work. Within Victoria’s critique of the legality and\nmorality of Spanish colonialism was a rationalization for conquest,\nalbeit a restrictive one. \nThe legitimacy of colonialism was also a topic of debate among French,\nGerman, and British philosophers in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant, Smith and Diderot were\ncritical of the barbarity of colonialism and challenged the idea that\nEuropeans had the obligation to “civilize” the rest of the\nworld. At first it might seem relatively obvious that Enlightenment\nthinkers would develop a critique of colonialism. The system of\ncolonial domination, which involved some combination of slavery,\nquasi-feudal forced labor, or expropriation of property, is\nantithetical to the basic Enlightenment principle that each individual\nis capable of reason and self-government. The rise of anti-colonial\npolitical theory, however, required more than a universalistic ethic\nthat recognized the shared humanity of all people. As suggested above,\nthe universalism of Thomism proved to be a relatively weak basis for\ncriticizing colonialism. Given the tension between the abstract\nuniversalism of natural law and the actual cultural practices of\nindigenous peoples, it was easy to interpret native difference as\nevidence of the violation of natural law. This in turn became a\njustification for exploitation. \nDiderot was one of the most forceful critics of European colonization.\nIn his contributions to Raynal’s Histoire des deux\nIndes, he challenges the view that indigenous people benefit from\nEuropean civilization and argues that the European colonists are the\nuncivilized ones. He claims that culture (“national\ncharacter”) helps to inculcate morality and reinforces norms of\nrespect, but these norms tend to dissipate when the individual is far\nfrom his country of origin. According to Diderot, colonial empires\nfrequently become the sites of extreme brutality because the colonists\nare far away from legal institutions and informal sanctions and this\nweakens the habits of restraint, exposing natural man’s full\ninstinct for violence (Muthu 2003). \nDiderot also challenges the dominant justifications for European\ncolonialism. Although he grants that it is legitimate to colonize an\narea that is not actually inhabited, he insists that foreign traders\nand explorers have no right of access to fully inhabited lands. This\nis important because the right to commerce (understood to encompass\nnot only trade but also missionary work and exploration) was used as a\njustification for colonization by Spanish thinkers in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth century. Emblematic of this approach was\nVictoria’s conclusion that an indigenous people could not\nexclude peaceful traders and missionaries without violating the Law of\nNations. If the native peoples resisted these incursions, the Spanish\ncould legitimately wage war and conquer their territory. Diderot\nspecifically challenges this view, noting that the European traders\nhad proven themselves “dangerous as guests.” (Muthu 2003:\n75) \nBefore enlightenment thinkers could articulate a compelling critique\nof colonialism, they had to recognize the importance of culture and\nthe possibility of cultural pluralism. The claim that all individuals\nare equally worthy of dignity and respect was a necessary but not\nsufficient basis for anti-imperialist thought. They also had to\nrecognize that the tendency to develop diverse institutions,\nnarratives, and aesthetic practices was an essential human capacity.\nThe French term moeurs or what today would be called culture\ncaptures the idea that the humanity of human beings is expressed in\nthe distinctive practices that they adopt as solutions to the\nchallenges of existence. \nThe work of enlightenment anti-imperialists such as Diderot and Kant\nreflects their struggle with the tension between universalistic\nconcepts such as human rights and the realities of cultural pluralism.\nThe paradox of enlightenment anti-imperialism is that human dignity is\nunderstood to be rooted in the universal human capacity for reason.\nYet when people engage in cultural practices that are unfamiliar or\ndisturbing to the European observer, they appear irrational and thus\nundeserving of recognition and respect. Diderot’s solution was\nto identify particularity as the universal human trait. In other\nwords, he emphasized that human beings all share similar desires to\ncreate workable rules of conduct that allow particular ways of life to\nflourish without themselves creating harsh injustices and cruelties.\n(Muthu 2003: 77) There are infinite varieties of solutions to the\nchallenges posed by human existence. Societies all need to find a way\nto balance individual egoism and sociability and to overcome the\nadversities that stem from the physical environment. From this\nperspective, culture itself, rather than rationality, is the universal\nhuman capacity. \nUnlike many other eighteenth and nineteenth century political\nphilosophers, Diderot did not assume that non-Western societies were\nnecessarily primitive (e.g. lacking political and social organization)\nnor did he assume that more complex forms of social organization were\nnecessarily superior. One of the key issues that distinguished critics\nfrom proponents of colonialism and imperialism was their view of the\nrelationship between culture, history and progress. Many of the\ninfluential philosophers writing in France and England in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries had assimilated some version of\nthe developmental approach to history that was associated with the\nScottish Enlightenment. According to the stadial theory of historical\ndevelopment, all societies naturally moved from hunting, to herding,\nto farming, to commerce, a developmental process that simultaneously\ntracked a cultural arc from “savagery,” through\n“barbarism,” to “civilization.”\n“Civilization” was not just a marker of material\nimprovement, but also a normative judgment about the moral progress of\nsociety. (Kohn and O’Neill 2006) \nThe language of civilization, savagery, and barbarism is pervasive in\nwriters as diverse of Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and John Stuart Mill.\nIt would therefore be incorrect to conclude that a developmental\ntheory of history is distinctive of the liberal tradition;\nnevertheless, given that figures of the Scottish Enlightenment such as\nFerguson and Smith were among its leading expositors, it is strongly\nassociated with liberalism. Smith himself opposed imperialism for\neconomic reasons. He felt that relations of dependence between\nmetropole and periphery distorted self-regulating market mechanisms\nand worried that the cost of military domination would be burdensome\nfor taxpayers (Pitts 2005). The idea that civilization is the\nculmination of a process of historical development, however, proved\nuseful in justifying imperialism. According to Uday Mehta, liberal\nimperialism was the product of the interaction between universalism\nand developmental history (1999). A core doctrine of liberalism holds\nthat all individuals share a capacity for reason and self-government.\nThe theory of developmental history, however, modifies this\nuniversalism with the notion that these capacities only emerge at a\ncertain stage of civilization (McCarthy 2009). For example, according\nto John Stuart Mill (hereafter Mill), savages do not have the capacity\nfor self-government because of their excessive love of freedom. Serfs,\nslaves, and peasants in barbarous societies, on the other hand, may be\nso schooled in obedience that their capacity for rationality is\nstifled. Only commercial society produces the material and cultural\nconditions that enable individuals to realize their potential for\nfreedom and self-government. According to this logic, civilized\nsocieties like Great Britain are acting in the interest of\nless-developed peoples by governing them. Imperialism, from this\nperspective, is not primarily a form of political domination and\neconomic exploitation but rather a paternalistic practice of\ngovernment that exports “civilization” (e.g.\nmodernization) in order to foster the improvement of native peoples.\nDespotic government (and Mill doesn’t hesitate to use this term)\nis a means to the end of improvement and ultimately\nself-government. \nMill, a life-long employee of the British East India Company,\nrecognized that despotic government by a foreign people could lead to\ninjustice and economic exploitation. These abuses, if unchecked, could\nundermine the legitimacy and efficacy of the imperial project. In\nConsiderations on Representative Government (1861), Mill\nidentifies four reasons why foreign (e.g. European) peoples are not\nsuited to governing colonies. First, foreign politicians are unlikely\nto have the knowledge of local conditions that is necessary to solve\nproblems of public policy effectively. Second, given cultural,\nlinguistic, and often religious differences between colonizers and\ncolonized, the colonizers are unlikely to sympathize with the native\npeoples and are likely to act tyrannically. Third, even if the\ncolonizers really try to treat the native peoples fairly, their\nnatural tendency to sympathize with those similar to themselves (other\nforeign colonists or merchants) would likely lead to distorted\njudgment in cases of conflict. Finally, according to Mill, colonists\nand merchants go abroad in order to acquire wealth with little effort\nor risk, which means that their economic activity often exploits the\ncolonized country rather than developing it. These arguments echo\npoints made in Edmund Burke’s voluminous writings assailing the\nmisgovernment in India, most notably Burke’s famous Speech on\nFox’s East India Bill (1783). Recent scholarship, however, has\nchallenged the view of Burke as an opponent of imperialism. Daniel\nO’Neill has argued that Burke was a staunch supporter of the\nBritish Empire in the eighteenth century (2016). According to\nO’Neill, Burke’s defense of empire was ideologically\nconsistent with his conservative opposition to the French Revolution.\n \nMill’s solution to the problem of imperial misgovernment was to\neschew parliamentary oversight in favor of a specialized\nadministrative corps. Members of this specialized body would have the\ntraining to acquire relevant knowledge of local conditions. Paid by\nthe government, they would not personally benefit from economic\nexploitation and could fairly arbitrate conflicts between colonists\nand indigenous people. Mill, however, was not able to explain how to\nensure good government where those wielding political power were not\naccountable to the population. In this sense, Mill’s writing is\nemblematic of the failure of liberal imperial thought. \nNineteenth century liberal thinkers held a range of views on the\nlegitimacy of foreign domination and conquest. Alexis de Tocqueville,\nfor example, made a case for colonialism that did not rely on the idea\nof a “civilizing mission.” Tocqueville recognized that\ncolonialism probably did not bring good government to the native\npeoples, but this did not lead him to oppose colonialism since his\nsupport rested entirely on the way it benefited France. Tocqueville\ninsisted that French colonies in Algeria would increase France’s\nstature vis-à-vis rivals like England. Colonies would provide\nan outlet for excess population that caused disorder in France.\nTocqueville also suggested that imperial endeavors would incite a\nfeeling of patriotism that would counterbalance the modern centrifugal\nforces of materialism and class conflict. \nTocqueville was actively engaged in advancing the project of French\ncolonization of Algeria. Tocqueville’s first analysis of French\ncolonialism was published during his 1837 electoral campaign for a\nseat in the Chamber of Deputies. As a member of the Chamber of\nDeputies, Tocqueville argued in favor of expanding the French presence\nin Algeria. He traveled to Algeria in 1841 composing an “Essay\non Algeria” that served as the basis for two parliamentary\nreports on the topic (Tocqueville 1841). Unlike the more naïve\nproponents of the “civilizing mission,” Tocqueville\nadmitted that the brutal military occupation did little to introduce\ngood government or advance civilization. In an apparent reversal of\nthe four-stages theory of the Scottish Enlightenment, he acknowledged\nthat “we are now fighting far more barbarously than the Arabs\nthemselves” and “it is on their side that one meets with\ncivilization.” (Tocqueville 1841: 70) This realization, however,\ndid not imply a critique of French brutality. Instead, Tocqueville\ndefended controversial tactics such as the destruction of crops,\nconfiscation of land, and seizure of unarmed civilians. His texts,\nhowever, provide little in the way of philosophical justification and\nhe dismisses the entire just war tradition by stating, “I\nbelieve that the right of war authorizes us to ravage the\ncountry.” (Tocqueville 1841: 70). In Tocqueville’s\nwritings on Algeria, the French national interest is paramount and\nmoral considerations are explicitly subordinate to political\ngoals. \nTocqueville’s analysis of Algeria reflects little anxiety about\nits legitimacy and much concern about the pragmatics of effective\ncolonial governance. The stability of the regime, he felt, depended on\nthe ability of the colonial administration to provide good government\nto the French settlers. Tocqueville emphasized that the excessive\ncentralization of decision-making in Paris combined with the arbitrary\npractices of the local military leadership meant that French colonists\nhad no security of property, let alone the political and civil rights\nthat they were accustomed to France. Tocqueville was untroubled by the\nuse of martial law against indigenous peoples, but felt that it was\ncounterproductive when applied to the French. For Tocqueville, the\nsuccess of the French endeavor in Algeria depended entirely on\nattracting large numbers of permanent French settlers. Given that it\nwas proving impossible to win the allegiance of the indigenous people,\nFrance could not hold Algeria without creating a stable community of\ncolonists. The natives were to be ruled through military domination\nand the French were to be enticed to settle through the promise of\neconomic gain in an environment that reproduced, as much as possible,\nthe cultural and political life of France. After a brief period of\noptimism about “amalgamation” of the races in his\n“Second Letter on Algeria” (Tocqueville 1837: 25),\nTocqueville understood the colonial world in terms of the permanent\nopposition of settler and native, an opposition structured to ensure\nthe economic benefit of the former. \nRecent scholarship has also drawn attention to the writings of less\ncanonical figures (Bell 2016). In Mr. Mothercountry, Keally\nMcBride (2016) focuses on the career of James Stephen and uses new\narchival research to explore the gap between the practice of colonial\nadministration and the ideal of the rule of law. In Alibis of\nEmpire: Henry Maine and the Ends of Liberal Imperialism, Karuna\nMantena (2010) challenges the idea that liberal notions of progress\nand civilization played a central role in the justification of\nVictorian empire. Mantena shows that the work of Victorian legal\nscholar Henry Maine played an important role in the shift toward a new\nculturalism that emphasized the dangers and difficulties of trying to\ncivilize native peoples.  \nIn recent years, scholars have devoted less attention to the debates\non colonialism within the Marxist tradition. This reflects the waning\ninfluence of Marxism in the academy and in political practice.\nMarxism, however, has influenced both post-colonial theory and\nanti-colonial independence movements around the world. Marxists have\ndrawn attention to the material basis of European political expansion\nand developed concepts that help explain the persistence of economic\nexploitation after the end of direct political rule. \nAlthough Marx never developed a theory of colonialism, his analysis of\ncapitalism emphasized its inherent tendency to expand in search of new\nmarkets. In his classic works such as The Communist\nManifesto, Grundrisse, and Capital, Marx\npredicted that the bourgeoisie would continue to create a global\nmarket and undermine both local and national barriers to its own\nexpansion. Expansion is a necessary product of the core dynamic of\ncapitalism: overproduction. Competition among producers drives them to\ncut wages, which in turn leads to a crisis of under-consumption. The\nonly way to prevent economic collapse is to find new markets to absorb\nexcess consumer goods. From a Marxist perspective, some form of\nimperialism is inevitable. By exporting population to resource rich\nforeign territories, a nation creates a market for industrial goods\nand a reliable source of natural resources. Alternately, weaker\ncountries can face the choice of either voluntarily admitting foreign\nproducts that will undermine domestic industry or submitting to\npolitical domination, which will accomplish the same end. \nIn a series of newspaper articles published in the 1850s in the\nNew York Daily Tribune, Marx specifically discussed the\nimpact of British colonialism in India. His analysis was consistent\nwith his general theory of political and economic change. He described\nIndia as an essentially feudal society experiencing the painful\nprocess of modernization. According to Marx, however, Indian\n“feudalism” was a distinctive form of economic\norganization. He reached this conclusion because he believed\n(incorrectly) that agricultural land in India was owned communally.\nMarx used the concept of “Oriental despotism” to describe\na specific type of class domination that used the state’s power\nof taxation in order to extract resources from the peasantry.\nAccording to Marx, oriental despotism emerged in India because\nagricultural productivity depended on large-scale public works such as\nirrigation that could only be financed by the state. This meant that\nthe state could not be easily replaced by a more decentralized system\nof authority. In Western Europe, feudal property could be transformed\ngradually into privately owned, alienable property in land. In India,\ncommunal land ownership made this impossible, thereby blocking the\ndevelopment of commercial agriculture and free markets. Since\n“Oriental despotism” inhibited the indigenous development\nof economic modernization, British domination became the agent of\neconomic modernization. \nMarx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing\nmodernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent\nrationalization for foreign domination. His account of British\ndomination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows\ntowards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the\nimmense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to\nbourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both\nnecessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration\nof foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India. For Marx,\nthis upheaval has both positive and negative consequences. When\npeasants lose their traditional livelihoods, there is a great deal of\nhuman suffering, but he also points out that traditional village\ncommunities are hardly idyllic; they are sites of caste oppression,\nslavery, misery, and cruelty. The first stage of the modernization\nprocess is entirely negative, because poor people pay heavy taxation\nto support British rule and endure the economic upheaval that results\nfrom the glut of cheaply produced English cotton. Eventually, however,\nBritish merchants begin to realize that Indians cannot pay for\nimported cloth or British administration if they don’t\nefficiently produce goods to trade, which provides an incentive for\nBritish investment in production and infrastructure. Even though Marx\nbelieved that British rule was motivated by greed and exercised\nthrough cruelty, he felt it was still the agent of progress. Thus,\nMarx’s discussion of British rule in India has three dimensions:\nan account of the progressive character of foreign rule, a critique of\nthe human suffering involved, and a concluding argument that British\nrule must be temporary if the progressive potential is to be\nrealized. \nLenin developed his analysis of Western economic and political\ndomination in his pamphlet Imperialism: The Highest Stage of\nCapitalism (1917) (see Other Internet Resources). Lenin took a\nmore explicitly critical view of imperialism. He noted that\nimperialism was a technique which allowed European countries to put\noff the inevitable domestic revolutionary crisis by exporting their\nown economic burdens onto weaker states. Lenin argued that\nlate-nineteenth century imperialism was driven by the economic logic\nof late-capitalism. The falling rate of profit caused an economic\ncrisis that could only be resolved through territorial expansion.\nCapitalist conglomerates were compelled to expand beyond their\nnational borders in pursuit of new markets and resources. In a sense,\nthis analysis is fully consistent with Marx, who saw European\ncolonialism as continuous with the process of internal expansion\nwithin states and across Europe. Both Marx and Lenin thought that\ncolonialism and imperialism resulted from the same logic that drove\nthe economic development and modernization of peripheral areas in\nEurope. But there was one distinctive element of Lenin’s\nanalysis. Since late capitalism was organized around national\nmonopolies, the competition for markets took the form of military\ncompetition between states over territories that could be dominated\nfor their exclusive economic benefit. \nMarxist theorists including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, and Nikolai\nBukharin also explored the issue of imperialism. Kautsky’s\nposition is especially important because his analysis introduced\nconcepts that continue to play a prominent role in contemporary world\nsystems theory and post-colonial studies. Kautsky challenges the\nassumption that imperialism would lead to the development of the areas\nsubjected to economic exploitation. He suggests that imperialism is a\nrelatively permanent relationship structuring the interactions between\ntwo types of countries. (Young 2001) Although imperialism initially\ntook the form of military competition between capitalist countries, it\nwould result in collusion between capitalist interests to maintain a\nstable system of exploitation of the non-developed world. The most\ninfluential contemporary proponent of this view is Immanuel\nWallerstein, who is known for world-systems theory. According to this\ntheory, the world-system is a relatively stable set of relations\nbetween core and peripheral states. This international division of\nlabor is structured to benefit the core states (Wallerstein\n1974–1989) and transfers resources from the periphery to the\ncore. \nFrom the perspective of world-systems theory, the economic\nexploitation of the periphery does not necessarily require direct\npolitical or military domination. In a similar vein, contemporary\nliterary theorists have drawn attention to practices of representation\nthat reproduce a logic of subordination that endures even after former\ncolonies gain independence. The field of postcolonial studies was\ninfluenced by Edward Said’s path-breaking book\nOrientalism. In Orientalism Said applied Michel\nFoucault’s technique of discourse analysis to the production of\nknowledge about the Middle East. The term orientalism described a\nstructured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive practices that\nwere used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge about\nnon-European peoples. Said’s analysis made it possible for\nscholars to deconstruct literary and historical texts in order to\nunderstand how they reflected and reinforced the imperialist project.\nUnlike previous studies that focused on the economic or political\nlogics of colonialism, Said drew attention to the relationship between\nknowledge and power. By foregrounding the cultural and epistemological\nwork of imperialism, Said was able to undermine the ideological\nassumption of value-free knowledge and show that “knowing the\nOrient” was part of the project of dominating it.\nOrientalism can be seen as an attempt to extend the\ngeographical and historical terrain of the poststructuralist critique\nof Western epistemology. \nSaid uses the term Orientalism in several different ways. First,\nOrientalism is a specific field of academic study about the Middle\nEast and Asia, albeit one that Said conceives quite expansively to\nencompass history, sociology, literature, anthropology and especially\nphilology. He also identifies it as a practice that helps define\nEurope by creating a stable depiction of its other, its constitutive\noutside. Orientalism is a way of characterizing Europe by drawing a\ncontrasting image or idea, based on a series of binary oppositions\n(rational/irrational, mind/body, order/chaos) that manage and displace\nEuropean anxieties. Finally, Said emphasizes that it is also a mode of\nexercising authority by organizing and classifying knowledge about the\nOrient. This discursive approach is distinct both from the materialist\nview that knowledge is simply a reflection of economic or political\ninterests and from the idealist view that scholarship is disinterested\nand neutral. Following Foucault, Said describes discourse as a form of\nknowledge that is not used instrumentally in service of power but\nrather is itself a form of power. \nThe second quasi-canonical contribution to the field of post-colonial\ntheory is Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern\nSpeak?” (1988). Spivak works within Said’s problematic of\nrepresentation but extends it to the contemporary academy. Spivak\nquestions the idea of transparent subaltern speech. When well-meaning\nscholars want to let the subaltern “speak for themselves”\nthey hope that removing the intermediary (the expert, the judge, the\nimperial administrator, the local elite) will enable some authentic\ntruth based on experience to emerge. But experience itself is\nconstituted through representation; therefore denying the problem of\nrepresentation does not make it go away but only makes it harder to\nrecognize. The central claim of the essay is that\n“representation has not withered away.” Since power is\neverywhere, even in language itself, transparency and authenticity are\nimpossible; this means that the messy and controversial work of\ninterpretation is necessary.  \nAijaz Ahmad has argued that, despite Spivak’s claims to be\nworking within the Marxist tradition, her essays exhibit contempt for\nmaterialism, rationalism, and progress, the core features of Marxism\n(Ahmad 1997). According to Ahmad, Spivak is concerned with narratives\nof capitalism rather than the institutional structures and material\neffects of capitalism as a mode of production. Spivak’s sharp\ncriticism of movements that essentialize subaltern subjects casts\ndoubt on the basic premise of Marxist politics, which privileges the\nproletariat as a group with shared, true interests that are produced\nby the capitalist system. \nVivek Chibber (2013) and Dipesh Chakrabarty (2007) have taken up these\nissues. In his influential book Provincializing Europe,\nChakrabarty argues that distinctively European concepts such as\ndisenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty inform the social\nsciences. When these standards are treated as universal, the third\nworld is seen as incomplete or lacking. Chibber challenges the\nposition. Chibber advances a critique of Subaltern Studies and defends\nuniversal categories such as capitalism, class, rationality, and\nobjectivity. He argues that these categories need not be reductionist\nor Eurocentric and that they are useful in illuminating the motivation\nof political actors and the structural constraints faced by leaders in\ncountries such as India.  \nThis debate reflects a tension that runs through the field of\npostcolonial studies. Although some thinkers draw on both Marxism and\npoststructuralism, the two theories have different goals, methods, and\nassumptions. In the humanities, postcolonial theory tends to reflect\nthe influence of poststructuralist thought, while theorists of\ndecolonization focus on social history, economics, and political\ninstitutions. Whereas postcolonial theory is associated with the\nissues of hybridity, diaspora, representation, narrative, and\nknowledge/power, theories of decolonization are concerned with\nrevolution, economic inequality, violence, and political identity. \nSome scholars have begun to question the usefulness of the concept\npost-colonial theory. Like the idea of the Scottish four-stages\ntheory, a theory with which it would appear to have little in common,\nthe very concept of post-colonialism seems to rely on a progressive\nunderstanding of history (McClintock 1992). It suggests, perhaps\nunwittingly, that the core concepts of hybridity,\nalterity,particularity, and multiplicity may lead to a kind of\nmethodological dogmatism or developmental logic. Moreover, the term\n“colonial” as a marker of this domain of inquiry is also\nproblematic in so far as it suggests historically implausible\ncommonalities across territories that experienced very different\ntechniques of domination. Thus, the critical impulse behind\npost-colonial theory has turned on itself, drawing attention to the\nway that it may itself be marked by the utopian desire to transcend\nthe trauma of colonialism (Gandhi 1998). \nIndigenous scholars have articulated a critique of post-colonialism,\nnoting that the concept obscures the continued existence of\nsettler-colonial states. One point of controversy in contemporary\nIndigenous political theory literature is the extent to which it is\ndesirable to participate in colonial legal and political institutions\nin order to transform them. At the center of this debate is the\nquestion of whether institutional accommodation aimed towards\nreconciliation advances indigenous interests or further reproduces the\nconditions of domination that only perpetuate the historical\nsettler-colonial relationship. One group of scholars emphasizes the\npolitics of refusal and resurgence. In Mohawk Interruptus: A\nPolitical Life Across the Borders of Settler States (2014), Audra\nSimpson argues that the contemporary democratic practices of\nrecognition transform indigenous peoples from sovereign nations into\nethnic minority citizens. She suggests that the struggle for\nself-government requires a politics of refusal. The problem with the\npolitics of reconciliation is that it remains in a system that is\nguided by the logic of Western liberalism and structured by its\nattendant hierarchies. Resurgence is best achieved through the\npolitics of refusal, which aims towards self-determination and\nsovereignty through the reintegration of Indigenous culture and\ncustoms.  \nIn Wasáse: Indigenous Pathways to Action and Freedom\n(2005) Taiaiake Alfred argues that meaningful change to the colonial\ncondition requires a lasting transformation of society through\nIndigenous resurgence. According to Alfred, Indigenous reintegration\ncannot take place within the Western liberal framework because the\nimperatives of capitalism contrast sharply with those of the\nIndigenous ways of life. Therefore, liberal attempts at reconciliation\nwill always run counter to the self-determination efforts of\nIndigenous communities. In Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back:\nStories of Nishnaabeg Re-Creation, Resurgence and a New Emergence\n(2011) Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out that rebuilding needs to\nstart from within, and Indigenous people require not only the\nre-establishment of pre-colonial history and customs but also the\nreintroduction of Indigenous traditions of governance and culture\nthrough the oral tradition of story-telling as a framework to inform\nsocial experience.  \nGlen Coulthard expands on the theoretical framework of resurgence and\nrefusal in Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics\nof Recognition (2014) and presents a critical analysis of the\nhistorical and political experiences of Indigenous people within\nCanada. Coulthard argues that the current methods of reconciliation\ntend to dehistoricize and neutralize acts of dispossession, violence,\nand displacement of Indigenous peoples from their lands and cultures.\nFor Coulthard, settler colonialism is an ongoing process, not merely\nthe legacy of past injustices. This is evident in the unsettled land\nclaims, the dispossession of land, the limitations placed on\nIndigenous governments, and the displacement of Indigenous ways of\nlife—which are tied to access to traditional territories. Rather\nthan relying on recognition from within the colonial-settler\nrelationship, Coulthard advocates for Indigenous sovereignty informed\nby an intellectual, social, political, and artistic movement that\nembodies a “self-reflective revitalization” of traditional\nvalues, principles, and cultural practices. \nThe title of Coulthard’s book alludes to Black Skin, White\nMasks (1952), the path-breaking work by Frantz Fanon. Writing in\nthe 1950s, Fanon challenged the abstract universalism of Western\nphilosophy, showing how universalism serves to structure a\nhierarchical relationship between settler and colonized. Fanon’s\ncritical theory challenges the assumption that European notions of\nprogress truly advance justice and secure mutual benefit. In Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon focuses on the development of black\nconsciousness by exploring the psychological alienation and\ndisplacement caused by colonial domination. He describes a divided\nself who identifies with French culture even while experiencing\nexclusion from the ideals of universalism, equality, and reason.\nCoulthard’s reading of Fanon sheds light on his view that\ncultural recognition by the colonial state is a solution. Following\nFanon, he concludes that paternalist recognition serves to legitimize\nthe colonial state and further divide indigenous subjects. \nOther scholars, however, argue that it is possible to achieve\nsuccessful reconciliation through democratic deliberation and\nprocedures. In This Is Not a Peace Pipe: Towards a Critical\nIndigenous Philosophy (2006) Dale Turner suggests that the way to\nundermine the power dynamics that perpetuate the conditions of\ncolonialism is through the participation within the legal and\npolitical institutions of the Canadian state. Turner argues that\n“word warriors,” who mediate between Indigenous\ncommunities and legal and political institutions, should ensure the\npreservation and expansion of Indigenous rights within the larger\ncommunity. Turner argues that an effective relationship between the\nCanadian and Indigenous peoples will only emerge out of a dialogue\ngrounded in democratic presumptions of equality and respect. This\ndialogue entails that Indigenous peoples, to establish claims of\ncultural distinctiveness, learn how to engage within the\nCanadian’s state’s legal and political discourses in more\neffective ways (2006:5). \nThe struggle for Indigenous self-determination is not unique to\nCanada. Rather, Indigenous movements towards self-determination have\nemerged across North and South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand,\nand other territories. Scholars, such as Ronald Niezen (2003), Will\nKymlicka (2013), and Sheryl Lightfoot (2016), have written on the\nsubject of indigenous peoples’ international struggles for\nindividual and collective rights. International recognition-based\nmodels have gained momentum since the 2007 United Nations Declaration\nof Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Lightfoot highlights the\nrevolutionary potential of international movements to enable a\ncollective voice where local struggles may strategically coalesce on a\nglobal platform. Acknowledging local variations, Indigenous people\nhave developed a movement beyond national borders that strive to\nrecognize the political autonomy by addressing issues surrounding land\nrights and cultural distinctiveness.

One of the difficulties in\ndefining colonialism is that it is hard to distinguish it from\nimperialism. Frequently the two concepts are treated as synonyms. Like\ncolonialism, imperialism also involves political and economic control\nover a dependent territory. The etymology of the two terms, however,\nprovides some clues about how they differ. The term colony comes from\nthe Latin word colonus, meaning farmer. This root reminds us\nthat the practice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of\npopulation to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent\nsettlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of\norigin. Imperialism, on the other hand, comes from the Latin term\nimperium, meaning to command. Thus, the term imperialism\ndraws attention to the way that one country exercises power over\nanother, whether through settlement, sovereignty, or indirect\nmechanisms of control.\n\n\nThe legitimacy of colonialism has been a longstanding concern for\npolitical and moral philosophers in the Western tradition. At least\nsince the Crusades and the conquest of the Americas, political\ntheorists have struggled with the difficulty of reconciling ideas\nabout justice and natural law with the practice of European\nsovereignty over non-Western peoples. In the nineteenth century, the\ntension between liberal thought and colonial practice became\nparticularly acute, as dominion of Europe over the rest of the world\nreached its zenith. Ironically, in the same period when most political\nphilosophers began to defend the principles of universalism and\nequality, the same individuals still defended the legitimacy of\ncolonialism and imperialism. One way of reconciling those apparently\nopposed principles was the argument known as the “civilizing\nmission,” which suggested that a temporary period of political\ndependence or tutelage was necessary in order for\n“uncivilized” societies to advance to the point where they\nwere capable of sustaining liberal institutions and\nself-government.\n\n\nThe goal of this entry is to analyze the relationship between Western\npolitical theory and the project of colonialism. After providing a\nmore thorough discussion of the concept of colonialism, this entry\nwill explain how European thinkers justified, legitimized, and\nchallenged political domination. The third section focuses on\nliberalism and the fourth section briefly discusses the Marxist\ntradition, including Marx’s own defense of British colonialism\nin India and Lenin’s anti-imperialist writings. The fifth\nsection provides an introduction to contemporary “post-colonial\ntheory.” This approach has been particularly influential in\nliterary studies because it draws attention to the diverse ways that\npostcolonial subjectivities are constituted and resisted through\ndiscursive practices. The final section will introduce an Indigenous\ncritique of settler-colonialism that emerges both as a response to\ncolonial practices of domination and dispossession of land, customs\nand traditional history and to post-colonial theories of universalism.\nThe goal of the entry is to provide an overview of the vast and\ncomplex literature that explores the theoretical issues emerging out\nof the experience of European colonization.\n\nColonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of\nexamples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent\nterritory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. The\nancient Greeks set up colonies as did the Romans, the Moors, and the\nOttomans, to name just a few of the most famous examples. Colonialism,\nthen, is not restricted to a specific time or place. Nevertheless, in\nthe sixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of\ntechnological developments in navigation that began to connect more\nremote parts of the world. Fast sailing ships made it possible to\nreach distant ports and to sustain close ties between the center and\ncolonies. Thus, the modern European colonial project emerged when it\nbecame possible to move large numbers of people across the ocean and\nto maintain political sovereignty in spite of geographical dispersion.\nThis entry uses the term colonialism to describe the process of\nEuropean settlement and political control over the rest of the world,\nincluding the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia. \nThe difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the\nterm is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and\nimperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit\nEurope economically and strategically. The term colonialism is\nfrequently used to describe the settlement of North America,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Brazil, places that were\ncontrolled by a large population of permanent European residents. The\nterm imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government\nadministers a territory without significant settlement; typical\nexamples include the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth\ncentury and the American domination of the Philippines and Puerto\nRico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely\nconsistent in the literature. Some scholars distinguish between\ncolonies for settlement and colonies for economic exploitation. Others\nuse the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are directly\ngoverned by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which\ninvolves indirect forms of domination. \nThe confusion about the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the\nway that the concept has changed over time. Although the English word\nimperialism was not commonly used before the nineteenth century,\nElizabethans already described the United Kingdom as “the\nBritish Empire.” As Britain began to acquire overseas\ndependencies, the concept of empire was employed more frequently.\nImperialism was understood as a system of military domination and\nsovereignty over territories. The day to day work of government might\nbe exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers\nwho paid tribute, but sovereignty rested with the British. The shift\naway from this traditional understanding of empire was influenced by\nthe Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards\neconomic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the\nnecessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late\ncapitalism. Thus, for Lenin and subsequent Marxists, imperialism\ndescribed a historical stage of capitalism rather than a\ntrans-historical practice of political and military domination. The\nlasting impact of the Marxist approach is apparent in contemporary\ndebates about American imperialism, a term which usually means\nAmerican economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is\nexercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001). \nGiven the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two\nterms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers\nto the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to\nthe twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation\nmovements of the 1960s. Post-colonialism will be used to describe the\npolitical and theoretical struggles of societies that experienced the\ntransition from political dependence to sovereignty. This entry will\nuse imperialism as a broad term that refers to economic, military,\npolitical domination that is achieved without significant permanent\nEuropean settlement. \nThe Spanish conquest of the Americas sparked a theological, political,\nand ethical debate about the use of military force to acquire control\nover foreign lands. This debate took place within the framework of a\nreligious discourse that legitimized military conquest as a way to\nfacilitate the conversion and salvation of indigenous peoples. The\nidea of a “civilizing mission” was by no means the\ninvention of the British in the nineteenth century. The Spanish\nconquistadores and colonists explicitly justified their activities in\nthe Americas in terms of a religious mission to bring Christianity to\nthe native peoples. The Crusades provided the initial impetus for\ndeveloping a legal doctrine that rationalized the conquest and\npossession of infidel lands. Whereas the Crusades were initially\nframed as defensive wars to reclaim Christian lands that had been\nconquered by non-Christians, the resulting theoretical innovations\nplayed an important role in subsequent attempts to justify the\nconquest of the Americas. The core claim was that the “Petrine\nmandate” to care for the souls of Christ’s human flock\nrequired Papal jurisdiction over temporal as well as spiritual\nmatters, and this control extended to non-believers as well as\nbelievers. \nThe conversion of the native peoples, however, did not provide an\nunproblematic justification for the project of overseas conquest. The\nSpanish conquest of the Americas was taking place during a period of\nreform when humanist scholars within the Church were increasingly\ninfluenced by the natural law theories of theologians such as St.\nThomas Aquinas. According to Pope Innocent IV, war could not be waged\nagainst infidels and they could not be deprived of their property\nsimply because of their non-belief. Under the influence of Thomism,\nInnocent IV concluded that force was legitimate only in cases where\ninfidels violated natural law. Nonbelievers had legitimate dominion\nover themselves and their property, but this dominion was abrogated if\nthey proved incapable of governing themselves according to principles\nthat every reasonable person would recognize. The Spanish quickly\nconcluded that the habits of the native Americans, from nakedness to\nunwillingness to labor to alleged cannibalism, clearly demonstrated\ntheir inability to recognize natural law. This account of native\ncustoms was used to legitimize the enslavement of the Indians, which\nthe Spanish colonists insisted was the only way to teach them\ncivilization and introduce them to Christianity. \nSome of the Spanish missionaries sent to the New World, however,\nnoticed that the brutal exploitation of slave labor was widespread\nwhile any serious commitment to religious instruction was absent.\nMembers of the Dominican order in particular noted the hypocrisy of\nenslaving the Indians because of their alleged barbarity while\npracticing a form of conquest, warfare, and slavery that reduced the\nindigenous population of Hispaniola from 250,000 to 15,000 in two\ndecades of Spanish rule. Given the genocidal result of Spanish\n“civilization,” they began to question the idea of a\ncivilizing mission. Bartolomé de Las Casas and Franciscus de\nVictoria were two of the most influential critics of Spanish colonial\npractice. Victoria gave a series of lectures on Indian rights that\napplied Thomism to the practice of Spanish rule. He argued that all\nhuman beings share the capacity for rationality and have natural\nrights that stem from this capacity. From this premise, he deduced\nthat the Papal decision to grant Spain title to the Americas was\nillegitimate. Unlike the position of Pope Innocent IV, Victoria argued\nthat neither the Pope nor the Spaniards could subjugate the Indians in\norder to punish violations of natural law, such as fornication or\nadultery. He noted that the Pope had no right to make war on\nChristians and take their property simply because they were\n“fornicators or thieves.” If this were the case, then no\nEuropean king’s dominion would ever be safe. Furthermore,\naccording to Victoria, the pope and Christian rulers acting on his\nmandate had even less right to enforce laws against unbelievers,\nbecause they were outside of the Christian community, which was the\ndomain of Papal authority (Williams 1990). \nDespite this strongly worded critique of the dominant modes of\njustifying Spanish conquest, Victoria concluded that the use of force\nin the New World was legitimate when Indian communities violated the\nLaw of Nations, a set of principles derivable from reason and\ntherefore universally binding. At first it might sound contradictory\nthat the Indians’ supposed violation of the natural law did not\njustify conquest but their violation of the Law of Nations, itself\nderived from natural law, did. Victoria emphasizes that the Law of\nNations is binding because “there exists clearly enough a\nconsensus of the greater part of the whole world” (391) and\nbecause the principles benefit “the common good of all.”\nThis distinction seems to rely on the assumption that other principles\nusually associated with natural law (such as the prohibitions on\nadultery and idolatry) only affect those who consent to the practices,\nwhereas violations of the Law of Nations (e.g. prohibitions on\npeaceful travel and trade) have consequences for those who do not\nconsent. Ultimately, Victoria’s understanding of the Law of\nNations led him to defend the practice of Spanish colonialism, even\nthough he emphasized that warfare should be limited to the measures\nrequired to attain the legitimate objectives of peaceful trade and\nmissionary work. Within Victoria’s critique of the legality and\nmorality of Spanish colonialism was a rationalization for conquest,\nalbeit a restrictive one. \nThe legitimacy of colonialism was also a topic of debate among French,\nGerman, and British philosophers in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant, Smith and Diderot were\ncritical of the barbarity of colonialism and challenged the idea that\nEuropeans had the obligation to “civilize” the rest of the\nworld. At first it might seem relatively obvious that Enlightenment\nthinkers would develop a critique of colonialism. The system of\ncolonial domination, which involved some combination of slavery,\nquasi-feudal forced labor, or expropriation of property, is\nantithetical to the basic Enlightenment principle that each individual\nis capable of reason and self-government. The rise of anti-colonial\npolitical theory, however, required more than a universalistic ethic\nthat recognized the shared humanity of all people. As suggested above,\nthe universalism of Thomism proved to be a relatively weak basis for\ncriticizing colonialism. Given the tension between the abstract\nuniversalism of natural law and the actual cultural practices of\nindigenous peoples, it was easy to interpret native difference as\nevidence of the violation of natural law. This in turn became a\njustification for exploitation. \nDiderot was one of the most forceful critics of European colonization.\nIn his contributions to Raynal’s Histoire des deux\nIndes, he challenges the view that indigenous people benefit from\nEuropean civilization and argues that the European colonists are the\nuncivilized ones. He claims that culture (“national\ncharacter”) helps to inculcate morality and reinforces norms of\nrespect, but these norms tend to dissipate when the individual is far\nfrom his country of origin. According to Diderot, colonial empires\nfrequently become the sites of extreme brutality because the colonists\nare far away from legal institutions and informal sanctions and this\nweakens the habits of restraint, exposing natural man’s full\ninstinct for violence (Muthu 2003). \nDiderot also challenges the dominant justifications for European\ncolonialism. Although he grants that it is legitimate to colonize an\narea that is not actually inhabited, he insists that foreign traders\nand explorers have no right of access to fully inhabited lands. This\nis important because the right to commerce (understood to encompass\nnot only trade but also missionary work and exploration) was used as a\njustification for colonization by Spanish thinkers in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth century. Emblematic of this approach was\nVictoria’s conclusion that an indigenous people could not\nexclude peaceful traders and missionaries without violating the Law of\nNations. If the native peoples resisted these incursions, the Spanish\ncould legitimately wage war and conquer their territory. Diderot\nspecifically challenges this view, noting that the European traders\nhad proven themselves “dangerous as guests.” (Muthu 2003:\n75) \nBefore enlightenment thinkers could articulate a compelling critique\nof colonialism, they had to recognize the importance of culture and\nthe possibility of cultural pluralism. The claim that all individuals\nare equally worthy of dignity and respect was a necessary but not\nsufficient basis for anti-imperialist thought. They also had to\nrecognize that the tendency to develop diverse institutions,\nnarratives, and aesthetic practices was an essential human capacity.\nThe French term moeurs or what today would be called culture\ncaptures the idea that the humanity of human beings is expressed in\nthe distinctive practices that they adopt as solutions to the\nchallenges of existence. \nThe work of enlightenment anti-imperialists such as Diderot and Kant\nreflects their struggle with the tension between universalistic\nconcepts such as human rights and the realities of cultural pluralism.\nThe paradox of enlightenment anti-imperialism is that human dignity is\nunderstood to be rooted in the universal human capacity for reason.\nYet when people engage in cultural practices that are unfamiliar or\ndisturbing to the European observer, they appear irrational and thus\nundeserving of recognition and respect. Diderot’s solution was\nto identify particularity as the universal human trait. In other\nwords, he emphasized that human beings all share similar desires to\ncreate workable rules of conduct that allow particular ways of life to\nflourish without themselves creating harsh injustices and cruelties.\n(Muthu 2003: 77) There are infinite varieties of solutions to the\nchallenges posed by human existence. Societies all need to find a way\nto balance individual egoism and sociability and to overcome the\nadversities that stem from the physical environment. From this\nperspective, culture itself, rather than rationality, is the universal\nhuman capacity. \nUnlike many other eighteenth and nineteenth century political\nphilosophers, Diderot did not assume that non-Western societies were\nnecessarily primitive (e.g. lacking political and social organization)\nnor did he assume that more complex forms of social organization were\nnecessarily superior. One of the key issues that distinguished critics\nfrom proponents of colonialism and imperialism was their view of the\nrelationship between culture, history and progress. Many of the\ninfluential philosophers writing in France and England in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries had assimilated some version of\nthe developmental approach to history that was associated with the\nScottish Enlightenment. According to the stadial theory of historical\ndevelopment, all societies naturally moved from hunting, to herding,\nto farming, to commerce, a developmental process that simultaneously\ntracked a cultural arc from “savagery,” through\n“barbarism,” to “civilization.”\n“Civilization” was not just a marker of material\nimprovement, but also a normative judgment about the moral progress of\nsociety. (Kohn and O’Neill 2006) \nThe language of civilization, savagery, and barbarism is pervasive in\nwriters as diverse of Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and John Stuart Mill.\nIt would therefore be incorrect to conclude that a developmental\ntheory of history is distinctive of the liberal tradition;\nnevertheless, given that figures of the Scottish Enlightenment such as\nFerguson and Smith were among its leading expositors, it is strongly\nassociated with liberalism. Smith himself opposed imperialism for\neconomic reasons. He felt that relations of dependence between\nmetropole and periphery distorted self-regulating market mechanisms\nand worried that the cost of military domination would be burdensome\nfor taxpayers (Pitts 2005). The idea that civilization is the\nculmination of a process of historical development, however, proved\nuseful in justifying imperialism. According to Uday Mehta, liberal\nimperialism was the product of the interaction between universalism\nand developmental history (1999). A core doctrine of liberalism holds\nthat all individuals share a capacity for reason and self-government.\nThe theory of developmental history, however, modifies this\nuniversalism with the notion that these capacities only emerge at a\ncertain stage of civilization (McCarthy 2009). For example, according\nto John Stuart Mill (hereafter Mill), savages do not have the capacity\nfor self-government because of their excessive love of freedom. Serfs,\nslaves, and peasants in barbarous societies, on the other hand, may be\nso schooled in obedience that their capacity for rationality is\nstifled. Only commercial society produces the material and cultural\nconditions that enable individuals to realize their potential for\nfreedom and self-government. According to this logic, civilized\nsocieties like Great Britain are acting in the interest of\nless-developed peoples by governing them. Imperialism, from this\nperspective, is not primarily a form of political domination and\neconomic exploitation but rather a paternalistic practice of\ngovernment that exports “civilization” (e.g.\nmodernization) in order to foster the improvement of native peoples.\nDespotic government (and Mill doesn’t hesitate to use this term)\nis a means to the end of improvement and ultimately\nself-government. \nMill, a life-long employee of the British East India Company,\nrecognized that despotic government by a foreign people could lead to\ninjustice and economic exploitation. These abuses, if unchecked, could\nundermine the legitimacy and efficacy of the imperial project. In\nConsiderations on Representative Government (1861), Mill\nidentifies four reasons why foreign (e.g. European) peoples are not\nsuited to governing colonies. First, foreign politicians are unlikely\nto have the knowledge of local conditions that is necessary to solve\nproblems of public policy effectively. Second, given cultural,\nlinguistic, and often religious differences between colonizers and\ncolonized, the colonizers are unlikely to sympathize with the native\npeoples and are likely to act tyrannically. Third, even if the\ncolonizers really try to treat the native peoples fairly, their\nnatural tendency to sympathize with those similar to themselves (other\nforeign colonists or merchants) would likely lead to distorted\njudgment in cases of conflict. Finally, according to Mill, colonists\nand merchants go abroad in order to acquire wealth with little effort\nor risk, which means that their economic activity often exploits the\ncolonized country rather than developing it. These arguments echo\npoints made in Edmund Burke’s voluminous writings assailing the\nmisgovernment in India, most notably Burke’s famous Speech on\nFox’s East India Bill (1783). Recent scholarship, however, has\nchallenged the view of Burke as an opponent of imperialism. Daniel\nO’Neill has argued that Burke was a staunch supporter of the\nBritish Empire in the eighteenth century (2016). According to\nO’Neill, Burke’s defense of empire was ideologically\nconsistent with his conservative opposition to the French Revolution.\n \nMill’s solution to the problem of imperial misgovernment was to\neschew parliamentary oversight in favor of a specialized\nadministrative corps. Members of this specialized body would have the\ntraining to acquire relevant knowledge of local conditions. Paid by\nthe government, they would not personally benefit from economic\nexploitation and could fairly arbitrate conflicts between colonists\nand indigenous people. Mill, however, was not able to explain how to\nensure good government where those wielding political power were not\naccountable to the population. In this sense, Mill’s writing is\nemblematic of the failure of liberal imperial thought. \nNineteenth century liberal thinkers held a range of views on the\nlegitimacy of foreign domination and conquest. Alexis de Tocqueville,\nfor example, made a case for colonialism that did not rely on the idea\nof a “civilizing mission.” Tocqueville recognized that\ncolonialism probably did not bring good government to the native\npeoples, but this did not lead him to oppose colonialism since his\nsupport rested entirely on the way it benefited France. Tocqueville\ninsisted that French colonies in Algeria would increase France’s\nstature vis-à-vis rivals like England. Colonies would provide\nan outlet for excess population that caused disorder in France.\nTocqueville also suggested that imperial endeavors would incite a\nfeeling of patriotism that would counterbalance the modern centrifugal\nforces of materialism and class conflict. \nTocqueville was actively engaged in advancing the project of French\ncolonization of Algeria. Tocqueville’s first analysis of French\ncolonialism was published during his 1837 electoral campaign for a\nseat in the Chamber of Deputies. As a member of the Chamber of\nDeputies, Tocqueville argued in favor of expanding the French presence\nin Algeria. He traveled to Algeria in 1841 composing an “Essay\non Algeria” that served as the basis for two parliamentary\nreports on the topic (Tocqueville 1841). Unlike the more naïve\nproponents of the “civilizing mission,” Tocqueville\nadmitted that the brutal military occupation did little to introduce\ngood government or advance civilization. In an apparent reversal of\nthe four-stages theory of the Scottish Enlightenment, he acknowledged\nthat “we are now fighting far more barbarously than the Arabs\nthemselves” and “it is on their side that one meets with\ncivilization.” (Tocqueville 1841: 70) This realization, however,\ndid not imply a critique of French brutality. Instead, Tocqueville\ndefended controversial tactics such as the destruction of crops,\nconfiscation of land, and seizure of unarmed civilians. His texts,\nhowever, provide little in the way of philosophical justification and\nhe dismisses the entire just war tradition by stating, “I\nbelieve that the right of war authorizes us to ravage the\ncountry.” (Tocqueville 1841: 70). In Tocqueville’s\nwritings on Algeria, the French national interest is paramount and\nmoral considerations are explicitly subordinate to political\ngoals. \nTocqueville’s analysis of Algeria reflects little anxiety about\nits legitimacy and much concern about the pragmatics of effective\ncolonial governance. The stability of the regime, he felt, depended on\nthe ability of the colonial administration to provide good government\nto the French settlers. Tocqueville emphasized that the excessive\ncentralization of decision-making in Paris combined with the arbitrary\npractices of the local military leadership meant that French colonists\nhad no security of property, let alone the political and civil rights\nthat they were accustomed to France. Tocqueville was untroubled by the\nuse of martial law against indigenous peoples, but felt that it was\ncounterproductive when applied to the French. For Tocqueville, the\nsuccess of the French endeavor in Algeria depended entirely on\nattracting large numbers of permanent French settlers. Given that it\nwas proving impossible to win the allegiance of the indigenous people,\nFrance could not hold Algeria without creating a stable community of\ncolonists. The natives were to be ruled through military domination\nand the French were to be enticed to settle through the promise of\neconomic gain in an environment that reproduced, as much as possible,\nthe cultural and political life of France. After a brief period of\noptimism about “amalgamation” of the races in his\n“Second Letter on Algeria” (Tocqueville 1837: 25),\nTocqueville understood the colonial world in terms of the permanent\nopposition of settler and native, an opposition structured to ensure\nthe economic benefit of the former. \nRecent scholarship has also drawn attention to the writings of less\ncanonical figures (Bell 2016). In Mr. Mothercountry, Keally\nMcBride (2016) focuses on the career of James Stephen and uses new\narchival research to explore the gap between the practice of colonial\nadministration and the ideal of the rule of law. In Alibis of\nEmpire: Henry Maine and the Ends of Liberal Imperialism, Karuna\nMantena (2010) challenges the idea that liberal notions of progress\nand civilization played a central role in the justification of\nVictorian empire. Mantena shows that the work of Victorian legal\nscholar Henry Maine played an important role in the shift toward a new\nculturalism that emphasized the dangers and difficulties of trying to\ncivilize native peoples.  \nIn recent years, scholars have devoted less attention to the debates\non colonialism within the Marxist tradition. This reflects the waning\ninfluence of Marxism in the academy and in political practice.\nMarxism, however, has influenced both post-colonial theory and\nanti-colonial independence movements around the world. Marxists have\ndrawn attention to the material basis of European political expansion\nand developed concepts that help explain the persistence of economic\nexploitation after the end of direct political rule. \nAlthough Marx never developed a theory of colonialism, his analysis of\ncapitalism emphasized its inherent tendency to expand in search of new\nmarkets. In his classic works such as The Communist\nManifesto, Grundrisse, and Capital, Marx\npredicted that the bourgeoisie would continue to create a global\nmarket and undermine both local and national barriers to its own\nexpansion. Expansion is a necessary product of the core dynamic of\ncapitalism: overproduction. Competition among producers drives them to\ncut wages, which in turn leads to a crisis of under-consumption. The\nonly way to prevent economic collapse is to find new markets to absorb\nexcess consumer goods. From a Marxist perspective, some form of\nimperialism is inevitable. By exporting population to resource rich\nforeign territories, a nation creates a market for industrial goods\nand a reliable source of natural resources. Alternately, weaker\ncountries can face the choice of either voluntarily admitting foreign\nproducts that will undermine domestic industry or submitting to\npolitical domination, which will accomplish the same end. \nIn a series of newspaper articles published in the 1850s in the\nNew York Daily Tribune, Marx specifically discussed the\nimpact of British colonialism in India. His analysis was consistent\nwith his general theory of political and economic change. He described\nIndia as an essentially feudal society experiencing the painful\nprocess of modernization. According to Marx, however, Indian\n“feudalism” was a distinctive form of economic\norganization. He reached this conclusion because he believed\n(incorrectly) that agricultural land in India was owned communally.\nMarx used the concept of “Oriental despotism” to describe\na specific type of class domination that used the state’s power\nof taxation in order to extract resources from the peasantry.\nAccording to Marx, oriental despotism emerged in India because\nagricultural productivity depended on large-scale public works such as\nirrigation that could only be financed by the state. This meant that\nthe state could not be easily replaced by a more decentralized system\nof authority. In Western Europe, feudal property could be transformed\ngradually into privately owned, alienable property in land. In India,\ncommunal land ownership made this impossible, thereby blocking the\ndevelopment of commercial agriculture and free markets. Since\n“Oriental despotism” inhibited the indigenous development\nof economic modernization, British domination became the agent of\neconomic modernization. \nMarx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing\nmodernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent\nrationalization for foreign domination. His account of British\ndomination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows\ntowards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the\nimmense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to\nbourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both\nnecessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration\nof foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India. For Marx,\nthis upheaval has both positive and negative consequences. When\npeasants lose their traditional livelihoods, there is a great deal of\nhuman suffering, but he also points out that traditional village\ncommunities are hardly idyllic; they are sites of caste oppression,\nslavery, misery, and cruelty. The first stage of the modernization\nprocess is entirely negative, because poor people pay heavy taxation\nto support British rule and endure the economic upheaval that results\nfrom the glut of cheaply produced English cotton. Eventually, however,\nBritish merchants begin to realize that Indians cannot pay for\nimported cloth or British administration if they don’t\nefficiently produce goods to trade, which provides an incentive for\nBritish investment in production and infrastructure. Even though Marx\nbelieved that British rule was motivated by greed and exercised\nthrough cruelty, he felt it was still the agent of progress. Thus,\nMarx’s discussion of British rule in India has three dimensions:\nan account of the progressive character of foreign rule, a critique of\nthe human suffering involved, and a concluding argument that British\nrule must be temporary if the progressive potential is to be\nrealized. \nLenin developed his analysis of Western economic and political\ndomination in his pamphlet Imperialism: The Highest Stage of\nCapitalism (1917) (see Other Internet Resources). Lenin took a\nmore explicitly critical view of imperialism. He noted that\nimperialism was a technique which allowed European countries to put\noff the inevitable domestic revolutionary crisis by exporting their\nown economic burdens onto weaker states. Lenin argued that\nlate-nineteenth century imperialism was driven by the economic logic\nof late-capitalism. The falling rate of profit caused an economic\ncrisis that could only be resolved through territorial expansion.\nCapitalist conglomerates were compelled to expand beyond their\nnational borders in pursuit of new markets and resources. In a sense,\nthis analysis is fully consistent with Marx, who saw European\ncolonialism as continuous with the process of internal expansion\nwithin states and across Europe. Both Marx and Lenin thought that\ncolonialism and imperialism resulted from the same logic that drove\nthe economic development and modernization of peripheral areas in\nEurope. But there was one distinctive element of Lenin’s\nanalysis. Since late capitalism was organized around national\nmonopolies, the competition for markets took the form of military\ncompetition between states over territories that could be dominated\nfor their exclusive economic benefit. \nMarxist theorists including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, and Nikolai\nBukharin also explored the issue of imperialism. Kautsky’s\nposition is especially important because his analysis introduced\nconcepts that continue to play a prominent role in contemporary world\nsystems theory and post-colonial studies. Kautsky challenges the\nassumption that imperialism would lead to the development of the areas\nsubjected to economic exploitation. He suggests that imperialism is a\nrelatively permanent relationship structuring the interactions between\ntwo types of countries. (Young 2001) Although imperialism initially\ntook the form of military competition between capitalist countries, it\nwould result in collusion between capitalist interests to maintain a\nstable system of exploitation of the non-developed world. The most\ninfluential contemporary proponent of this view is Immanuel\nWallerstein, who is known for world-systems theory. According to this\ntheory, the world-system is a relatively stable set of relations\nbetween core and peripheral states. This international division of\nlabor is structured to benefit the core states (Wallerstein\n1974–1989) and transfers resources from the periphery to the\ncore. \nFrom the perspective of world-systems theory, the economic\nexploitation of the periphery does not necessarily require direct\npolitical or military domination. In a similar vein, contemporary\nliterary theorists have drawn attention to practices of representation\nthat reproduce a logic of subordination that endures even after former\ncolonies gain independence. The field of postcolonial studies was\ninfluenced by Edward Said’s path-breaking book\nOrientalism. In Orientalism Said applied Michel\nFoucault’s technique of discourse analysis to the production of\nknowledge about the Middle East. The term orientalism described a\nstructured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive practices that\nwere used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge about\nnon-European peoples. Said’s analysis made it possible for\nscholars to deconstruct literary and historical texts in order to\nunderstand how they reflected and reinforced the imperialist project.\nUnlike previous studies that focused on the economic or political\nlogics of colonialism, Said drew attention to the relationship between\nknowledge and power. By foregrounding the cultural and epistemological\nwork of imperialism, Said was able to undermine the ideological\nassumption of value-free knowledge and show that “knowing the\nOrient” was part of the project of dominating it.\nOrientalism can be seen as an attempt to extend the\ngeographical and historical terrain of the poststructuralist critique\nof Western epistemology. \nSaid uses the term Orientalism in several different ways. First,\nOrientalism is a specific field of academic study about the Middle\nEast and Asia, albeit one that Said conceives quite expansively to\nencompass history, sociology, literature, anthropology and especially\nphilology. He also identifies it as a practice that helps define\nEurope by creating a stable depiction of its other, its constitutive\noutside. Orientalism is a way of characterizing Europe by drawing a\ncontrasting image or idea, based on a series of binary oppositions\n(rational/irrational, mind/body, order/chaos) that manage and displace\nEuropean anxieties. Finally, Said emphasizes that it is also a mode of\nexercising authority by organizing and classifying knowledge about the\nOrient. This discursive approach is distinct both from the materialist\nview that knowledge is simply a reflection of economic or political\ninterests and from the idealist view that scholarship is disinterested\nand neutral. Following Foucault, Said describes discourse as a form of\nknowledge that is not used instrumentally in service of power but\nrather is itself a form of power. \nThe second quasi-canonical contribution to the field of post-colonial\ntheory is Gayatri Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern\nSpeak?” (1988). Spivak works within Said’s problematic of\nrepresentation but extends it to the contemporary academy. Spivak\nquestions the idea of transparent subaltern speech. When well-meaning\nscholars want to let the subaltern “speak for themselves”\nthey hope that removing the intermediary (the expert, the judge, the\nimperial administrator, the local elite) will enable some authentic\ntruth based on experience to emerge. But experience itself is\nconstituted through representation; therefore denying the problem of\nrepresentation does not make it go away but only makes it harder to\nrecognize. The central claim of the essay is that\n“representation has not withered away.” Since power is\neverywhere, even in language itself, transparency and authenticity are\nimpossible; this means that the messy and controversial work of\ninterpretation is necessary.  \nAijaz Ahmad has argued that, despite Spivak’s claims to be\nworking within the Marxist tradition, her essays exhibit contempt for\nmaterialism, rationalism, and progress, the core features of Marxism\n(Ahmad 1997). According to Ahmad, Spivak is concerned with narratives\nof capitalism rather than the institutional structures and material\neffects of capitalism as a mode of production. Spivak’s sharp\ncriticism of movements that essentialize subaltern subjects casts\ndoubt on the basic premise of Marxist politics, which privileges the\nproletariat as a group with shared, true interests that are produced\nby the capitalist system. \nVivek Chibber (2013) and Dipesh Chakrabarty (2007) have taken up these\nissues. In his influential book Provincializing Europe,\nChakrabarty argues that distinctively European concepts such as\ndisenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty inform the social\nsciences. When these standards are treated as universal, the third\nworld is seen as incomplete or lacking. Chibber challenges the\nposition. Chibber advances a critique of Subaltern Studies and defends\nuniversal categories such as capitalism, class, rationality, and\nobjectivity. He argues that these categories need not be reductionist\nor Eurocentric and that they are useful in illuminating the motivation\nof political actors and the structural constraints faced by leaders in\ncountries such as India.  \nThis debate reflects a tension that runs through the field of\npostcolonial studies. Although some thinkers draw on both Marxism and\npoststructuralism, the two theories have different goals, methods, and\nassumptions. In the humanities, postcolonial theory tends to reflect\nthe influence of poststructuralist thought, while theorists of\ndecolonization focus on social history, economics, and political\ninstitutions. Whereas postcolonial theory is associated with the\nissues of hybridity, diaspora, representation, narrative, and\nknowledge/power, theories of decolonization are concerned with\nrevolution, economic inequality, violence, and political identity. \nSome scholars have begun to question the usefulness of the concept\npost-colonial theory. Like the idea of the Scottish four-stages\ntheory, a theory with which it would appear to have little in common,\nthe very concept of post-colonialism seems to rely on a progressive\nunderstanding of history (McClintock 1992). It suggests, perhaps\nunwittingly, that the core concepts of hybridity,\nalterity,particularity, and multiplicity may lead to a kind of\nmethodological dogmatism or developmental logic. Moreover, the term\n“colonial” as a marker of this domain of inquiry is also\nproblematic in so far as it suggests historically implausible\ncommonalities across territories that experienced very different\ntechniques of domination. Thus, the critical impulse behind\npost-colonial theory has turned on itself, drawing attention to the\nway that it may itself be marked by the utopian desire to transcend\nthe trauma of colonialism (Gandhi 1998). \nIndigenous scholars have articulated a critique of post-colonialism,\nnoting that the concept obscures the continued existence of\nsettler-colonial states. One point of controversy in contemporary\nIndigenous political theory literature is the extent to which it is\ndesirable to participate in colonial legal and political institutions\nin order to transform them. At the center of this debate is the\nquestion of whether institutional accommodation aimed towards\nreconciliation advances indigenous interests or further reproduces the\nconditions of domination that only perpetuate the historical\nsettler-colonial relationship. One group of scholars emphasizes the\npolitics of refusal and resurgence. In Mohawk Interruptus: A\nPolitical Life Across the Borders of Settler States (2014), Audra\nSimpson argues that the contemporary democratic practices of\nrecognition transform indigenous peoples from sovereign nations into\nethnic minority citizens. She suggests that the struggle for\nself-government requires a politics of refusal. The problem with the\npolitics of reconciliation is that it remains in a system that is\nguided by the logic of Western liberalism and structured by its\nattendant hierarchies. Resurgence is best achieved through the\npolitics of refusal, which aims towards self-determination and\nsovereignty through the reintegration of Indigenous culture and\ncustoms.  \nIn Wasáse: Indigenous Pathways to Action and Freedom\n(2005) Taiaiake Alfred argues that meaningful change to the colonial\ncondition requires a lasting transformation of society through\nIndigenous resurgence. According to Alfred, Indigenous reintegration\ncannot take place within the Western liberal framework because the\nimperatives of capitalism contrast sharply with those of the\nIndigenous ways of life. Therefore, liberal attempts at reconciliation\nwill always run counter to the self-determination efforts of\nIndigenous communities. In Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back:\nStories of Nishnaabeg Re-Creation, Resurgence and a New Emergence\n(2011) Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out that rebuilding needs to\nstart from within, and Indigenous people require not only the\nre-establishment of pre-colonial history and customs but also the\nreintroduction of Indigenous traditions of governance and culture\nthrough the oral tradition of story-telling as a framework to inform\nsocial experience.  \nGlen Coulthard expands on the theoretical framework of resurgence and\nrefusal in Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics\nof Recognition (2014) and presents a critical analysis of the\nhistorical and political experiences of Indigenous people within\nCanada. Coulthard argues that the current methods of reconciliation\ntend to dehistoricize and neutralize acts of dispossession, violence,\nand displacement of Indigenous peoples from their lands and cultures.\nFor Coulthard, settler colonialism is an ongoing process, not merely\nthe legacy of past injustices. This is evident in the unsettled land\nclaims, the dispossession of land, the limitations placed on\nIndigenous governments, and the displacement of Indigenous ways of\nlife—which are tied to access to traditional territories. Rather\nthan relying on recognition from within the colonial-settler\nrelationship, Coulthard advocates for Indigenous sovereignty informed\nby an intellectual, social, political, and artistic movement that\nembodies a “self-reflective revitalization” of traditional\nvalues, principles, and cultural practices. \nThe title of Coulthard’s book alludes to Black Skin, White\nMasks (1952), the path-breaking work by Frantz Fanon. Writing in\nthe 1950s, Fanon challenged the abstract universalism of Western\nphilosophy, showing how universalism serves to structure a\nhierarchical relationship between settler and colonized. Fanon’s\ncritical theory challenges the assumption that European notions of\nprogress truly advance justice and secure mutual benefit. In Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon focuses on the development of black\nconsciousness by exploring the psychological alienation and\ndisplacement caused by colonial domination. He describes a divided\nself who identifies with French culture even while experiencing\nexclusion from the ideals of universalism, equality, and reason.\nCoulthard’s reading of Fanon sheds light on his view that\ncultural recognition by the colonial state is a solution. Following\nFanon, he concludes that paternalist recognition serves to legitimize\nthe colonial state and further divide indigenous subjects. \nOther scholars, however, argue that it is possible to achieve\nsuccessful reconciliation through democratic deliberation and\nprocedures. In This Is Not a Peace Pipe: Towards a Critical\nIndigenous Philosophy (2006) Dale Turner suggests that the way to\nundermine the power dynamics that perpetuate the conditions of\ncolonialism is through the participation within the legal and\npolitical institutions of the Canadian state. Turner argues that\n“word warriors,” who mediate between Indigenous\ncommunities and legal and political institutions, should ensure the\npreservation and expansion of Indigenous rights within the larger\ncommunity. Turner argues that an effective relationship between the\nCanadian and Indigenous peoples will only emerge out of a dialogue\ngrounded in democratic presumptions of equality and respect. This\ndialogue entails that Indigenous peoples, to establish claims of\ncultural distinctiveness, learn how to engage within the\nCanadian’s state’s legal and political discourses in more\neffective ways (2006:5). \nThe struggle for Indigenous self-determination is not unique to\nCanada. Rather, Indigenous movements towards self-determination have\nemerged across North and South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand,\nand other territories. Scholars, such as Ronald Niezen (2003), Will\nKymlicka (2013), and Sheryl Lightfoot (2016), have written on the\nsubject of indigenous peoples’ international struggles for\nindividual and collective rights. International recognition-based\nmodels have gained momentum since the 2007 United Nations Declaration\nof Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Lightfoot highlights the\nrevolutionary potential of international movements to enable a\ncollective voice where local struggles may strategically coalesce on a\nglobal platform. Acknowledging local variations, Indigenous people\nhave developed a movement beyond national borders that strive to\nrecognize the political autonomy by addressing issues surrounding land\nrights and cultural distinctiveness.
