Philosophers\nhave, of course, long been concerned with wealth and poverty, and with\nhow economic inequalities between persons might be justified. They\nhave, however, tended to focus only upon inequalities between\ninhabitants of the same state. In recent years, though, a sustained\nphilosophical dialogue has emerged on how these ideas might be applied\nto the relationships and institutions holding at the global level.\nThis dialogue has been prompted by issues of philosophy, but also by\nthe realities of globalization and global poverty; in a world as\nconnected as our own, is it justifiable that some have so much while\nothers have so little?\n\n\nThis entry is an introduction to the development of this dialogue. It\nis, perhaps, appropriate to start with some limitations. This entry\nwill discuss only the distributive aspects of international justice,\nrather than on all aspects of international relations and institutions\nthat might be morally important. Philosophical discussion of global\njustice has become sufficiently rich and complex that it is no longer\npossible to discuss all the various threads of this discussion in one\nentry (see Chatterjee [2011] for a more encyclopedic discussion of the\nvarious debates within global justice). This entry will, accordingly,\npass over such important topics as fairness in trade (Risse &\nWollner 2019; James 2012; Wenar 2020; Kurjanska & Risse 2008);\nimmigration (Blake forthcoming; D. Miller, 2016; Carens 2013; Wellman\n& Cole 2011; Carens 1987 [1995]); and gender (Kristof & WuDunn\n2009; Jaggar 2005; Nussbaum 2000). The fact that we do not discuss\nthese topics should not be read as implying their irrelevance; on the\ncontrary, they are enormously important for any adequate theory of\nglobal justice, and deserve more attention than we can provide\nhere. This entry will, moreover, discuss writings primarily within the\ntradition of liberal egalitarianism. Thinkers of a radical or a\nMarxist bent have had things to say about international justice, too,\nbut these writings are here largely ignored (see Kohn 2010, Humphrey\n2010, and Goto-Jones 2010 in Bell 2010, for discussions of these\ntopics). The entry is, finally, focused almost exclusively on fairly\nrecent writings. The reason for this is the simple fact, noted above,\nthat international justice has been a central research topic only in\nrecent years. This is emphatically not to say that less recent\nphilosophers have not had important things to say about international\njustice: Immanuel Kant’s idea of a foedus pacificum\ncontinues to exert a strong influence over modern philosophical\nthought, for example, as does Mill’s liberal nationalism (Kant\n1795; Mill 1859). The modern period, too, has seen some sustained\ndiscussion of global wealth and poverty, most notably in Peter\nSinger’s discussion of the ethics of global famine relief\n(Singer 1972; see also Singer 2002). Nevertheless, the modern dialogue\nabout international distributive justice can be largely traced to the\ninitial publication of John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice\nin 1971, and the prehistory of these ideas can be largely omitted in\nthe present context.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can begin, then, with John Rawls’s A Theory of\nJustice. The influence of this work on modern political\nphilosophy can hardly be overstated. It shifted the assumptions with\nwhich political philosophers have operated—in part by\nresuscitating the social contract tradition, and in part by giving a\nsustained and analytically robust argument regarding the injustice of\nparticular forms of economic inequality. A full analysis of\nRawls’s work is beyond the scope of this entry; readers can see\nthe related entries in this encyclopedia for more detail. Rawls\nintroduces two principles of justice, which he argues represent the\nprinciples of justice we would accept as governing the “basic\nstructure” of our society were we to bargain with one another\nunder fair conditions. These principles of justice include those\naddressing political justice, and with what fairness would demand of\nthe rules allocating persons to positions within the basic structure;\nthey also include principles designed to evaluate the justice of\nparticular forms of material inequality. In particular, the only\ninequalities of “primary goods” that could be justified\nare those that can be shown to be to the advantage of the least\nadvantaged representative position. This idea—called the\ndifference principle—represents a significant constraint on the\nexercise of the market, in that individuals are no longer entitled to\nobtain whatever share of resources their talents might obtain in a\nstandard capitalist model of the labor market. \nIt is not part of our current project to criticize or defend the\ndifference principle. We are, instead, simply going to highlight two\nfacts about this principle. The first is that the principle does seem\nto place a significant constraint on the types and degrees of\ninequality that might be justifiable. The difference principle\nrequires that all such inequalities of social primary goods must be\njustifiable to the representative worst-off party within society;\nappeals to utility, or to efficiency, or to other forms of social\nvalue simply will not suffice. The second thing to note is that this\nprinciple is taken by its author to apply only within the context of\nthe domestic state. Rawls is explicit, in his theory, that his\nprinciples should be taken as only describing the nature of justice\nwithin the political society represented by a territorial state. When\nRawls does deal with the issue of international justice, it is in a\nmanner markedly less reformist than that with which he approaches\ndomestic justice. Rawls argues that a just international regime would\ninvolve states agreeing to treat one another fairly in their mutual\ninteraction—but that this fairness would not involve any sort of\ndistributive consideration, or demand for economic justice. Indeed,\nRawls argues that the principles to which states would agree would\nlargely resemble those found in contemporary twentieth century\ninternational law. In contrast with the radical (or at least\nsurprising) conclusions drawn domestically, Rawls argues that in\ninternational justice, there would be “no surprises” in\nthe principles we ought to select (Rawls 1971: 378). \nThis difference in treatment between the domestic and the\ninternational context was immediately troubling to many philosophers.\nOne way of highlighting this is by noting the apparent contradiction\nbetween the universalism of Rawls’s moral theory and the\nlocalism of its realm of application. The first argues that what is\nmorally arbitrary should not be taken as legitimately grounding an\ninequality of wealth or income. If liberalism means anything, after\nall, it means an aversion to inherited caste privilege and other forms\nof feudal birthright privilege (Carens 1992). The second, however,\napplies this universal guarantee only within the very local context of\nthe nation-state, ignoring the fact that membership in that state was,\nitself, morally arbitrary. The net result was, for many commentators,\na sort of internal inconsistency in Rawls’s theory; if Rawls was\nto regard income inequality above that permitted by the difference\nprinciple as unjust, he should do so in a thoroughgoing way, and\ncondemn the inequalities between the wealthy and the impoverished\ninternationally (see Pogge 1989, 1992, 1994; Beitz 1979a,b, 1983;\nScanlon 1973). \nRawls can, on this account, be taken as the originator of the modern\ndialogue on global distributive justice—not because he was the\nfirst to speak out against international inequality, but because he\ndid not do so. Many of those who first did speak about international\ninequality, though, used Rawlsian ideas and concepts in their\narguments. We can therefore proceed to examine some representative\narguments used by these thinkers, to see how their cases were\nconstructed. \nMany initial commentators on Rawls’s work argued that the proper\ninterpretation of Rawls’s principles was one in which the\ndifference principle was applied at the global level. These authors\nare often referred to as “cosmopolitans”; this term,\nhowever, is often less than illuminating (see the accompanying\n entry on cosmopolitanism\n for more detail). We will instead refer to these authors as Left\nInstitutionalists, for reasons we hope will become clear. Left\nInstitutionalists agree on the following conclusion: that\nRawls’s own limitation of his two principles of justice to the\ncircumstances of a domestic society was a morally illegitimate\nconstraint on his theory, so that a consistent liberalism taking off\nfrom Rawls’s arguments must apply its liberal principles at the\nglobal level—and, therefore, the well-being of the worst-off\nrepresentative member of the global society, rather than the domestic,\nought to be our starting-point for the justification of inequality. In\nthis way, liberalism is made coherent with its ideals; rather than\nseeking some arbitrary fact to serve as a limitation on the liberal\ntheory of justice, the cosmopolitans argue that we ought to live up to\nthe globalism inherent in liberalism’s self-understanding. See,\nfor instance, Thomas Pogge’s analysis of liberalism’s\ndomestic focus: \nNationality is just one further deep contingency (like genetic\nendowment, race, gender, and social class), one more potential basis\nof institutional inequalities that are inescapable and present from\nbirth. Within Rawls’s conception, there is no reason to treat\nthis case differently from the others. And so it would seem that we\ncan justify our global institutional order only if we can show that\nthe institutional inequalities it produces tend to optimize (against\nthe backdrop of feasible alternative global regimes) the worst social\nposition. (Pogge 1989: 247) \nRawls, of course, had reasons to resist this interpretation of his\nwork. His own view—made more explicit in his The Law of\nPeoples (1993), but present even in A Theory of\nJustice—is that what counts as justice within a given\ncontext must make reference to what that context is, and how we should\nunderstand its function and its rules. Thus, Rawls argues that his\ntheory does not have application to such private institutions as\nchurches or universities; it is only to be applied to the basic\nstructure of a society—which is understood by Rawls as the major\nsocial institutions, and the ways in which they structure the rules of\nassociation and allocate the advantages of cooperation (Rawls 1971:\n7). The first task of the cosmopolitan, then, is to analyze the notion\nof the basic structure, and demonstrate that such an entity is found\ninternationally as well as domestically. Charles Beitz and Thomas\nPogge both argue that the modern system of international trade has all\nthe indicia given by Rawls to explain what makes the basic structure\nso central: international institutions allocate the advantages of\ntrade, and their rules set the basic framework for the specific\ninteractions taken among international agents. They argue, in short,\nthat the international institutional set is indeed akin to a basic\nstructure, in that this set is a site of cooperation, to which the\nprinciples of justice given in A Theory of Justice ought to\napply. As Beitz has it: \n[I]f evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows\nthe existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, we should not\nview national boundaries as having fundamental moral significance.\nSince boundaries are not coextensive with the scope of social\ncooperation, they do not mark the limits of social obligation. Thus\nthe parties to the original position cannot be assumed to know that\nthey are members of a particular national society, choosing principles\nof justice primarily for that society. The veil of ignorance must\nextend to all matters of national citizenship, and the principles\nchosen will therefore apply globally. (Beitz 1979b: 151) \nRawlsian principles must therefore apply to the set of persons in the\nworld as a whole, so that global institutions should be arranged to\nmaximize the expectations of the globally worst-off representative\nindividual. \nThe early Rawlsian cosmopolitans were enormously influential, and can\nbe credited with forcing the attention of the philosophical community\ntowards the issue of global underdevelopment and inequality. The\ntheories, of course, were subject to enormous criticism, and Rawls\nhimself rejected their conclusions, as we shall see. For the moment,\nwe might note only that many theorists were skeptical of the\nconclusion that Rawls’s principles could apply as easily to the\nglobal community as to the domestic community. Two strands of\ncriticism here deserve note: the first begins with coercion, and the\nsecond with the issue of nationality. \nSome thinkers, then, have questioned whether or not the simple act of\nexchanging goods—even a great many goods—places people in\na relationship that is morally akin to that shared by people who are\nliable to the same territorial state. Something like this point was\nnoticed early by Brian Barry, who notes that \n[T]rade, however multilateral, does not constitute a cooperative\nscheme of the relevant kind. Trade, if freely undertaken, is\n(presumably) beneficial to the exchanging parties, but it is not, it\nseems to me, the kind of relationship giving rise to duties of fair\nplay.…Trade in pottery, ornamentation, and weapons can be\ntraced back to prehistoric times, but we would hardly feel inclined to\nthink of, say, the Beaker Folk as forming a single cooperative\nenterprise with their trading partners. No more did the spice trade\nunite East and West. (Barry 1982: 233) \nBarry’s intuition, here, is that there seems to be something\nnormatively distinct between what is shared by trading partners and\nwhat is felt by fellow citizens. One way of noticing this is to notice\nthat some cosmopolitans sought to sever the distributive component of\nRawls’s theory from the other aspects of that theory—in\nparticular, from the parts of the theory dealing with political rights\nand political justification. There is, of course, a reason for this\ndismembering: there is, internationally, no polity, and the very\nconcept of having (for example) democratic rights within that polity\nmight seem misplaced. But many have thought that something has been\nmissed that is morally relevant, and that we might better regard\nRawls’s distributive conclusions and his political conclusions\nas more tightly linked than that. Some thinkers, in particular, have\nargued that Rawls’s conclusions are best read as principles\nintended to justify the coercive acts of a territorial state, rather\nthan as principles applicable to cooperative ventures more generally\n(Blake 2001, 2013; Nagel 2005). These theorists have suggested that\nthe state stands in need of justification, and that the justification\nwe offer makes distributive principles applicable here—but not\neverywhere. \nThe other critical strand we wish to highlight began with the notion\nof nationality. The idea here is that the relationships that are most\ncentral to human flourishing and human creativity are always specific\nrelationships, with specific persons and with specific cultural\ncontexts. As such, the use of abstract principles like Rawls’s\nto determine what we owe to one another generally is either suspect or\noutright self-destructive. This critical posture, of course, can end\nup being a criticism of the liberal project itself (see Sandel 1982).\nBut it can also end up being a simple criticism of the attempt to do\njustice without looking at the messiness of nations, of cultures, and\nof communities. These latter entities, it might be felt, are in need\nof support—and, in particular, are in need of support by\nindividuals who are taken as duty-bound to prefer the good of that\ncommunity to the abstract rights of foreign citizens (D. Miller 1995;\nKymlicka 1995a). What is missed in the cosmopolitan argument, on this\naccount, is not the presence of the coercive state, but the presence\nof the cultural nation. The nationalists, it should be noted, are not\nhostile to all notions of global justice; they are, instead, committed\nonly to the relatively modest conclusion that nationality has some\nmoral relevance—and that the principles of distributive justice\nthat are right within the nation may not be right at the global level\n(D. Miller 2007). \nThere are a variety of ways of arguing for such a conclusion. Some\ntheorists begin with dissatisfaction at the deracinated and abstract\nforms of philosophy practiced by cosmopolitans (Walzer 1983). Some\ntheorists begin with the need for communities to preserve themselves,\nif they are to provide individuals with the goods needed to live\ndecent lives (MacIntyre 1984). More generally, these theorists argue\nthat the needs of community are such that the cosmopolitan does damage\nto what is needed by actual humans, by considering individuals without\nconsidering the communities within which they live: \n[P]atriotism requires me to exhibit peculiar devotion to my nation and\nyou to yours. It requires me to regard such contingent social facts as\nwhere I was born and what government ruled over that place at that\ntime, who my parents were, who my great-grandparents were, and so on,\nas deciding for me what the question of virtuous action is—at\nleast insofar as it is the virtue of patriotism which is in question.\nHence the moral standpoint and the patriotic standpoint are\nsystematically incompatible. (MacIntyre 1984: 5) \nBoth of these criticisms seem, to some degree, to be accepted by Rawls\nhimself, in his fuller explanation of his own international theory in\nThe Law of Peoples. Rawls is more explicit in this\nwork—as he is in his 1993 volume Political\nLiberalism—that he takes the political dimension of the\nstate as of primary importance, and that his principles of justice\napply only within the state for that reason. He is, further, more\nexplicit about his debt to the liberal nationalist idea in this\nvolume, writing approvingly that these ideas help guide his vision of\na just international regime. We may, then, proceed to examine\nRawls’s Law of Peoples directly. \nThe trend towards greater and more sophisticated theorizing about\ninternational justice was both exemplified and encouraged by the\npublication of Rawls’ The Law of Peoples. This\nwork—an extensive elaboration and revision of an earlier essay\n(Rawls 1993b)—discusses and, has influenced the subsequent\ndiscussion of, a variety of issues of international and global import,\nincluding and especially the obligations of distributive justice in\nthe international realm. Before we turn to Rawls’s account of\ninternational distributive justice, we should acknowledge some salient\nfeatures of how he conceives of his project. Rawls’ perspective\nis unabashedly international rather than global.\nUnlike the early cosmopolitans who conceive of the world as a single\ncooperative unit and seek a single principle of distributive justice\nto govern everyone, Rawls explicitly seeks principles that will\nregulate the interactions among territorially defined political,\ncorporate agents that have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force,\ncalled peoples—and, only indirectly, govern individuals\n(Rawls 1999a: 6). \nSecond, and partly as a consequence of this conceptualization of\ninternational justice, Rawls does not attempt to derive complete\nprinciples of international and global justice. Rather, he describes\nprinciples that ought to regulate the foreign policy of a liberal\npeople (Rawls 1999a: 9–10). Thus, when Rawls says, for example,\nthat some non-democratic peoples are sufficiently well-ordered to be\nworthy of full membership in the society of peoples, he is arguing\nthat democratic peoples may not use political power or pressure to\nchange them—not that non-democratic but well-ordered peoples are\nideal or beyond moral criticism. Furthermore, he argues that the ideal\ncase of international justice is a world composed entirely of\nwell-ordered peoples whose interactions are governed by a set of moral\nprinciples. The account is then extended to cover various non-ideal\ncases: societies burdened by poverty and failing institutions or rogue\nstates that wage aggressive war. What constitutes a minimally just or\nwell-ordered people is a matter of immense controversy, but the\nbroader conceptual point is unchanged: Rawls conceives of\ninternational justice as being ideally about the interactions of\nmorally justified, centralized territorial polities. \nThird, his account of the law of peoples is constrained by the need\nthat it describe a “realistic utopia” (Rawls 1999a:\n11–12) that follows Rousseau’s dictum to take\n“people as they are and laws as they might be”. As a\nconsequence, there are at least three distinct instances where Rawls\nappeals to empirical facts as a way of “realistically”\ngrounding particular normative claims. First, an international system\ncomposed of well-ordered peoples with representative governments will\nbe peaceful (1999a: 44–54); second, issues beginning with\ncultural diversity, geographic distance, and linguistic pluralism\ncombine to make a world state fundamentally unworkable (1999a: 36);\nand, lastly, the primary causal component of national wealth and\nprosperity is the political culture and the corresponding\neffectiveness of their political institutions (1999a:\n108–110). \nWith the above normative and descriptive picture in view, Rawls\npresents a provisional list of principles that peoples could\nreasonably endorse: \nNotably absent from this list is the difference principle or anything\nlike it. When deciding on these principles, peoples do not know how\nbig, rich, prosperous, or powerful they will be. Yet, unlike\nindividuals in the first original position, the peoples represented in\nthis international original position will not demand that material\ninequalities among them be justified with reference to the\nexpectations of the least well-off. The peoples in the second original\nposition know that they have sufficient resources to be well-ordered,\nand they need no more. So, in the ideal case, where international\nsociety is fully composed of well-ordered states that follow the law\nof peoples, there are no distributive requirements at all. Some\npeoples may be very rich and others quite poor and, correspondingly,\nthere could be large differences in wealth among individuals of\ndifferent countries, but there is no principled reason—on\nRawls’ view—to find that objectionable. \nThe Law of Peoples does include some elements that constrain\ninequality—or, at least, poverty. We shall mention three. First,\ninequalities that undermine the instantiation, enforcement, and\nmaintenance of other principles will violate the Law of\nPeoples: \nThe Law of Peoples, on the other hand, holds that inequalities are not\nalways unjust, and that when they are, it is because of their unjust\neffects on the basic structure of the Society of Peoples, and on\nrelations among peoples and among their members. (Rawls 1999a:\n113) \nThus, if one could show that a deep material inequality among peoples\nundermined their ability to, say, be considered equals in the\nnegotiation of treaties or tempted peoples to inappropriately\nintervene in the domestic affairs of other peoples, then that would be\na reason—from the standpoint of international justice—for\neliminating that inequality. However, this principle must be moderated\nin light of Rawls suggestions that both poor and rich well-ordered\npeoples will be “satisfied” with their political and\neconomic position within the Society of Peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n27–30), and that the most important determinant of wealth is the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people. Well-ordered\npeoples—rich or poor—will generally act according to the\nprinciples that make up the law of peoples and even poor peoples will\nhave fairly strong political institutions, so Rawls would argue that\nit is unlikely that mere inequality will be a problem among\nwell-ordered states. \nSecond, all members of the Society of Peoples must respect human\nrights that guarantee that every person, regardless of society, a\nminimum level of material prosperity and physical security, though\nthis minimum level will fall far short of distributive equality (Rawls\n1999a: 65). \nThird, Rawls writes: \nBurdened societies, while they are not expansive or aggressive, lack\nthe political and cultural traditions, the human capital and know-how,\nand, often, the material and technological resources needed to be\nwell-ordered. The long term goal of (relatively) well-ordered\nsocieties should be to bring burdened societies, like outlaw states,\ninto the Society of well-ordered Peoples. Well-ordered peoples have a\nduty to assist burdened societies. (Rawls 1999a: 106) \nSome societies are sufficiently poor or have sufficiently weak\ninstitutions that they are unable to become and remain well-ordered on\ntheir own. In those cases, the Society of Peoples must produce the\nmaterial, human, and institutional support to help these burdened\nsocieties become minimally just. This could very well include some\nwealth transfers from richer nations to burdened ones, but Rawls is\nskeptical that this will be the primary tool of assistance. \nIt is important to see that the duty of assistance to burdened\nsocieties is structurally dissimilar to the difference principle.\nFirst, the difference principle is meant to continuously apply, via\nthe basic structure, to the flow of social and economic interactions,\nbut the duty of assistance has a target and a cutoff point: once all\nsocieties are well-ordered, no people has any further obligation to\ndistribute resources to burdened nations. Second, while the difference\nprinciple is explicitly about the distribution of primary goods, the\nduty of assistance might, in the end, have very little to do with\nactual wealth; burdened societies might be quite wealthy in terms of\nresources, but have failing or deeply embedded non well-ordered\ninstitutions while well-ordered nations may be quite poor.\nFurthermore, when confronted with consistently failing institutions,\nwell-ordered peoples might conceivably discharge their obligations as\nmuch through the provision of technical know-how, information, and\ninstitutional assistance—rather than through than financial\nsupport. \nRawls thus argues for a two-tiered theory of distributive justice. The\nrespect for the free and equal status of each citizen in domestic\ncontext demands an egalitarian distribution of primary goods, but\nequality in the international context requires that each person find\nthemselves in a well-ordered people and that those peoples are\nrespected within international society. Economic inequalities are\ninherently problematic—and require justification—at the\ndomestic level but not at the international. In other words, the\ndistributive outcomes of international trade and the global economy\nare only indirectly relevant to international justice. \nBut why this strong distinction between domestic and international?\nRawls’s response has several themes. First, Rawls suggests that\nlimitations on distributive justice are a consequence of tolerating\nand respecting the economic decisions of peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n117–118). Insofar as peoples are well-ordered, they have made\ndecisions about savings rates, education, and population policy that\nessentially determine national prosperity, and it would be\ndisrespectful of the decisions made by richer and poorer\nnations—who presumably adopted these policies for what they took\nto be good reasons—to require one people to compensate another.\nThis argument is especially controversial because Rawls argues that\nnon-democratic “decent consultation hierarchies” are\nwell-ordered and ought to be accepted into the ranks of the Society of\nPeoples (Rawls 1999a: 62–78). This leaves open the possibility\nthat individuals will become impoverished as a consequence of public\npolicies and choices that they had no hand in deciding. Kok Chor Tan,\nfor example, has argued that Rawls has improperly stretched his\nargument for toleration of reasonable, but illiberal, comprehensive\ndoctrines within a generally liberal political culture into an\nargument for respecting illiberal political cultures (Tan 1998). \nRawls further seems to suggest that the “basic structure”\nof international realm is quite different from the basic structure of\nthe domestic state. In the domestic case, the basic structure is\ncomposed of powerful and effective institutions to which the\nprinciples of justice apply. In the international\ncase, Rawls suggests that the basic structure simply is the\nprinciples by which well-ordered peoples govern themselves—there\nare no institutions distinct from the acts and decisions of the\npeoples themselves. In other words, the interactions among peoples are\nnot—and need not be—regulated by a robust set of\npolitical, economic, and social institutions that would constitute an\nindependent basic structure. As a consequence of this lack of an\ninternational basic structure, Rawls argues that the moral objections\nto inequality in the domestic case do not apply (Rawls 1999a:\n114–115). Inequality among individuals of different peoples does\nnot, for example, undermine the fair value of the political liberties\nor fair equality of opportunity, since they are not co-members of\neconomic and political systems, and peoples will treat other peoples\nas equals insofar as they are well-ordered and reasonable. Since the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people are primary cause of\nwealth and its distribution, the criterion of reciprocity does not\ndemand equal distributive shares among members of different\npolities. \nRawls’s arguments should not be taken as a defense of the status\nquo in international relations. Many states—especially\nauthoritarian, weak, and failing ones—are not well-ordered, and\nthe principles informing current foreign policies are not those\ndescribed in the The Law of Peoples. Neither Rawls nor his\ncritics would defend the justice of the world today. The theoretical\ndifference between these perspectives, though, is profound. The real\npoint of dispute between them is this: once well-ordered nations have\nensured that every person lives in a well-ordered state and are\nthereby guaranteed certain minimum protections against starvation and\npoverty, does the international order represent a basic structure of\nthe right type, and robustness, so that the fact that some peoples are\nmuch wealthier than others ought to be considered an affront to\njustice? Rawls himself will answer in the negative, while his critics\nwill answer in the affirmative. \nDespite the fact that almost no element of The Law of Peoples\nhas escaped controversy, it served as a well-spring of additional\ntheorizing (see generally Martin & Reidy 2006) and has structured\nthe subsequent debate concerning international distributive justice.\nRawls’s two-tiered account strongly influenced those\ntheorists who were unsatisfied with both cosmopolitan and nationalist\naccounts of distributive justice. Much of the ensuing discussion has\npitted two groups of theorists who both purport to be building upon\nwhat they take to be the key insights of Rawls’s view. One\ngroup—we will call them right\ninstitutionalists—has followed the general contours of\nRawls’s two-tiered account, developing more detailed accounts of\nwhy we should sharply distinguish between the international and\ndomestic. They aim to justify Rawls’s fundamental position that\negalitarian distributive justice only operates at the state level,\neven if they disagree with Rawls as to the rationale. Left\ninstitutionalists, on the other hand, have argued that\ninternational politics is characterized by a sufficiently robust set\nof institutions, such that they “trigger” principles of\ndistributive justice that are more robust and that, pace the\nduty of assistance, operate directly on the distributive consequences\nof international economic regimes. As a consequence, left\ninstitutionalists generally argue for more robust distributive\nobligations and more radical institutional changes than right\ninstitutionalists even though the extent and nature of those\nobligations varies from thinker to thinker. \nBefore we go deeper into the divide between left and right\ninstitutionalism, it’s important to note what the two sides\nagree on and to see where the actual disagreements between the two\nsides lie. The important point of agreement lies in their mutual focus\non institutions or rule-governed practices as the trigger of genuinely\negalitarian distributive obligations. Both right and left\ninstitutionalists accept that principles of distributive justice only\napply or are activated in particular institutional contexts or when\npeople mutually participate in practices that are relevant to\ndistribution. So, both right and left institutionalists would deny\nthat we have obligations of distributive justice to, say, the lost\ncity of Atlantis—should it appear—since Atlanteans have\nnot participated with us in shared institutions or practices. In other\nwords, principles of distributive justice apply to, and are activated\nby, a basic structure that mostly determines the distributive shares\nthe participants receive. Right and left institutionalists disagree,\nthen, concerning which institutions activate obligations of\ndistributive justice among participants. \nRight institutionalists have generally adopted Rawls’s\ntwo-tiered approach, arguing for a sharp distinction between domestic\nand international distributive justice. While Rawls himself did not\nsay much about why international politics was so different,\nmuch of the subsequent work by right institutionalists has been to\nfind some morally salient feature that distinguishes the domestic from\nthe international which justifies such strong differences in\ndistributive principles in the face of growing globalization,\nincreasing economic interdependence, and strengthening international\ncivil society. In order to do so, right Rawlsians have argued that the\ninternational and domestic realms differ fundamentally in terms of\npolitical structure. Kenneth Waltz describes the difference\nnicely: \nThe parts of domestic political systems stand in relations of super-\nand subordination. Some are entitled to command; others are required\nto obey. Domestic systems are centralized and hierarchic. The parts of\nthe international-political systems stand in relations of cooperation.\nFormally, each is the equal of all the others. None is entitled to\ncommand; none is required to obey. International structures are\ndecentralized and anarchic. (Waltz 1979: 88) \nMore specifically, domestic politics is characterized by the existence\nof a superior political authority that claims—and\npossesses—sovereign judicial, legislative, and executive powers.\nNo such shared, coercive legal system exists in the international\nrealm. Since the world state is, at best, a distant possibility, this\nis unlikely to change. Domestic legal systems define the very terms of\neconomic activity and represent a kind of fundamental political power\nover individuals. Samuel Freeman writes: \nWhen Rawls says that the political constitution is part of the basic\nstructure, he does not just mean the procedures that specify how laws\nare enacted and that define offices and positions of political\nauthority. He means more or less the entire legal system, including\nmost public and private law, that is the product of the constitution\nin this procedural sense. Modern legal systems, such as the federal\nsystem of the United States, are made up of countless acts of\nlegislation, administration, judicial precedent, and other legal\nrulings that are issued by multiple legal bodies with lawmaking\nauthority. An economic system that is regulated by the legal norms\nthat are issued by the political constitutions is also part of the\nbasic structure. Here, of course, the legal norms of property,\ncontract, commercial law, intangibles, and so on that are essential\nfor economic production and exchange are to be included in the basic\nstructure. What makes possible the incredibly complicated system of\nlegal norms that underlie production, exchange, and consumption is a\nunified political system that specifies these norms and revises them\nto meet changing conditions….Nothing comparable to the\nbasic structure of society exists on the global level. (Freeman\n2006: 38–39, emphasis added) \nA Canadian citizen—no matter how economically and culturally\nentwined Canada might with the United States—does not get a vote\nin American elections, and the Canadian’s economic interactions\nand relationships are regulated and governed by Canadian, not\nAmerican, law. As a consequence, the American government lacks\n“original jurisdiction or effective [or basic] political\npower” over Canadians. The Canadian citizen lacks the same\nhierarchical relationship with American political authorities that\nAmerican citizens have, except under special circumstances are that\nare themselves negotiated by Canadian and American legal authorities.\nDifferent right institutionalists emphasize different elements of the\ndomestic, coercive legal system. Matthias Risse (2006, 2012) and\nMichael Blake (2001, 2013), for example, emphasize the\ncoercive nature of domestic legal systems. Risse has argued\nthat the pervasiveness and immediacy of the coercion in domestic legal\nsystems makes them fundamentally different from the kinds of\ninteractions that occur at the international level: even international\nlaws call on the powers of the state for their enforcement. Michael\nBlake, on the other hand, emphasizes how domestic legal systems\nstructure the most basic of economic interactions, make determinate\nindividual rights, and enforce them against abuses of private power.\nHe suggests that egalitarian principles of distributive justice are\nwhat justifies the imposition of coercive political authority\non autonomous agents. Samuel Freeman argues therefore that the\ninternational system—because it lacks the features and powers of\na robust legal system—does not constitute “a system of\nsocial cooperation” and, therefore, does not invoke\nRawls’s “Criterion of Reciprocity” that underlies\nthe difference principle. \nBlake, Risse, and Freeman all represent—along with Rawls\nhimself—the moderate wing of right institutionalism. They are\nunited by three claims. First, the presence of a coercive legal system\nleads to more demanding requirements of egalitarian distributive\njustice. Second, the international institutions, regimes, and\norganizations do not constitute a coercive legal system. However,\nmoderates are aware of the many ways in which the international order\ncan make the world hospitable for, or hostile to, well-ordered states.\nAs a consequence, moderates argue for principles of international\ndistributive justice that assist and protect legitimate peoples, with\nthe goal of ensuring that everyone lives within a well-ordered state.\nInternational institutions don’t activate principles of justice\nthat apply directly to distributive outcomes of global trade or\neconomic activity. Rather, those principles are activated in the event\nonly insofar as member polities (peoples, states, and the like) fail\nin their own distributive requirements (such as when peoples fail to\nprevent severe poverty, violating the human rights of their citizens)\nor need assistance. Moderate Right Institutionalists share,\nthen, Rawls’s indirect account of international distributive\njustice, justifying the two-tiered account by appeal to the necessary\nrelationship between the co-membership in a coercive legal system and\ndistributive justice. \nMore extreme right institutionalists, most vividly\nrepresented by Thomas Nagel in his article “The Problem of\nGlobal Justice”, (2005) argue that the lack of an international\nlegal system with sovereign coercive authority does not simply\nundermine claims of egalitarian distributive justice; it undermines\nall claims of justice outside the state. So, Nagel accepts\nthe first two claims of the moderates but suggests that together they\nimply that justice is chimerical in the anarchic realm of\ninternational politics. He does accept that we have moral obligations\nto prevent people from starving, being assaulted, or murdered, but\nthese are obligations of a universal “humanitarianism”.\nJustice, for Nagel, is a moral value that is necessarily\nindexed to coercive institutions, as coercive institutions are\nnecessary for large-scale social coordination and cooperation. Claims\nof distributive justice only apply to those institutions that engage\nin such large-scale economic coordination, do so coercively, and do so\nin the name of the individuals coerced. For Nagel, that last part is\nessential: the answer to the question, “Why do we owe someone\nequal distributive shares (or equal consideration in light of the\ndifference principle)?” is “We structure their economic\nlives through coercive political institutions in their name”.\nCo-citizens have their wills invoked as shared participants in the\ncreation of distributively relevant public policy, and this invocation\ngives rise to egalitarianism. Since the international realm is\ncharacterized by institutions that do not invoke the wills of\nthose involved as a justification of coercion, justice simply fails to\napply to that realm. \nBoth the extreme and moderate versions of right institutionalism have\nbeen criticized, broadly, on two fronts. First, some have argued that\nthe right institutionalist focus on coercion has been misguided. If we\nstrip away coercive institutions, or were somehow able to make\ncoercive institutions non-coercive, but retained the various regimes\nof economic cooperation, we would still have obligations of\ndistributive justice. We will turn to these arguments in section 4.1.\nThe second objection is an internal critique that denies their second\nshared claim. On this objection, the international realm is a\ncoercive legal system and thereby activates principles of distributive\njustice akin to those in the domestic arena. Right institutionalism\ndepends on the coercive nature of domestic politics being different\nfrom that of international politics. Those who argue against it\nthereby try to close the gap by pointing out the many ways in which\ncoercion is deployed internationally. Cohen and Sabel (2006) argue\nthat the collective activities of various states have created an\ninternational organization (the World Trade Organization [WTO]) that\ncan essentially issue coercive threats: follow WTO or suffer\nimpoverishment as a consequence of being denied access to global\nmarkets. They write: \nStill, it might be said that any complaint against global rule-making\nbodies should really be directed against the state for accepting their\n[the World Trade Organization] directives…But this point seems\nalmost facetious. Opting out is not a real option (the WTO is a\n“take it or leave it” arrangement without even the formal\noption of picking and choosing which parts to comply with), and given\nthat it is not, and that everyone knows that it is not, there is a\ndirect rule-making relationship between the global bodies and the\ncitizens of different states. (Cohen & Sabel 2006: 168) \nEric Cavallero (2010), on the other hand, argues that the\ninternational system is coercive in a much more direct way: Great\nPowers (including and especially the United States) coercively enforce\ninternational norms of property by invading or covertly deposing\nnations that misbehave. Arash Abizadeh (2007) has emphasized the\ncoercion inherent in the maintenance of borders and territorial\nintegrity, especially in response to immigration. If states claim the\nright to determine who enters their territory, then they place\nthemselves in the position of coercing non-citizens in virtue of the\nmethods they use to prevent those who wish to cross their borders from\ndoing so. Mirian Ronzoni (2009) argues that the existence of a global\nbasic structure isn’t the right target for our theorizing; we\nought to focus instead on whether such a basic structure should be\nbrought into being in virtue of how states exercise their power over\neach other. Laura Valentini (2011), finally, argues that the distinct\nforms of coercion present at the global level give rise to distinct\nforms of moral principles; neither statists nor cosmopolitans, she\nargues, have been able to look at the global realm as its own site of\ncoercion, with the result that a “third way” between\nstatism and cosmopolitanism must be developed. In each case, the\nstructure of the objection is quite similar: states coerce via\ninvasion and espionage, via collective action through international\ninstitutions, and via border maintenance, therefore the international\nsystem is coercive in nature and, thus, appropriately calls for\negalitarian distributive justice.  \nThese objections have forced right institutionalists to become more\nattentive to the ways in which coercive contexts can be different. As\na consequence, the responses to these objections will be complex. For\nexample, it is clear that a state requiring a citizen to purchase\nhealth insurance, stopping a non-citizen at the border, or using a\ncovert paramilitary organization to topple an unfriendly regime are\nall examples of coercion, but are they all the same type of\ncoercion and do they all subsequently demand the same\nnormative response? Furthermore, should we evaluate these coercive\nactivities in their current form—where the\ninternational world is populated by rogue states, failed and failing\nstates, and burdened societies—or should we evaluate these\ncoercive activities based on how they would operate with a genuine\nSociety of Peoples? At any rate, the debate is ongoing as right\ninstitutionalists are pushed by these objections to create more\nsophisticated accounts of coercion and to consider coercion is more\nspecific contexts (see Blake 2011; Valentini, 2011). \nLeft institutionalists are distinguished from right institutionalists\nin three ways. First, left institutionalists tend to argue for more\nrobust distributive obligations that operate directly on the\ninstitutions that characterize international politics. Second, they\ntend to reject a strongly bifurcated view of the differences between\ninternational and domestic justice, some arguing that there is no\ndifference, others arguing that there are many institutional contexts\nthat give rise to distributive obligations, and still others claiming\nthat domestic and international institutional contexts, and their\ncorresponding principles of distributive justice, operate on a smooth\ncontinuum. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, left\ninstitutionalists reject the right institutionalist emphasis on\ncoercion in activating claims of distributive justice. To the\ncontrary, left institutionalists typically characterize the basic\nstructure in terms of cooperation, the provision of basic goods, or\neconomic interdependence (Sangiovanni 2007: 19–20). \nWe have already examined some early left institutionalist responses\nabove. We will, here, consider some more recent extensions of the\nview. These thinkers generally accept that the state—with its\ncoercive legal apparatus—gives rise to especially stringent\ndemands of distributive justice. However, they argue that the nature\nof the global economic system also gives rise to robust\ndistributive obligations. These distributive obligations arise\ndirectly in virtue of the institutional features of the\nglobal economic system irrespective of their effects on domestic\njustice. What differentiates them from the early, more radical left\ninstitutionalist thinkers, is that they recognize and accept that\ndistinct norms of egalitarian concern might be appropriate in the\ndomestic and global contexts. Moderate left institutionalists then\naccept with Rawls a two-tiered account of global justice; they differ\nfrom right institutionalists (and from Rawls) in arguing that distinct\nnorms of distributive justice apply to individuals at the global\nlevel. \nModerate left institutionalists generally present some view as to what\nactivates these distributive obligations. Darrell Moellendorf (2011),\nfor example, offers the following, jointly sufficient criteria: \nThe version of membership dependence that I affirm is based upon what\nI term the principle of associational justice. The idea is\nthat duties of social justice exist between persons who have a moral\nduty of equal respect to one another if those persons are co-members\nin an association that is (1) relatively strong, (2) largely\nnonvoluntary, (3) constitutive of a significant part of the background\nrules for the various relationships of their public lives, and (4)\ngoverned by norms that can be subject to human control. (2011:\n537) \nCohen and Sabel (2006) have offered three distinct principles by which\nthese distributive duties might be justified. Andrea Sangiovanni\n(2007), despite the fact that his view has much in common with right\ninstitutionalisn, presents a left-oriented view because his account of\ninternational distributive justice is both non-coercive and\ndirect: \nI will argue that equality is a relational ideal of\nreciprocity among those who support and maintain the\nstate’s capacity to provide the basic collective goods necessary\nto protect us from physical attack and to maintain a stable system of\nproperty rights and entitlements. (Sangiovanni 2007: 19–20) \nThese views can all be used to directly evaluate global inequalities.\nHowever, unlike the more extreme left institutionalism of early Beitz\nand Pogge, each view produces comparatively less egalitarian results\nat the global level. Moellendorf argues that, even though both the\nglobal economic system and the state satisfy all four criteria, the\nformer activates obligations of “reciprocity” while the\nlatter activates the obligations of “inclusive and equal\ncitizenship”. Cohen and Sabel argue that the state requires\nliberal egalitarianism while international institutions create\nobligations of “inclusion”. In both cases, the obligations\nat the global level are less robust than at the domestic. Similarly,\nSangiovanni argues that the provision of collective goods generates an\nobligation of reciprocity, understood as egalitarian shares. The\nglobal economic system gives rise to distributive obligations, but the\nscope of the obligation is limited to the public goods produced by the\nsystem itself, in the event it comes to produce them (whether it\ncurrently does so is a matter of controversy). This means that\nSangiovanni’s account could be indifferent to considerable\ninequality among citizens of different countries as long as\nreciprocity held within each country and obtained in the contribution\nto a system of physical and economic rights made by the\ninternational system. What is important to note about moderate\nleft institutionalism, and what distinguishes it from the more extreme\nversion, is that moderates seek robust principles of distributive\njustice that apply to the particular domain of the global that are of\na piece with the principles of distributive justice domestically but\nare nonetheless sensitive to the differences between the two\ndomains. \nModerate left institutionalist views are considerably more diverse\nwhen compared to moderate right institutionalists: there is no central\nconcept—like coercion—that binds them together. And\nmoderate left institutionalism, as a view that is responsive to the\nparticular features of international institutions, has much to\nrecommend it. However, there are some areas of concern. First, one\nmight worry that many left institutionalist arguments import notions\nof coercion into their view. Moellendorf makes\n“non-voluntariness” one of the criteria of distributively\nrelevant institutions, which seems to imply that individuals or states\nthat don’t wish to participate in the global economy will be\ncoerced into doing so, generally by threat of economic catastrophe.\nSimilarly, Cohen and Sabel present their three “weak”\nnon-coercive accounts of when obligations of distributive justice are\nactivated, but their argument that the WTO should invoke norms of\ninclusion is based—at least partly—on the fact that the\nWTO can issue coercive threats. Sangiovanni discusses the provision of\npublic goods, which may seem non-coercive, but if these public goods\nare necessary for even minimally decent lives, then it seems that the\nthreat of their non-provision could very well be a coercive one. To\nput it another way, is it really the case that economic cooperation\nthrough trade—even institutionalized in order to solve\ncoordination problems—is ever enough to invoke norms of\ndistributive justice if there is no chance that that economic\ncooperation, no matter how unequally distributed, will undermine the\npossibility of the participants to live decent lives? The worry here\nis that left institutionalists might be begging the question by\ncovertly assuming that the international system is indeed coercive,\nwill remain coercive even if reformed, and is coercive in precisely\nway needed to generate obligations of distributive justice. Left\ninstitutionalists, therefore, are quite adept at identifying\ninjustices in the international arena, but they are less persuasive at\nshowing that the appropriate normative response to these wrongs is to\nhave the international system be governed by principles of\ndistributive justice. For example, suppose Moellendorf is correct that\nthe WTO wrongly forces an inappropriate development model on weak and\nfailing nations that serves the rich and powerful while undermining\nthe ability of those nations to become democratically well-ordered.\nCertainly the right response to recognizing this wrong is to have the\nWTO cease that unjust behavior. It is hard to see why we\nwould need the more robust norm of distributive equality to understand\nthe wrongness of the WTO’s behavior. \nIn recent years, the debate about institutions and justice has\nbroadened significantly. Some, as we will discuss in section 4, have\nbegun to question whether institutions are all that significant from\nthe standpoint of justice. Others, however, have begun to expand the\ntoolkit with which global institutions are to be judged. The\nresurgence of republican thought in recent years has offered an\nopportunity for thinkers concerned with domination to examine how\nglobal institutions might be understood from the standpoint of\nrepublican justice. In this section, we will lay out the basic tenets\nof neo-republicanism and explain the major positions that have been\nstaked out in their application to issues of global concern. \n\n Neo-republicanism (see entry)\n is a family of views that emphasizes the close connection between\njustice and a particular kind of freedom. Namely, the purpose of\nsocial institutions is to protect us from domination by others and to\nensure we can act independently from the wills of others. Unlike\nfreedom from interference, freedom from domination is specifically\nabout the power relation: a slaveowner who could interfere with her\nslaves but chooses not is still constraining their freedom. In this\ncase, slaves are not free from the will of their owner even if they\nhappen to live their lives mostly without interference. Thus,\ndomination is a worry whenever one agent has superior power over\nanother and can asymmetrically influence the choice situation of the\nweaker agent. However, it is sometimes, even usually, the case that we\ncannot eliminate differentials in social position or power, but one\ncan be subject to superior power without being dominated if the\nexercise of that power is suitably constrained or directed. There is a\nfair amount of disagreement over the precise nature of these\nconstraints, but neo-republicans have converged on a set of\ninstitutional prescriptions that ensure that citizens are not merely\nsubject to power: the rule of law, constitutional protections,\ndemocracy, due process, and the provision of a social minimum at the\nvery least. These institutional structures have a two-fold objective.\nFirst, they constrain state power such that there is no public\ndomination. Second, they direct state power effectively towards its\njustificatory purpose: governing the relations between citizens such\nthat there is no private domination. These purposes can only be\nachieved within a republican constitutional order and so freedom is\nonly possible in the state. This is, perhaps, the key idea behind\nrepublicanism: we do not give up freedom in order to achieve the\nsecurity of citizenship in a state, citizenship in a state is a\nprecondition of freedom. \nGiven the neo-republican focus on the moral necessity of citizenship\nin a constitutional order, it is unsurprising that most\nneo-republicans have adopted a view that is functionally similar to\nthe right institutionalists (Pettit 2010; Laborde & Ronzoni \n2015; Smith forthcoming).\nThe state is the primary site of distributive justice and the purpose\nof international institutions is to ensure that each state has the\nability to ensure non-domination within its borders and to prevent\nstates from dominating other states. This commitment is driven by\nconsiderations that are primarily non-ideal. Many statist\nneo-republicans have no principled objection to a world republic and\nmay even find that institutional structure preferable under ideal\nconditions. Yet, they view a more robustly republican global order as\nsimply too far away and difficult to achieve for the ideal case to be\naction-guiding. \nA smaller but growing group of neo-republicans fit more in the mold of\nleft institutionalists (Laborde 2010; Bohman 2004; Buckinx 2011).\nGenerally, left institutionalist neo-republicans are impressed by\n“expansion” arguments that purport to show that the\nconsiderations that motivate us to be concerned about coercion,\ncooperation, or domination at the domestic level apply to issues of\nglobal governance. These left republicans do not expect or want the\nstate to “wither away” but rather think that direct\nprotections against domination at the level of regional or global\ngovernance are necessary. In general, left republicans are—at\nleast on global justice issues—less optimistic about the ability\nof even well-ordered states to manage their affairs in the face of\nglobal coordination problems from climate change to immigration and\nthus argue that global governance regimes need to be designed with\ntheir own republican principles in mind and not treated as mere\nadjuncts to state capacity. \nFinally, both left and right neo-republicans are—and need\nto—engage with a deeper conceptual issue: the republican world\nstate. Jacobin republicans, for example, believed that if the civil\ncondition between citizens was morally necessary, then a civil\ncondition between states was equally necessary (Kleingeld 2011). This\nseems to suggest that the world state is morally necessary. Most\nneo-republican objections to the world state concern its lack of\nfeasibility. This means that left and right republicans are both\nallied in suggesting that the improbability of the world republican\nstate is sufficient to warrant its rejection as an institutional\nobjective. Yet it is unclear whether these feasibility concerns,\nborrowed from Kant, are as quite as substantial as they appear\n(Deudney 2006) and it is also unclear why they should be so decisive\nin our normative theorizing even if they were (Gilabert 2017). There\nis a worrisome asymmetry in the neo-republican discussions of\nfeasibility in the context of global justice: a modern state with the\nrule of law and reliable welfare provision would have been viewed as\nquite unfeasible in the early modern period and yet this did not\nprevent republicans from pushing for those institutional norms over\ntime. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a key feature of future neo-republican\ntheorizing about global justice will concern the appropriate mixture\nof ideal and non-ideal assumptions and the use of feasibility\njudgments when it comes to making normative prescriptions. \nAs the above discussion demonstrates, much work in global justice\nbegins with interpretations of—and arguments\nabout—Rawlsian principles. Some recent work, however, has sought\nto break the Rawlsian spell, by demonstrating the plausibility of\nprinciples and theories not foundationally linked to Rawlsian\narguments. This work includes many recent philosophical theories\nwhich—while undoubtedly influenced by Rawls—are less\nconcerned with applying Rawlsian methods directly to global\ninstitutions (see also R. Miller 2010; Brock 2009; Altman &\nWellman 2009). We will here examine four important recent\ncontributions to this project. The first, which we might call pure\negalitarianism, argues that egalitarianism applies among persons\nconsidered as human; no institutional framework is needed to give rise\nto strong duties of distributive justice. The second, associated with\nThomas Pogge, argues that the global institutional structure we see\ntoday is not merely unjust, but actively violating the negative rights\nof the global poor. The third notes that the fact of history—in\nparticular, the shared experience of colonialism and imperial\nexploitation—is a central, and underexplored, part of any\nplausible account of global distributive justice. The fourth, finally,\nargues that an independent concern with property rights is necessary\nfor the evaluation of global justice. We will consider these arguments\nin turn. \nThe dispute between left and right institutionalism has centered on\nhow to interpret the institutions found at the global level; both\nsides in the debate agreed that the nature of these institutions is of\nprimary importance in establishing whether or not egalitarian duties\nhold globally. Some recent theorists, however, have challenged this\nassumption. On this vision, what is relevant from the standpoint of\njustice is only whether or not a particular agent is, in fact, a\nrecognizably human agent—not whether that agent stands in a\nparticular relationship as regards other humans. Simon Caney is a\nchief exponent of this theoretical perspective, and defends it as\nfollows: \nConsider a world with two separate systems of interaction that have no\ncontact but are aware of each other and suppose that one of them is\nprosperous whereas the other is extremely impoverished. Compare, now,\ntwo individuals—one from the prosperous system and one from the\nimpoverished system—who are identical in their abilities and\nneeds. The member of the prosperous system receives more. But it is\ndifficult to see why—concentrating on any possible and\nreasonable criteria for entitlement—this is fair. Ex\nhypothesi, she is not more hard-working or more gifted or more\nneedy. In all respects they are identical (bar one, namely that one is\nlucky to live in the prosperous society and one is not) and yet an\ninstitutionalist approach confers on one many more benefits. Moreover,\nit does so wholly arbitrarily because there is no ground on which the\nmember of the prosperous society can claim to be entitled to more.\n(Caney 2005: 111; see also Tan 2004) \nOther cosmopolitans have echoed this conclusion, while grounding it in\na broader theory of ethics. Kok-Chor Tan, for instance, argues that\nany global order that allows economic inequality to rest upon\narbitrary facts can be rejected as unjust: \nThe ideas of state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of states\npresume a global institutional order that grants these ideas a certain\nmoral standing, as claims that others should respect. But this respect\nis achievable only if the global order is not one that persons subject\nto it can reasonably reject. My claim is that a global order that\nturns arbitrariness about persons into differential personal\nadvantages is one that some can reasonably reject. (Tan 2012: 159) \nThese conclusions are echoed by Pablo Gilabert, who uses the notion of\nreasonable rejection to argue for a “humanist\negalitarianism”, on which principles of distributive justice\napply simply in virtue of status as human: \nTo say that some but not all humans are entitled to [economic]\nadvantages would seem, on the face of it, morally arbitrary. It would\nfail to show equal concern and respect for all… Any conception\nof global distribution that gives some human beings less access to the\nimportant advantages identified [above] than it gives to others is one\nthat the former have reason to reject. (Gilabert 2012:\n196–97) \nThis form of egalitarianism has some undisputed attractions. It keeps\nthe moral attention focused on human persons, which is—we might\nagree—right where it ought to be. It is compatible, moreover,\nwith a variety of different theories of what might be the appropriate\nmetric with which to demonstrate our egalitarian respect; Caney argues\nthat a global principle of equality of opportunity is likely superior\nto one based upon resources (Caney 2001). It is compatible, moreover,\nwith the institutions we have developed being relevant from the\nstandpoint of justice, insofar as they help or hinder efforts to live\nup to the demands of global equality. It insists, in the end, only\nthat such institutions are at most helpful tools, rather than\nfoundational forms of human relationship that give rise to distinct\nmoral duties. \nThe problem with this form of egalitarianism, however, is that\ncomparatively few of us are prepared to take distributive equality as\na foundational value; most of us believe that distributive equality is\nrelevant only within certain relational contexts, as a way of\nguaranteeing that individuals are not dominated or marginalized within\nthose relationships (Anderson 1999; Altman & Wellman 2009). To say\nthat equality is itself a value seems to ascribe a fundamental moral\nimportance to relative income shares—an importance that seems,\nat the very least, somewhat in need of defense . Return once again to\nthe example of Atlantis. Imagine that the world were made fully just,\naccording to whatever conception of justice you require, and that the\nisland of Atlantis then rose into that just world; imagine further\nthat every Atlantean were possessed of a small quantity of diamonds,\nwhich made them significantly more wealthy than the average person.\nWould the Atlanteans have the duty, simply in virtue of common\nhumanity, to redistribute their diamonds, so as to ensure equality?\nThe answer, for a pure egalitarian, must be yes; this answer, however,\nseems to say that what was a just world has now become unjust, simply\nbecause we are made aware of others doing better for themselves than\nwe are (Blake 2012). This particular vision of egalitarianism depends\nupon an ideal of quality that many people—including both right\nand left Rawlsians—have regarded as deeply problematic. \nThe pure egalitarian impulse begins with the idea that we have duties\nof justice towards one another that do not depend upon shared\ninstitutions. Thomas Pogge’s recent work, in contrast, argues\nthat institutions are morally central—but in a manner somewhat\nunlike that argued for by the left Rawlsians. (Pogge was, of course,\nan early advocate of left institutionalism, but his more recent work\ndoes not depend upon left institutionalism being true.) Pogge’s\nrecent work (see, especially, 2002) has argued that the institutions\nwe have built in the world are, in fact, directly violating the rights\nof the poor. We can start our analysis here by noting the starkness of\nPogge’s conclusion: global poverty represents, for Pogge, not\njust an unmet humanitarian obligation, but an ongoing human evil,\nperhaps the greatest one in history. Pogge’s argument insists\nthat international poverty and underdevelopment—and the death\nand wasted potential this entails—find their causal origin in a\nset of global institutions created and imposed by the wealthy nations\nof the world upon the global poor (Pogge 2002, 2010a). As such, the\npoverty of the underdeveloped nations is not simply a fact in the\nworld, to be dealt with by comparatively weak moral notions of\nhumanitarian benefit and charity; it is, instead, a violation of the\nrights of the poor. It is not simply a violation of their legitimate\nexpectations; they might expect to be helped, for instance, and we are\nnot merely refraining from doing that. It is a violation of their\nnegative rights to be free from harm. The poorer inhabitants of the\nworld have rights that are being violated, on a massive scale, by the\nwealthy states. One significant mechanism for this violation is the\nascription of the resource and borrowing privilege to any organization\nable to take effective political control of a territorial\njurisdiction. A group does not have to truly represent the interests\nof a place’s inhabitants, on the rules set up by international\nlaw, in order to sell that jurisdiction’s resources. So long as\nan agent is able to effectively control and repress the inhabitants,\nit has the ability to speak in their name in international\ntreaty-making—regardless of how badly it treats these\ninhabitants. The result, for Pogge, is that the institutions of global\nsociety have set up incentives by which undemocratic regimes are\nrewarded and encouraged in the underdeveloped countries, and in which\nresources predictably flow from these countries to those already\nblessed with wealth. The shared history of colonial rule, moreover,\nhas led to the radical underdevelopment experienced by many former\ncolonies, with the result that these colonies are likely to be\nexceptionally vulnerable to the decisions and acts of agents within\nformer colonial powers. Global institutions are, in the end, developed\nand maintained to benefit the wealthier nations that set these\ninstitutions up, and whose participation is necessary for their\nsurvival as institutions. They serve only to impose a set of property\nrules upon the poorer nations that guarantee their continued poverty\nand underdevelopment. \nPogge’s analysis is powerful, and includes a number of valuable\npositive suggestions about how we might begin to rectify these\ndefects—including revisions in how pharmaceutical research is\nincentivized, and mechanisms for a global tax on resource use (Pogge\n1994 and 2011). For the moment, though, we may examine only the major\ncritical responses to which Pogge’s argument has been subjected.\nMost of Pogge’s critics agree with his contention that\ninternational poverty is unjust, in addition to being a violation of\nhumanitarian duties. These critics, though, have frequently questioned\nwhether or not Pogge has made his case that this poverty is causally\nascribable to the international institutional set—and that\nsimple revisions in this set could dramatically decrease global\npoverty. \nThe first form of critique begins with an objection to Pogge’s\nidea that global institutions cause international poverty. The worry\nwith this idea begins with concerns about the idea that the notion of\na cause can be, without certain controversial assumptions, be easily\nascribed to anything as complex as the global institutional set. In\nparticular, for an institution to be said to have caused a result,\nthere must be a comprehensible baseline of expectations to which the\nexisting result might be compared. Alan Patten and Mathias Risse have\neach provided a version of this critique. Patten argues that Pogge\nillegitimately smuggles in a moralized baseline of expectations, in\nwhich the inhabitants of the poorer nations obtain the resources and\nrights they would have under ideal justice; this baseline is what the\npoor deserve, argues Patten, but it is a stretch to say that the\nwealthy nations cause the poverty of the poor when they fail to bring\nabout ideal justice (Patten 2005). Mathias Risse offers an even more\npointed criticism, pointing out that the usual baseline for causation\nto be ascribed to an interaction is the expectations that would hold\nin the absence of such interaction (Risse 2005). Risse points out that\nthe statistical baseline for most of humanity throughout history has\nbeen radical poverty and misery. On this analysis, the interaction\nbetween the poor and the rich might be taken to have increased the\nwealth of the poor, rather than caused their poverty. This is\ncompatible, of course, with the existence of duties of justice as\nregards the benefits of industrialization and globalization; the poor\nmay have become slightly better off, but the wealthy have undoubtedly\ngotten much, much richer, and we might develop theories that condemn\nthis gap. Pogge’s contention that global poverty is caused by\nthe wealthy societies of the world, though, seems—to Risse and\nPatten—simply incorrect.  Joshua Cohen offers a more wide-reaching version of these\nconcerns.  He, too, begins with the difficulty of saying that the\npoverty of the global poor is caused by the wealth of the global rich\n(Cohen 2011). He challenges, that is, the extent to which the global\ninstitutions imposed by the wealthy are actually causally\nresponsible. His analysis, though, draws more on modern development\neconomics, and notes that modern theorists have identified various\nfactors that might determine why some countries are poor and some are\nrich: they include the institutions described by Pogge, but they also\ninclude such endogenous factors as geography, resource allocation, and\npolitical culture (Easterly 2006).  The precise weighting and power of\nthese various factors is, of course, a matter of tremendous\ndisagreement and controversy, and much of the field of development\neconomics is devoted to developing more complete and powerful analyses\nof how the relative wealth and poverty of nations is to be\nexplained. This is a difficulty for Pogge, argues Cohen, since his\nanalysis of poverty includes only two possibilities: either the poor\nnations of the world are responsible for their own poverty, which is\nimplausible, or the rich nations of the world are responsible for that\npoverty. Cohen’s conclusion is that Pogge has not adequately\ncome to terms with the empirical complexity of how poverty is to be\nexplained, and that as a result his conclusions about international\nculpability for poverty are simply unmotivated. \nThe debate between Pogge and his critics, of course, continues (see\nPogge 2010b); Pogge is able to offer rejoinders to many of the\nobjections discussed here. In particular, Pogge has emphasized\nrecently that the baseline with which his analysis proceeds is one of\na reasonable alternative set of arrangements that would not generate\nthis massive human rights deficit. Christian Barry and Gerhard\nØverland, moreover, have recently provided six distinct ways in\nwhich the global order might be thought to harm the poor, despite the\nconceptual worries of figures like Risse and Cohen (Barry &\nØverland, 2016). It is important to recognize, though, that\nmuch of this debate turns on a mixture of empirical social science and\npolitical philosophy. This is, we believe, likely to be a territory in\nwhich an increasing amount of work on global justice will have to be\nsituated in the years to come. \nAn increasingly important challenge to the institutionalist paradigm\nof global justice is the historical legacy and contemporary effects of\ncolonialism. The idea that our obligations of distributive justice as\ndetermined by our current institutions might be undermined by\nthe idea that the historical relationship of colonialism has\ntremendous influence on current distributions of wealth and power. The\nfocus on colonialism has three aspects though this section will focus\nmostly on the second and third. First, there is a growing interest in\nwhether the early modern progenitors of the social contract tradition\nwere ideologically complicit in European imperialism. In particular,\nthere is a lively debate concerning how Kant’s account of\nhospitality and cosmopolitan right can used to critique colonial and\nneo-colonial relations (Flikschuh & Ypi 2014). Second, there is a\nsignificant—and mostly cosmopolitan in orientation—debate\nconcerning precisely what makes colonialism unjust or wrong. Third,\ngiven the wrong of colonialism and the likely reverberation of its\nnegative effects onto the present, there is the question\nof rectificatory global justice. That is, colonial powers\nhave some distributive duties in virtue of the fact that they must\nrepair the harm caused by their imperial endeavors. \nIt is obviously true that the history of colonialism is replete with\nan almost unparalleled violence (Fanon 1961; Walter 2017). Yet, it\nseems equally clear that a colonial relationship that was essentially\nfree of this sort of violence—or where the level of violence was\nconsiderably lower than the pre-colonial political\nsituation—would still be morally unacceptable. The question of\nwhat precisely grounds the wrongness of colonialism is an attempt to\ngrapple with difficult questions of procedural justice, sovereignty,\nand legitimacy—and how these ideas affect our current\nunderstanding of global distributive justice.  Lea Ypi, for example,\nargues that colonialism is wrong because it represents a wrongfully\nunequal political relationship between the ruler and the ruled (Ypi\n2013; see also Lu 2017). Thus, the defining feature of colonialism is\nset of unequal and non-reciprocal terms of political association. This\nfeature of colonialism makes it uniquely wrong even if the\ncolonizers refrain from atrocities, the colonized have no strongly\nclaims—property or otherwise—to the land being taken, or\nthe colonized lack significant rights to self-determination. This\nview, however, does give rise to a serious concern about how we should\nunderstand coercive associative political projects where the terms of\nassociation being offered are comparatively equitable. That is,\nimagine some more powerful state that comes to a weaker group of\npeople and offers them an offer of political association that is both\nhard to refuse and, yet, based upon equitable terms. Ypi suggests that\nequitable terms of association are decisively undermined if the weaker\nparty does not consent, so it must be true that the\n“colonized” group consents. And yet, it is at least\npossible to imagine cases where the weaker party sees the benefit of\nassociation and therefore consents to the association in ways that\ngive rises to concerns of colonialism. In other words, Ypi’s\naccount may miss a feature of colonialism that gives rise to its\ndistinctiveness as a wrong (Valentini 2015). In most cases, the\ncriticism of Ypi’s account lies in nature of the entity to which\nreciprocal association is owed: the colonized understood as\nindividuals, as corporate bodies, or as a plurality. This is\nespecially important because Ypi’s account—in order to be\ndistinct—must not rely upon nationalism or some sort of\ncorporate ownership of specific territory, and it remains an open\nwhether her account can effectively avoid so relying. At any rate,\ndiscussions of how to precisely to characterize the wrong of\nself-determination are ongoing. \nFinally, colonialism gives rise to claims that the distribution of\nwealth globally ought to be re-ordered in order to satisfy the demands\nof rectificatory global justice. The claim is that rich nations in\ngeneral, or colonizing nations in particular, ought to transfer wealth\nor other valuable resources to poor nations in general or colonized\nnations in particular in virtue of the legacy of colonialism. It is\nimportant to see that these claims to rectification tend to be\npredicated upon the idea that there are contemporary effects of\ncolonial relations. For example, the “new\ninstitutionalists” (Acemoglu & Robinson 2012) suggest that\ndifferences in development are a consequence of geographically driven\ndifferences in colonial history. In some cases, the colonial\npowers—often in the context of settler colonialism—set up\nrelatively effective institutions with the rule of law and strong\nproperty rights. In other contexts, the colonial powers set up\nextractive institutions. These extractive institutions set up strong\nincentive structures for the “liberated” de-colonized\nelites to maintain the extractive nature of these institutions,\ninhibiting development. This is often encouraged—through\ncorruption, military intervention, and less obviously criminal\neconomic manipulation—by the former colonial powers themselves.\nAs a consequence, the initial extractive equilibrium is hard to\ndispel. This account creates a complication for rectificatory views,\nwhich is that this view relies on the bad actions of local elites to\nsustain the equilibrium and so complicates the question of who,\nprecisely, is responsible for the poor current state of many states\n(Lomasky & Tesón 2015). Nonetheless, many have argued that\nthe contemporary effects—whether though the imposition of\ninstitutional forms or debt—of colonialism generates a special\nobligation to provide, for example, debt relief (Jaggar 2002), open\nborders (Amighetti & Nuti 2016) or additional emissions permits\n(Blomfield 2015). Yet, these views face some significant hurdles. They\nhave difficulty in generating a general obligation by rich nations to\nhelp poor nations; rather, they generate obligations for colonizing\nstates to help their former colonies. And while it may be true these\nrelations mostly track the needs of the present, there is no\nrequirement that they do so and, indeed, there seem to be cases where\nthe requirement to assist needy countries and the requirement to help\nnations that have been negatively affected by colonialism conflict.\nSo, rectificatory views must either accept that sometimes states will\nbe obligated to rectify in cases where the objects of the obligation\nare not particularly needy or need to suggest that a broader\nparticipation in an ongoing system of neo-colonial economic relations\nis sufficient to activate the obligations. Yet, if we adopt this\nlatter interpretation, then it is unclear that this view is truly\ndifferent from left institutionalist views described above. If the\nformer, then the claims of colonialism do not appear to be as urgent\nas distributive obligations. Furthermore, the nature of the claim to\ncompensation depends on characterizing the relevant baseline: are we\ncomparing the plight of the former colonies to how they would have\nbeen without colonization or a world where the colonizers acted\njustly? Each of these answers have their issues, with the former being\ntoo permissive towards colonialism and the latter collapsing into\nother views of justice. It is hard to deny that the legacy of\ncolonialism is significant in a variety of applied issues—from\ntrade to climate change to humanitarian intervention—and the\ngrowing interest in its effects and normative consequences is a\nwelcome development; the philosophical difficulties of addressing that\nlegacy, however, are likely to prove difficult indeed. \nWe can conclude this discussion of distributive justice by discussing\nsome recent work on global economic justice that rejects the Rawlsian\nlegacy in a more thoroughgoing manner. Much of this work begins with a\nconcern for property rights, understood in terms that make them prior\nto—and, thus, constraints upon—principles of distributive\njustice. Rawlsian distributive justice, of course, is compatible with\nthe defense of property rights; but those rights are taken to be\nconstructed out of the theory of justice—they do not, as it\nwere, exist before the discussion of economic justice. For many\ntheorists, however, property rights must be respected as inputs to our\ntheorizing about global distributive justice—rather than as\noutputs of that theorizing.  \nThree sorts of theories have recently been put forward into the\ndebates surrounding global economic justice. The first—which we\nwill call right libertarians—take individual rights to\nacquire and trade in property as foundational for any analysis of\nglobal economic justice. The second—who take their inspiration\nfrom the left libertarian tradition—take common\nproperty rights in the world as a basis for theorizing about global\ndistributive justice. The final—who can be termed theorists of\nnational property rights—take the right of a\nnation’s people to use and exploit its natural resources as\nfoundational for thinking about global justice. We can discuss these\nin turn. \nThe debate between libertarian and liberal theories of distributive\njustice is a long-standing one within analytic political philosophy;\nRobert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia offered a\nchallenge to Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice (Nozick\n1974). Nozick argued that a rightful respect for property rights made\nit impossible for a just state to pursue “patterned”\nprinciples of distributive justice. The right to property, if\nrespected, would make such principles of economic equality chimerical\nat best, and totalitarian at worst.  \nIdeas such as those of Nozick have only recently been applied to the\nglobal level. Bas van der Vossen and Jason Brennan (2018) have\ndefended the thought that economic freedom would, if applied at the\nglobal level, lead to greater wealth—and greater human\nflourishing—than any attempt to pursue some particular pattern\nof wealth and poverty. In particular, they argue, social scientific\ndata indicate that policy interventions designed to narrow the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor tends to do more harm than good; good\nintentions, they note, are inadequate to ensure good results. Loren\nLomasky and Fernando Tesón (2015), similarly defend the thought\nthat individual property rights would, if defended universally, lead\nto a significant reduction in global poverty. It is only by\nuniversalizing respect for individual property rights, they argue,\nthat the global poverty can be reduced.  \nThese arguments are, of course, intended to undermine global\ndistributive justice as an independent goal, much as Nozick intended\nhis work to undermine the Rawlsian belief than the gap between the\nrich and the poor was itself a relevant consideration for social\njustice. As such, the same arguments that have been made against\nNozick might also hold true for those who defend libertarianism at the\nglobal level. In the first instance, we might note that there is, on\nthese views, no independent worry about the size of the gap between\nthe rich and the poor; even if the universalization of property rights\nwere to produce an increase in overall wealth, there is nothing within\nthese theories that allows us to regard an increased inequality\nbetween the rich and the poor as problematic in its own right. This,\nof course, is not an objection to the libertarian view; it is,\ninstead, simply evidence that the libertarian and the liberal are\nmotivated by distinct moral concerns. But it is also worth noting that\nsome of what the libertarian says here is motivated by predictions\nabout what the globalization of individual property rights would\ndo. The libertarian is convinced that a global expansion of\nthose rights would produce a world of flourishing communities and\nflourishing individuals. Others, however, would worry that the\nuniversalization of libertarian rights might produce something\nentirely different—that a world of unconstrained capitalism\nmight produce dystopia and rampant inequality, rather than perpetual\npeace. The debate between the global liberal and the global\nlibertarian is, then, going to turn upon both principle and\nprediction, in a way that makes this debate unlikely to be resolved\nsoon. \nIf the right-libertarian celebrates individual property rights, the\nleft-libertarian regards property rights as a collective phenomenon.\nLeft-libertarian thought is complex, and merits its own examination;\nwe will not provide an adequate analysis of that thought here. We\nmean, instead, to note that one particular left-libertarian\nidea—that individual property rights in natural resources and in\nterritory must acknowledge the symmetrical claims of all human persons\nto the use of those goods—has proven to be a fruitful one in\ntheorizing about global distributive justice. \nHillel Steiner (2005) argues that all individuals are equally entitled\nto benefit from the exploitation of natural resources; as such, those\nleft behind by territorial expropriation have the right to\ncompensation, through the creation of a proposed Global Fund. Mathias\nRisse (2012) has more recently argued in favor of common ownership of\nthe world’s natural resources as an independent ground of\njustice. Risse’s view is complex and polycentric, and includes\nsites on which global justice might be evaluated—including\ncommon humanity, shared subjection to a coercive legal system, and the\nfact that humanity shares a limited set of territorial goods. It is\nthis latter aspect that is most relevant for our present discussion;\nRisse argues that the world’s natural resources, since they are\nnot the result of any individual person’s agency, must be\nregarded as subject to symmetrical claims from all human persons. This\nvision of the world as given to mankind in common, of course, is\nborrowed from early modern thinkers; Risse vindicates their concern\nwith natural resources, and argues that conclusions for both migration\nand for distributive justice can be derived from this ground. \nThese ideas are complex, and the debate over their relevance to global\njustice is likely to continue. One immediate worry, of course, is how\nto understand the relationship between that wealth created by natural\nresources, and that wealth created by human agency and ingenuity.\nSteiner and Risse both argue that the collective right to use the\nearth constrains what distribution of wealth can emerge at the global\nlevel; but both must provide some account of how to figure out what\ncounts as given to humans by God or by nature, from that which is\ncreated by humans using their brains and their agency. Steiner and\nRisse do, of course, engage with exactly that issue; but the precise\ncut between what is made by God and what is made by humanity is likely\nto be a continuing source of controversy. \nWe can conclude this section by examining a view on which property\nrights in the natural resources of a country are held by that set of\npeople who live within that particular country. This view is defended\nin Wenar (2015), who argues that it would be revolutionary—in\nour world, as it emerges from colonialism and imperialism—for us\nto regard the inhabitants of a given country as actually owning that\ncountry’s national resources. Wenar notes, as does Pogge, that\nour current global institutions allow—indeed,\nincentivize—bad governance, by encouraging malign agents to gain\ncontrol of a coercive state and sell of the natural resources of that\nstate. Wenar, however, grounds this not in a cosmopolitan vision of\nRawlsian right, but instead upon a view on which the territorial goods\ncontained within a country are owned by the inhabitants of that\ncountry. Those who would sell those goods without the consent of the\npeople, then, are best understood as thieves—whether or not\nthose thieves present themselves as the legitimate government of the\nsociety in question: \nIf we believe in popular resource sovereignty, there can be no such\nthing as a ruler who is benevolent with resource revenues. No one can\nbe generous by giving someone what they already own. The citizens of a\ncountry are entitled to all the value of their resources; the regime\nis entitled to not a penny. All of Saudi Arabia’s oil belongs to\nthe Saudi people, and the royals can only have their super yachts and\npalaces—indeed, anything bought with the oil money—at the\npeople’s sufferance. A king’s right is not to\n“all”, it is to “nothing” (Wenar 2015:\n241). \nWenar’s argument is not directly focused on global distributive\njustice, so much as it is focused on the avoidance of Western\ncomplicity in tyranny and dispossession; Wenar defends Western legal\ninstruments intended to avoid participation in unjustified resource\nsales, instead of principles of global distributive justice.\nNevertheless, this vision of collective property rights over natural\ngoods might be thought to pose an independent check on what sorts of\nredistributive policy are available, similar to the libertarian views\ndiscussed above. And, similarly, it is possible to object to\nWenar’s view, with reference to whether or not this way of\nconstructing property rights is morally defensible (see generally\nWenar et al. 2018). In particular, the cosmopolitan might reject the\nthought that a Saudi citizen (say) has a greater claim than others to\nexploit the Saudi oilfields, simply because of his birth within the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. Wenar’s view, nonetheless, is an\nimportant recent addition to the philosophical discussion of global\ndistributive justice, and debate about that view is likely to\ncontinue. \nIt is rarely a smart move to make predictions within philosophy.\nNevertheless, it is perhaps appropriate to offer a few views about\nwhat we are likely to see in future work about global justice. The\nfirst, following on our discussion of Pogge’s work, is an\nincreased engagement by philosophers with empirical evidence and\nempirical methods. Apart from the pure egalitarians, political\nphilosophers all make assumptions about the nature and powers of\nglobal institutions; these assumptions can be grounded—or\nrefuted—by engagement with international lawyers, development\neconomists, and the like. To some extent, this engagement is already\nhappening (Reddy & Pogge 2010; Hassoun & Subramanian 2012;\nBenatar & Brock 2011). More of this engagement is, we believe,\nboth likely and likely to be beneficial.   The second trend we would identify is that there is increasingly\nlikely a need for political philosophy dealing with specific global\nphenomena. Much of what we have dealt with here has looked only at the\nmacro-level phenomenon of global inequality. A full analysis of global\njustice will also look at specific forms of human institution and\nagency that are likely to be relevant from the standpoint of justice.\nWe have already mentioned, if only in passing, the issues of\nimmigration, fairness in trade, and feminism. We would conclude here\nby mentioning some other areas of inquiry that might become\nincreasingly important. Buchanan (2009) and Pogge (2009) have both\nproduced recent work on global incentives for pharmaceutical\nresearch. Ypi, Goodin, & Barry (2009) have written on the issue of\nglobal debt relief. Gardiner (2004) and Caney (2008, 2009) have\nwritten on the relationship of global climate change and global\ninequality. Increasingly, we believe that these sorts of analyses are\nlikely to proliferate, and philosophers come to terms not just with\nthe fact of inequality, but with the plurality of different reasons\nfor—and solutions to—that inequality.  Political\nphilosophy has only recently turned its attention to questions of\nglobal justice; it is our hope that this attention will deepen in\nyears to come, as we gain more understanding of the nature and causes\nof global underdevelopment and inequality.  The final trend might be the most important; we are increasingly\nwilling to move beyond the questions that animated Rawlsian analyses\nof global distributive justice, to a broader consideration of the\nagents and institutions that might be implicated in our global\nprocesses of production. Iris Marion Young (2011) raises some\nimportant questions about how to begin to understand the various\nagents whose acts might be constrained by moral theorizing—and\nhow to understand the distinct ways in which our identities, as\nconsumers and as citizens, might be implicated in the replication of\npoverty and inequality. Although this entry began with an examination\nof the Rawlsian tradition of thinking about distributive justice, it\nis an entirely good thing that the philosophical literature is\nincreasingly willing to move beyond that tradition. As global\nrelationships become more complicated and more central, we stand in\nneed of more theorizing about how to understand the relationship\nbetween global wealth and global poverty—and about the moral\nprinciples within which that relationship is to be understood.","contact.mail":"miblake@u.washington.edu","contact.domain":"u.washington.edu"},{"date.published":"2013-10-24","date.changed":"2020-05-04","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/international-justice/","author1":"Michael Blake","author1.info":"https://phil.washington.edu/people/michael-blake","author2.info":"http://www.patricktaylorsmith.com/","entry":"international-justice","body.text":"\n\n\nInternational distributive justice has, in the past several decades,\nbecome a prominent topic within political philosophy. Philosophers\nhave, of course, long been concerned with wealth and poverty, and with\nhow economic inequalities between persons might be justified. They\nhave, however, tended to focus only upon inequalities between\ninhabitants of the same state. In recent years, though, a sustained\nphilosophical dialogue has emerged on how these ideas might be applied\nto the relationships and institutions holding at the global level.\nThis dialogue has been prompted by issues of philosophy, but also by\nthe realities of globalization and global poverty; in a world as\nconnected as our own, is it justifiable that some have so much while\nothers have so little?\n\n\nThis entry is an introduction to the development of this dialogue. It\nis, perhaps, appropriate to start with some limitations. This entry\nwill discuss only the distributive aspects of international justice,\nrather than on all aspects of international relations and institutions\nthat might be morally important. Philosophical discussion of global\njustice has become sufficiently rich and complex that it is no longer\npossible to discuss all the various threads of this discussion in one\nentry (see Chatterjee [2011] for a more encyclopedic discussion of the\nvarious debates within global justice). This entry will, accordingly,\npass over such important topics as fairness in trade (Risse &\nWollner 2019; James 2012; Wenar 2020; Kurjanska & Risse 2008);\nimmigration (Blake forthcoming; D. Miller, 2016; Carens 2013; Wellman\n& Cole 2011; Carens 1987 [1995]); and gender (Kristof & WuDunn\n2009; Jaggar 2005; Nussbaum 2000). The fact that we do not discuss\nthese topics should not be read as implying their irrelevance; on the\ncontrary, they are enormously important for any adequate theory of\nglobal justice, and deserve more attention than we can provide\nhere. This entry will, moreover, discuss writings primarily within the\ntradition of liberal egalitarianism. Thinkers of a radical or a\nMarxist bent have had things to say about international justice, too,\nbut these writings are here largely ignored (see Kohn 2010, Humphrey\n2010, and Goto-Jones 2010 in Bell 2010, for discussions of these\ntopics). The entry is, finally, focused almost exclusively on fairly\nrecent writings. The reason for this is the simple fact, noted above,\nthat international justice has been a central research topic only in\nrecent years. This is emphatically not to say that less recent\nphilosophers have not had important things to say about international\njustice: Immanuel Kant’s idea of a foedus pacificum\ncontinues to exert a strong influence over modern philosophical\nthought, for example, as does Mill’s liberal nationalism (Kant\n1795; Mill 1859). The modern period, too, has seen some sustained\ndiscussion of global wealth and poverty, most notably in Peter\nSinger’s discussion of the ethics of global famine relief\n(Singer 1972; see also Singer 2002). Nevertheless, the modern dialogue\nabout international distributive justice can be largely traced to the\ninitial publication of John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice\nin 1971, and the prehistory of these ideas can be largely omitted in\nthe present context.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can begin, then, with John Rawls’s A Theory of\nJustice. The influence of this work on modern political\nphilosophy can hardly be overstated. It shifted the assumptions with\nwhich political philosophers have operated—in part by\nresuscitating the social contract tradition, and in part by giving a\nsustained and analytically robust argument regarding the injustice of\nparticular forms of economic inequality. A full analysis of\nRawls’s work is beyond the scope of this entry; readers can see\nthe related entries in this encyclopedia for more detail. Rawls\nintroduces two principles of justice, which he argues represent the\nprinciples of justice we would accept as governing the “basic\nstructure” of our society were we to bargain with one another\nunder fair conditions. These principles of justice include those\naddressing political justice, and with what fairness would demand of\nthe rules allocating persons to positions within the basic structure;\nthey also include principles designed to evaluate the justice of\nparticular forms of material inequality. In particular, the only\ninequalities of “primary goods” that could be justified\nare those that can be shown to be to the advantage of the least\nadvantaged representative position. This idea—called the\ndifference principle—represents a significant constraint on the\nexercise of the market, in that individuals are no longer entitled to\nobtain whatever share of resources their talents might obtain in a\nstandard capitalist model of the labor market. \nIt is not part of our current project to criticize or defend the\ndifference principle. We are, instead, simply going to highlight two\nfacts about this principle. The first is that the principle does seem\nto place a significant constraint on the types and degrees of\ninequality that might be justifiable. The difference principle\nrequires that all such inequalities of social primary goods must be\njustifiable to the representative worst-off party within society;\nappeals to utility, or to efficiency, or to other forms of social\nvalue simply will not suffice. The second thing to note is that this\nprinciple is taken by its author to apply only within the context of\nthe domestic state. Rawls is explicit, in his theory, that his\nprinciples should be taken as only describing the nature of justice\nwithin the political society represented by a territorial state. When\nRawls does deal with the issue of international justice, it is in a\nmanner markedly less reformist than that with which he approaches\ndomestic justice. Rawls argues that a just international regime would\ninvolve states agreeing to treat one another fairly in their mutual\ninteraction—but that this fairness would not involve any sort of\ndistributive consideration, or demand for economic justice. Indeed,\nRawls argues that the principles to which states would agree would\nlargely resemble those found in contemporary twentieth century\ninternational law. In contrast with the radical (or at least\nsurprising) conclusions drawn domestically, Rawls argues that in\ninternational justice, there would be “no surprises” in\nthe principles we ought to select (Rawls 1971: 378). \nThis difference in treatment between the domestic and the\ninternational context was immediately troubling to many philosophers.\nOne way of highlighting this is by noting the apparent contradiction\nbetween the universalism of Rawls’s moral theory and the\nlocalism of its realm of application. The first argues that what is\nmorally arbitrary should not be taken as legitimately grounding an\ninequality of wealth or income. If liberalism means anything, after\nall, it means an aversion to inherited caste privilege and other forms\nof feudal birthright privilege (Carens 1992). The second, however,\napplies this universal guarantee only within the very local context of\nthe nation-state, ignoring the fact that membership in that state was,\nitself, morally arbitrary. The net result was, for many commentators,\na sort of internal inconsistency in Rawls’s theory; if Rawls was\nto regard income inequality above that permitted by the difference\nprinciple as unjust, he should do so in a thoroughgoing way, and\ncondemn the inequalities between the wealthy and the impoverished\ninternationally (see Pogge 1989, 1992, 1994; Beitz 1979a,b, 1983;\nScanlon 1973). \nRawls can, on this account, be taken as the originator of the modern\ndialogue on global distributive justice—not because he was the\nfirst to speak out against international inequality, but because he\ndid not do so. Many of those who first did speak about international\ninequality, though, used Rawlsian ideas and concepts in their\narguments. We can therefore proceed to examine some representative\narguments used by these thinkers, to see how their cases were\nconstructed. \nMany initial commentators on Rawls’s work argued that the proper\ninterpretation of Rawls’s principles was one in which the\ndifference principle was applied at the global level. These authors\nare often referred to as “cosmopolitans”; this term,\nhowever, is often less than illuminating (see the accompanying\n entry on cosmopolitanism\n for more detail). We will instead refer to these authors as Left\nInstitutionalists, for reasons we hope will become clear. Left\nInstitutionalists agree on the following conclusion: that\nRawls’s own limitation of his two principles of justice to the\ncircumstances of a domestic society was a morally illegitimate\nconstraint on his theory, so that a consistent liberalism taking off\nfrom Rawls’s arguments must apply its liberal principles at the\nglobal level—and, therefore, the well-being of the worst-off\nrepresentative member of the global society, rather than the domestic,\nought to be our starting-point for the justification of inequality. In\nthis way, liberalism is made coherent with its ideals; rather than\nseeking some arbitrary fact to serve as a limitation on the liberal\ntheory of justice, the cosmopolitans argue that we ought to live up to\nthe globalism inherent in liberalism’s self-understanding. See,\nfor instance, Thomas Pogge’s analysis of liberalism’s\ndomestic focus: \nNationality is just one further deep contingency (like genetic\nendowment, race, gender, and social class), one more potential basis\nof institutional inequalities that are inescapable and present from\nbirth. Within Rawls’s conception, there is no reason to treat\nthis case differently from the others. And so it would seem that we\ncan justify our global institutional order only if we can show that\nthe institutional inequalities it produces tend to optimize (against\nthe backdrop of feasible alternative global regimes) the worst social\nposition. (Pogge 1989: 247) \nRawls, of course, had reasons to resist this interpretation of his\nwork. His own view—made more explicit in his The Law of\nPeoples (1993), but present even in A Theory of\nJustice—is that what counts as justice within a given\ncontext must make reference to what that context is, and how we should\nunderstand its function and its rules. Thus, Rawls argues that his\ntheory does not have application to such private institutions as\nchurches or universities; it is only to be applied to the basic\nstructure of a society—which is understood by Rawls as the major\nsocial institutions, and the ways in which they structure the rules of\nassociation and allocate the advantages of cooperation (Rawls 1971:\n7). The first task of the cosmopolitan, then, is to analyze the notion\nof the basic structure, and demonstrate that such an entity is found\ninternationally as well as domestically. Charles Beitz and Thomas\nPogge both argue that the modern system of international trade has all\nthe indicia given by Rawls to explain what makes the basic structure\nso central: international institutions allocate the advantages of\ntrade, and their rules set the basic framework for the specific\ninteractions taken among international agents. They argue, in short,\nthat the international institutional set is indeed akin to a basic\nstructure, in that this set is a site of cooperation, to which the\nprinciples of justice given in A Theory of Justice ought to\napply. As Beitz has it: \n[I]f evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows\nthe existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, we should not\nview national boundaries as having fundamental moral significance.\nSince boundaries are not coextensive with the scope of social\ncooperation, they do not mark the limits of social obligation. Thus\nthe parties to the original position cannot be assumed to know that\nthey are members of a particular national society, choosing principles\nof justice primarily for that society. The veil of ignorance must\nextend to all matters of national citizenship, and the principles\nchosen will therefore apply globally. (Beitz 1979b: 151) \nRawlsian principles must therefore apply to the set of persons in the\nworld as a whole, so that global institutions should be arranged to\nmaximize the expectations of the globally worst-off representative\nindividual. \nThe early Rawlsian cosmopolitans were enormously influential, and can\nbe credited with forcing the attention of the philosophical community\ntowards the issue of global underdevelopment and inequality. The\ntheories, of course, were subject to enormous criticism, and Rawls\nhimself rejected their conclusions, as we shall see. For the moment,\nwe might note only that many theorists were skeptical of the\nconclusion that Rawls’s principles could apply as easily to the\nglobal community as to the domestic community. Two strands of\ncriticism here deserve note: the first begins with coercion, and the\nsecond with the issue of nationality. \nSome thinkers, then, have questioned whether or not the simple act of\nexchanging goods—even a great many goods—places people in\na relationship that is morally akin to that shared by people who are\nliable to the same territorial state. Something like this point was\nnoticed early by Brian Barry, who notes that \n[T]rade, however multilateral, does not constitute a cooperative\nscheme of the relevant kind. Trade, if freely undertaken, is\n(presumably) beneficial to the exchanging parties, but it is not, it\nseems to me, the kind of relationship giving rise to duties of fair\nplay.…Trade in pottery, ornamentation, and weapons can be\ntraced back to prehistoric times, but we would hardly feel inclined to\nthink of, say, the Beaker Folk as forming a single cooperative\nenterprise with their trading partners. No more did the spice trade\nunite East and West. (Barry 1982: 233) \nBarry’s intuition, here, is that there seems to be something\nnormatively distinct between what is shared by trading partners and\nwhat is felt by fellow citizens. One way of noticing this is to notice\nthat some cosmopolitans sought to sever the distributive component of\nRawls’s theory from the other aspects of that theory—in\nparticular, from the parts of the theory dealing with political rights\nand political justification. There is, of course, a reason for this\ndismembering: there is, internationally, no polity, and the very\nconcept of having (for example) democratic rights within that polity\nmight seem misplaced. But many have thought that something has been\nmissed that is morally relevant, and that we might better regard\nRawls’s distributive conclusions and his political conclusions\nas more tightly linked than that. Some thinkers, in particular, have\nargued that Rawls’s conclusions are best read as principles\nintended to justify the coercive acts of a territorial state, rather\nthan as principles applicable to cooperative ventures more generally\n(Blake 2001, 2013; Nagel 2005). These theorists have suggested that\nthe state stands in need of justification, and that the justification\nwe offer makes distributive principles applicable here—but not\neverywhere. \nThe other critical strand we wish to highlight began with the notion\nof nationality. The idea here is that the relationships that are most\ncentral to human flourishing and human creativity are always specific\nrelationships, with specific persons and with specific cultural\ncontexts. As such, the use of abstract principles like Rawls’s\nto determine what we owe to one another generally is either suspect or\noutright self-destructive. This critical posture, of course, can end\nup being a criticism of the liberal project itself (see Sandel 1982).\nBut it can also end up being a simple criticism of the attempt to do\njustice without looking at the messiness of nations, of cultures, and\nof communities. These latter entities, it might be felt, are in need\nof support—and, in particular, are in need of support by\nindividuals who are taken as duty-bound to prefer the good of that\ncommunity to the abstract rights of foreign citizens (D. Miller 1995;\nKymlicka 1995a). What is missed in the cosmopolitan argument, on this\naccount, is not the presence of the coercive state, but the presence\nof the cultural nation. The nationalists, it should be noted, are not\nhostile to all notions of global justice; they are, instead, committed\nonly to the relatively modest conclusion that nationality has some\nmoral relevance—and that the principles of distributive justice\nthat are right within the nation may not be right at the global level\n(D. Miller 2007). \nThere are a variety of ways of arguing for such a conclusion. Some\ntheorists begin with dissatisfaction at the deracinated and abstract\nforms of philosophy practiced by cosmopolitans (Walzer 1983). Some\ntheorists begin with the need for communities to preserve themselves,\nif they are to provide individuals with the goods needed to live\ndecent lives (MacIntyre 1984). More generally, these theorists argue\nthat the needs of community are such that the cosmopolitan does damage\nto what is needed by actual humans, by considering individuals without\nconsidering the communities within which they live: \n[P]atriotism requires me to exhibit peculiar devotion to my nation and\nyou to yours. It requires me to regard such contingent social facts as\nwhere I was born and what government ruled over that place at that\ntime, who my parents were, who my great-grandparents were, and so on,\nas deciding for me what the question of virtuous action is—at\nleast insofar as it is the virtue of patriotism which is in question.\nHence the moral standpoint and the patriotic standpoint are\nsystematically incompatible. (MacIntyre 1984: 5) \nBoth of these criticisms seem, to some degree, to be accepted by Rawls\nhimself, in his fuller explanation of his own international theory in\nThe Law of Peoples. Rawls is more explicit in this\nwork—as he is in his 1993 volume Political\nLiberalism—that he takes the political dimension of the\nstate as of primary importance, and that his principles of justice\napply only within the state for that reason. He is, further, more\nexplicit about his debt to the liberal nationalist idea in this\nvolume, writing approvingly that these ideas help guide his vision of\na just international regime. We may, then, proceed to examine\nRawls’s Law of Peoples directly. \nThe trend towards greater and more sophisticated theorizing about\ninternational justice was both exemplified and encouraged by the\npublication of Rawls’ The Law of Peoples. This\nwork—an extensive elaboration and revision of an earlier essay\n(Rawls 1993b)—discusses and, has influenced the subsequent\ndiscussion of, a variety of issues of international and global import,\nincluding and especially the obligations of distributive justice in\nthe international realm. Before we turn to Rawls’s account of\ninternational distributive justice, we should acknowledge some salient\nfeatures of how he conceives of his project. Rawls’ perspective\nis unabashedly international rather than global.\nUnlike the early cosmopolitans who conceive of the world as a single\ncooperative unit and seek a single principle of distributive justice\nto govern everyone, Rawls explicitly seeks principles that will\nregulate the interactions among territorially defined political,\ncorporate agents that have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force,\ncalled peoples—and, only indirectly, govern individuals\n(Rawls 1999a: 6). \nSecond, and partly as a consequence of this conceptualization of\ninternational justice, Rawls does not attempt to derive complete\nprinciples of international and global justice. Rather, he describes\nprinciples that ought to regulate the foreign policy of a liberal\npeople (Rawls 1999a: 9–10). Thus, when Rawls says, for example,\nthat some non-democratic peoples are sufficiently well-ordered to be\nworthy of full membership in the society of peoples, he is arguing\nthat democratic peoples may not use political power or pressure to\nchange them—not that non-democratic but well-ordered peoples are\nideal or beyond moral criticism. Furthermore, he argues that the ideal\ncase of international justice is a world composed entirely of\nwell-ordered peoples whose interactions are governed by a set of moral\nprinciples. The account is then extended to cover various non-ideal\ncases: societies burdened by poverty and failing institutions or rogue\nstates that wage aggressive war. What constitutes a minimally just or\nwell-ordered people is a matter of immense controversy, but the\nbroader conceptual point is unchanged: Rawls conceives of\ninternational justice as being ideally about the interactions of\nmorally justified, centralized territorial polities. \nThird, his account of the law of peoples is constrained by the need\nthat it describe a “realistic utopia” (Rawls 1999a:\n11–12) that follows Rousseau’s dictum to take\n“people as they are and laws as they might be”. As a\nconsequence, there are at least three distinct instances where Rawls\nappeals to empirical facts as a way of “realistically”\ngrounding particular normative claims. First, an international system\ncomposed of well-ordered peoples with representative governments will\nbe peaceful (1999a: 44–54); second, issues beginning with\ncultural diversity, geographic distance, and linguistic pluralism\ncombine to make a world state fundamentally unworkable (1999a: 36);\nand, lastly, the primary causal component of national wealth and\nprosperity is the political culture and the corresponding\neffectiveness of their political institutions (1999a:\n108–110). \nWith the above normative and descriptive picture in view, Rawls\npresents a provisional list of principles that peoples could\nreasonably endorse: \nNotably absent from this list is the difference principle or anything\nlike it. When deciding on these principles, peoples do not know how\nbig, rich, prosperous, or powerful they will be. Yet, unlike\nindividuals in the first original position, the peoples represented in\nthis international original position will not demand that material\ninequalities among them be justified with reference to the\nexpectations of the least well-off. The peoples in the second original\nposition know that they have sufficient resources to be well-ordered,\nand they need no more. So, in the ideal case, where international\nsociety is fully composed of well-ordered states that follow the law\nof peoples, there are no distributive requirements at all. Some\npeoples may be very rich and others quite poor and, correspondingly,\nthere could be large differences in wealth among individuals of\ndifferent countries, but there is no principled reason—on\nRawls’ view—to find that objectionable. \nThe Law of Peoples does include some elements that constrain\ninequality—or, at least, poverty. We shall mention three. First,\ninequalities that undermine the instantiation, enforcement, and\nmaintenance of other principles will violate the Law of\nPeoples: \nThe Law of Peoples, on the other hand, holds that inequalities are not\nalways unjust, and that when they are, it is because of their unjust\neffects on the basic structure of the Society of Peoples, and on\nrelations among peoples and among their members. (Rawls 1999a:\n113) \nThus, if one could show that a deep material inequality among peoples\nundermined their ability to, say, be considered equals in the\nnegotiation of treaties or tempted peoples to inappropriately\nintervene in the domestic affairs of other peoples, then that would be\na reason—from the standpoint of international justice—for\neliminating that inequality. However, this principle must be moderated\nin light of Rawls suggestions that both poor and rich well-ordered\npeoples will be “satisfied” with their political and\neconomic position within the Society of Peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n27–30), and that the most important determinant of wealth is the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people. Well-ordered\npeoples—rich or poor—will generally act according to the\nprinciples that make up the law of peoples and even poor peoples will\nhave fairly strong political institutions, so Rawls would argue that\nit is unlikely that mere inequality will be a problem among\nwell-ordered states. \nSecond, all members of the Society of Peoples must respect human\nrights that guarantee that every person, regardless of society, a\nminimum level of material prosperity and physical security, though\nthis minimum level will fall far short of distributive equality (Rawls\n1999a: 65). \nThird, Rawls writes: \nBurdened societies, while they are not expansive or aggressive, lack\nthe political and cultural traditions, the human capital and know-how,\nand, often, the material and technological resources needed to be\nwell-ordered. The long term goal of (relatively) well-ordered\nsocieties should be to bring burdened societies, like outlaw states,\ninto the Society of well-ordered Peoples. Well-ordered peoples have a\nduty to assist burdened societies. (Rawls 1999a: 106) \nSome societies are sufficiently poor or have sufficiently weak\ninstitutions that they are unable to become and remain well-ordered on\ntheir own. In those cases, the Society of Peoples must produce the\nmaterial, human, and institutional support to help these burdened\nsocieties become minimally just. This could very well include some\nwealth transfers from richer nations to burdened ones, but Rawls is\nskeptical that this will be the primary tool of assistance. \nIt is important to see that the duty of assistance to burdened\nsocieties is structurally dissimilar to the difference principle.\nFirst, the difference principle is meant to continuously apply, via\nthe basic structure, to the flow of social and economic interactions,\nbut the duty of assistance has a target and a cutoff point: once all\nsocieties are well-ordered, no people has any further obligation to\ndistribute resources to burdened nations. Second, while the difference\nprinciple is explicitly about the distribution of primary goods, the\nduty of assistance might, in the end, have very little to do with\nactual wealth; burdened societies might be quite wealthy in terms of\nresources, but have failing or deeply embedded non well-ordered\ninstitutions while well-ordered nations may be quite poor.\nFurthermore, when confronted with consistently failing institutions,\nwell-ordered peoples might conceivably discharge their obligations as\nmuch through the provision of technical know-how, information, and\ninstitutional assistance—rather than through than financial\nsupport. \nRawls thus argues for a two-tiered theory of distributive justice. The\nrespect for the free and equal status of each citizen in domestic\ncontext demands an egalitarian distribution of primary goods, but\nequality in the international context requires that each person find\nthemselves in a well-ordered people and that those peoples are\nrespected within international society. Economic inequalities are\ninherently problematic—and require justification—at the\ndomestic level but not at the international. In other words, the\ndistributive outcomes of international trade and the global economy\nare only indirectly relevant to international justice. \nBut why this strong distinction between domestic and international?\nRawls’s response has several themes. First, Rawls suggests that\nlimitations on distributive justice are a consequence of tolerating\nand respecting the economic decisions of peoples (Rawls 1999a:\n117–118). Insofar as peoples are well-ordered, they have made\ndecisions about savings rates, education, and population policy that\nessentially determine national prosperity, and it would be\ndisrespectful of the decisions made by richer and poorer\nnations—who presumably adopted these policies for what they took\nto be good reasons—to require one people to compensate another.\nThis argument is especially controversial because Rawls argues that\nnon-democratic “decent consultation hierarchies” are\nwell-ordered and ought to be accepted into the ranks of the Society of\nPeoples (Rawls 1999a: 62–78). This leaves open the possibility\nthat individuals will become impoverished as a consequence of public\npolicies and choices that they had no hand in deciding. Kok Chor Tan,\nfor example, has argued that Rawls has improperly stretched his\nargument for toleration of reasonable, but illiberal, comprehensive\ndoctrines within a generally liberal political culture into an\nargument for respecting illiberal political cultures (Tan 1998). \nRawls further seems to suggest that the “basic structure”\nof international realm is quite different from the basic structure of\nthe domestic state. In the domestic case, the basic structure is\ncomposed of powerful and effective institutions to which the\nprinciples of justice apply. In the international\ncase, Rawls suggests that the basic structure simply is the\nprinciples by which well-ordered peoples govern themselves—there\nare no institutions distinct from the acts and decisions of the\npeoples themselves. In other words, the interactions among peoples are\nnot—and need not be—regulated by a robust set of\npolitical, economic, and social institutions that would constitute an\nindependent basic structure. As a consequence of this lack of an\ninternational basic structure, Rawls argues that the moral objections\nto inequality in the domestic case do not apply (Rawls 1999a:\n114–115). Inequality among individuals of different peoples does\nnot, for example, undermine the fair value of the political liberties\nor fair equality of opportunity, since they are not co-members of\neconomic and political systems, and peoples will treat other peoples\nas equals insofar as they are well-ordered and reasonable. Since the\npolitical culture and institutions of a people are primary cause of\nwealth and its distribution, the criterion of reciprocity does not\ndemand equal distributive shares among members of different\npolities. \nRawls’s arguments should not be taken as a defense of the status\nquo in international relations. Many states—especially\nauthoritarian, weak, and failing ones—are not well-ordered, and\nthe principles informing current foreign policies are not those\ndescribed in the The Law of Peoples. Neither Rawls nor his\ncritics would defend the justice of the world today. The theoretical\ndifference between these perspectives, though, is profound. The real\npoint of dispute between them is this: once well-ordered nations have\nensured that every person lives in a well-ordered state and are\nthereby guaranteed certain minimum protections against starvation and\npoverty, does the international order represent a basic structure of\nthe right type, and robustness, so that the fact that some peoples are\nmuch wealthier than others ought to be considered an affront to\njustice? Rawls himself will answer in the negative, while his critics\nwill answer in the affirmative. \nDespite the fact that almost no element of The Law of Peoples\nhas escaped controversy, it served as a well-spring of additional\ntheorizing (see generally Martin & Reidy 2006) and has structured\nthe subsequent debate concerning international distributive justice.\nRawls’s two-tiered account strongly influenced those\ntheorists who were unsatisfied with both cosmopolitan and nationalist\naccounts of distributive justice. Much of the ensuing discussion has\npitted two groups of theorists who both purport to be building upon\nwhat they take to be the key insights of Rawls’s view. One\ngroup—we will call them right\ninstitutionalists—has followed the general contours of\nRawls’s two-tiered account, developing more detailed accounts of\nwhy we should sharply distinguish between the international and\ndomestic. They aim to justify Rawls’s fundamental position that\negalitarian distributive justice only operates at the state level,\neven if they disagree with Rawls as to the rationale. Left\ninstitutionalists, on the other hand, have argued that\ninternational politics is characterized by a sufficiently robust set\nof institutions, such that they “trigger” principles of\ndistributive justice that are more robust and that, pace the\nduty of assistance, operate directly on the distributive consequences\nof international economic regimes. As a consequence, left\ninstitutionalists generally argue for more robust distributive\nobligations and more radical institutional changes than right\ninstitutionalists even though the extent and nature of those\nobligations varies from thinker to thinker. \nBefore we go deeper into the divide between left and right\ninstitutionalism, it’s important to note what the two sides\nagree on and to see where the actual disagreements between the two\nsides lie. The important point of agreement lies in their mutual focus\non institutions or rule-governed practices as the trigger of genuinely\negalitarian distributive obligations. Both right and left\ninstitutionalists accept that principles of distributive justice only\napply or are activated in particular institutional contexts or when\npeople mutually participate in practices that are relevant to\ndistribution. So, both right and left institutionalists would deny\nthat we have obligations of distributive justice to, say, the lost\ncity of Atlantis—should it appear—since Atlanteans have\nnot participated with us in shared institutions or practices. In other\nwords, principles of distributive justice apply to, and are activated\nby, a basic structure that mostly determines the distributive shares\nthe participants receive. Right and left institutionalists disagree,\nthen, concerning which institutions activate obligations of\ndistributive justice among participants. \nRight institutionalists have generally adopted Rawls’s\ntwo-tiered approach, arguing for a sharp distinction between domestic\nand international distributive justice. While Rawls himself did not\nsay much about why international politics was so different,\nmuch of the subsequent work by right institutionalists has been to\nfind some morally salient feature that distinguishes the domestic from\nthe international which justifies such strong differences in\ndistributive principles in the face of growing globalization,\nincreasing economic interdependence, and strengthening international\ncivil society. In order to do so, right Rawlsians have argued that the\ninternational and domestic realms differ fundamentally in terms of\npolitical structure. Kenneth Waltz describes the difference\nnicely: \nThe parts of domestic political systems stand in relations of super-\nand subordination. Some are entitled to command; others are required\nto obey. Domestic systems are centralized and hierarchic. The parts of\nthe international-political systems stand in relations of cooperation.\nFormally, each is the equal of all the others. None is entitled to\ncommand; none is required to obey. International structures are\ndecentralized and anarchic. (Waltz 1979: 88) \nMore specifically, domestic politics is characterized by the existence\nof a superior political authority that claims—and\npossesses—sovereign judicial, legislative, and executive powers.\nNo such shared, coercive legal system exists in the international\nrealm. Since the world state is, at best, a distant possibility, this\nis unlikely to change. Domestic legal systems define the very terms of\neconomic activity and represent a kind of fundamental political power\nover individuals. Samuel Freeman writes: \nWhen Rawls says that the political constitution is part of the basic\nstructure, he does not just mean the procedures that specify how laws\nare enacted and that define offices and positions of political\nauthority. He means more or less the entire legal system, including\nmost public and private law, that is the product of the constitution\nin this procedural sense. Modern legal systems, such as the federal\nsystem of the United States, are made up of countless acts of\nlegislation, administration, judicial precedent, and other legal\nrulings that are issued by multiple legal bodies with lawmaking\nauthority. An economic system that is regulated by the legal norms\nthat are issued by the political constitutions is also part of the\nbasic structure. Here, of course, the legal norms of property,\ncontract, commercial law, intangibles, and so on that are essential\nfor economic production and exchange are to be included in the basic\nstructure. What makes possible the incredibly complicated system of\nlegal norms that underlie production, exchange, and consumption is a\nunified political system that specifies these norms and revises them\nto meet changing conditions….Nothing comparable to the\nbasic structure of society exists on the global level. (Freeman\n2006: 38–39, emphasis added) \nA Canadian citizen—no matter how economically and culturally\nentwined Canada might with the United States—does not get a vote\nin American elections, and the Canadian’s economic interactions\nand relationships are regulated and governed by Canadian, not\nAmerican, law. As a consequence, the American government lacks\n“original jurisdiction or effective [or basic] political\npower” over Canadians. The Canadian citizen lacks the same\nhierarchical relationship with American political authorities that\nAmerican citizens have, except under special circumstances are that\nare themselves negotiated by Canadian and American legal authorities.\nDifferent right institutionalists emphasize different elements of the\ndomestic, coercive legal system. Matthias Risse (2006, 2012) and\nMichael Blake (2001, 2013), for example, emphasize the\ncoercive nature of domestic legal systems. Risse has argued\nthat the pervasiveness and immediacy of the coercion in domestic legal\nsystems makes them fundamentally different from the kinds of\ninteractions that occur at the international level: even international\nlaws call on the powers of the state for their enforcement. Michael\nBlake, on the other hand, emphasizes how domestic legal systems\nstructure the most basic of economic interactions, make determinate\nindividual rights, and enforce them against abuses of private power.\nHe suggests that egalitarian principles of distributive justice are\nwhat justifies the imposition of coercive political authority\non autonomous agents. Samuel Freeman argues therefore that the\ninternational system—because it lacks the features and powers of\na robust legal system—does not constitute “a system of\nsocial cooperation” and, therefore, does not invoke\nRawls’s “Criterion of Reciprocity” that underlies\nthe difference principle. \nBlake, Risse, and Freeman all represent—along with Rawls\nhimself—the moderate wing of right institutionalism. They are\nunited by three claims. First, the presence of a coercive legal system\nleads to more demanding requirements of egalitarian distributive\njustice. Second, the international institutions, regimes, and\norganizations do not constitute a coercive legal system. However,\nmoderates are aware of the many ways in which the international order\ncan make the world hospitable for, or hostile to, well-ordered states.\nAs a consequence, moderates argue for principles of international\ndistributive justice that assist and protect legitimate peoples, with\nthe goal of ensuring that everyone lives within a well-ordered state.\nInternational institutions don’t activate principles of justice\nthat apply directly to distributive outcomes of global trade or\neconomic activity. Rather, those principles are activated in the event\nonly insofar as member polities (peoples, states, and the like) fail\nin their own distributive requirements (such as when peoples fail to\nprevent severe poverty, violating the human rights of their citizens)\nor need assistance. Moderate Right Institutionalists share,\nthen, Rawls’s indirect account of international distributive\njustice, justifying the two-tiered account by appeal to the necessary\nrelationship between the co-membership in a coercive legal system and\ndistributive justice. \nMore extreme right institutionalists, most vividly\nrepresented by Thomas Nagel in his article “The Problem of\nGlobal Justice”, (2005) argue that the lack of an international\nlegal system with sovereign coercive authority does not simply\nundermine claims of egalitarian distributive justice; it undermines\nall claims of justice outside the state. So, Nagel accepts\nthe first two claims of the moderates but suggests that together they\nimply that justice is chimerical in the anarchic realm of\ninternational politics. He does accept that we have moral obligations\nto prevent people from starving, being assaulted, or murdered, but\nthese are obligations of a universal “humanitarianism”.\nJustice, for Nagel, is a moral value that is necessarily\nindexed to coercive institutions, as coercive institutions are\nnecessary for large-scale social coordination and cooperation. Claims\nof distributive justice only apply to those institutions that engage\nin such large-scale economic coordination, do so coercively, and do so\nin the name of the individuals coerced. For Nagel, that last part is\nessential: the answer to the question, “Why do we owe someone\nequal distributive shares (or equal consideration in light of the\ndifference principle)?” is “We structure their economic\nlives through coercive political institutions in their name”.\nCo-citizens have their wills invoked as shared participants in the\ncreation of distributively relevant public policy, and this invocation\ngives rise to egalitarianism. Since the international realm is\ncharacterized by institutions that do not invoke the wills of\nthose involved as a justification of coercion, justice simply fails to\napply to that realm. \nBoth the extreme and moderate versions of right institutionalism have\nbeen criticized, broadly, on two fronts. First, some have argued that\nthe right institutionalist focus on coercion has been misguided. If we\nstrip away coercive institutions, or were somehow able to make\ncoercive institutions non-coercive, but retained the various regimes\nof economic cooperation, we would still have obligations of\ndistributive justice. We will turn to these arguments in section 4.1.\nThe second objection is an internal critique that denies their second\nshared claim. On this objection, the international realm is a\ncoercive legal system and thereby activates principles of distributive\njustice akin to those in the domestic arena. Right institutionalism\ndepends on the coercive nature of domestic politics being different\nfrom that of international politics. Those who argue against it\nthereby try to close the gap by pointing out the many ways in which\ncoercion is deployed internationally. Cohen and Sabel (2006) argue\nthat the collective activities of various states have created an\ninternational organization (the World Trade Organization [WTO]) that\ncan essentially issue coercive threats: follow WTO or suffer\nimpoverishment as a consequence of being denied access to global\nmarkets. They write: \nStill, it might be said that any complaint against global rule-making\nbodies should really be directed against the state for accepting their\n[the World Trade Organization] directives…But this point seems\nalmost facetious. Opting out is not a real option (the WTO is a\n“take it or leave it” arrangement without even the formal\noption of picking and choosing which parts to comply with), and given\nthat it is not, and that everyone knows that it is not, there is a\ndirect rule-making relationship between the global bodies and the\ncitizens of different states. (Cohen & Sabel 2006: 168) \nEric Cavallero (2010), on the other hand, argues that the\ninternational system is coercive in a much more direct way: Great\nPowers (including and especially the United States) coercively enforce\ninternational norms of property by invading or covertly deposing\nnations that misbehave. Arash Abizadeh (2007) has emphasized the\ncoercion inherent in the maintenance of borders and territorial\nintegrity, especially in response to immigration. If states claim the\nright to determine who enters their territory, then they place\nthemselves in the position of coercing non-citizens in virtue of the\nmethods they use to prevent those who wish to cross their borders from\ndoing so. Mirian Ronzoni (2009) argues that the existence of a global\nbasic structure isn’t the right target for our theorizing; we\nought to focus instead on whether such a basic structure should be\nbrought into being in virtue of how states exercise their power over\neach other. Laura Valentini (2011), finally, argues that the distinct\nforms of coercion present at the global level give rise to distinct\nforms of moral principles; neither statists nor cosmopolitans, she\nargues, have been able to look at the global realm as its own site of\ncoercion, with the result that a “third way” between\nstatism and cosmopolitanism must be developed. In each case, the\nstructure of the objection is quite similar: states coerce via\ninvasion and espionage, via collective action through international\ninstitutions, and via border maintenance, therefore the international\nsystem is coercive in nature and, thus, appropriately calls for\negalitarian distributive justice.  \nThese objections have forced right institutionalists to become more\nattentive to the ways in which coercive contexts can be different. As\na consequence, the responses to these objections will be complex. For\nexample, it is clear that a state requiring a citizen to purchase\nhealth insurance, stopping a non-citizen at the border, or using a\ncovert paramilitary organization to topple an unfriendly regime are\nall examples of coercion, but are they all the same type of\ncoercion and do they all subsequently demand the same\nnormative response? Furthermore, should we evaluate these coercive\nactivities in their current form—where the\ninternational world is populated by rogue states, failed and failing\nstates, and burdened societies—or should we evaluate these\ncoercive activities based on how they would operate with a genuine\nSociety of Peoples? At any rate, the debate is ongoing as right\ninstitutionalists are pushed by these objections to create more\nsophisticated accounts of coercion and to consider coercion is more\nspecific contexts (see Blake 2011; Valentini, 2011). \nLeft institutionalists are distinguished from right institutionalists\nin three ways. First, left institutionalists tend to argue for more\nrobust distributive obligations that operate directly on the\ninstitutions that characterize international politics. Second, they\ntend to reject a strongly bifurcated view of the differences between\ninternational and domestic justice, some arguing that there is no\ndifference, others arguing that there are many institutional contexts\nthat give rise to distributive obligations, and still others claiming\nthat domestic and international institutional contexts, and their\ncorresponding principles of distributive justice, operate on a smooth\ncontinuum. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, left\ninstitutionalists reject the right institutionalist emphasis on\ncoercion in activating claims of distributive justice. To the\ncontrary, left institutionalists typically characterize the basic\nstructure in terms of cooperation, the provision of basic goods, or\neconomic interdependence (Sangiovanni 2007: 19–20). \nWe have already examined some early left institutionalist responses\nabove. We will, here, consider some more recent extensions of the\nview. These thinkers generally accept that the state—with its\ncoercive legal apparatus—gives rise to especially stringent\ndemands of distributive justice. However, they argue that the nature\nof the global economic system also gives rise to robust\ndistributive obligations. These distributive obligations arise\ndirectly in virtue of the institutional features of the\nglobal economic system irrespective of their effects on domestic\njustice. What differentiates them from the early, more radical left\ninstitutionalist thinkers, is that they recognize and accept that\ndistinct norms of egalitarian concern might be appropriate in the\ndomestic and global contexts. Moderate left institutionalists then\naccept with Rawls a two-tiered account of global justice; they differ\nfrom right institutionalists (and from Rawls) in arguing that distinct\nnorms of distributive justice apply to individuals at the global\nlevel. \nModerate left institutionalists generally present some view as to what\nactivates these distributive obligations. Darrell Moellendorf (2011),\nfor example, offers the following, jointly sufficient criteria: \nThe version of membership dependence that I affirm is based upon what\nI term the principle of associational justice. The idea is\nthat duties of social justice exist between persons who have a moral\nduty of equal respect to one another if those persons are co-members\nin an association that is (1) relatively strong, (2) largely\nnonvoluntary, (3) constitutive of a significant part of the background\nrules for the various relationships of their public lives, and (4)\ngoverned by norms that can be subject to human control. (2011:\n537) \nCohen and Sabel (2006) have offered three distinct principles by which\nthese distributive duties might be justified. Andrea Sangiovanni\n(2007), despite the fact that his view has much in common with right\ninstitutionalisn, presents a left-oriented view because his account of\ninternational distributive justice is both non-coercive and\ndirect: \nI will argue that equality is a relational ideal of\nreciprocity among those who support and maintain the\nstate’s capacity to provide the basic collective goods necessary\nto protect us from physical attack and to maintain a stable system of\nproperty rights and entitlements. (Sangiovanni 2007: 19–20) \nThese views can all be used to directly evaluate global inequalities.\nHowever, unlike the more extreme left institutionalism of early Beitz\nand Pogge, each view produces comparatively less egalitarian results\nat the global level. Moellendorf argues that, even though both the\nglobal economic system and the state satisfy all four criteria, the\nformer activates obligations of “reciprocity” while the\nlatter activates the obligations of “inclusive and equal\ncitizenship”. Cohen and Sabel argue that the state requires\nliberal egalitarianism while international institutions create\nobligations of “inclusion”. In both cases, the obligations\nat the global level are less robust than at the domestic. Similarly,\nSangiovanni argues that the provision of collective goods generates an\nobligation of reciprocity, understood as egalitarian shares. The\nglobal economic system gives rise to distributive obligations, but the\nscope of the obligation is limited to the public goods produced by the\nsystem itself, in the event it comes to produce them (whether it\ncurrently does so is a matter of controversy). This means that\nSangiovanni’s account could be indifferent to considerable\ninequality among citizens of different countries as long as\nreciprocity held within each country and obtained in the contribution\nto a system of physical and economic rights made by the\ninternational system. What is important to note about moderate\nleft institutionalism, and what distinguishes it from the more extreme\nversion, is that moderates seek robust principles of distributive\njustice that apply to the particular domain of the global that are of\na piece with the principles of distributive justice domestically but\nare nonetheless sensitive to the differences between the two\ndomains. \nModerate left institutionalist views are considerably more diverse\nwhen compared to moderate right institutionalists: there is no central\nconcept—like coercion—that binds them together. And\nmoderate left institutionalism, as a view that is responsive to the\nparticular features of international institutions, has much to\nrecommend it. However, there are some areas of concern. First, one\nmight worry that many left institutionalist arguments import notions\nof coercion into their view. Moellendorf makes\n“non-voluntariness” one of the criteria of distributively\nrelevant institutions, which seems to imply that individuals or states\nthat don’t wish to participate in the global economy will be\ncoerced into doing so, generally by threat of economic catastrophe.\nSimilarly, Cohen and Sabel present their three “weak”\nnon-coercive accounts of when obligations of distributive justice are\nactivated, but their argument that the WTO should invoke norms of\ninclusion is based—at least partly—on the fact that the\nWTO can issue coercive threats. Sangiovanni discusses the provision of\npublic goods, which may seem non-coercive, but if these public goods\nare necessary for even minimally decent lives, then it seems that the\nthreat of their non-provision could very well be a coercive one. To\nput it another way, is it really the case that economic cooperation\nthrough trade—even institutionalized in order to solve\ncoordination problems—is ever enough to invoke norms of\ndistributive justice if there is no chance that that economic\ncooperation, no matter how unequally distributed, will undermine the\npossibility of the participants to live decent lives? The worry here\nis that left institutionalists might be begging the question by\ncovertly assuming that the international system is indeed coercive,\nwill remain coercive even if reformed, and is coercive in precisely\nway needed to generate obligations of distributive justice. Left\ninstitutionalists, therefore, are quite adept at identifying\ninjustices in the international arena, but they are less persuasive at\nshowing that the appropriate normative response to these wrongs is to\nhave the international system be governed by principles of\ndistributive justice. For example, suppose Moellendorf is correct that\nthe WTO wrongly forces an inappropriate development model on weak and\nfailing nations that serves the rich and powerful while undermining\nthe ability of those nations to become democratically well-ordered.\nCertainly the right response to recognizing this wrong is to have the\nWTO cease that unjust behavior. It is hard to see why we\nwould need the more robust norm of distributive equality to understand\nthe wrongness of the WTO’s behavior. \nIn recent years, the debate about institutions and justice has\nbroadened significantly. Some, as we will discuss in section 4, have\nbegun to question whether institutions are all that significant from\nthe standpoint of justice. Others, however, have begun to expand the\ntoolkit with which global institutions are to be judged. The\nresurgence of republican thought in recent years has offered an\nopportunity for thinkers concerned with domination to examine how\nglobal institutions might be understood from the standpoint of\nrepublican justice. In this section, we will lay out the basic tenets\nof neo-republicanism and explain the major positions that have been\nstaked out in their application to issues of global concern. \n\n Neo-republicanism (see entry)\n is a family of views that emphasizes the close connection between\njustice and a particular kind of freedom. Namely, the purpose of\nsocial institutions is to protect us from domination by others and to\nensure we can act independently from the wills of others. Unlike\nfreedom from interference, freedom from domination is specifically\nabout the power relation: a slaveowner who could interfere with her\nslaves but chooses not is still constraining their freedom. In this\ncase, slaves are not free from the will of their owner even if they\nhappen to live their lives mostly without interference. Thus,\ndomination is a worry whenever one agent has superior power over\nanother and can asymmetrically influence the choice situation of the\nweaker agent. However, it is sometimes, even usually, the case that we\ncannot eliminate differentials in social position or power, but one\ncan be subject to superior power without being dominated if the\nexercise of that power is suitably constrained or directed. There is a\nfair amount of disagreement over the precise nature of these\nconstraints, but neo-republicans have converged on a set of\ninstitutional prescriptions that ensure that citizens are not merely\nsubject to power: the rule of law, constitutional protections,\ndemocracy, due process, and the provision of a social minimum at the\nvery least. These institutional structures have a two-fold objective.\nFirst, they constrain state power such that there is no public\ndomination. Second, they direct state power effectively towards its\njustificatory purpose: governing the relations between citizens such\nthat there is no private domination. These purposes can only be\nachieved within a republican constitutional order and so freedom is\nonly possible in the state. This is, perhaps, the key idea behind\nrepublicanism: we do not give up freedom in order to achieve the\nsecurity of citizenship in a state, citizenship in a state is a\nprecondition of freedom. \nGiven the neo-republican focus on the moral necessity of citizenship\nin a constitutional order, it is unsurprising that most\nneo-republicans have adopted a view that is functionally similar to\nthe right institutionalists (Pettit 2010; Laborde & Ronzoni \n2015; Smith forthcoming).\nThe state is the primary site of distributive justice and the purpose\nof international institutions is to ensure that each state has the\nability to ensure non-domination within its borders and to prevent\nstates from dominating other states. This commitment is driven by\nconsiderations that are primarily non-ideal. Many statist\nneo-republicans have no principled objection to a world republic and\nmay even find that institutional structure preferable under ideal\nconditions. Yet, they view a more robustly republican global order as\nsimply too far away and difficult to achieve for the ideal case to be\naction-guiding. \nA smaller but growing group of neo-republicans fit more in the mold of\nleft institutionalists (Laborde 2010; Bohman 2004; Buckinx 2011).\nGenerally, left institutionalist neo-republicans are impressed by\n“expansion” arguments that purport to show that the\nconsiderations that motivate us to be concerned about coercion,\ncooperation, or domination at the domestic level apply to issues of\nglobal governance. These left republicans do not expect or want the\nstate to “wither away” but rather think that direct\nprotections against domination at the level of regional or global\ngovernance are necessary. In general, left republicans are—at\nleast on global justice issues—less optimistic about the ability\nof even well-ordered states to manage their affairs in the face of\nglobal coordination problems from climate change to immigration and\nthus argue that global governance regimes need to be designed with\ntheir own republican principles in mind and not treated as mere\nadjuncts to state capacity. \nFinally, both left and right neo-republicans are—and need\nto—engage with a deeper conceptual issue: the republican world\nstate. Jacobin republicans, for example, believed that if the civil\ncondition between citizens was morally necessary, then a civil\ncondition between states was equally necessary (Kleingeld 2011). This\nseems to suggest that the world state is morally necessary. Most\nneo-republican objections to the world state concern its lack of\nfeasibility. This means that left and right republicans are both\nallied in suggesting that the improbability of the world republican\nstate is sufficient to warrant its rejection as an institutional\nobjective. Yet it is unclear whether these feasibility concerns,\nborrowed from Kant, are as quite as substantial as they appear\n(Deudney 2006) and it is also unclear why they should be so decisive\nin our normative theorizing even if they were (Gilabert 2017). There\nis a worrisome asymmetry in the neo-republican discussions of\nfeasibility in the context of global justice: a modern state with the\nrule of law and reliable welfare provision would have been viewed as\nquite unfeasible in the early modern period and yet this did not\nprevent republicans from pushing for those institutional norms over\ntime. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a key feature of future neo-republican\ntheorizing about global justice will concern the appropriate mixture\nof ideal and non-ideal assumptions and the use of feasibility\njudgments when it comes to making normative prescriptions. \nAs the above discussion demonstrates, much work in global justice\nbegins with interpretations of—and arguments\nabout—Rawlsian principles. Some recent work, however, has sought\nto break the Rawlsian spell, by demonstrating the plausibility of\nprinciples and theories not foundationally linked to Rawlsian\narguments. This work includes many recent philosophical theories\nwhich—while undoubtedly influenced by Rawls—are less\nconcerned with applying Rawlsian methods directly to global\ninstitutions (see also R. Miller 2010; Brock 2009; Altman &\nWellman 2009). We will here examine four important recent\ncontributions to this project. The first, which we might call pure\negalitarianism, argues that egalitarianism applies among persons\nconsidered as human; no institutional framework is needed to give rise\nto strong duties of distributive justice. The second, associated with\nThomas Pogge, argues that the global institutional structure we see\ntoday is not merely unjust, but actively violating the negative rights\nof the global poor. The third notes that the fact of history—in\nparticular, the shared experience of colonialism and imperial\nexploitation—is a central, and underexplored, part of any\nplausible account of global distributive justice. The fourth, finally,\nargues that an independent concern with property rights is necessary\nfor the evaluation of global justice. We will consider these arguments\nin turn. \nThe dispute between left and right institutionalism has centered on\nhow to interpret the institutions found at the global level; both\nsides in the debate agreed that the nature of these institutions is of\nprimary importance in establishing whether or not egalitarian duties\nhold globally. Some recent theorists, however, have challenged this\nassumption. On this vision, what is relevant from the standpoint of\njustice is only whether or not a particular agent is, in fact, a\nrecognizably human agent—not whether that agent stands in a\nparticular relationship as regards other humans. Simon Caney is a\nchief exponent of this theoretical perspective, and defends it as\nfollows: \nConsider a world with two separate systems of interaction that have no\ncontact but are aware of each other and suppose that one of them is\nprosperous whereas the other is extremely impoverished. Compare, now,\ntwo individuals—one from the prosperous system and one from the\nimpoverished system—who are identical in their abilities and\nneeds. The member of the prosperous system receives more. But it is\ndifficult to see why—concentrating on any possible and\nreasonable criteria for entitlement—this is fair. Ex\nhypothesi, she is not more hard-working or more gifted or more\nneedy. In all respects they are identical (bar one, namely that one is\nlucky to live in the prosperous society and one is not) and yet an\ninstitutionalist approach confers on one many more benefits. Moreover,\nit does so wholly arbitrarily because there is no ground on which the\nmember of the prosperous society can claim to be entitled to more.\n(Caney 2005: 111; see also Tan 2004) \nOther cosmopolitans have echoed this conclusion, while grounding it in\na broader theory of ethics. Kok-Chor Tan, for instance, argues that\nany global order that allows economic inequality to rest upon\narbitrary facts can be rejected as unjust: \nThe ideas of state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of states\npresume a global institutional order that grants these ideas a certain\nmoral standing, as claims that others should respect. But this respect\nis achievable only if the global order is not one that persons subject\nto it can reasonably reject. My claim is that a global order that\nturns arbitrariness about persons into differential personal\nadvantages is one that some can reasonably reject. (Tan 2012: 159) \nThese conclusions are echoed by Pablo Gilabert, who uses the notion of\nreasonable rejection to argue for a “humanist\negalitarianism”, on which principles of distributive justice\napply simply in virtue of status as human: \nTo say that some but not all humans are entitled to [economic]\nadvantages would seem, on the face of it, morally arbitrary. It would\nfail to show equal concern and respect for all… Any conception\nof global distribution that gives some human beings less access to the\nimportant advantages identified [above] than it gives to others is one\nthat the former have reason to reject. (Gilabert 2012:\n196–97) \nThis form of egalitarianism has some undisputed attractions. It keeps\nthe moral attention focused on human persons, which is—we might\nagree—right where it ought to be. It is compatible, moreover,\nwith a variety of different theories of what might be the appropriate\nmetric with which to demonstrate our egalitarian respect; Caney argues\nthat a global principle of equality of opportunity is likely superior\nto one based upon resources (Caney 2001). It is compatible, moreover,\nwith the institutions we have developed being relevant from the\nstandpoint of justice, insofar as they help or hinder efforts to live\nup to the demands of global equality. It insists, in the end, only\nthat such institutions are at most helpful tools, rather than\nfoundational forms of human relationship that give rise to distinct\nmoral duties. \nThe problem with this form of egalitarianism, however, is that\ncomparatively few of us are prepared to take distributive equality as\na foundational value; most of us believe that distributive equality is\nrelevant only within certain relational contexts, as a way of\nguaranteeing that individuals are not dominated or marginalized within\nthose relationships (Anderson 1999; Altman & Wellman 2009). To say\nthat equality is itself a value seems to ascribe a fundamental moral\nimportance to relative income shares—an importance that seems,\nat the very least, somewhat in need of defense . Return once again to\nthe example of Atlantis. Imagine that the world were made fully just,\naccording to whatever conception of justice you require, and that the\nisland of Atlantis then rose into that just world; imagine further\nthat every Atlantean were possessed of a small quantity of diamonds,\nwhich made them significantly more wealthy than the average person.\nWould the Atlanteans have the duty, simply in virtue of common\nhumanity, to redistribute their diamonds, so as to ensure equality?\nThe answer, for a pure egalitarian, must be yes; this answer, however,\nseems to say that what was a just world has now become unjust, simply\nbecause we are made aware of others doing better for themselves than\nwe are (Blake 2012). This particular vision of egalitarianism depends\nupon an ideal of quality that many people—including both right\nand left Rawlsians—have regarded as deeply problematic. \nThe pure egalitarian impulse begins with the idea that we have duties\nof justice towards one another that do not depend upon shared\ninstitutions. Thomas Pogge’s recent work, in contrast, argues\nthat institutions are morally central—but in a manner somewhat\nunlike that argued for by the left Rawlsians. (Pogge was, of course,\nan early advocate of left institutionalism, but his more recent work\ndoes not depend upon left institutionalism being true.) Pogge’s\nrecent work (see, especially, 2002) has argued that the institutions\nwe have built in the world are, in fact, directly violating the rights\nof the poor. We can start our analysis here by noting the starkness of\nPogge’s conclusion: global poverty represents, for Pogge, not\njust an unmet humanitarian obligation, but an ongoing human evil,\nperhaps the greatest one in history. Pogge’s argument insists\nthat international poverty and underdevelopment—and the death\nand wasted potential this entails—find their causal origin in a\nset of global institutions created and imposed by the wealthy nations\nof the world upon the global poor (Pogge 2002, 2010a). As such, the\npoverty of the underdeveloped nations is not simply a fact in the\nworld, to be dealt with by comparatively weak moral notions of\nhumanitarian benefit and charity; it is, instead, a violation of the\nrights of the poor. It is not simply a violation of their legitimate\nexpectations; they might expect to be helped, for instance, and we are\nnot merely refraining from doing that. It is a violation of their\nnegative rights to be free from harm. The poorer inhabitants of the\nworld have rights that are being violated, on a massive scale, by the\nwealthy states. One significant mechanism for this violation is the\nascription of the resource and borrowing privilege to any organization\nable to take effective political control of a territorial\njurisdiction. A group does not have to truly represent the interests\nof a place’s inhabitants, on the rules set up by international\nlaw, in order to sell that jurisdiction’s resources. So long as\nan agent is able to effectively control and repress the inhabitants,\nit has the ability to speak in their name in international\ntreaty-making—regardless of how badly it treats these\ninhabitants. The result, for Pogge, is that the institutions of global\nsociety have set up incentives by which undemocratic regimes are\nrewarded and encouraged in the underdeveloped countries, and in which\nresources predictably flow from these countries to those already\nblessed with wealth. The shared history of colonial rule, moreover,\nhas led to the radical underdevelopment experienced by many former\ncolonies, with the result that these colonies are likely to be\nexceptionally vulnerable to the decisions and acts of agents within\nformer colonial powers. Global institutions are, in the end, developed\nand maintained to benefit the wealthier nations that set these\ninstitutions up, and whose participation is necessary for their\nsurvival as institutions. They serve only to impose a set of property\nrules upon the poorer nations that guarantee their continued poverty\nand underdevelopment. \nPogge’s analysis is powerful, and includes a number of valuable\npositive suggestions about how we might begin to rectify these\ndefects—including revisions in how pharmaceutical research is\nincentivized, and mechanisms for a global tax on resource use (Pogge\n1994 and 2011). For the moment, though, we may examine only the major\ncritical responses to which Pogge’s argument has been subjected.\nMost of Pogge’s critics agree with his contention that\ninternational poverty is unjust, in addition to being a violation of\nhumanitarian duties. These critics, though, have frequently questioned\nwhether or not Pogge has made his case that this poverty is causally\nascribable to the international institutional set—and that\nsimple revisions in this set could dramatically decrease global\npoverty. \nThe first form of critique begins with an objection to Pogge’s\nidea that global institutions cause international poverty. The worry\nwith this idea begins with concerns about the idea that the notion of\na cause can be, without certain controversial assumptions, be easily\nascribed to anything as complex as the global institutional set. In\nparticular, for an institution to be said to have caused a result,\nthere must be a comprehensible baseline of expectations to which the\nexisting result might be compared. Alan Patten and Mathias Risse have\neach provided a version of this critique. Patten argues that Pogge\nillegitimately smuggles in a moralized baseline of expectations, in\nwhich the inhabitants of the poorer nations obtain the resources and\nrights they would have under ideal justice; this baseline is what the\npoor deserve, argues Patten, but it is a stretch to say that the\nwealthy nations cause the poverty of the poor when they fail to bring\nabout ideal justice (Patten 2005). Mathias Risse offers an even more\npointed criticism, pointing out that the usual baseline for causation\nto be ascribed to an interaction is the expectations that would hold\nin the absence of such interaction (Risse 2005). Risse points out that\nthe statistical baseline for most of humanity throughout history has\nbeen radical poverty and misery. On this analysis, the interaction\nbetween the poor and the rich might be taken to have increased the\nwealth of the poor, rather than caused their poverty. This is\ncompatible, of course, with the existence of duties of justice as\nregards the benefits of industrialization and globalization; the poor\nmay have become slightly better off, but the wealthy have undoubtedly\ngotten much, much richer, and we might develop theories that condemn\nthis gap. Pogge’s contention that global poverty is caused by\nthe wealthy societies of the world, though, seems—to Risse and\nPatten—simply incorrect.  Joshua Cohen offers a more wide-reaching version of these\nconcerns.  He, too, begins with the difficulty of saying that the\npoverty of the global poor is caused by the wealth of the global rich\n(Cohen 2011). He challenges, that is, the extent to which the global\ninstitutions imposed by the wealthy are actually causally\nresponsible. His analysis, though, draws more on modern development\neconomics, and notes that modern theorists have identified various\nfactors that might determine why some countries are poor and some are\nrich: they include the institutions described by Pogge, but they also\ninclude such endogenous factors as geography, resource allocation, and\npolitical culture (Easterly 2006).  The precise weighting and power of\nthese various factors is, of course, a matter of tremendous\ndisagreement and controversy, and much of the field of development\neconomics is devoted to developing more complete and powerful analyses\nof how the relative wealth and poverty of nations is to be\nexplained. This is a difficulty for Pogge, argues Cohen, since his\nanalysis of poverty includes only two possibilities: either the poor\nnations of the world are responsible for their own poverty, which is\nimplausible, or the rich nations of the world are responsible for that\npoverty. Cohen’s conclusion is that Pogge has not adequately\ncome to terms with the empirical complexity of how poverty is to be\nexplained, and that as a result his conclusions about international\nculpability for poverty are simply unmotivated. \nThe debate between Pogge and his critics, of course, continues (see\nPogge 2010b); Pogge is able to offer rejoinders to many of the\nobjections discussed here. In particular, Pogge has emphasized\nrecently that the baseline with which his analysis proceeds is one of\na reasonable alternative set of arrangements that would not generate\nthis massive human rights deficit. Christian Barry and Gerhard\nØverland, moreover, have recently provided six distinct ways in\nwhich the global order might be thought to harm the poor, despite the\nconceptual worries of figures like Risse and Cohen (Barry &\nØverland, 2016). It is important to recognize, though, that\nmuch of this debate turns on a mixture of empirical social science and\npolitical philosophy. This is, we believe, likely to be a territory in\nwhich an increasing amount of work on global justice will have to be\nsituated in the years to come. \nAn increasingly important challenge to the institutionalist paradigm\nof global justice is the historical legacy and contemporary effects of\ncolonialism. The idea that our obligations of distributive justice as\ndetermined by our current institutions might be undermined by\nthe idea that the historical relationship of colonialism has\ntremendous influence on current distributions of wealth and power. The\nfocus on colonialism has three aspects though this section will focus\nmostly on the second and third. First, there is a growing interest in\nwhether the early modern progenitors of the social contract tradition\nwere ideologically complicit in European imperialism. In particular,\nthere is a lively debate concerning how Kant’s account of\nhospitality and cosmopolitan right can used to critique colonial and\nneo-colonial relations (Flikschuh & Ypi 2014). Second, there is a\nsignificant—and mostly cosmopolitan in orientation—debate\nconcerning precisely what makes colonialism unjust or wrong. Third,\ngiven the wrong of colonialism and the likely reverberation of its\nnegative effects onto the present, there is the question\nof rectificatory global justice. That is, colonial powers\nhave some distributive duties in virtue of the fact that they must\nrepair the harm caused by their imperial endeavors. \nIt is obviously true that the history of colonialism is replete with\nan almost unparalleled violence (Fanon 1961; Walter 2017). Yet, it\nseems equally clear that a colonial relationship that was essentially\nfree of this sort of violence—or where the level of violence was\nconsiderably lower than the pre-colonial political\nsituation—would still be morally unacceptable. The question of\nwhat precisely grounds the wrongness of colonialism is an attempt to\ngrapple with difficult questions of procedural justice, sovereignty,\nand legitimacy—and how these ideas affect our current\nunderstanding of global distributive justice.  Lea Ypi, for example,\nargues that colonialism is wrong because it represents a wrongfully\nunequal political relationship between the ruler and the ruled (Ypi\n2013; see also Lu 2017). Thus, the defining feature of colonialism is\nset of unequal and non-reciprocal terms of political association. This\nfeature of colonialism makes it uniquely wrong even if the\ncolonizers refrain from atrocities, the colonized have no strongly\nclaims—property or otherwise—to the land being taken, or\nthe colonized lack significant rights to self-determination. This\nview, however, does give rise to a serious concern about how we should\nunderstand coercive associative political projects where the terms of\nassociation being offered are comparatively equitable. That is,\nimagine some more powerful state that comes to a weaker group of\npeople and offers them an offer of political association that is both\nhard to refuse and, yet, based upon equitable terms. Ypi suggests that\nequitable terms of association are decisively undermined if the weaker\nparty does not consent, so it must be true that the\n“colonized” group consents. And yet, it is at least\npossible to imagine cases where the weaker party sees the benefit of\nassociation and therefore consents to the association in ways that\ngive rises to concerns of colonialism. In other words, Ypi’s\naccount may miss a feature of colonialism that gives rise to its\ndistinctiveness as a wrong (Valentini 2015). In most cases, the\ncriticism of Ypi’s account lies in nature of the entity to which\nreciprocal association is owed: the colonized understood as\nindividuals, as corporate bodies, or as a plurality. This is\nespecially important because Ypi’s account—in order to be\ndistinct—must not rely upon nationalism or some sort of\ncorporate ownership of specific territory, and it remains an open\nwhether her account can effectively avoid so relying. At any rate,\ndiscussions of how to precisely to characterize the wrong of\nself-determination are ongoing. \nFinally, colonialism gives rise to claims that the distribution of\nwealth globally ought to be re-ordered in order to satisfy the demands\nof rectificatory global justice. The claim is that rich nations in\ngeneral, or colonizing nations in particular, ought to transfer wealth\nor other valuable resources to poor nations in general or colonized\nnations in particular in virtue of the legacy of colonialism. It is\nimportant to see that these claims to rectification tend to be\npredicated upon the idea that there are contemporary effects of\ncolonial relations. For example, the “new\ninstitutionalists” (Acemoglu & Robinson 2012) suggest that\ndifferences in development are a consequence of geographically driven\ndifferences in colonial history. In some cases, the colonial\npowers—often in the context of settler colonialism—set up\nrelatively effective institutions with the rule of law and strong\nproperty rights. In other contexts, the colonial powers set up\nextractive institutions. These extractive institutions set up strong\nincentive structures for the “liberated” de-colonized\nelites to maintain the extractive nature of these institutions,\ninhibiting development. This is often encouraged—through\ncorruption, military intervention, and less obviously criminal\neconomic manipulation—by the former colonial powers themselves.\nAs a consequence, the initial extractive equilibrium is hard to\ndispel. This account creates a complication for rectificatory views,\nwhich is that this view relies on the bad actions of local elites to\nsustain the equilibrium and so complicates the question of who,\nprecisely, is responsible for the poor current state of many states\n(Lomasky & Tesón 2015). Nonetheless, many have argued that\nthe contemporary effects—whether though the imposition of\ninstitutional forms or debt—of colonialism generates a special\nobligation to provide, for example, debt relief (Jaggar 2002), open\nborders (Amighetti & Nuti 2016) or additional emissions permits\n(Blomfield 2015). Yet, these views face some significant hurdles. They\nhave difficulty in generating a general obligation by rich nations to\nhelp poor nations; rather, they generate obligations for colonizing\nstates to help their former colonies. And while it may be true these\nrelations mostly track the needs of the present, there is no\nrequirement that they do so and, indeed, there seem to be cases where\nthe requirement to assist needy countries and the requirement to help\nnations that have been negatively affected by colonialism conflict.\nSo, rectificatory views must either accept that sometimes states will\nbe obligated to rectify in cases where the objects of the obligation\nare not particularly needy or need to suggest that a broader\nparticipation in an ongoing system of neo-colonial economic relations\nis sufficient to activate the obligations. Yet, if we adopt this\nlatter interpretation, then it is unclear that this view is truly\ndifferent from left institutionalist views described above. If the\nformer, then the claims of colonialism do not appear to be as urgent\nas distributive obligations. Furthermore, the nature of the claim to\ncompensation depends on characterizing the relevant baseline: are we\ncomparing the plight of the former colonies to how they would have\nbeen without colonization or a world where the colonizers acted\njustly? Each of these answers have their issues, with the former being\ntoo permissive towards colonialism and the latter collapsing into\nother views of justice. It is hard to deny that the legacy of\ncolonialism is significant in a variety of applied issues—from\ntrade to climate change to humanitarian intervention—and the\ngrowing interest in its effects and normative consequences is a\nwelcome development; the philosophical difficulties of addressing that\nlegacy, however, are likely to prove difficult indeed. \nWe can conclude this discussion of distributive justice by discussing\nsome recent work on global economic justice that rejects the Rawlsian\nlegacy in a more thoroughgoing manner. Much of this work begins with a\nconcern for property rights, understood in terms that make them prior\nto—and, thus, constraints upon—principles of distributive\njustice. Rawlsian distributive justice, of course, is compatible with\nthe defense of property rights; but those rights are taken to be\nconstructed out of the theory of justice—they do not, as it\nwere, exist before the discussion of economic justice. For many\ntheorists, however, property rights must be respected as inputs to our\ntheorizing about global distributive justice—rather than as\noutputs of that theorizing.  \nThree sorts of theories have recently been put forward into the\ndebates surrounding global economic justice. The first—which we\nwill call right libertarians—take individual rights to\nacquire and trade in property as foundational for any analysis of\nglobal economic justice. The second—who take their inspiration\nfrom the left libertarian tradition—take common\nproperty rights in the world as a basis for theorizing about global\ndistributive justice. The final—who can be termed theorists of\nnational property rights—take the right of a\nnation’s people to use and exploit its natural resources as\nfoundational for thinking about global justice. We can discuss these\nin turn. \nThe debate between libertarian and liberal theories of distributive\njustice is a long-standing one within analytic political philosophy;\nRobert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia offered a\nchallenge to Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice (Nozick\n1974). Nozick argued that a rightful respect for property rights made\nit impossible for a just state to pursue “patterned”\nprinciples of distributive justice. The right to property, if\nrespected, would make such principles of economic equality chimerical\nat best, and totalitarian at worst.  \nIdeas such as those of Nozick have only recently been applied to the\nglobal level. Bas van der Vossen and Jason Brennan (2018) have\ndefended the thought that economic freedom would, if applied at the\nglobal level, lead to greater wealth—and greater human\nflourishing—than any attempt to pursue some particular pattern\nof wealth and poverty. In particular, they argue, social scientific\ndata indicate that policy interventions designed to narrow the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor tends to do more harm than good; good\nintentions, they note, are inadequate to ensure good results. Loren\nLomasky and Fernando Tesón (2015), similarly defend the thought\nthat individual property rights would, if defended universally, lead\nto a significant reduction in global poverty. It is only by\nuniversalizing respect for individual property rights, they argue,\nthat the global poverty can be reduced.  \nThese arguments are, of course, intended to undermine global\ndistributive justice as an independent goal, much as Nozick intended\nhis work to undermine the Rawlsian belief than the gap between the\nrich and the poor was itself a relevant consideration for social\njustice. As such, the same arguments that have been made against\nNozick might also hold true for those who defend libertarianism at the\nglobal level. In the first instance, we might note that there is, on\nthese views, no independent worry about the size of the gap between\nthe rich and the poor; even if the universalization of property rights\nwere to produce an increase in overall wealth, there is nothing within\nthese theories that allows us to regard an increased inequality\nbetween the rich and the poor as problematic in its own right. This,\nof course, is not an objection to the libertarian view; it is,\ninstead, simply evidence that the libertarian and the liberal are\nmotivated by distinct moral concerns. But it is also worth noting that\nsome of what the libertarian says here is motivated by predictions\nabout what the globalization of individual property rights would\ndo. The libertarian is convinced that a global expansion of\nthose rights would produce a world of flourishing communities and\nflourishing individuals. Others, however, would worry that the\nuniversalization of libertarian rights might produce something\nentirely different—that a world of unconstrained capitalism\nmight produce dystopia and rampant inequality, rather than perpetual\npeace. The debate between the global liberal and the global\nlibertarian is, then, going to turn upon both principle and\nprediction, in a way that makes this debate unlikely to be resolved\nsoon. \nIf the right-libertarian celebrates individual property rights, the\nleft-libertarian regards property rights as a collective phenomenon.\nLeft-libertarian thought is complex, and merits its own examination;\nwe will not provide an adequate analysis of that thought here. We\nmean, instead, to note that one particular left-libertarian\nidea—that individual property rights in natural resources and in\nterritory must acknowledge the symmetrical claims of all human persons\nto the use of those goods—has proven to be a fruitful one in\ntheorizing about global distributive justice. \nHillel Steiner (2005) argues that all individuals are equally entitled\nto benefit from the exploitation of natural resources; as such, those\nleft behind by territorial expropriation have the right to\ncompensation, through the creation of a proposed Global Fund. Mathias\nRisse (2012) has more recently argued in favor of common ownership of\nthe world’s natural resources as an independent ground of\njustice. Risse’s view is complex and polycentric, and includes\nsites on which global justice might be evaluated—including\ncommon humanity, shared subjection to a coercive legal system, and the\nfact that humanity shares a limited set of territorial goods. It is\nthis latter aspect that is most relevant for our present discussion;\nRisse argues that the world’s natural resources, since they are\nnot the result of any individual person’s agency, must be\nregarded as subject to symmetrical claims from all human persons. This\nvision of the world as given to mankind in common, of course, is\nborrowed from early modern thinkers; Risse vindicates their concern\nwith natural resources, and argues that conclusions for both migration\nand for distributive justice can be derived from this ground. \nThese ideas are complex, and the debate over their relevance to global\njustice is likely to continue. One immediate worry, of course, is how\nto understand the relationship between that wealth created by natural\nresources, and that wealth created by human agency and ingenuity.\nSteiner and Risse both argue that the collective right to use the\nearth constrains what distribution of wealth can emerge at the global\nlevel; but both must provide some account of how to figure out what\ncounts as given to humans by God or by nature, from that which is\ncreated by humans using their brains and their agency. Steiner and\nRisse do, of course, engage with exactly that issue; but the precise\ncut between what is made by God and what is made by humanity is likely\nto be a continuing source of controversy. \nWe can conclude this section by examining a view on which property\nrights in the natural resources of a country are held by that set of\npeople who live within that particular country. This view is defended\nin Wenar (2015), who argues that it would be revolutionary—in\nour world, as it emerges from colonialism and imperialism—for us\nto regard the inhabitants of a given country as actually owning that\ncountry’s national resources. Wenar notes, as does Pogge, that\nour current global institutions allow—indeed,\nincentivize—bad governance, by encouraging malign agents to gain\ncontrol of a coercive state and sell of the natural resources of that\nstate. Wenar, however, grounds this not in a cosmopolitan vision of\nRawlsian right, but instead upon a view on which the territorial goods\ncontained within a country are owned by the inhabitants of that\ncountry. Those who would sell those goods without the consent of the\npeople, then, are best understood as thieves—whether or not\nthose thieves present themselves as the legitimate government of the\nsociety in question: \nIf we believe in popular resource sovereignty, there can be no such\nthing as a ruler who is benevolent with resource revenues. No one can\nbe generous by giving someone what they already own. The citizens of a\ncountry are entitled to all the value of their resources; the regime\nis entitled to not a penny. All of Saudi Arabia’s oil belongs to\nthe Saudi people, and the royals can only have their super yachts and\npalaces—indeed, anything bought with the oil money—at the\npeople’s sufferance. A king’s right is not to\n“all”, it is to “nothing” (Wenar 2015:\n241). \nWenar’s argument is not directly focused on global distributive\njustice, so much as it is focused on the avoidance of Western\ncomplicity in tyranny and dispossession; Wenar defends Western legal\ninstruments intended to avoid participation in unjustified resource\nsales, instead of principles of global distributive justice.\nNevertheless, this vision of collective property rights over natural\ngoods might be thought to pose an independent check on what sorts of\nredistributive policy are available, similar to the libertarian views\ndiscussed above. And, similarly, it is possible to object to\nWenar’s view, with reference to whether or not this way of\nconstructing property rights is morally defensible (see generally\nWenar et al. 2018). In particular, the cosmopolitan might reject the\nthought that a Saudi citizen (say) has a greater claim than others to\nexploit the Saudi oilfields, simply because of his birth within the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. Wenar’s view, nonetheless, is an\nimportant recent addition to the philosophical discussion of global\ndistributive justice, and debate about that view is likely to\ncontinue. \nIt is rarely a smart move to make predictions within philosophy.\nNevertheless, it is perhaps appropriate to offer a few views about\nwhat we are likely to see in future work about global justice. The\nfirst, following on our discussion of Pogge’s work, is an\nincreased engagement by philosophers with empirical evidence and\nempirical methods. Apart from the pure egalitarians, political\nphilosophers all make assumptions about the nature and powers of\nglobal institutions; these assumptions can be grounded—or\nrefuted—by engagement with international lawyers, development\neconomists, and the like. To some extent, this engagement is already\nhappening (Reddy & Pogge 2010; Hassoun & Subramanian 2012;\nBenatar & Brock 2011). More of this engagement is, we believe,\nboth likely and likely to be beneficial.   The second trend we would identify is that there is increasingly\nlikely a need for political philosophy dealing with specific global\nphenomena. Much of what we have dealt with here has looked only at the\nmacro-level phenomenon of global inequality. A full analysis of global\njustice will also look at specific forms of human institution and\nagency that are likely to be relevant from the standpoint of justice.\nWe have already mentioned, if only in passing, the issues of\nimmigration, fairness in trade, and feminism. We would conclude here\nby mentioning some other areas of inquiry that might become\nincreasingly important. Buchanan (2009) and Pogge (2009) have both\nproduced recent work on global incentives for pharmaceutical\nresearch. Ypi, Goodin, & Barry (2009) have written on the issue of\nglobal debt relief. Gardiner (2004) and Caney (2008, 2009) have\nwritten on the relationship of global climate change and global\ninequality. Increasingly, we believe that these sorts of analyses are\nlikely to proliferate, and philosophers come to terms not just with\nthe fact of inequality, but with the plurality of different reasons\nfor—and solutions to—that inequality.  Political\nphilosophy has only recently turned its attention to questions of\nglobal justice; it is our hope that this attention will deepen in\nyears to come, as we gain more understanding of the nature and causes\nof global underdevelopment and inequality.  The final trend might be the most important; we are increasingly\nwilling to move beyond the questions that animated Rawlsian analyses\nof global distributive justice, to a broader consideration of the\nagents and institutions that might be implicated in our global\nprocesses of production. Iris Marion Young (2011) raises some\nimportant questions about how to begin to understand the various\nagents whose acts might be constrained by moral theorizing—and\nhow to understand the distinct ways in which our identities, as\nconsumers and as citizens, might be implicated in the replication of\npoverty and inequality. Although this entry began with an examination\nof the Rawlsian tradition of thinking about distributive justice, it\nis an entirely good thing that the philosophical literature is\nincreasingly willing to move beyond that tradition. As global\nrelationships become more complicated and more central, we stand in\nneed of more theorizing about how to understand the relationship\nbetween global wealth and global poverty—and about the moral\nprinciples within which that relationship is to be understood.","contact.mail":"patrick.taylor.smith@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
