In addition, philosophical\nstudy of related topics (such as parental rights, duties and\nresponsibilities) has flourished in recent years. The philosophy of\nchildhood takes up philosophically interesting questions about\nchildhood, changing conceptions over time about childhood and\nattitudes toward children; theories of cognitive and moral\ndevelopment; children’s interests and children’s rights, the goods of\nchildhood; children and autonomy; the moral status of children and the\nplace of children in society. As an academic subject, the philosophy\nof childhood has sometimes been included within the philosophy of\neducation (e.g., Siegel, 2009). Recently, however, philosophers have\nbegun to offer college and university courses specifically in the\nphilosophy of childhood. And philosophical literature on childhood,\nparenting and families is increasing in both quantity and quality.\n\n\n\nAlmost single-handedly, Philippe Ariès, in his influential\nbook, Centuries of Childhood (Ariès, 1962), made the\nreading public aware that conceptions of childhood have varied across\nthe centuries. The very notion of a child, we now realize, is both\nhistorically and culturally conditioned. But exactly how the\nconception of childhood has changed historically and how conceptions\ndiffer across cultures is a matter of scholarly controversy and\nphilosophical interest (see Kennedy, 2006). Thus Ariès argued,\npartly on the evidence of depictions of infants in medieval art, that\nthe medievals thought of children as simply “little\nadults.” Shulamith Shahar (1990), by contrast, finds evidence\nthat some medieval thinkers understood childhood to be divided into\nfairly well-defined stages. And, whereas Piaget claims that his\nsubjects, Swiss children in the first half of the 20th Century, were\nanimistic in their thinking (Piaget, 1929), Margaret Mead (1967)\npresents evidence that Pacific island children were not.   \n\nOne reason for being skeptical about any claim of radical\ndiscontinuity—at least in Western conceptions of\nchildhood—arises from the fact that, even today, the dominant\nview of children embodies what we might call a broadly\n“Aristotelian conception” of childhood.  According to\nAristotle, there are four sorts of causality, one of which is Final\ncausality and another is Formal Causality. Aristotle thinks of the\nFinal Cause of a living organism as the function that organism\nnormally performs when it reaches maturity. He thinks of the Formal\nCause of the organism as the form or structure it normally has in\nmaturity, where that form or structure is thought to enable the\norganism to perform its functions well. According to this conception,\na human child is an immature specimen of the organism type, human,\nwhich, by nature, has the potentiality to develop into a mature\nspecimen with the structure, form, and function of a normal or\nstandard adult. \n\nMany adults today have this broadly Aristotelian conception of\nchildhood without having actually read any of Aristotle. It informs\ntheir understanding of their own relationship toward the children\naround them. Thus they consider the fundamental responsibility they\nbear toward their children to be the obligation to provide the kind of\nsupportive environment those children need to develop into normal\nadults, with the biological and psychological structures in place\nneeded to perform the functions we assume that normal, standard adults\ncan perform. \n\nTwo modifications of this Aristotelian conception have been\nparticularly influential in the last century and a half. One is the 19th\ncentury idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\n(Gould, 1977), that is, that the development of an individual\nrecapitulates the history and evolutionary development of the race, or\nspecies (Spock, 1968, 229). This idea is prominent in Freud (1950) and\nin the early writings of Jean Piaget (see, e.g. Piaget, 1933). Piaget,\nhowever, sought in his later writings to explain the phenomenon of\nrecapitulation by appeal to general principles of structural change in\ncognitive development (see, e.g., Piaget, 1968, 27). \n\nThe other modification is the idea that development takes places in\nage-related stages of clearly identifiable structural change.\nThis idea can be traced back to ancient thinkers, for example the\nStoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 49). Stage theory is to be found in\nvarious medieval writers (Shahar, 1990, 21–31) and, in the\nmodern period, most prominently in Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s highly\ninfluential work, Emile (1979). But it is Piaget who first\ndeveloped a highly sophisticated version of stage theory and made it\nthe dominant paradigm for conceiving childhood in the latter part of\nthe 20th Century (see, e.g., Piaget, 1971). \n\nMatthews (2008, 2009), argues that a Piagetian-type stage theory of\ndevelopment tends to support a “deficit conception” of childhood,\naccording to which the nature of the child is understood primarily as\na configuration of deficits—missing capacities that normal adults\nhave but children lack. This conception, he argues, ignores or\nundervalues the fact that children are, for example, better able to\nlearn a second language, or paint an aesthetically worthwhile picture,\nor conceive a philosophically interesting question, than those same\nchildren will likely be able to do as adults. Moreover, it restricts\nthe range and value of relationships adults think they can have with\ntheir children. Broadly Aristotelian conceptions of childhood can have two further\nproblematic features. They may deflect attention away from thinking\nabout children with disabilities in favour of theorizing solely about\nnormally developing children (see Carlson 2010), and they may distract\nphilosophers from attending to the goods of childhood when they think\nabout the responsibilities adults have towards the children in their\ncare, encouraging focus only on care required to ensure that children\ndevelop adult capacities.  \n\nHow childhood is conceived is crucial for almost all the\nphilosophically interesting questions about children. It is also\ncrucial for questions about what should be the legal status of children\nin society, as well as for the study of children in psychology,\nanthropology, sociology, and many other fields.  Any well-worked out epistemology will provide at least the\nmaterials for a theory of cognitive development in childhood. Thus\naccording to René Descartes a clear and distinct knowledge of\nthe world can be constructed from resources innate to the human mind\n(Descartes, PW, 131). John Locke, by contrast, maintains that the\nhuman mind begins as a “white paper, void of all characters,\nwithout any ideas” (Locke, EHC, 121). On this view all the\n“materials of reason and knowledge” come from\nexperience. Locke’s denial of the doctrine of innate ideas was, no\ndoubt, directed specifically at Descartes and the Cartesians. But it\nalso implies a rejection of the Platonic doctrine that learning is a\nrecollection of previously known Forms. Few theorists of cognitive\ndevelopment today find either the extreme empiricism of Locke or the\nstrong innatism of Plato or Descartes completely acceptable. \n\nBehaviorism has offered recent theorists of cognitive development a\nway to be strongly empiricist without appealing to Locke’s inner\ntheater of the mind. The behaviorist program was, however, dealt a\nmajor setback when Noam Chomsky, in his review (1959) of\nSkinner’s Verbal Behavior (1957), argued successfully\nthat no purely behaviorist account of language-learning is possible.\nChomsky’s alternative, a theory of Universal Grammar, which owes\nsome of its inspiration to Plato and Descartes, has made the idea of\ninnate language structures, and perhaps other cognitive structures as\nwell, seem a viable alternative to a more purely empiricist conception\nof cognitive development. \n\nIt is, however, the work of Jean Piaget that has been most\ninfluential on the way psychologists, educators, and even philosophers\nhave come to think about the cognitive development of children.\nPiaget’s early work, The Child’s Conception of the\nWorld (1929), makes especially clear how philosophically\nchallenging the work of a developmental psychologist can be. Although his\nproject is always to lay out identifiable stages in which children come\nto understand what, say, causality or thinking or whatever is, the\nintelligibility of his account presupposes that there are satisfactory\nresponses to the philosophical quandaries that topics like\ncausality, thinking, and life raise. \n\nTake the concept of life. According to Piaget this concept is acquired\nin four stages (Piaget, 1929, Chapter 6) \n\nThese distinctions are suggestive, but they invite much more\ndiscussion than Piaget elicits from his child subjects. What is\nrequired for movement to be spontaneous? Is a bear alive during\nhibernation? We may suppose the Venus flytrap moves spontaneously. But\ndoes it really? What about other plants? And then there is the\nquestion of what Piaget can mean by calling the thinking of young\nchildren “animistic,” if, at their stage of cognitive\ndevelopment, their idea of life is simply “assimilated to\nactivity in general.” \n\nDonaldson (1978) offers a psychological critique of Piaget on\ncognitive development. A philosophical critique of Piaget’s work on\ncognitive development is to be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of Matthews\n(1994). Interesting post-Piagetian work in cognitive development\nincludes Cary (1985), Wellman (1990), Flavel (1995), Subbotsky (1996),\nand Gelman (2003). \n\nRecent psychological research on concept formation has suggested that\nchildren do not generally form concepts by learning necessary and\nsufficient conditions for their application, but rather by coming to\nuse prototypical examples as reference guides. Thus a robin (rather,\nof course, than a penguin) might be the child’s prototype for\n‘bird’. The child, like the adult, might then be credited\nwith having the concept, bird, without the child’s ever being able to\nspecify, successfully, necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsomething to count as a bird. This finding seems to have implications\nfor the proper role and importance of conceptual analysis in\nphilosophy. It is also a case in which we should let what we come to\nknow about cognitive development in children help shape our\nepistemology, rather than counting on our antecedently formulated\nepistemology to shape our conception of cognitive development in\nchildren (see Rosch and Lloyd, 1978, and Gelman, 2003). \n\nSome developmental psychologists have recently moved away from the\nidea that children are to be understood primarily as human beings who\nlack the capacities adults of their species normally have. This change\nis striking in, for example, the work of Alison Gopnik, who writes:\n“Children aren’t just defective adults, primitive grownups gradually\nattaining our perfection and complexity. Instead, children and adults\nare different forms of homo sapiens. They have very different, though\nequally complex and powerful, minds, brains, and forms of\nconsciousness, designed to serve different evolutionary functions”\n(Gopnik, 2009, 9). Part of this new respect for the capacities of\nchildren rests on neuroscience and an increased appreciation for the\ncomplexity of the brains of infants and young children. Thus Gopnik\nwrites: “Babies’ brains are actually more highly connected than adult\nbrains; more neural pathways are available to babies than adults.”\n(11)  \n\nMany philosophers in the history of ethics have devoted serious\nattention to the issue of moral development. Thus Plato, for example,\noffers a model curriculum in his dialogue, Republic, aimed at\ndeveloping virtue in rulers. Aristotle’s account of the logical\nstructure of the virtues in his Nicomachean Ethics\nprovides a scaffolding for understanding how moral development takes\nplace. And the Stoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 45–64) devoted special\nattention to dynamics of moral development. \n\nAmong modern philosophers, it is again Rousseau (1979) who devotes the\nmost attention to issues of development. He offers a sequence of five\nage-related stages through which a person must pass to reach moral\nmaturity: (i) infancy (birth to age 2); (ii) the age of sensation (3\nto 12); (iii) the age of ideas (13 to puberty); (iv) the age of\nsentiment (puberty to age 20); and (v) the age of marriage and social\nresponsibility (age 21 on). Although he allows that an adult may\neffectively modify the behavior of children by explaining that bad\nactions are those that will bring punishment (90), he insists that\ngenuinely moral reasoning will not be appreciated until the age of\nideas, at 13 and older. In keeping with his stage theory of moral\ndevelopment he explicitly rejects Locke’s maxim, ‘Reason with\nchildren,’ (Locke, 1971) on the ground that attempting to reason\nwith a child younger than thirteen years of age is developmentally\ninappropriate. \n\nHowever, the cognitive theory of moral development formulated by\nPiaget in The Moral Judgment of the Child (1965) and the\nsomewhat later theory of Lawrence Kohlberg (1981, 1984) are the ones\nthat have had most influence on psychologists, educators, and even\nphilosophers.  Thus, for example, what John Rawls has to say about\nchildren in his classic work, A Theory of Justice (1971)\nrests heavily on the work of Piaget and Kohlberg. \n\nKohlberg presents a theory according to which morality develops in\napproximately six stages, though according to his research, few adults\nactually reach the fifth or sixth stages. In this respect Kohlberg’s\ntheory departs from classic stage theory, as in Piaget, since the\nsequence of stages does not culminate in the capacity shared by normal\nadults. However, Kohlberg maintained that no one skips a stage or\nregresses to an earlier stage. Although Kohlberg sometimes considered\nthe possibility of a seventh or eighth stage, these are his basic\nsix:  \nKohlberg developed a test, which has been widely used, to determine\nthe stage of any individual at any given time. The test requires\nresponses to ethical dilemmas and is to be scored by consulting an\nelaborate manual. \n\nOne of the most influential critiques of the Kohlberg theory is to\nbe found in Carol Gilligan’s In a Different Voice\n(1982). Gilligan argues that Kohlberg’s rule-oriented conception\nof morality has an orientation toward justice, which she associates\nwith stereotypically male thinking, whereas women and girls are perhaps\nmore likely to approach moral dilemmas with a “care” orientation. One\nimportant issue in moral theory that the Kohlberg-Gilligan debate\nraises is that of the role and importance of moral feelings in the\nmoral life (see the entry on \n feminist ethics). \n\nAnother line of approach to moral development is to be found in the\nwork of Martin Hoffman (1982). Hoffman describes the development of\nempathetic feelings and responses in four stages. Hoffman’s approach\nallows one to appreciate the possibility of genuine moral feelings, and\nso of genuine moral agency, in a very small child. By contrast,\nKohlberg’s moral-dilemma tests will assign pre-schoolers and even early\nelementary-school children to a pre-moral level. \n\nA philosophically astute and balanced assessment of the\nKohlberg-Gilligan debate, with appropriate attention to the work of\nMartin Hoffman, can be found in Pritchard (1991). See also Friedman (1987), Likona\n(1976), Kagan and Lamb (1987), and Pritchard (1996). \n\nFor a full discussion of children’s interests and children’s rights \nsee the entry on the\n rights of children. \n\nClearly children are capable of goal-directed behavior while still\nrelatively young, and are agents in this minimal sense. Respect for\nchildren’s agency is provided in legal and medical contexts, in that\nchildren who are capable of expressing their preferences are\nfrequently consulted, even if their views are not regarded as decisive\nfor determining outcomes.   \n\nThe exercise of childhood agency will obviously be constrained by\nsocial and political factors, including various dependency relations,\nsome of them imposed by family structures. Whether there are special\nethical rules and considerations that pertain to the family in\nparticular, and, if so, what these rules or considerations are, is the\nsubject of an emerging field we can call ‘family ethics’\n(Baylis and McLeod 2014, Blustein, 1982, Brighouse and Swift 2014,\nHoulgate, 1980, 1999).   \n\nThe idea that, in child-custody cases, the preferences of a child\nshould be given consideration, and not just the “best\ninterest” of the child, is beginning to gain acceptance in the\nU.S., Canada and Europe. “Gregory K,” who at age 12 was\nable to speak rationally and persuasively to support his petition for\nnew adoptive parents, made a good case for recognizing childhood\nagency in a family court. (See “Gregory Kingsley” in the\nOther Internet Resources.) Less dramatically, in divorce proceedings,\nolder children are routinely consulted for their views about proposed\narrangements for their custody. \nPerhaps the most wrenching cases in which adults have come to let\nchildren play a significant role in deciding their own future are\nthose that involve treatment decisions for children with terminal\nillnesses. (Kopelman and Moskop, 1989) The pioneering work of Myra\nBluebond-Langner shows how young children can come to terms with their\nown imminent death and even conspire, mercifully, to help their\nparents and caregivers avoid having to discuss this awful truth with\nthem (Bluebond-Langner, 1980).  \nWhile family law and medical ethics are domains in which children\ncapable of expressing preferences are increasingly encouraged to do\nso, there remains considerable controversy within philosophy as to the\nkind of authority that should be given to children’s\npreferences. There is widespread agreement that most children’s\ncapacity to eventually become autonomous is morally important and that\nadults who interact with them have significant responsibility to\nensure that this capacity is nurtured (Feinberg 1980). At the same\ntime it is typical for philosophers to be skeptical about the capacity\nfor children under the age of ten to have any capacity for autonomy,\neither because they are judged not to care stably about anything\n(Oshana 2005, Schapiro 1999), lack information, experience and\ncognitive maturity (Levinson 1999, Ross 1998), or are too poor at\ncritical reflection (Levinson 1999). \nMullin (2007, 2014) argues that consideration of children’s capacity\nfor autonomy should operate with a relatively minimal understanding of\nautonomy as self-governance in the service of what the person cares\nabout (with the objects of care conceived broadly to include\nprinciples, relationships, activities and things). Children’s\nattachment to those they love (including their parents) can therefore\nbe a source of autonomy. When a person, adult or child, acts\nautonomously, he or she finds the activity meaningful and embraces the\ngoal of the action. This contrasts both with a lack of motivation and\nwith feeling pressured by others to achieve outcomes desired by\nthem. Autonomy in this sense requires capacities for impulse control,\ncaring stably about some things, connecting one’s goals to one’s\nactions, and confidence that one can achieve at least some of one’s\ngoals by directing one’s actions. It does not require extensive\nability to engage in critical self-reflection, or substantive\nindependence. The ability to act autonomously in a particular domain\nwill depend, however, on whether one’s relationships with others are\nautonomy supporting. This is in keeping with feminist work on\nrelational autonomy. See the entry on\n Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy. \nChildren’s autonomy is supported when adults give them relevant\ninformation, reasons for their requests, demonstrate interest in\nchildren’s feelings and perspectives, and offer children structured\nchoices that reflect those thoughts and feelings. Support for\nchildren’s autonomy in particular domains of action is perfectly\nconsistent with adults behaving paternalistically toward them at other\ntimes and in other domains, when children are ill-informed, extremely\nimpulsive, do not appreciate the long-term consequences of their\nactions, cannot recognize what is in their interest, cannot direct\ntheir actions to accord with their interests, or are at risk of\nsignificant harm (Mullin 2014).   “Refrigerator art,” that is, the paintings and\ndrawings of young children that parents display on the family’s\nrefrigerator, is emblematic of adult ambivalence toward the\nproductions of childhood. Typically, parents are pleased with, and\nproud of, the art their children produce. But equally typically,\nparents do not consider the artwork of their children to be good\nwithout qualification. Yet, as Jonathan Fineberg has pointed out\n(Fineberg, 1997, 2006), several of the most celebrated artists of the\n20th century collected child art and were inspired by it. It may be\nthat children are more likely as children to produce art, the\naesthetic value of which a famous artist or an art historian can\nappreciate, than they will be able to later as adults.   According to what we have called the “Aristotelian\nconception”, childhood is an essentially prospective state. On\nsuch a view, the value of what a child produces cannot be expected to\nbe good in itself, but only good for helping the child to develop into\na good adult. Perhaps some child art is a counterexample to this\nexpectation. Of course, one could argue that adults who, as children,\nwere encouraged to produce art, as well as make music and excel at\ngames, are more likely to be flourishing adults than those who are not\nencouraged to give such “outlets” to their energy and\ncreativity. But the example of child art should at least make one\nsuspicious of Michael Slote’s claim that “just as dreams are\ndiscounted except as they affect (the waking portions of) our lives,\nwhat happens in childhood principally affects our view of total lives\nthrough the effects that childhood success or failure are supposed to\nhave on mature individuals” (Slote, 1983, 14). \nRecent philosophical work on the goods of childhood (Brennan 2014,\nGheaus 2014, Macleod 2010) stresses that childhood should not be\nevaluated solely insofar as it prepares the child to be a fully\nfunctioning adult. Instead, a good childhood is of intrinsic and not\nmerely instrumental value. Different childhoods that equally prepare\nchildren to be capable adults may be better or worse, depending on how\nchildren fare qua children. Goods potentially specific to childhood\n(or, more likely, of greatest importance during childhood) include\nopportunities for joyful and unstructured play and social\ninteractions, lack of significant responsibility, considerable free\ntime, and innocence, particularly sexual innocence. Play, for\ninstance, can be of considerable value not only as a means for\nchildren to acquire skills and capacities they will need as adults,\nbut also for itself, during childhood. \nEven more recently, some philosophers (Hannan 2018, Hannan and Leland\n2018) have questioned whether or not there are features of childhood\nthat make childhood bad for children. Candidate bad-making features\ninclude children’s impaired practical identity, their being\nasymmetrically physically and emotionally vulnerable to their parents\nand needing extensive control by them, and their lack of a fixed\npractical identity. Any evaluation of features that are particularly\nvaluable in childhood, and either uniquely or more easily accessed in\nchildhood, should be balanced against consideration of features that\nmake it a worse stage of life than adulthood. Bad-making features of\nchildhood may be traced either to aspects of childhood that cannot be\nchanged or to contingent social arrangements that may leave children\nvulnerable to abuse or neglect at the hands of their intimate\ncaregivers, without much opportunity for recourse. \n\nFor a full discussion of this topic see the entry on \n Philosophy for Children. \n\nIt is uncontroversial to judge that what Mary Anne Warren terms\nparadigmatic humans have moral status (Warren 1992). Paradigmatic\nhumans are adults with relatively standard cognitive capacities for\nself-control, self-criticism, self-direction, and rational thought,\nand are capable of moral thought and action. However, the grounds for\nthis status are controversial, and different grounds for moral status\nhave direct implications for the moral status of children. Jan\nNarveson (1988), for instance, argues that children do not have moral\nstatus in their own right because only free rational beings, capable\nof entering into reciprocal relations with one another, have\nfundamental rights. While Narveson uses the language of rights in his\ndiscussion of moral status (people have direct moral duties only to\nrights holders on his account), moral status need not be discussed in\nthe language of rights. Many other philosophers recognize children as\nhaving moral status because of their potential to become paradigmatic\nhumans without committing to children having rights. For instance,\nAllen Wood writes: “it would show contempt for rational nature to be\nindifferent to its potentiality in children.” (Wood 1998, 198) \nWhen children are judged to have moral status because of their\npotential to develop the capacities of paradigmatic adults (we might\ncall these paradigmatic children), this leaves questions about the\nmoral status of those children who are not expected to live to\nadulthood, and those children whose significant intellectual\ndisabilities compromise their ability to acquire the capacities of\nparadigmatic adults. There are then three common approaches that grant\nmoral status to non-paradigmatic children (and other non-paradigmatic\nhumans). The first approach deems moral consideration to track species\nmembership. On this approach all human children have moral status\nsimply because they are human (Kittay 2005). This approach has been\ncriticized as being inappropriately speciesist, especially by animal\nrights activists. The second approach gives moral status to children\nbecause of their capacity to fare well or badly, either on\nstraightforwardly utilitarian grounds or because they have subjective\nexperiences (Dombrowski 1997). It has been criticized by some for\nfailing to distinguish between capacities all or almost all human\nchildren have that are not also possessed by other creatures who feel\npleasure and pain. The third approach gives moral status to\nnon-paradigmatic children because of the interests others with moral\nstatus take in them (Sapontzis 1987), or the relationships they have\nwith them (Kittay 2005)  \nSometimes the approaches may be combined. For instance Warren writes\nthat young children and other non-paradigmatic humans have moral\nstatus for two sorts of reasons: “their rights are based not only on\nthe value which they themselves place upon their lives and well-being,\nbut also on the value which other human beings place on them.”\n(1992. 197) In addition to these three most common approaches, Mullin\n(2011) develops a fourth: some non-paradigmatic children (and adults)\nhave moral status not simply because others value them but because\nthey are themselves capable of being active participants in morally\nvaluable relationships with others. These relationships express care\nfor others beyond their serving as means for one’s own\nsatisfaction. Approaches to moral status that emphasize children’s\ncapacity to care for others in morally valuable relationships also\nraise interesting questions about children’s moral responsibilities\nwithin those relationships (see Mullin 2010).\n For more on this topic see the entry on the\n grounds of moral status.  \n\nThe topics discussed above hardly exhaust the philosophy of\nchildhood.  Thus we have said nothing about, for example,\nphilosophical literature on personhood as it bears on questions about\nthe morality of abortion, or bioethical discussions about when it is\nappropriate for parents to consent to children’s participation in\nmedical research or refuse medical treatment of their children. There\nhas been increasing attention in recent years to questions about the\nappropriate limits of parental authority over children, about the\nsource and extent of parents and the state’s responsibilities for\nchildren, and about the moral permissibility of parents devoting\nsubstantial resources to advancing the life prospects of their\nchildren. These and many other topics concerning children may be\nfamiliar to philosophers as they get discussed in other\ncontexts. Discussing them under the rubric, ‘philosophy of\nchildhood,’ as well in the other contexts, may help us see\nconnections between them and other philosophical issues concerning\nchildren.","contact.mail":"amy.mullin@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
