But a\nself-conscious subject is not just aware of something that merely\nhappens to be themselves, as one is if one sees an old photograph\nwithout realising that it is of oneself. Rather a self-conscious\nsubject is aware of themselves as themselves; it is manifest\nto them that they themselves are the object of awareness.\nSelf-consciousness is a form of consciousness that is paradigmatically\nexpressed in English by the words “I”, “me”,\nand “my”, terms that each of us uses to refer to ourselves\nas such.\n\n\nA central topic throughout the history of philosophy—and\nincreasingly so since the seventeenth century—the phenomena\nsurrounding self-consciousness prompt a variety of fundamental\nphilosophical and scientific questions, including its relation to\nconsciousness; its semantic and epistemic features; its realisation in\nboth conceptual and non-conceptual representation; and its connection\nto our conception of an objective world populated with others like\nourselves.\n\nA familiar feature of ancient Greek philosophy and culture is the\nDelphic maxim “Know Thyself”. But what is it that one\nknows if one knows oneself? In Sophocles’ Oedipus,\nOedipus knows a number of things about himself, for example that he\nwas prophesied to kill Laius. But although he knew this about himself,\nit is only later in the play that he comes to know that it is he\nhimself of whom it is true. That is, he moves from thinking that\nthe son of Laius and Jocasta was prophesied to kill Laius, to thinking\nthat he himself was so prophesied. It is only this latter\nknowledge that we would call an expression of self-consciousness and\nthat, we may presume, is the object of the Delphic maxim. During the\ncourse of the drama Oedipus comes to know himself, with tragic\nconsequences. But just what this self-consciousness amounts to, and\nhow it might be connected to other aspects of the mind, most notably\nconsciousness itself, is less clear. It has, perhaps unsurprisingly,\nbeen the topic of considerable discussion since the Greeks. During the\nearly modern period self-consciousness became central to a number of\nphilosophical issues and, with Kant and the post-Kantians, came to be\nseen as one of the most important topics in epistemology and the\nphilosophy of mind. \nAlthough it is occasionally suggested that a concern with\nself-consciousness is a peculiarly modern phenomenon, originating with\nDescartes (Brinkmann 2005), it is in fact the topic of lively ancient\nand medieval debates, many of which prefigure early modern and\ncontemporary concerns (Sorabji 2006). Aristotle, for example, claims\nthat a person must, while perceiving any thing, also perceive their\nown existence (De Sensu 7.448a), a claim suggestive of the\nview that consciousness entails self-consciousness. Furthermore,\naccording to Aristotle, since the intellect takes on the form of that\nwhich is thought (Kahn 1992), it “is thinkable just as the\nthought-objects are” (De Anima 3.4.430), an assertion\nthat was interpreted by Aristotle’s medieval commentators as the\nview that self-awareness depends on an awareness of extra-mental\nthings (Cory 2014: ch. 1; Owens 1988). \nBy contrast, the Platonic tradition, principally through the influence\nof Augustine, writing in the fourth and fifth centuries, is associated\nwith the view that the mind “gains the knowledge of [itself]\nthrough itself” (On the Trinity 9.3; Matthews 1992;\nCary 2000) by being present to itself. Thus, on this view,\nself-awareness requires no awareness of outer things. In a similar\nvein, in the eleventh century, Avicenna argues, by way of his Flying\nMan thought experiment, that a newly created person floating in a\nvoid, with all senses disabled, would nevertheless be self-aware. Thus\nthe self that one cognises cannot be a bodily thing of which one is\naware through the senses (Kaukua & Kukkonen 2007; Black 2008;\nKaukua 2015). On such views, and in contrast to the Aristotelian\npicture, basic self-awareness is neither sensory in nature nor\ndependent on the awareness of other things. This latter claim was\naccepted by Aquinas, writing in the thirteenth century, who can be\nseen as synthesising aspects of the Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions (Cory 2014). For not only does Aquinas claim that there is\na form of self-awareness—awareness that one exists—for\nwhich, “the mere presence of the mind suffices”, there is\nanother form—awareness of one’s essence—that, as\nAristotle had claimed, is dependent on cognising other things and so\nfor which “the mere presence of the mind does not suffice”\n(Summa 1, 87, 1; Kenny 1993: ch. 10). \nThis ancient and medieval debate concerning whether the mere presence\nof the mind is sufficient for self-awareness is related to another\nconcerning whether self-awareness is itself sensory in character or,\nput another way, whether the self is or is not perceptible. Aquinas\nhas sometimes been interpreted as offering a positive answer to this\nquestion, sometimes a negative answer (see Pasnau 2002: ch. 11, and\nCory 2014: ch. 4, for differing views). These issues were also\ndiscussed in various Indian (Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist) debates\n(Albahari 2006; Siderits, Thompson, & Zahavi 2013; Ganeri\n2012a,b), with a variety of perspectives represented. For example, in\nthe writing of the eleventh century Jain writer Prabhācandra,\nthere appears an argument very much like Avicenna’s Flying Man\nargument for the possibility of self-awareness without awareness of\nthe body (Ganeri 2012a: ch. 2), whereas various thinkers of the\nAdvaita Vendānta school argue that there is no self-awareness\nwithout embodiment (Ram-Prasad 2013). There were, therefore,\nwide-ranging debates in the ancient and medieval period not only about\nthe nature of self-consciousness, but also about its relation to other\naspects of the mind, most notably sensory perception and awareness of\nthe body. \nCentral to the early modern discussion of self-consciousness are\nDescartes’ assertions, in the second of his\nMeditations, that “I am, I exist, is\nnecessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my\nmind” (Descartes 1641: 80), and, in both his Discourse\nand Principles, that “I think, therefore I am”,\nor “cogito ergo sum” (Descartes 1637: 36, and\nDescartes 1644: 162; see the discussion of Reflection in the entry on\n seventeenth century theories of consciousness).\n The cogito, which was anticipated by Augustine (On the\nTrinity 10.10; Pasnau 2002: ch. 11), embodies two elements of\nself-awareness—awareness that one is thinking and awareness that\none exists—that play a foundational role in Descartes’\nepistemological project. As such, it is crucial for Descartes that the\ncogito is something of which we can be absolutely certain.\nBut whilst most commentators are happy to agree that both “I am\nthinking” and “I exist” are indubitable, there is a\ngreat deal of debate over the grounds for such certainty and over the\nform of the cogito itself (Hintikka 1962; Wilson 1978: ch. 2, §2;\nB. Williams 1978: ch. 3; Markie 1992). Of particular concern is the\nquestion whether these two propositions are known by inference or\nnon-inferentially, e.g., by intuition, an issue that echoes the\nmedieval debates concerning whether one can be said to perceive\noneself. \nOne philosopher who accepts the former, intuition-based, account is\nLocke, who claims that  \nwe have an intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence, and an\ninternal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation,\nReasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our own\nBeing. (1700: IV.ix.3)  \nA similar claim can be found in Berkeley’s Three\nDialogues (1713: 231–234; Stoneham 2002: §6.4).\nFurther, Locke makes self-consciousness partly definitive of the very\nconcept of a person, a person being “a thinking intelligent\nBeing, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it\nself, the same thinking thing in different times and places”\n(1700: II. xxvii.9; Ayers 1991: vol.II, ch.23; Thiel 2011: ch. 4), and\nself-consciousness also plays an important role in his theory of\npersonal identity (see\n §4.1). \nIf Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley can be interpreted as accepting the\nview that there is an inner perception of the self, on this question\nHume stands in stark contrast notoriously writing that whilst  \nthere are some philosophers, who imagine we are every moment\nintimately conscious of what we call our self […] For my part\nwhen I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can\ncatch myself at any time without a perception, and never can\nobserve anything but the perception. (Hume 1739–40: bk.1, ch.4,\n§6; Pitson 2002: ch. 1; Thiel 2011: ch. 12; cf.\nLichtenberg’s famous remark that one should not say “I\nthink” but rather, “it thinks”, discussed in\nZöller 1992 and Burge 1998)  \nHume’s view that there is no impression, or perception, of\noneself is crucial to his case for the understanding of our idea of\nourselves as nothing more than a “heap or collection of\ndifferent perceptions” (1739–40: bk.1, ch.4, §6;\nPenelhum 2000; G. Strawson 2011a), since lacking an impression of the\nowner of these perceptions we must, in accordance with his empiricist\naccount of concept acquisition, lack an idea of such. It is clear,\nthen, that in the early modern period issues of self-consciousness\nplay an important role in a variety of philosophical questions\nregarding persons and their minds. \nHume’s denial that there is an inner perception of the self as\nthe owner of experience is one that is echoed in Kant’s\ndiscussion in both the Transcendental Deduction and the Paralogisms,\nwhere he writes that there is no intuition of the self “through\nwhich it is given as object” (Kant 1781/1787: B408; Brook 1994;\nAmeriks 1982 [2000]). Kant’s account of self-consciousness and\nits significance is complex, a central element of the Transcendental\nDeduction being the claim that a form of\nself-awareness—transcendental apperception—is required to\naccount for the unity of conscious experience over time. In\nKant’s words, “the ‘I think’ must be able to\naccompany all my representations” (Kant 1781/1787: B132; Keller\n1998; Kitcher 2011; see the entry on\n Kant’s view of the mind and consciousness of self).\n Thus, while Kant denies that there is an inner awareness of the self\nas an object that owns its experiences, we must nevertheless be aware\nof those experiences as things that are, both individually and\ncollectively, our own. The representation of the self in this “I\nthink” is then, according to Kant, purely formal, exhausted by\nits function in unifying experience. \nThe Kantian account of self-awareness and its relation to the capacity\nfor objective thought set the agenda for a great deal of post-Kantian\nphilosophy. On the nature of self-awareness, for example, in an\nunpublished manuscript Schopenhauer concurs with Kant, asserting that,\n“that the subject should become an object for itself is the most\nmonstrous contradiction ever thought of” (quoted in Janaway\n1989: 120). Further, a philosophical tradition stemming from\nKant’s work has tried to identify the necessary conditions of\nthe possibility of self-consciousness, with P.F. Strawson (1959,\n1966), Evans (1980, 1982), and Cassam (1997), for example, exploring\nthe relation between the capacity for self-conscious thought and the\npossession of a conception of oneself as an embodied agent located\nwithin an objective world (see\n §4.3).\n Another, related tradition has argued that an awareness of subjects\nother than oneself is a necessary condition of self-consciousness (see\n §4.4).\n Historical variations on such a view can be found in Fichte\n(1794–1795; Wood 2006), Hegel (1807; Pippin 2010), and, from a\nsomewhat different perspective, Mead (1934; Aboulafia 1986). \nFichte offers the most influential account of self-consciousness in\nthe post-Kantian tradition. On the reading of the “Heidelberg\nSchool”, Fichte claims that previous accounts of\nself-consciousness given by Descartes, Locke, and even Kant are\n“reflective”, regarding the self as taking itself not as\nsubject but as object (Henrich 1967; Tugendhat 1979: ch. 3; Frank\n2004; Zahavi 2007). But this reflective form of self-awareness, Fichte\nargues, presupposes a more primitive form since it is necessary for\nthe reflecting self to be aware that the reflected self is in fact\nitself. Consequently, according to Fichte, we must possess an\nimmediate acquaintance with ourselves, “the self exists and\nposits its own existence by virtue of merely existing” (Fichte\n1794–1795: 97). Once more, this debate echoes ancient\ndiscussions concerning the nature and role of self-consciousness. \nIn the early twentieth century, Frege suggests a form of\nself-acquaintance, claiming that “everyone is presented to\nhimself in a special and primitive way” (Frege 1918–1919:\n333). In a similar vein, in early work Russell (1910) favours the idea\nthat we are acquainted with ourselves, but by the 1920s (1921: 141) he\nseems to endorse a view more in line with Hume’s sceptical\naccount. The same can be said of the Wittgenstein of the\nTractatus, who famously likens the self to the eye which sees\nbut does not see itself (Wittgenstein 1921: 5.6–5.641;\nO’Brien 1996; Sullivan 1996). Husserl’s philosophical\ndevelopment seems to have taken the opposite trajectory to that of\nRussell, with his (1900/1901, Investigation V, §8) denial of the\ninner awareness of a “pure ego” being subsequently revised\ninto something resembling Kantian transcendental apperception (Husserl\n1913: §57; Carr 1999: ch. 3; Zahavi 2005: ch. 2). Continuing with\nthe phenomenological tradition, Sartre (1937; Priest 2000) takes\nHusserl’s later view to task, arguing against the view that we\nare continually aware of a transcendent ego, yet in favour of the\npicture of consciousness as involving a “pre-reflective”\nawareness of itself reminiscent of the Heidelberg School view (Wider\n1997: ch. 3; Miguens, Preyer, & Morando 2016). Questions about the\nnature of self-consciousness and, in particular, over whether there is\nan immediate, or intuitive, consciousness of the self, were as lively\nas ever well into the twentieth century. \nOne natural way to think of self-consciousness is in terms of a\nsubject’s capacity to entertain conscious thought about herself.\nSelf-conscious thoughts are thoughts about oneself. But it is commonly\npointed out that thinking about what merely happens to be oneself is\ninsufficient for self-consciousness, rather one must think of oneself\nas oneself. If one is capable of self-conscious thought, that\nis, one must be able to think in such a way that it is manifest to one\nthat it is oneself about whom one is thinking. \nIt is widely recognised that the paradigmatic linguistic expression of\nself-consciousness in English is the first-person pronoun\n“I”; a term with which one might be said to refer to\noneself as oneself (Sainsbury 2011). Plausibly, every\nutterance of a sentence containing “I” is expressive of a\nself-conscious “I-thought”, that is a thought containing\nthe first-person concept. Thus, discussions of self-consciousness are\noften closely associated with accounts of the semantics of the\nindexical term “I” and the nature of its counterpart\nfirst-person concept (e.g., Anscombe 1975; Perry 1979; Nozick 1981:\nch. 1, §2; Evans 1982: ch. 7; Mellor 1989; O’Brien 1995a;\nCastañeda 1999; de Gaynesford 2006; Recanati 2007; Rödl\n2007: ch. 1; Bermúdez 2016). \nAs Castañeda (1966; cf. Anscombe 1975) points out, there is an\nambiguity in certain ascriptions of belief containing “he”\nor “she”. I may say “Jane believes that she is\nF” without implying that Jane realises that it is\nherself that she believes to be F. That is, there is a\nreading of “Jane believes that she is F” that does\nnot imply self-consciousness on Jane’s part. But, in some cases,\nwe do intend to attribute self-consciousness with that same form of\nwords. To resolve this ambiguity, Castañeda introduces\n“she*” for self-conscious attributions. I will use the\nmore natural indirect reflexive “she herself”.\nThus, “Jane believes that she is F” does not imply\nthat Jane self-consciously believes that she is F, whilst\n“Jane believes that she herself is F” does. Before\nthe dreadful revelation, Oedipus believed that he was prophesied to\nkill his father, but did not believe that he himself was so\nprophesied. \nFirst-personal language and thought is commonly taken to be sui\ngeneris, irreducible to language or thought not containing the\nfirst-person pronoun or corresponding concept (Castañeda 1966,\n1967; Perry 1977, 1979, 2001). Arguments for this view have typically\nappealed to the essential role seemingly played by the first-person in\nexplanations of action. This point is supported by a number of\nwell-known examples. Consider Perry’s case of the messy\nshopper, \nI once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my\ncart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle\non the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he\nwas making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became\nthicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I\nwas the shopper I was trying to catch. (Perry 1979: 33) \nAs Perry points out, he knew all along that the shopper with the torn\nsack was making a mess. He may also have believed that the oldest\nphilosopher in the shop (in fact himself) was making a mess, yet\nfailed to check his own cart since he falsely believed that Quine was\nat the Deli Counter. Indeed, it seems that for any non-indexical term\na that denotes Perry, it is possible for Perry to fail to\nbelieve anything naturally expressed by the sentence “I am\na”. If so, it is possible for Perry to rationally believe\nthat a is making a mess without believing anything that he\nwould express as “I am making a mess”. It was only when\nPerry came to believe that he himself was making a mess that\nhe stopped the chase. Indeed, it would seem that only the\nfirst-personal content can provide an adequate explanation of\nPerry’s behaviour when he stops. If Perry had come to believe\nthat John Perry is making a mess then, unless he also believed that he\nhimself was John Perry, he would not have stopped. The first-personal\ncontent is “self-locating”, thereby enabling action,\nwhereas the non-first-personal content is not. To use Kaplan’s\n(1977) example, if I believe that my pants are on fire, pure\nself-interest will surely motivate me do something about it. If,\nhowever, I believe that Smith’s pants are on fire, pure\nself-interest will only so motivate me if I also believe that I am\nSmith. \nOn this widely accepted picture, then, first-personal thought and\nlanguage is irreducible to non-first-personal thought and language,\nand is essential to the explanation of action (Kaplan 1977: 533; D.\nLewis 1979; McGinn 1983: ch. 6; Recanati 2007: ch. 34; Musholt 2015:\nch. 1; Prosser 2015; García-Carpintero & Torre 2016).\nImportantly, on Perry’s view, what is irreducible is the\nfirst-personal way of thinking about ourselves, not the facts or\nstates of affairs that make such thoughts true. So, whilst my belief\n“I am F” is not equivalent to any\nnon-first-personal belief, it is true if and only if Smith is\nF, this being the same fact that makes true the\nnon-first-personal “Smith is F”. Thus, whilst\nfirst-person representations are special, a special class of\nfirst-person facts are nowhere to be found (for views that do accept\nthe existence of first-personal facts, see McGinn 1983; Baker 2013;\nalso see Nagel 1986). \nPerry (1977, 1979) argues that terms such as “I” which\nare, as he puts it, “essentially indexical”, pose a\nproblem for the traditional Fregean view of belief as a two-place\nrelation between a subject and a proposition (cf. Spencer 2007).\nFregean senses are, according to Perry, descriptive and as Perry has\nargued no description is equivalent to an essential indexical.\nConsequently, no Fregean proposition can be the thing believed when\none believes first-personally. Essential indexicality, if somehow\nforced into the Fregean mould, means that we must implausibly accept\nthat there are incommunicable senses that only the speaker (or\nthinker) is in a position to grasp (see García-Carpintero &\nTorre 2016); cf.Evans 1981; Longworth 2013). D. Lewis goes further\nthan this, arguing, partly on the basis of his much discussed Two Gods\nexample (1979), in which each God knows all the propositions true at\ntheir world yet fails to know which of the two Gods he\nhimself is, that the objects of belief are not propositions at\nall but rather properties (or centred worlds). That is, since they\nalready know all the true propositions, there is no true proposition\nthe Gods would come to believe when they come to realise which God\nthey are. Essential indexicality forces us away from the model of\npropositions as the objects of belief. Further, Lewis claims that not\njust the explicitly indexical cases, but all belief is in\nthis way self-locating or, in his terminology, de se. On this\naccount, every belief involves the self-ascription of a property and\nso, arguably, is an instance of self-consciousness (for discussion,\nGennaro 1996: ch. 8; Stalnaker 2008: ch. 3; Feit 2008; Cappelen &\nDever 2013: ch. 5; Magidor 2015). \nArguments such as Perry’s might be challenged on the grounds\nthat it is not possible to rationally doubt that one is the\nsubject of these conscious states, where that formulation\ninvolves an “introspective demonstrative” picking out\none’s current conscious states. This, it might be claimed,\nconstitutes a reduction of first-person content (cf. Peacocke 1983:\nch. 5, although his goal is not reductive). Even if it is true,\nhowever, that one cannot doubt that one is the subject of\nthese conscious states, it is not clear that this poses a\nsignificant challenge to Perry’s argument for the essential\nindexicality of the first-person. For one thing, the content itself\ncontains a demonstrative, so indexical, element. Second, it has been\nargued that our capacity to refer to our own experiences itself\ndepends on our capacity to refer to ourselves as ourselves (P.F.\nStrawson 1959: 97; Evans 1982: 253). That is, to think of these\nconscious states is to think of them as these conscious\nstates of mine. If to demonstratively think of one’s\nconscious state is, necessarily, to think of it as\none’s own conscious state, then the purported reduction of\nfirst-person thought to thought not containing the first-person will\nfail. \nCappelen and Dever (2013) present a sustained attack on the\nconstellation of philosophical claims surrounding the “essential\nindexical”, including its purported relation to action, and both\nPerry’s and Lewis’s arguments for it (for an alternative\nobjections to Perry and Lewis, see Millikan 1990; Magidor 2015). A\ncentral element in their critique is the claim that cases, such as\nPerry’s shopper, that are often thought to show the special\nconnection between self-consciousness (I-thoughts) and the capacity\nfor action really only show that action explanation contexts do not\nallow for substitution salva veritate, but rather are opaque\n(Cappelen & Dever 2013: ch. 3). Just as, if I am at the airport\nwaiting for Jones, I will only signal that man if I believe\nhim to be Jones, so if I am looking for the shopper with the torn sack\nI will only stop when I believe that I am that shopper. On\ntheir view, despite the popularity of the view to the contrary, the\ncapacity for self-consciousness does not possess any philosophically\ndeep relation to the capacity for action. See the supplement: \nScepticism About Essential Indexicality and Agency. \nBecause of its connection with the first-person pronoun, it is often\ntaken as platitudinous to say that self-conscious thought is closely\nassociated with the capacity to refer to oneself as oneself.\nWhen I think self-consciously, I cannot fail to refer to myself. More\nthan this, it has often been claimed that for a central class of\nfirst-person thoughts, there is no possibility of misidentifying\nmyself: not only can I not fail to pick myself out, I cannot take\nanother person to be me. But first-person reference, and indexicality\nmore generally, has sometimes been thought to pose a challenge to\ntheories of reference, requiring special treatment. Indeed, some have\nargued that the platitude itself should be rejected. \nTerms whose function it is to refer can, on occasion, fail in that\nfunction. A use of the term “Vulcan” to refer to the\nplanet orbiting between Mercury and the sun, fails to refer to\nanything for the reason that there is nothing for it to refer to. If I\nsee the head of one dachshund protruding from behind a tree and the\nrear end of another protruding from the other side of the tree, and\nutter “that dog is huge”, my use of “that dog”\nhas arguably failed to refer due to there being too many objects. It\nwould seem that, by contrast, the term “I” cannot fail to\nrefer either by there being too few or too many objects.\n“I” is guaranteed to refer. \nAs an indexical, the referent of “I” varies with the\ncontext of utterance (see the entry on\n indexicals).\n That is, “I” refers to different people depending on who\nutters it. Following Kaplan (1977), it is common to think of the\nmeaning of such terms as determining a function from context to\nreferent. In the case of “I”, a natural proposal is the\n“Self-Reference Rule” (SRR), that the referent of a token\nof “I” is the person that produces it (Kaplan 1977: 491;\nCampbell 1994: ch. 3). “I” is thus, unlike\n“this” or “that”, a pure indexical, seemingly\nrequiring no overt demonstration or manifestation of intention (Kaplan\n1977: 489–91). SRR captures the plausible thought that\n“I” is guaranteed against reference failure. Since every\ntoken of “I” has been produced, the fact that\n“I” refers to its producer means that there is no chance\nof its failing to pick out some entity. This account of\n“I”, then, treats it as not only expressive of\nself-consciousness, but also guaranteed to refer to the utterer. \nSRR is Kaplan’s specification of the character of\n“I”, which is fixed independently of the context of any\nparticular utterance. This character is to be distinguished from the\ncontent of a tokening of “I”, which it has only\nin a context. On Kaplan’s account, the content of an utterance\nof “I am F” will be a singular proposition composed\nof the person that produced it and Fness (Recanati 1993; for an\naccount that attributes to the utterance both singular content, and\nthe “reflexive content” the speaker of this token is\nF, see Perry 2001; for an alternative “Neo-Fregean”\naccount in terms of object-dependent de re senses, see Evans\n1981; cf. McDowell 1977; and Evans 1982: ch. 1). \nIntuitively plausible as it is, SRR is open to a number of potential\ncounterexamples. Suppose, for example, that you are away from work due\nto illness and I leave a note on your door reading “I am not\nhere now”. Plausibly, whilst it was me that produced this token\nof “I”, it nevertheless refers to you. Or\nconsider a situation in which I walk into a petrol station, point to\nmy car, and say “I’m empty”. In this case, it might\nbe suggested, my use of “I” refers to my car rather than\nmyself (for these and related cases, see Vision 1985; Q. Smith 1989;\nSidelle 1991; Nunberg 1993, 1995). If so, SRR cannot specify the\ncharacter of “I” and so, arguably, some tokens of\n“I” fail to express the self-conscious thoughts of those\nthat produce them. In light of such cases, a variety of alternatives\nto SRR have been proposed. Q. Smith (1989) suggests that\n“I” is lexically ambiguous; Predelli (1998a,b, 2002)\noffers an intention-based reference rule for “I”; Corazza,\nFish, and Gorvett (2002) offer a convention-based account; and Cohen\n(2013) argues that the cases can be handled by a conservative\nmodification of Kaplan’s original proposal (also see,\nRomdenh-Romluc 2002, 2008; Corazza 2004: ch. 5; Dodd & Sweeney\n2010; Michaelson 2014). \nAlthough she didn’t have Kaplan’s formulation of SRR in\nmind, an earlier criticism of such a rule can be found in the work of\nAnscombe (1975) who argues that the rule cannot be complete as an\naccount of the meaning of “I” (for discussion see\nO’Brien 1994). Anscombe considers a world in which each person\nhas two names, one of which (ranging from “B” to\n“Z”) is printed on their chest, the other (in every case\n“A”) is printed on the inside of their wrist. Each person\nuses “B” to “Z” when attributing actions to\nothers, but “A” when describing their own actions\n(Anscombe 1975: 49). Anscombe argues that such a situation is\ncompatible with the possibility that the people in question lack\nself-consciousness. Whilst B uses “A” to refer to B, C\nuses “A” to refer to C, and so on, there is no guarantee\nthat they are thinking of themselves as themselves, for they\nmay be reporting what are in fact their own actions without thinking\nof those actions as things that they themselves are\nperforming. They may treat themselves, that is, just as the treat any\nother. This is despite the fact that, in this scenario,\n“A” complies with SRR. \nCan the Self-Reference Rule be reformulated in such a way as to entail\nself-consciousness on the part of those who use terms that comply with\nit? According to Anscombe it can, but any such reformulation will\npresuppose a prior grasp of self-conscious reference to oneself. For\nexample, if we say, employing the indirect reflexive, that\n“I” is a term that a person uses to refer to she\nherself, we have travelled in a tight circle since “she\nherself” can be understood only in terms of “I”\n(Anscombe 1975; Castañeda 1966; for discussion, see\nBermúdez 1998: ch. 1). This can be seen clearly in the\nfirst-person formulation of such a rule: “I” is a term\nthat I use to refer to myself. For here the\n“myself” must itself be understood as an expression of\nself-consciousness, i.e., we should really say that “I” is\na term that I use to refer to myself as myself. \nIn response to Anscombe’s argument, it has been argued that SRR\nis not intended to explain the connection between self-consciousness\nand the first-person (O’Brien 1994, 1995a; Garrett 1998: ch. 7;\ncf. Campbell 1994: §4.2; Peacocke 2008: §3.1). On this view,\nall that the example of “A” users shows is that\nself-consciousness has not been fully accounted for by SRR, not that\nSRR fails as an account of the character of “I”. Kaplan\nhimself, however, does appear to be more ambitious than this, claiming\nthat the “particular and primitive way” in which each of\nus is presented to ourselves is simply that each “is presented\nto himself under the character of \"I\"” (Kaplan 1977: 533). This\nclaim, it would seem, is indeed open to Anscombe’s\nchallenge. \nAnscombe’s (1975) paper is perhaps most notable for her claim\nthat “I” is not a referring expression at all. Assuming\nthat if “I” refers it must be understood on the model of\neither a proper name, a demonstrative, or an abbreviation of a\ndefinite description, Anscombe argues that each of these kinds of\nreferring expression requires what she calls a\n“conception” by means of which it reaches its referent.\nThis conception must explain the seemingly guaranteed reference of\n“I”: the apparent fact that no token of “I”\ncan fail to pick out an object. However, she argues, no satisfactory\nconception can be specified for “I” since either it fails\nto deliver up guaranteed reference, or it succeeds but only by\ndelivering an immaterial soul. Since we have independent reason to\nbelieve that there are no immaterial souls, it follows that\n“I” cannot be understood on the model of a proper name,\ndemonstrative or definite description, so is not a referring\nexpression (see Kenny 1979 and Malcolm 1979 for positive appraisals of\nAnscombe’s position. Criticisms can be found in White 1979;\nHamilton 1991; Brandom 1994: 552–561; Glock & Hacker 1996;\nMcDowell 1998; Harcourt 2000). \nThat “I” does not function as either a name or an\nabbreviated definite description is widely accepted. The more\ncontentious aspect of Anscombe’s case for the view that there is\nno appropriate conception for “I” is her claim that\n“I” does not function like a demonstrative. Her argument\nfor this claim is highly reminiscent of Avicenna’s Flying Man\nargument (see\n §1.1),\n with which she was surely familiar. We can, she tells us, imagine a\nsubject in a sensory deprivation tank who has been anaesthetised and\nis suffering from amnesia. Such a subject would, claims Anscombe, be\nable to think I-thoughts, perhaps wondering, “How did I get into\nthis mess?”. Since such a subject can think self-consciously in\nthe absence of any presented referent, it follows that “I”\ncannot mean something like “this person”, since\ndemonstratives require the demonstrated object to be presented to\nconscious awareness. Treating “I” on a demonstrative\nmodel, then, fails (cf. Campbell 1994: §4.2; O’Brien 1995b;\nsee Morgan 2015 for a defence of a demonstrative account). \nAccording to Evans (1982: ch. 7), the problem with Anscombe’s\nargument is that it fails to appreciate that “I” can be\nmodelled on “here” rather than “this”.\nAccording to Evans’ account, the similarity between what he\ncalls “I”-Ideas and “here”-Ideas shows up in\ntheir functional role (for an alternative broadly functional account,\nsee Mellor 1989; for an argument that, far from being amenable to a\nfunctional analysis, self-consciousness poses a threat to the\ncoherence of functionalism, see Bealer 1997). Once we see how both\n“I”-Ideas and “here”-Ideas stand at the centre\nof distinctive networks of inputs (ways of gaining information about\nourselves and our locations respectively) and outputs (including the\nexplanation of action), we can see how to model “I” on\n“here”, thus escaping Anscombe’s argument. For\nfurther discussion, see the supplement:\n Evans on First Person Thought. \nIn The Blue and Brown Books, Wittgenstein distinguishes\nbetween two uses of the term “I” which he calls the\n“use as subject” and the “use as object”\n(1958: 66–70; Garrett 1998: ch. 8; cf. James’ distinction\nbetween the I, or pure ego, and the me, or empirical\nself (1890: vol. 1, ch. X)). As Wittgenstein describes the difference,\nthere is a certain kind of error in thought that is possible when\n“I” is used as object but not when “I” is used\nas subject. Wittgenstein notes that if I find myself in a tangle of\nbodies, I may wrongly take another’s visibly broken arm to be my\nown, mistakenly judging “I have a broken arm”. Upon seeing\na broken arm, then, it can make sense to wonder whether or not it is\nmine. If, however, I feel a pain in the arm, and on that basis judge\n“I have a pain”, then it makes no sense at all for me to\nwonder whether the pain of which I am aware is mine. That is, it is\nnot possible for me to be aware, in the ordinary way, of a pain in an\narm but mistakenly judge it to be my own arm that hurts. On this\npicture, self-ascriptions of pain, at least when based on the usual\nintrospective grounds, involve the use of “I” as\nsubject and so are immune to this sort of error of\nmisidentification. \nImmunity to this sort of error should not be conflated with another\nsort of epistemic security that is often discussed under the heading\nof self-knowledge (see entry on\n self-knowledge).\n Some philosophers have held that, for a range of mental states, one\ncannot be mistaken about whether one is in them. Thus, for example, if\none sincerely judges that one has a pain, or that one believes that P,\nthen it cannot turn out that one is not in pain, or that one does not\nso believe. That the kind of immunity to error described by\nWittgenstein differs from this sort of epistemic security follows from\nthe fact that one may be sceptical of the latter while accepting the\nformer. That is, one may reject the claim that sincere judgements that\none has a pain cannot be mistaken (perhaps it is possible to mistake a\nsensation of coldness for one of pain), whilst nevertheless\nmaintaining that if one is introspectively aware of a pain, then that\npain must be one’s own. Immunity to errors of this sort has been\ntaken, by a number of philosophers, to be importantly connected to\nself-consciousness. \nUnder the influence of Shoemaker (1968) this phenomenon has become\nknown as immunity to error through misidentification relative to the\nfirst-person pronoun, or IEM. On Shoemaker’s formulation, an\nerror of misidentification occurs when one knows some particular\nthing, a, to be F and judges that b is F\non the grounds that one mistakenly believes that a is identical\nto b. To this it is important to add that IEM is not a feature\nthat judgements possess in virtue of their content alone but only\nrelative to certain grounds (perception, testimony,\n introspection,\n memory, etc.). Thus, the judgement that I \nam jealous of a\nmight be IEM when grounded in introspection, but not when grounded in\nthe overheard testimony of my analyst. For I may have misinterpreted\nmy analyst’s words, wrongly taking his use of\n“Smith” in “Smith is Jealous of a” to\nrefer to me (“Smith” after all is a common name). IEM is\nalways relative, then, to the grounds on which a judgement is based.\nWhich grounds might give rise to first-person judgements that are IEM\nis a contested matter, see the supplement:\n The Scope of Immunity to Error Through Misidentification. \nOn this account, first-person thoughts will be IEM relative to certain\ngrounds just in case errors of misidentification are not possible with\nrespect to them. That is, they will be IEM relative to grounds\nG if and only if it is not possible that one knows,\nvia G, some particular thing, a, to be F\nand judges oneself to be F in virtue of mistakenly believing\nthat a is identical to oneself. Whilst precise formulations\ndiffer in various ways, this can reasonably be thought of as the\nstandard account of IEM (see, for example, Shoemaker 1968, 1970, 1986,\n2012; Brewer 1995; Bermúdez 1998: §1.2; Peacocke 1999: ch.\n6; 2008: §3.2; 2014: §5.1; Coliva 2006; Recanati 2007: part\n6; Perry 2012; most of the papers in Prosser & Recanati 2012;\nMusholt 2015: ch. 1). \nAn alternative way of formulating IEM can be found in the work of\nvariety of philosophers. On this view, a judgement “a is\nF” is IEM if and only if it is not possible to undercut\none’s evidence for judging that a is F without\nthereby undercutting one’s evidence that someone is\nF (for variations on this idea, see Hamilton 1995; Wright 1998;\nPryor 1999; Campbell 1999a; 2002: ch. 5; for discussion see Coliva\n2006; Joel Smith 2006a; McGlynn 2016). As Wright puts it, a claim  \nmade on a certain kind of ground involves immunity to error through\nmisidentification just when its defeat is not consistent with\nretention of grounds for existential generalization. (1998: 19)  \nThe idea is that, for a wide range of judgements it is possible that\none knows that something is F but wrongly supposes that\na is F. That is, one has misidentified which thing is F.\nFor other judgements, perhaps including the introspection based\njudgement that one has a headache, this sort of identification error\nis not possible. After Pryor’s (1999) influential discussion,\nthis is typically known as immunity to\nwhich-misidentification, or wh-IEM. \nThat wh-IEM is a distinct phenomenon from IEM as it is standardly\nformulated is shown by the fact one may consistently claim that a form\nof experience, for example memory, does not put one in a position to\nthink, of some a distinct from oneself, that a was\nF, yet nevertheless does put one in a position to think that\nsomeone was F. That is, it might give rise to\njudgements that are IEM but not wh-IEM. The converse,\nhowever, is not possible. For since “a was\nF” entails “someone was F”,\nit will not be possible for a judgement, relative to some grounds, to\nbe wh-IEM without it also being IEM. If a judgement is based\non an identification, it will be subject to errors of\nwh-misidentification. For this reason, wh-IEM might\nlegitimately be considered the more fundamental notion (as it is by\nPryor 1999). \nWhat is the philosophical significance of IEM? First, consider what it\nwould take for a form of experience to ground thoughts that are IEM.\nSuppose that a form of experience, introspection for example, itself\nhas first-personal content. That is, suppose that the content of\nintrospective awareness is not adequately conceptualised as\npain but rather requires the first-personal form, my\npain. If so, then there would be no need for an identification of\nsome object as oneself, for the identity of the subject of pain is\nalready given as oneself. On this way of thinking, to determine which\nforms of experience ground judgements that are IEM would be to\ndetermine which forms of experience have first-personal content. And\nthat, according to some philosophers, is to determine which forms of\nexperience are themselves forms of self-consciousness (see, for\nexample, Bermúdez 1998: 144). This issue is further discussed\nin\n §3. \nSecond, Wittgenstein suggests that the phenomenon of IEM is\nresponsible for the (in his view, mistaken) opinion that the use of\n“I” as subject refers to an immaterial soul (1958: 66).\nThis is for the reason that one may be tempted to suppose that if\nintrospectively based self-ascriptions of psychological predicates do\nnot rely on an identification of a bodily entity, they must rely on\nthe identification of a non-bodily entity (1958: 70; for related\ndiscussion, see Peacocke 1999: ch. 6; Coliva 2012).\nWittgenstein’s view, of course, is that they rely on no\nidentification at all. As Evans puts it, they are identification-free.\nEssentially the same point is made by Strawson in his diagnosis of\n“the fact that lies at the root of the Cartesian\nillusion”, which is that “criterionless”\nself-ascription gives rise to the idea of a “purely inner and\nyet subject-referring use for ‘I’” (P.F. Strawson\n1966: 164–166). In short, the fact that a certain class of\nfirst-person thoughts depend for their reference on no identification\nof myself as some publicly presented object (they are\nidentification-free) gives rise to the idea that they pick out a\nprivate object, a soul. There is a clear connection between this idea\nand Anscombe’s (1975) argument for the non-referential character\nof “I”.  \nSome philosophers maintain that, in addition to its manifestation in\nfirst-personal thinking, self-consciousness is also present in various\nforms of sensory and non-sensory experience (Bermúdez 1998;\nHurley 1998: ch. 4; Zahavi 2005; Peacocke 2014; Musholt 2015). After\nall, self-consciousness is presumably a form of consciousness (see\nentry on\n consciousness).\n On the view that experience, like thought, has representational\ncontent, this can be understood as the view that experiences, like\nthoughts, can have content that is first-personal. On the further view\nthat the content of experience is non-conceptual (see the entry on\n non-conceptual\n mental content), the claim is that there is non-conceptual\nfirst-person content (for a conceptualist response, see Noë\n2002). Bermúdez also argues that there is a non-conceptual form\nof self-conscious thinking that arises from non-conceptual\nself-conscious experience, which he calls “protobelief”\n(Bermúdez 1998: ch. 5; cf. Bermúdez 2003). \nThe claim that there is a form of self-consciousness in experience,\none which arguably grounds the capacity to entertain first-personal\nthought, can be understood in a number of ways. According to one view\nthere is a perceptual, or quasi-perceptual, consciousness of the self\nas an object of experience. On another, there is a\n“pre-reflective” form of self-consciousness that does not\ninvolve the awareness of the self as an object. A third claims that\nvarious forms of experience involve a distinctive “sense of\nownership” in which each of us is aware of our own states as\nour own. In each case, the question is whether the mode of\nexperience in question can, in Peacocke’s (2014: ch. 4) words,\nact as the “non-conceptual parent” of the first-person\nconcept and associated phenomena, in particular that of immunity to\nerror through misidentification. \nIt is natural to suppose that self-consciousness is, fundamentally, a\nconscious awareness of the self. On such a view, one is self-conscious\nif, when one introspects, one is aware of a thing that is, in some\nsense, presented as oneself. This is the view, mentioned in\n §1.2,\n that Hume seems to be rejecting with his claim that when he\nintrospects he can never catch himself, but only perceptions (Hume\n1739–40: bk. 1, ch. 4, §6). Whilst Hume’s claim has\nbeen very influential, it has not found universal acceptance. Those\nsiding with Hume include Shoemaker (1986), Martin (1997), Howell\n(2010), and Prinz (2012) (for a related, Jamesian perspective, see\nFlanagan 1992: ch. 9). Those opposing him include Chisholm (1976: ch.\n1), Cassam (1995), G. Strawson (2009), Damasio (2010) and Rosenthal\n(2012). \nAs with first-person thought, the issue is not whether one is, or can\nbe, conscious of what is in fact oneself. If that were sufficient for\nself-consciousness then, on the supposition that one is identical to\none’s body, seeing oneself in a mirror would be a case of\nself-consciousness, even if one were unaware that it was oneself that\none saw. Rather, the issue is whether one is, or can be, conscious of\noneself as oneself, a form of awareness in which it is\nmanifest to one that the object of awareness is oneself. If there is\nsuch an awareness then this is philosophically significant, since one\nmight expect it to ground certain cases of self-knowledge,\nfirst-person reference, and the immunity to error of certain\nfirst-person thoughts (Shoemaker 1986; see the entry on\n self-knowledge).\n The inner consciousness of the self as F, for example, would\naccount for one’s capacity to refer to oneself as\noneself, one’s knowledge that one is F, and the fact\nthat such a thought cannot rest on a misidentification of another\nthing as oneself. On the other hand, the claim that there is\nno such conscious awareness of the self is philosophically\nsignificant, not only because it undermines the possibility of such\nexplanations but also for the reason that it plays an important role\nin various well known arguments: for example, in Kant’s\nFirst Critique (1781/1787), most obviously the Transcendental\nDeduction, the Refutation of Idealism, and the Paralogisms, and in\nWittgenstein’s discussion of the conceptual problem of other\nminds (Kripke 1982: Postscript). \nA simple argument for the claim that we are introspectively aware of\nourselves is that in introspection one is perceptually aware of\none’s own mental properties, and that when one perceives a\nproperty one perceives that which has that property, i.e., oneself.\nShoemaker (1984b, 1986) agrees that if there is an\nintrospective awareness of the self as an object, then it should be\nunderstood as a form of self-perception. He argues, however,\nthat, on a plausible account of perception, introspection is not a\nform of perception, so we do not introspectively perceive\nanything, including the self. As such, we cannot conclude in this way\nthat we are introspectively aware of the self (cf. Martin 1997;\nRosenthal 2012). \nShoemaker further argues, in a way reminiscent of the Heidelberg\nSchool (Frank 1995; Musholt 2015: ch. 1), that the postulation of an\nintrospective awareness of the self as the self would not be\nin a position to explain all self-knowledge. According to Shoemaker\n(1984b: 105), if inner perception revealed an object to be F,\nthen I would only be in a position to judge that I am F if I\nalready took myself to be that object that I perceive. But this both\npresupposes some (non-perceptual) self-knowledge (i.e., that I am the\nthing perceived via inner sense), and also implausibly opens\nup introspection based first-person thought to the possibility of\nerrors of misidentification, since such a view would entail that\nintrospective self-knowledge is based in part on an identification of\nthe self. \nA number of philosophers have maintained that, even if Hume is right\nthat introspection does not reveal the self as an object, there is\nanother form of perceptual experience which does:\n bodily awareness (see entry).\n Versions of this claim can be found in P.F. Strawson (1966: 102),\nEvans (1982: ch. 7), Sutton Morris (1982), Ayers (1991), Brewer\n(1995), Cassam (1995, 1997), Bermúdez (1998, 2011). On this\nview, through bodily awareness I am aware of my body “from the\ninside” as a bodily self, as me. Brewer (1995), for\nexample, argues that since bodily sensations are both manifestly\nproperties of oneself and are perceived as located properties of\none’s body, it follows that in bodily awareness one perceives\none’s body as oneself. \nIf one’s body is presented as oneself in bodily awareness then,\nas mentioned above, we might expect this bodily self-perception to\nground first-person thought about one’s bodily states. As\npointed out in\n §2,\n it is plausible that first-person thoughts cannot fail to refer to\ntheir thinker and further that this is manifest in the thinking of\nthem. Martin (1995, 1997) argues on the basis of these two claims that\nif bodily awareness is a form of self-awareness, then one’s body\nas presented in bodily awareness must manifestly be oneself. That is,\nif a form of awareness is to ground judgements which are manifestly\nabout myself, then that form of awareness must manifestly be an\nawareness of myself. But this is arguably a condition that it does not\nmeet, since it is perfectly coherent to wonder whether or not one is\nidentical to one’s body, just as Descartes famously did in the\nMeditations (for a different, imagination-based, argument\nagainst bodily awareness as a form of self-awareness, see Joel Smith\n2006b; see Bermúdez 2011 for a response; for discussions of the\nrelation between self-consciousness and imagination see B. Williams\n1973; Reynolds 1989; Velleman 1996). \nAnother way in which it can be argued that the self figures in sensory\nexperience is in the self-locating content of perceptual experience,\nmost notably vision. Visual experience is perspectival, containing\ninformation not only about perceived objects but also of their spatial\nrelation to the perceiver: I see the wall as in front of me,\nthe bookcase as to my left, and so on. The (bodily) self, it\nmight be argued, is experienced as an object in the world, the point\nof origin of egocentric perception (Cassam 1997: 52–53; Hurley\n1998: ch. 4; Bermúdez 1998: ch. 5, 2002, 2011; Peacocke 1999:\nch. 6; Schwenkler 2014). On an alternative view, one consistent with\nthe rejection of any sort of awareness of the self as an object,\nvisual perception does not present the self at its point of origin,\nbut rather represents the locations of perceived objects in monadic\nterms, as ahead, to the left, and so on, without\nspecifying what it is that they are ahead, or to the left, of\n(Campbell 1994: §4.1; 2002: §9.3; Perry 1986). \nIf first-person thought is not grounded in an awareness of the self as\nan object, then some other account is arguably required to account for\nthe capacity to entertain self-conscious thought (O’Brien\n1995a). One suggestion is that subjects possess a form of\n“pre-reflective self-awareness” as a necessary condition\nof consciousness (Sartre 1937, 1943: Introduction; Zahavi 2005, 2007;\nLegrand 2006; cf. Kriegel 2009. For criticism, see Schear 2009; also\nsee the entry on\n phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness).\n On this view, all conscious experience involves an implicit awareness\nof oneself as its subject without explicitly representing the self as\nan object of awareness (cf. Musholt’s distinction between\n“self-representationalist” and\n“non-self-representationalist” accounts of non-conceptual\nself-consciousness (2015: chs. 3–4)). Indeed, it might be argued\nthat the necessity of an active agent’s possessing some form of\nself-awareness follows from the connection between action and\nself-consciousness that many suppose to have been established by\nconsiderations of the essential indexical discussed in\n §2.1\n (cf. Bermúdez 1998). \nThese views are closely associated with theories that explain\nconsciousness in terms of self-consciousness\n (§4.3).\n Pre-reflective self-awareness is “pre-reflective”,\naccording to its proponents, in the sense that it does not require one\nto explicitly reflect on one’s own mental states, or to\notherwise take them as objects of attention. Rather, pre-reflective\nself-awareness is manifest even in those situations in which\none’s attention is directed outwards toward worldly objects and\nevents. Pre-reflective self-awareness, then, is implicit in all\nconsciousness, providing one with a continuous awareness of oneself as\nthe subject of one’s stream of experience. \nOne way in which such views can be understood is as maintaining that\nexperience involves self-consciousness in the mode, rather than the\ncontent, of conscious experience (Recanati 2007: part 5; 2012;\nO’Brien 2007: ch. 6). This can be fleshed out by analogy with\nthe case of belief: one might claim that the concept of truth figures\nin the mode, but not the explicit content of every belief. That is,\nwhilst every belief is a holding true, it is not the case that every\nbelief has the content that such and such is true. Similarly, whilst\nevery experience is an experience of one’s own, it is not the\ncase that every experience has the content that such and such is\nexperienced by oneself. Rather, the mode of conscious\nexperience (introspection, bodily awareness, etc.) includes an\nimplicit awareness of the self. A related view is that the self can be\nconsidered an “unarticulated constituent” of the\nexperience, just as some claim that “here” is an\nunarticulated constituent of “It is raining” (Perry 1986;\nRecanati 2007: parts 9 & 10; for scepticism about unarticulated\nconstituents, see Cappelen & Lepore 2007). So, just as the person\nwho believes “It is raining” is implicitly aware of the\nfact that it is here that it is raining, so the subject of\nself-conscious experience is implicitly aware of the fact that it is\nshe herself who is undergoing that experience. \nAccounts of self-consciousness as involving unarticulated\nconstituents, or as implicit in the mode of consciousness, will need\nto explain how the transition is made from such implicit\nself-awareness to the explicit representation of the self in\nfirst-person thought. One option is to appeal to the idea that certain\nsources of information are self-tracking or, in Perry’s (2012)\nwords, “necessarily self-informative”. A form of\nexperience is self-tracking if it is a way of coming to know of the\ninstantiation of properties of a certain type and, necessarily, a\nsubject can come to know, in that way, of the instantiation of her own\nstates only. For example, if it is true that a subject can only\nremember conscious episodes from her own past, then episodic\nmemory is self-tracking. If so, then the subject may legitimately\nthink the first-person thought “I was F”, on the\nbasis of her episodic memory of being F. This account may also\nbe used to explain IEM, since if a form of experience is\nself-tracking, then it will not be possible for me to know, in that\nway, that a is F but mistakenly think that it is me that\nis F on the grounds that I mistakenly believe myself to be\nidentical to a (Perry 2012; Recanati 2012; cf. Campbell 1999a;\nMartin 1995). Here we have an architectural feature of a given form of\nexperience (that it is necessarily an awareness of oneself) being\nemployed in an explanation of an epistemic feature of self-ascriptions\nbased on such experience (that they are not partly grounded in an\nidentity judgement). If I know, in the relevant way, that a is\nF, then it must be the case that I am a. On this view,\nmaking a first-person judgement grounded in a given form of experience\nis a matter of articulating the unarticulated self. The experience\nitself is not explicitly first-personal, representing the self as\noneself. Nevertheless, it “concerns” the subject, in\nthat it is necessarily tied to the self (see Musholt 2015: ch. 5 for\nan alternative account). \nPre-reflective, or implicit, accounts of the place of\nself-consciousness in experience are often associated with the\nso-called “sense of ownership”, or “sense of\nmineness” (Flanagan 1992; Martin 1995; Dokic 2003; Marcel 2003;\nZahavi 2005: ch. 5; de Vignemont 2007, 2013; Tsakiris 2011; Zahavi\n& Kriegel 2015). According to some, a fundamental aspect of\nconscious experiences is that they seem, in each case, to be\nmine. In being aware of a thought, action, emotion,\nperceptual experience, memory, bodily experience (and also my body\nitself), I am aware of it as being my own. This sense of\nownership arguably does some work in explaining why it seems difficult\nto conceive of what it would be like to experience a thought as\nlocated in another’s mind, or a pain as located in\nanother’s body (Martin 1995; Dokic 2003). For such an experience\nwould involve being aware of a thought that seemed to be mine but as\nlocated in a mind that did not seem to be my own. The sense of\nownership is also a candidate for explaining immunity to error through\nmisidentification since if conscious experiences seem to be\none’s own, then there is presumably no need for any\nidentification of the experience’s subject as oneself. \nWhilst the sense of ownership would, presumably, be accounted for by\nan introspective awareness of the self, it can also arguably be\nexplained with the more minimal commitments of the implicit view. The\nsense of an experience as my own can be understood as nothing over and\nabove the fact that the self is implicitly given in the mode of\nconscious awareness (Musholt 2015: §4.2). Thus the focus on the\nsense of ownership might be thought to provide a minimal answer to\nHumean scepticism about self-perception. As Chisholm points out, for\nexample, although Hume complained that he could find no self in\nintrospection, he reported his findings in first-personal terms. That\nis, he was aware not only of his mental states, but also aware of them\nas his own (Chisholm 1976: ch. 1; cf. P.F. Strawson’s\n1959: ch. 3, attack on the “no-ownership” view). \nEven within the context of an implicit account of self-consciousness\nin experience, we can further distinguish between reductive and\nnon-reductive construals of the sense of ownership (Bermúdez\n2011; Zahavi & Kriegel 2015; Alsmith 2015). For example, Zahavi\nand Kriegel (2015; cf. Kriegel 2003, 2009; Zahavi 2014) defend a\nnon-reductive understanding of the sense of ownership as a distinct\naspect of the phenomenal character of experience. By contrast, a\nreductive account will explain the sense of ownership in terms of\ncognitive and/or experiential states whose existence we are\nindependently willing to endorse. For example, Bermúdez (2011:\n161–166) argues in favour of a reductive account of the sense of\nownership over one’s own body, according to which it consists in\nnothing more than the phenomenology of the spatial location of bodily\nsensations alongside our disposition to judge the body in which they\noccur to be our own (cf. Dainton 2008: §8.2; Prinz 2012).\nBermúdez’s argument for the reductive view is, in part,\nbased on the claim that, despite appearances, the non-reductive sense\nof ownership is not in fact able to explain first-personal judgements\nof ownership (cf. Schear 2009; for a response see Zahavi & Kriegel\n2015). \nIt is sometimes claimed that the variety of ways in which\nself-consciousness can break down poses a challenge to the claim that\nthe sense of ownership is a universal characteristic of experience\n(e.g., Metzinger 2003: §7.2.2). Thought insertion, anarchic hand,\nalien limb, anonymous memory, and anonymous vision, all seemingly\ninvolve subjects who are aware of their own conscious states, actions,\nor body parts, but without being aware of them as their own (for\nreferences, see the supplement:\n The Scope of Immunity to Error Through Misidentification).\n They may disown them or attribute them to others. For example, in\ncases of thought insertion, a symptom of schizophrenia, subjects\nreport that they are aware of the thoughts of other people or objects\nentering their own minds (see, for example, Saks 2007: ch. 2; for\ngeneral discussion of schizophrenia and self-consciousness see Parnas\n& Sass 2011). On the assumption that such subjects are actually\naware of what are, in fact, their own thoughts, this might seem to be\na case of a conscious experience that lacks the sense of ownership.\nThus, either the sense of ownership is not a necessary feature of\nexperience, or perhaps there is no sense of ownership at all (see, for\nexample, Chadha 2017). \nA common response to this line of thought involves, first,\ndistinguishing between the sense of ownership and the sense of agency\nand, second, claiming that subjects of thought insertion lack the\nlatter whilst retaining the former (Stephens & Graham 2000;\nGallagher 2004; Peacocke 2008: §7.8; Proust 2013: ch. 12). The\nsense of agency is the awareness of being the source or the agent of\nsome action or activity, including mental agency. It is the sense that\nit is me that is thinking a given thought (Bayne 2008;\nO’Brien & Soteriou 2009; Proust 2013: ch. 10). According to\nthis standard view, cases of thought insertion or anarchic hand, for\nexample, can be wholly explained by postulating a lack of a sense of\nagency. The usual sense of being the agent of a thought is lacking,\nbut the sense of ownership remains since the thought seems to the\nsubject be taking place in their own mind. \nWe might, however, wish to make a three-way distinction between the\nsense of agency (the sense that one is the author of a mental\nstate), the sense of ownership (the sense that one is the\nowner of a mental state), and what we might call the sense of\nlocation (the sense that a mental state is located within\none’s own mind). The sense of location might be understood as\nbeing possessed if one is aware of a mental state in the ordinary way,\ni.e., introspectively. Crucial, it would seem, for evaluating the\nsignificance of thought insertion and related cases, and so of the\nstandard view, will be determining which, if any, of the senses of\nagency, ownership, or location remain intact. For it might be argued\nthat what such subjects retain is in fact the sense of location,\nrather than the sense of ownership. That is, it may be possible to\ntake their descriptions at face value when they deny, in thought\ninsertion for example, that the thoughts in question are their own (or\nwere thought by them), whilst nevertheless accepting that the inserted\nthought occurs within the boundary of their own mind (for criticisms\nof the standard view, see Bortolotti & Broome 2009; Pacherie &\nMartin 2013; Fernández 2013: ch. 5; Billon 2013). \nMuch of the philosophical work on self-consciousness concerns its\nrelation to a variety of other phenomena. These include the nature of\npersonhood, rationality, consciousness, and the awareness of other\nminds. In each case we can ask whether self-consciousness is a\nnecessary and/or sufficient condition for the phenomenon in\nquestion. \nAs was mentioned in\n §1.2,\n Locke characterises a person as “a thinking intelligent Being,\nthat has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it self,\nthe same thinking thing in different times and places” (1700:\nII.xxvii.9). On such a view, self-consciousness is essential to\npersonhood. In particular, on Locke’s view it is the capacity to\nreidentify oneself at different times that is important, a claim which\nis in keeping with the central role of memory in his account of\npersonal identity (see Ayers 1991: vol. II, chs. 22–25; Thiel\n2011: ch. 4; Weinberg 2011; G. Strawson 2011b; Snowdon 2014: ch. 3;\nentry on\n personal identity).\n As such, Locke considers the capacity for self-conscious thinking to\nbe a necessary condition of personhood. What is less clear is whether,\non this view, self-consciousness is sufficient for personhood. One\nreason for doubt on this score is that since it is concerned with\nself-conscious thought the account provides no reason to suppose that\ncreatures that enjoy non-conceptual self-consciousness are persons. A\nsecond is that the requirement of being able to reidentify oneself\nover time is not one that we need consider met by all self-conscious\ncreatures for, we can suppose, it is possible for a self-conscious\nsubject to lack the conceptual sophistication to understand the past\nand future tense. \nAn alternative conception of personhood that also gives a central role\nto self-consciousness can be found in Frankfurt’s claim that it\nis essential to persons to have a capacity for reflective\nself-evaluation manifested in the possession of what he calls\n“second-order volitions” (Frankfurt 1971: 110).\nSecond-order volitions involve wanting a certain desire to be\none’s will, that is wanting it to move one to action. A subject\nwith second-order volitions has the capacity to evaluate their\nfirst-order desires and this, it would seem, involves being aware of\nthem as (potentially) their own. Thus persons, thought of as subjects\nwith second-order volitions, are self-conscious (for discussion, see\nWatson 1975; Dennett 1976; Frankfurt 1987; Bratman 2007: chs. 5 &\n11). \nAn account of persons that would appear to distance that notion from\nself-consciousness is that offered by P.F. Strawson in chapter 3 of\nIndividuals,  \nthe concept of a person is the concept of a type of entity such that\nboth predicates ascribing states of consciousness\nand predicates ascribing corporeal characteristics, a\nphysical situation &c. are equally applicable to a single\nindividual of that type. (1959: 101–102; for discussion, see\nAyer 1963; Hacker 2002)  \nFrankfurt points out that this is inadequate as a definition of\npersonhood since “there are many entities beside persons that\nhave both mental and physical properties” (Frankfurt 1971: 5).\nIt may be, however, that Strawson’s formulation here is somewhat\nloose, and that his central idea is that persons are those entities\nthat self­-ascribe both types of predicate, a condition\nthat perhaps rules out at least most non-human animals. After all\nchapter 3 of Individuals, entitled “Persons”, is\nprimarily concerned with the conditions of such self-ascription, with\n“the use we make of the word ‘I’” (P.F.\nStrawson 1959: 94). \nStrawson’s primary goal is to argue for the claim that the\nconcept of a person is primitive, a position that he contrasts, on the\none hand, with Cartesian dualism and, on the other, with what he calls\nthe “no-ownership view”: a view according to which we\ndon’t really self-ascribe states of consciousness at all, at\nleast not with the use of “I” as subject (cf. Wittgenstein\n1953: §244; 1958: 76; Anscombe 1975; it is controversial whether\nWittgenstein ever really held this view, for discussion see Hacker\n1990: chs. 5 & 11; Jacobsen 1996; Wright 1998). To say that the\nconcept of a person is primitive is, on Strawson’s account, to\nsay that it is “logically prior” to the concepts\nsubject and body; persons are not to be thought of\nas compounds of subjects and bodies. Strawson argues that the\nprimitiveness of the concept of a person is a necessary condition of\nthe possibility of self-consciousness (P.F. Strawson 1959:\n98–103). His argument is that one can only self-ascribe states\nof consciousness if one is able to ascribe them to others (for more on\nthis theme see\n §4.4).\n This rules out Cartesian dualism, since ascribing states of\nconsciousness to others requires that one be able to identify others,\nand one cannot identify pure subjects of experience or Cartesian egos.\nThe condition that one must be able to ascribe states of consciousness\nto others also rules out the “no-ownership view” because\nsuch a view is inconsistent with the fact that psychological\npredicates have the very same sense in their first and third person\nuses. \nClosely related to the no-ownership view are a family of claims about\npersons that Parfit dubs “reductionism” (Parfit 1984:\n§79). Two prominent members of this familiar are the claim that\n \n[a] person’s existence consists in the existence of a brain and\nbody, and the occurrence of a series of interrelated physical and\nmental event, (1984: 211)  \nand that  \n[t]hough persons exist, we could give a complete description\nof reality without claiming that persons exist. (1984: 212)\n \nParfit’s reductionism, and it’s relation to Buddhist views\nof the self, has been widely discussed (see for example, Stone 1988;\nKorsgaard 1989; Cassam 1989, 1993, 1997: ch. 5; Garrett 1991, 1998:\nch. 2; Siderits 1997; McDowell 1997; Blackburn 1997). As is the case\nwith the “no-ownership view” it has sometimes been argued\nthat reductionism is incompatible with self-consciousness so, since we\nare indisputably self-conscious, reductionism must be false. Against\nthe claim that the (continued) existence of a person consists merely\nin the (continued) existence of brain, body, and interrelated physical\nand mental events that do not presuppose anything about\npersons as such, McDowell (1997) for example, argues from a\nbroadly Evansian position on self-consciousness (see the supplement:\n Evans on First Person Thought)\n that there simply are no such “identity-free relations”\n(1997: 378) to which a person’s identity could be reducible.\nThat is, there is no way of characterising memory and the other\npsychological phenomena relevant to personal identity without invoking\nthe identity of the person whose memory it is. As McDowell puts it,\n \n[i]n continuity of “consciousness”, there is what appears\nto be knowledge of an identity, the persistence of the same subject\nthrough time. (1997: 361)  \nMemory, at least, cannot be employed in a reductive account of persons\n(for discussion of McDowell’s argument see Buford 2009;\nFernández 2014; for related arguments from self-consciousness\nto the falsity of reductionism, see Cassam 1997: ch. 5). \nIs self-consciousness a necessary condition of rationality? A number\nof philosophers have argued that rationality requires self-knowledge\nwhich itself implies self-consciousness (see Shoemaker 1988, 1994;\nBurge 1996; Moran 2001; Bilgrami 2006; Boyle 2009, 2011; for a general\ndiscussion of this approach to self-knowledge, see Gertler 2011: ch.\n6). In his case against perceptual theories of self-knowledge,\nShoemaker (1994) argues against the possibility of self-blindness;\nagainst, that it is, the possibility that a rational creature with all\nthe necessary concepts might be simply unaware of its own sensations,\nbeliefs, and so on. A rational creature that is in pain, Shoemaker\nargues, will typically desire to be rid of her pain, and this requires\nthat she believe that she is in pain. As Shoemaker puts it, to see\nrational responses to pain  \nas pain behavior is to see them as motivated by such states\nof the creature as the belief that it is in pain, the desire to be rid\nof the pain, and the belief that such and such a course of behaviour\nwill achieve that result. (Shoemaker 1994: 228)  \nThis belief, that she is in pain, is a self-conscious one; it is a\nbelief that she herself is in pain. This connection between rational\nbehaviour and first-person thought is, of course, the one highlighted\nby Perry’s (1979) case of the messy shopper in his discussion of\nthe essential indexical (see\n §2.1). \nThe connection between rationality and self-knowledge (and so\nself-consciousness), Shoemaker argues, is even more pronounced in the\ncase of our awareness of our own beliefs. Rational subjects should\nabide by certain strictures on the contents of their beliefs, updating\nthem in line with new evidence, removing inconsistencies, and so on.\nAnd this, Shoemaker argues, requires that they not be self-blind with\nrespect to their beliefs. It requires that they are self-conscious. As\nShoemaker writes,  \nin an important class of cases the rational revision or adjustment of\nthe belief-desire system requires that we undertake investigations\naimed at determining what revisions or readjustments to make\n[…] What rationalizes the investigation are one’s\nhigher-order beliefs about what one believes and has reason to\nbelieve. (Shoemaker 1994: 240; also see Shoemaker’s discussion\nof Moore’s Paradox in Shoemaker 1988, 1994; for critical\ndiscussion of Shoemaker’s arguments in the context of theories\nof self-knowledge see, for example, Macdonald 1999; Kind 2003; Siewert\n2003; Gertler 2011: ch. 5) \nThe connection that Shoemaker sees between the requirements of\nrationality, on the one hand, and self-awareness, on the other, is\nalso stressed in so-called “rationalist” accounts of\nself-knowledge, most prominently in the work of Burge (1996) and Moran\n(2001; for critical discussion of the rationalist approach as an\naccount of self-knowledge see, for example, Peacocke 1996;\nO’Brien 2003; Reed 2010; Gertler 2011: ch. 6). Burge focuses on\nthe notion of the critical reasoner. He writes,  \n[t]o be capable of critical reasoning, and to be subject to certain\nrational norms necessarily associated with such reasoning, some mental\nacts and states must be knowledgeably reviewable. (Burge\n1996: 97; for a fuller argument for the same conclusion, see Burge\n1998)  \nOn Burge’s account, the critical reasoner must be in a position\nto recognise their reasons as reasons, and that requires “the\nsecond order ability to think about thought contents or propositions,\nand rational relations among them” (1996: 97). This is for the\nreason that belief involves commitments and such commitments\ninvolve meeting certain standards—providing reasons,\nreevaluating where necessary, and so on. \nA similar line of thought can be found in Moran’s account of the\nrole of reflection on one’s own state in practical deliberation\nabout what to do and how to feel (Moran 2001: ch. 2). Here the focus\nis not so much on critical reasoning but rather practical deliberation\nas that which requires self-consciousness. This is an idea that is\nalso central to much of Korsgaard’s work (see, in particular,\nKorsgaard 1996, 2009). A central concern of hers is to distinguish\nbetween the sort of action of which all animals are capable and the\nsort of autonomous agency of which we self-conscious subjects are\ncapable. The difference lies, on her broadly Kantian view, in simply\nhaving one’s most powerful desire result in action, on the one\nhand, and counting that desire as a reason for action, on the other.\nIt is the latter that is constitutive of autonomous, deliberative\naction understood from the perspective of practical reason. As she\nwrites,  \n[w]hen you deliberate it is as if there were something over and above\nall your desires, something which is you, and which\nchooses which desire to act upon. (Korsgaard 1996: 100)  \nSelf-consciousness, on this view,  \nis the source of reason. When we become conscious of the workings of\nan incentive within us, the incentive is experienced not as a force or\na necessity but as a proposal, something we need to make a decision\nabout. (Korsgaard 2009: 119; for discussion of Korsgaard’s\naccount of the relation between self-consciousness and the perspective\nof practical reason, see, for example, Nagel 1996; Fitzpatrick 2005;\nSoteriou 2013: ch. 12). \nSelf-awareness, on these views, is a necessary condition of\nrationality (conceived as the capacity for critical reasoning or\npractical deliberation). Burge also makes it clear that he regards the\ncapacity for critical reasoning to be a necessary condition of\n(conceptual) self-consciousness, since to master and self-ascribe\npsychological concepts such as belief, once must be able to recognise\ntheir role in reasoning, and so employ them (Burge 1996: 97, n.3). As\nhe puts it,  \n[a]cknowledging, with the I concept, that an attitude or act\nis one’s own is acknowledging that rational evaluations of it\nwhich one also acknowledges provide immediate […] reason and\nrationally immediate motivation to shape the attitude or act in\naccordance with the evaluation […] The first-person concept\nfixes the locus of responsibility. (Burge 1998: 253) \nThe claim that there is a constitutive connection between\nself-consciousness and rationality has been met with scepticism by\nKornblith (2011, 2012: ch. 2; for a related line of thought, see Doris\n2015: ch. 2). Regarding the sort of responsiveness to reason involved\nin updating one’s beliefs in accordance with new\nevidence—one of the capacities emphasised by both Shoemaker and\nBurge—Kornblith argues that “[w]hile such responsiveness\nmay be achieved, at times, by way of reflection on one’s beliefs\nand desires, it does not require any such reflection” (2012:\n49). Rationally revising beliefs in the face of evidence, Kornblith is\nkeen to point out, is a capacity enjoyed by non-reflective animals. He\nfurther presents the rationalist view with a challenge: if one thinks\nthat (first-order) beliefs are not themselves responsive to reason,\nhow does adding (second-order) beliefs help? One response to this\nchallenge is to point out that the connection between self-awareness\nand rationality that Shoemaker finds is intended to hold only for\n“an important class of cases” (Shoemaker 1994: 240), that\nis it holds for those cases of belief revision that themselves qualify\nas exercises in rational investigation. On this view, whilst\nnon-reflective creatures may have some degree of rationality, their\nlack of self-consciousness means that they are not, as we are, capable\nof fully rational deliberation (for discussion of Kornblith’s\nscepticism concerning the role of self-consciousness in rationality,\nsee Pust 2014; M. Williams 2015; Smithies 2016). \nCentral to the history of the self-consciousness sketched in\n §1\n is a concern with the relation between self-consciousness and\nconsciousness. Since self-consciousness is itself a form of\nconsciousness, consciousness is, of course, a necessary condition of\nit. But is self-consciousness necessary for consciousness? Positive\nanswers to this question come in both reductive and non-reductive\nvarieties. \nOne way in which consciousness might entail self-consciousness is if\nthe former is reducible to the latter. One such family of\nviews are\n higher order theories of consciousness\n which maintain that a psychological state is conscious if and only if\nit is represented, in the right way, by a higher order state (Gennaro\n2004; for a very different account that nevertheless posits a tight\nconnection between consciousness and self-consciousness, see\nO’Shaughnessy 2002: ch. 3). A natural assumption is that this\nhigher order state is distinct from that which it represents. Higher\nOrder theories that accept this assumption fall into two camps: Higher\nOrder Thought (HOT) theories (Rosenthal 1986, 2005; Carruthers 2000,\n2005), which maintain that the higher order state is a thought or\nbelief, and Higher Order Perception (HOP) theories (Armstrong 1968;\nLycan 1996, 2004), which by contrast maintain that the higher order\nstate is a perception-like sensory state—an exercise of the sort\nof inner perception, or “inner sense”, that was\nextensively debated throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies (Thiel 2011; see §3.1). Since, however, we can be aware\nthat someone else is in some conscious state, it seems that\nsimply being aware that a thought is occurring is insufficient to\nrender that thought conscious. Arguably, what is required is that one\nbe aware that one is in the relevant first-order state. That\nis, one represents oneself as being in the state in question.\nSince this seems to involve a form of self-awareness, the HOT and HOP\ntheories can be understood as holding that consciousness entails\nself-consciousness (Gennaro 1996). Given this, it is natural to think\nof the distinction between HOT and HOP theories of consciousness as\nclosely related to that between conceptual and non-conceptual\nself-consciousness. \nAn alternative to HOT and HOP theories that still maintains the\nambition to reduce consciousness to self-consciousness is the\nself-representational view (Kriegel & Williford 2006; Kriegel\n2009; Caston 2002), according to which a psychological state is\nconscious if and only if it represents itself. Such accounts are\nhigher-order views that deny that the first and second-order states\nare distinct. As with both HOT and HOP, self-representationalism can\nbe thought of as supporting the view that a form of self-consciousness\nis a necessary condition of consciousness. Kriegel (2003) dubs this\n“intransitive self-consciousness”, the phenomenon\npurportedly picked out by phrases of the form “I am\nself-consciously thinking that P”, and distinguishes it from the\n“transitive self-consciousness” purportedly picked out by\nphrases of the form “I am self-conscious of my thought that\nP”. This is a version of the distinction between reflective and\npre-reflective self-consciousness discussed in\n §3.2\n (and the views of Fichte and Sartre mentioned in\n §1;\n cf. Kapitan 1999). If conscious states are those that represent\nthemselves then, it might be argued, consciousness entails\nintransitive self-consciousness, since one’s conscious states do\nnot only represent themselves but also (in some way implicitly)\nrepresent oneself as having them (Kriegel 2003: 104). \nAristotle, considering a version of the HOP theory, argued that the\nview suffered from a regress problem since the higher-order perception\nmust itself be conscious and so be accompanied by a HOP, which would\nitself be conscious, and so on (De Anima 3.2; Caston 2002).\nThe standard way to diffuse such a worry is to deny that the higher\norder state, be it perception or thought, need be conscious. An\nalternative, of course, is to endorse a self-representational account.\nThere are other objections to higher order views, however, each of\nwhich applies to one or more versions of the view. They include\nworries about the possibility of objectless and non-veridical higher\norder states (Byrne 1997; Block 2011), about whether it can account\nfor the conscious states of infants and non-humans (Dretske 1995: ch.\n4; Tye 1995: ch. 1), the complaint that the postulation of a distinct\nhigher-order state for every conscious state leads to an unnecessarily\n“cluttered picture of the mind” (Chalmers 1996: 231), and\nthe fundamental worry that no form of higher-order view has the\nresources to explain consciousness at all (Levine 2006; cf.\nKriegel 2012). As such, higher-order and self-representational\ntheories of consciousness, that posit a necessary connection between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness, are far from being\nestablished. \nIf consciousness cannot be reduced to self-consciousness, perhaps the\nlatter is nevertheless a necessary condition of the former. Some\nnon-reductive views, already mentioned, see pre-reflective\nconsciousness (see\n §3.2),\n or the sense of ownership (see\n §3.3)\n as necessary conditions of consciousness (see Zahavi 2005). A\ndifferent non-reductive, and broadly Kantian, argument for the claim\nthat self-consciousness is a necessary condition of consciousness\nfirst of all claims that conscious experience is necessarily unified\nand, second, that this unity of consciousness in turn depends on\nself-awareness. Of primary interest here is the second step which is\narticulated by Strawson in his discussion of Kant’s\ntranscendental deduction as the claim that,  \nif different experiences are to belong to a single consciousness,\nthere must be the possibility of self­-consciousness on\nthe part of the subject of those experiences. (P.F. Strawson 1966: 93;\nfor discussion of Kant’s views of the matter, see Henrich 1989;\nPowell 1990; Brook 1994; Keller 1998; Kitcher 2011; Allison 2015; for\ndetailed discussion of whether consciousness is necessarily unified,\nsee Bayne 2010; see also entry on\n unity of consciousness).\n  \nOne reason for supposing that there is a connection between\nself-consciousness and the unity of consciousness is given by Kant,\nwho writes,  \nonly because I can comprehend their manifold in a consciousness do I\ncall them altogether my representations; for\notherwise I would have as multi-coloured diverse a self as I have\nrepresentations of which I am conscious. (Kant 1781/1787: B134)  \nThat is, a single self must be able to “comprehend” its\nown experiences together, otherwise they would not really be its own.\nSuch “comprehension” would seem to involve\nself-consciousness. As Kant famously puts it,  \n[t]he I think must be able to\naccompany all my representations for otherwise something would be\nrepresented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much\nas to say that the representation would either be impossible or else\nat least would be nothing for me. (Kant 1781/1787: B131–132)\n \nOn this view, it is the unity of the self that guarantees that\nco-conscious experiences are jointly self-ascribable; that unity\nrequires self-consciousness (there is a question as to whether\nself-consciousness is here supposed to explain the unity of\nconsciousness; cf. Dainton’s strong and weak\n“I-thesis” (2000: §2.3)). This Kantian picture is\nassociated with the claim that unified self-consciousness requires a\nconception of the world as objective; as transcending the perspective\nthat one has on it. The idea here is that to self-ascribe an\nexperience one must have some grasp of the distinction between\none’s (subjective) experience that the (objective) condition of\nwhich it is an experience (these issues are explored in P.F. Strawson\n1966; Bennett 1966; Evans 1980; Cassam 1997; Sacks 2000; also see\nBurge 2010: ch. 6). \nThe claim that the unity of consciousness requires self-consciousness\ncan be criticised in a number of different ways. How one evaluates the\nclaim will depend on whether one has conceptual or non-conceptual\nself-consciousness in mind. As Bayne (2004) points out, the claim that\nthe unity of consciousness requires that one possess the concept of\noneself seems, implausibly, to imply that conceptually unsophisticated\ninfants and non-human animals could not possess a unified stream of\nconsciousness (of course, this worry applies quite generally to views\nthat connect consciousness with self-consciousness). The view that\nnon-conceptual self-consciousness is a necessary condition of the\nunity of consciousness would appear to be vulnerable to the objection\nthat it implausibly rules out the possibility of cases such as\nAnscombe’s (1975) subject in a sensory deprivation tank, a case\nin which the forms of experience typically classed as forms of\nnon-conceptual self-consciousness are lacking (for related cases see\nBayne 2004; also see G. Strawson 1999). A different worry about the\nconnection between self-consciousness and the unity of consciousness\nis the “just more content” objection (B. Williams 1978:\nch. 3; Hurley 1994; and 1998 Part I). The concern is addressed to the\nview that self-consciousness is not merely a necessary condition of\nthe unity of consciousness but is that in virtue of which it is\nunified. For if the self-ascription of experiences is taken to be that\nwhich is responsible for the unity of consciousness, how can we\naccount for the fact that the self-conscious thoughts are themselves\nunified with the first-order experiences that they supposedly unify?\nAs Hurley puts it,  \nself-conscious or first-person contents […] are just more\ncontents, to which the problem of co-consciousness [i.e., the\nunity of consciousness] also applies (1998: 61)  \nTo appeal to the third-order self-ascription of the self-conscious\nthought would appear to invite a regress. \nWhat is the connection between self-consciousness and the awareness of\nothers? On some views self-consciousness requires awareness of others,\non another view the awareness of others requires self-consciousness.\nIn each case we can distinguish between those accounts according to\nwhich such awareness is merely an empirical condition from those\naccording to which it is a strictly necessary/sufficient condition.\nThere is also a distinction to be made regarding the sense of\n“awareness of others” that is in play: whilst some\nphilosophers are concerned with knowledge of other minds, others are\ncontent with the representation of others, veridical or not. \nA familiar account of our knowledge of others takes the form of an\nargument from analogy (Slote 1970: ch. 4; Avramides 2001: part I). The\nargument from analogy presents an account of our justification for\nmoving from judgements about others’ observable behaviour to\njudgements about their unobservable mental states. I am aware from my\nown case that, say, wincing is the result of pain so, on seeing\nanother’s wincing, I am justified in judging them to be in pain.\nOn this picture, self-awareness, as manifest in the judgement about my\nown case, is a necessary condition of knowledge of other minds. In\nthis respect the view is related to contemporary simulation theory,\nstandard versions of which see our capacity to attribute mental states\nto others as dependent on our capacity to attribute them to ourselves\n(Heal 1986; Goldman 2006: ch. 9; for a simulationist theory that\ndiffers in this respect, see Gordon 1996). Associated with the\nargument from analogy is a view according to which our grasp of mental\nstate concepts is an essentially first-personal affair. That is, we\nunderstand what, for example, pain is first from our own case (Nagel\n1986: §2.3; Peacocke 2008: ch. 5–6; it has sometimes been\nclaimed that this view gives rise to the conceptual problem of other\nminds, see Wittgenstein 1958: §302; McGinn 1984; Avramides 2001:\npart II). \nIn opposition to this package stand views on which our grasp and\napplication of mental state concepts is neutral between the first and\nthird-person cases. Theory theorists, for example, claim that we\nattribute mental states to both ourselves and others by means of a\n(tacitly held) psychological theory. They may also hold that\npossession of such a theory constitutes our grasp of mental state\nconcepts (Carruthers 1996, 2011: ch. 8; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997;\nfor an account that combines elements of theory with elements of\nsimulation, see Nichols & Stich 2003). While such views accord no\npriority to the first-person case, they may see a tight connection\nbetween self-consciousness and our capacity to think about others:\nthese are simply two aspects of the more general capacity to think\nabout the mind. A distinct, though related, family of views see both\nself-consciousness and awareness of others as emerging from a\nprimitive “adualist” state in which self and other are not\ndistinguished (Piaget 1937; Merleau-Ponty 1960; Barresi & Moore\n1996; Hurley 2005; Gallese 2005; also see D. Stern 1985: part II).\nAgainst such “adualist” views, it is often claimed the\nphenomena of neonate imitation, joint attention, and emotion\nregulation show that infants display an awareness of others as\nothers from the very beginning of life (Meltzoff & Moore\n1977; Trevarthen 1979; Hurley & Chater 2005; Eilan et al. 2005;\nLegerstee 2005; Reddy 2008). One empirical proposal is that it is from\nthis early form of social interaction and capacity to understand\nothers that self-consciousness emerges as a self-directed form of\nmindreading (Carruthers 2011; Carruthers, Fletcher, & Ritchie\n2012; for an early such account, see Mead 1934). On such a view the\nfirst-person case is treated as secondary, reversing the traditional\npicture associated with the argument from analogy. \nA more ambitious version of this approach to the relationship between\nself-consciousness and awareness of others, prioritizing the awareness\nof others, is to argue that knowledge of other minds is a necessary\ncondition of the possibility of self-consciousness. Well known\nexamples of such arguments can be found in the work of P.F. Strawson\n(1959: ch. 3) and Davidson (1991; for the related Hegelian view that\nvarious forms of self-consciousness depend on intersubjective\nrecognition, see Honneth 1995). Since knowledge of other minds is\ntypically considered to be open to sceptical doubt, and\nself-consciousness is not, such lines of reasoning are transcendental\narguments and so potentially open to general criticisms of that form\nof argument (Stroud 1968; R. Stern 1999, 2000). Strawson’s\nargument hinges on his claim that  \nthe idea of a predicate is correlative with that of a range\nof distinguishable individuals of which the predicate can be\nsignificantly, though not necessarily truly, affirmed. (P.F. Strawson\n1959: 99; cf. Evans’ generality constraint, 1982: §4.3)\n \nThis means, Strawson claims, that one can only ascribe mental states\nto oneself if one is capable of ascribing them to others which, in\nturn, means that I cannot have gained the capacity to think of\nothers’ mental states by means of an analogical reasoning from\nmy own case. This, Strawson argues, shows that others’\nobservable behaviour is not a “sign” of their mentality,\nbut is a “criterion” of it. In short, we must have\nknowledge of others’ minds if we are self-conscious (for the\nfull argument, see P.F. Strawson 1959: 105ff; for critical discussion,\nsee R. Stern 2000: ch. 6; Sacks 2005; Joel Smith 2011). \nDavidson’s transcendental argument—the triangulation\nargument—connects self-consciousness, knowledge of other minds,\nand knowledge of the external world. At its heart is the claim that\nfor my thoughts to have determinate content there must exist another\nsubject who is able to interpret me. As Davidson puts it,  \nit takes two points of view to give a location to the cause of a\nthought, and thus to define its content […] Until a base line\nhas been established by communication with someone else, there is no\npoint in saying one’s own thoughts or words have a propositional\ncontent. (Davidson 1991: 212–213)  \nSince self-conscious subjects are aware of the contents of their\nthoughts, they must know that there are other minds, since the sort of\nintersubjective externalism that Davidson endorses guarantees it.\nSelf-knowledge, on this view, entails knowledge of others (for\ndiscussion, see R. Stern 2000: ch. 6; Sosa 2003; Ludwig 2011). \nAt what age can human infants be credited with self-consciousness? Is\nself-consciousness present beyond homo sapiens? Some\ntheorists, for example Bermúdez (1998), claim that various\nforms of perceptual experience constitute a non-conceptual form of\nself-consciousness (see\n §3).\n Others, for example Rosenthal (2005), claim that phenomenal\nconsciousness entails self-consciousness. If either view is correct\nthen self-consciousness, of some kind, can plausibly be attributed to\ncreatures other than adult humans. But when it comes to more\nsophisticated forms of self-awareness, matters are less clear. What is\nrequired is some empirical criterion for judging a creature\nself-conscious even if, as with infants and non-human animals, they\nare unable to provide evidence via their use of the\nfirst-person pronoun. Such evidence, if available, may reasonably be\nthought to shed light on both the phylogenetic and ontogenetic\ndevelopment of self-consciousness (Ferrari & Sternberg 1998;\nTerrace & Metcalfe 2005; see the entries on\n animal consciousness\n and\n animal cognition). \nIt has sometimes been claimed, most forcefully by Gallup and\ncolleagues, that the capacity to recognise oneself in the mirror is a\nmarker of self-consciousness (Gallup 1970; Gallup, Anderson, &\nPlatek 2011; Gallup, Platek, & Spaulding 2014). It is easy to see\nwhy this might seem to be so since, if first-person thought involves\nthinking about oneself as oneself, then it is natural to\nsuppose that a capacity to recognise that a subject seen in a mirror\nis oneself involves such a thought. In Evans’s (1982)\nterminology such thoughts involve an “identification\ncomponent”. \nGallup (1970) devised a test for mirror self-recognition:\nsurreptitiously placing a red mark on a subject’s forehead\nbefore exposure to a mirror, then observing whether they touch the\nrelevant spot. It is well established that chimpanzees pass the mirror\ntest while other primate species fail (Anderson & Gallup 2011). It\nhas also been claimed that dolphins and some elephants pass the test\n(Reiss & Marino 2001; Plotnik et. al. 2006). With respect to human\ninfants, the consensus is that success in the mirror test begins at\naround 15 to 18 months of age, and that by 24 months most children\npass (Amsterdam 1972; M. Lewis & Brooks-Gunn 1979; Nielsen,\nSuddendorf, & Slaughter 2006). \nIt is not universally accepted, however, that success in the mirror\ntest is an indication of self-consciousness. For example, Heyes (1994)\npresents an influential critique of the claim that it is a marker of\nself-awareness, arguing that all that is required for success is that\nsubjects be able to distinguish between novel ways of receiving bodily\nfeedback in order to guide behaviour, on the one hand, and other forms\nof incoming sensory data, on the other. Such a view, however, needs to\nexplain why it is that passing the mirror test seems to be connected\nwith the phenomena arguably associated with self-consciousness, such\nas experiencing shame and embarrassment (M. Lewis 2011). There\nremains, then, significant controversy concerning what success in the\nmirror test really shows, and so whether it can shed light on the\ndevelopment of self-awareness (see, for example, Mitchell 1993;\nSuddendorf & Butler 2013; Gallup, Platek, & Spaulding 2014.\nFor related philosophical discussion, see Rochat & Zahavi 2011;\nPeacocke 2014: ch.8). \nAnother potential marker of self-consciousness is episodic memory, the\ncapacity that we have to recollect particular episodes from our own\npast experience (see Tulving 1983; Michaelian 2016; entry on\n memory).\n As Tulving describes it, episodic memory involves\n“autonoesis” or “mental time-travel”, the\nexperience of transporting oneself in time (which also has a future\noriented dimension in expectation, planning, and so on; see\nMichaelian, Klein, & Szpunar 2016). The connection between memory\nand self-consciousness is one that is often made (see\n §2.3,\n §3, and\n §4.1).\n If it is correct that episodic memory essentially involves a form of\nself-consciousness, and we are able to test for the presence of\nepisodic memory in non-linguistic infants and animals, then we have a\nway of detecting the presence of self-conscious abilities. Since,\nhowever, episodic memory is not the only form of self-consciousness,\nthe lack of it does not indicate that a creature is not self-aware.\nIndeed, the much discussed case of K.C. seems to be one in which, due\nto an accident, someone has lost episodic memory but appears to remain\notherwise self-conscious (see Rosenbaum et. al. 2005). \nTulving himself argues that only humans possess episodic memory, and\nonly when they reach the age of around 4 years (2005; also see\nSuddendorf & Corballis 2007). Whilst human infants and non-human\nanimals possess non-episodic forms of memory such as semantic memory\n(remembering that such and such is the case), they lack the\n“autonoetic” consciousness of themselves projected either\nback or forwards in time. For example whilst most 3 year old infants\ncan remember presented information, most are unreliable when it comes\nto the question of how they know—did they see it, hear it, etc.\n(Gopnik & Graf 1988). The suggestion here is that the development\nof the reliable capacity to report how they know some fact reflects\nthe development of the capacity to episodically remember the learning\nevent. \nIn the case of animals perhaps the most suggestive evidence of\nepisodic memory derives from work on scrub-jays, who can retain\ninformation about what food has been stored, where it was stored, and\nwhen (Clayton, Bussey, & Dickinson 2003). This evidence coheres\nwith the “what, where, when” criterion of episodic memory\noriginally proposed by Tulving (1972). It is, however, widely accepted\nthat this content-based account of episodic memory—episodic\nmemory is memory that contains information about what happened, where\nit happened, and when—is inadequate, since non-episodic,\nsemantic memory often involves the retention of “what, where,\nwhen” information. Due to the difficulties in finding a\nbehavioural test for “autonoetic” consciousness, it is\noften, though not universally, claimed that there is no compelling\nevidence for episodic memory, and thus this particular form of\nself-consciousness, in non-human animals (Tulving 2005; Suddendorf\n& Corballis 2007; Michaelian 2016: ch. 2; for discussion relating\nto apes, see Menzel 2005; Schwartz 2005; for an alternative\nperspective suggesting that episodic memory abilities come in degree,\nsee Breeden et. al. 2016). \nAnother body of research pertaining to the question of\nself-consciousness in infants and non-human animals is the work on\nmetacognition (and metamemory). The term “metacognition”\ntypically refers to the capacity to monitor and control one’s\nown cognitive states, and is manifest in one’s judgements (or\nfeelings) concerning one’s own learning and consequent level of\ncertainty or confidence (J.D. Smith 2009; Beran et al. 2012; Proust\n2013; Fleming & Frith 2014). The suggestion is that if a creature\nis able to monitor their own level of confidence, they are to that\nextent self-conscious. One common paradigm for testing metacognitive\nabilities involves presenting subjects with a stimulus that they must\ncategorise in one of two ways. Crucially, they are also given the\nopportunity to opt out of the test, with correct categorisation\nresulting in the highest reward, opting out resulting in a lower\nreward, and incorrect categorisation resulting in no reward. The\nassumption is that the opt-out response reflects a meta-cognitive\njudgement of uncertainty. Evidence gathered from such a paradigm has\nbeen taken to show metacognitive abilities in some birds (Fujita et.\nal. 2012), dolphins (J.D. Smith et. al. 1995), primates (Shields et.\nal. 1997), and children from the age of around 4 years (Sodian et. al.\n2012). \nThe view that success on metacognitive opt-out tests is indicative of\nself-consciousness is not uncontroversial, however. For example, it\nhas been suggested that the uncertainty response is indicative not of\nmetacognitive uncertainty monitoring but rather of first-order,\nenvironmental judgements concerning a third category between the\nintended two (Kornell, Son, & Terrace 2007; Hampton 2009; also see\nCarruthers 2008; Kornell 2014; Musholt 2015: ch. 7). On such an\ninterpretation, the research on metacognition does not provide\ncompelling evidence regarding self-consciousness in infants and\nnon-human animals (but for critical discussion see J.D. Smith 2005;\nJ.D. Smith, Couchman, & Beran 2014; also relevant is the\ndistinction between “evaluativist” and\n“attributivist” accounts of metacognition outlined by\nProust (2013)). The question of the significance of opt-out tests for\nattributions of self-consciousness remains controversial.","contact.mail":"joel.smith@manchester.ac.uk","contact.domain":"manchester.ac.uk"}]
