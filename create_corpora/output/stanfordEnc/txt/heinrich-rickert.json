His father Heinrich Rickert Sr.\n(1833–1902) was a politician and editor in Berlin. Heinrich Sr. was a\nliberal democrat particularly invested in the cause of the German Jews.\nIn 1890 Heinrich Sr. founded the Society Against Anti-Semitism in\nBerlin (Zijderveld 2006, 9). This is an interesting fact about Rickert\nJr.’s background, considering that he eventually worked to\nsupport the appointment of philosophers of Jewish descent, such as\nEdmund Husserl and Georg Simmel, who were not under the protective wing\nof Hermann Cohen, the head of the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism (see\nbelow) and a very influential Jewish thinker.\n\n\n\nBetween 1884 and 1885 Rickert was enrolled at the University of\nBerlin, where he attended lectures from the philosopher Friedrich\nPaulsen (1846–1908). In 1885 he moved to Strasbourg (then\nStraßburg and part of the Prussian Reich) where he\nattended the Neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband’s\nlectures. Windelband (1848–1915) was a major source of inspiration for\nRickert’s work and he completed a dissertation on The Theory\nof Definition (Rickert 1915) under Windelband’s supervision\nin 1888. In the same year he married Sophie Keibel, a sculptor from\nBerlin. They had four children.\n\n\nIn 1889 Rickert moved to Freiburg for health-related reasons.\nRickert’s health was always precarious. After undergoing\nintestinal surgery in 1896 he suffered lifelong intercostal neuralgia\nand he developed agoraphobia. In spite of his health problems,\nRickert was able to complete his Habilitation under Alois\nRiehl (1844–1924) in Freiburg, where he was appointed extraordinary\nprofessor in 1894 and ordinary professor in 1896. The dissertation he\nproduced for the Habilitation, The Object of\nKnowledge, is one of his most important works and a milestone in\nearly twentieth century Neo-Kantianism.\n\n\nRickert remained in Freiburg until 1915, when he accepted an offer\nfrom the University of Heidelberg to replace his recently deceased\nmentor Windelband, who had moved there from Strasbourg in 1903. He\ntaught in Heidelberg until 1932, when he retired. He died on July\n25th 1936 in Heidelberg and was buried in Gdańsk.\n\n\nRickert had a long and successful academic career. He received several\nawards and honorary degrees. He taught and in some cases supervised\nimportant German thinkers of the next generation, such as Martin\nHeidegger (1889–1976), Emil Lask (1875–1915) and Walter\nBenjamin (1892–1940). He had close intellectual exchanges with\nleading figures of his time, including Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833–1911), Georg Simmel (1858–1918), Edmund Husserl\n(1859–1938), Max Weber (1864–1920) and Karl Jaspers\n(1883–1969). Although very few of his writings are available in\nEnglish, in recent years there has been a growing interest in\nRickert’s work, both to the extent that it influenced other\nphilosophers and as a significant contribution to the discipline in\nits own right.\n\n\n\nRickert was a very prolific writer. He managed his publications in a\nway that should strike the contemporary reader as familiar. He would\npresent new ideas and lines of inquiry first in exploratory journal\narticles (many of them published in Logos, the journal he\nfounded in Freiburg) and subsequently he would incorporate them in\nlarger publications, often including previously published materials.\nFollowing a common trend in his time, he kept working at his two major\nbooks, The Object of Knowledge (first published in 1892) and\nThe Limits of Concept-Formation in Natural Science (first\npublished in 1902), for his entire life. Instead of writing new books\nhe would rewrite entire chapters and add new sections to his two\nmagna opera, thereby addressing criticism and\nsometimes even changing significantly his previous views. So, for\ninstance, The Object of Knowledge grew from the 91 pages of\nthe first edition to the 460 pages of the sixth edition in 1928. This\nstyle of writing makes the development of his thought particularly\nperspicuous. However, in spite of his constant revisions and additions,\nthe fundamental principles of Rickert’s philosophy remained\nconstant throughout his career. In keeping with his systematic\nunderstanding of philosophy (see below), his approach to new problems\nwas geared towards connecting them to old problems, and his way of\nhandling criticism was often characterized by an effort to reformulate\nhis opponent’s views so as to make them compatible with his\nown.\n\n \n\nRickert is considered the head of the so-called Southwestern or\nBaden school of Neo-Kantianism, whose exponents worked in the\nphilosophy departments at Freiburg and Heidelberg, both in the region\nof Baden in southwestern Germany. The Southwestern school stands in\ncontrast to the so-called Marburg school, spearheaded by Hermann Cohen\n(1842–1918) and continued by Paul Natorp (1854–1924) and\nErnst Cassirer (1874–1945). (For an overview of the two schools\nsee Crowell 1999.) \n\nIn spite of their fierce opposition, the two schools present\nelements of similarity alongside the numerous elements of difference.\nThese have been recently debated among Neo-Kantianism scholars (Krijnen\n2001, 77–93; Krijnen/Noras 2012). One indisputably common element\nbetween the two schools is the preoccupation with the problem of\nvalidity, or Geltung, which is arguably the systematic core of\nNeo-Kantianism in general (Krijnen 2001, 84). Philosophy for the\nNeo-Kantians is concerned with the systematic elucidation of the a\npriori principles that allow for valid thinking in various\nspheres of knowledge. In keeping with Kant’s first\nCritique, valid thinking is not merely logically consistent\nthinking. Valid thinking requires, over and above the adherence to the\nlaws of formal logic, thinking in accordance with the a priori\nprinciples governing the intelligibility of a given area of reality.\nThese will be, for instance, the principles of causality,\nsubstantiality etc. in the sphere of physical nature and principles\nsuch as good and evil, responsibility, freedom, etc. in the sphere of\nethics. It is the task of philosophy to identify these a priori\nprinciples in all the different spheres of culture, including politics,\nbiology, art, history, etc. Helmuth Plessner captures metaphorically\nthe spirit of Neo-Kantianism when he characterizes the Neo-Kantians as\n“botanists in the garden of the a priori” (Plessner 1974,\n185). \n\nIn their attempt to clarify the way in which we should think of such\nprinciples, both the Southwestern and the Marburg Neo-Kantians reject\nany kind of psychological reading, which dominated among early\n19th Century interpretations of Kant. The a priori\nprinciples of valid thinking are not mere facts about human psychology;\nthey do not describe merely how our mind happens to function. Their\nvalidity is objective, that is, it is part of the formal\nstructure of the objects of investigation and not merely an extrinsic\nmental scheme that exemplars of the species homo sapiens\ncontingently apply to them. \n\nMoreover, both schools were rather unenthusiastic about the label\n‘Neo-Kantianism’. Their goal was not to go “back to\nKant”, as Otto Liebmann (1840–1912) famously urged philosophers\nto do in his Kant und die Epigonen (Liebmann 1865), but,\nrather, to move forward beyond Kant building on his original views.\nWindelband, Rickert’s mentor and the forefather of Southwestern\nNeo-Kantianism, pronounced: “To understand Kant means to move\nbeyond him” (Windelband 1915, IV). Likewise, the Marburg school\nleader Cohen pointed out: “From the very beginning I was\nconcerned with developing Kant’s system further” (Cohen\n1902, VII). \n\nThe two schools, however, diverge significantly in their\ninterpretation of Kant. While the Marburg school was predominantly\ninterested in the Critique of Pure Reason (Cohen 1885) and\nconsidered it to be an essay in the philosophical foundation of\nNewtonian science (a reading that is still prominent among contemporary\nKant scholars, such as Friedmann 1992), Rickert and the Southwesterners\nemphasized the importance of reading Kant as a whole and considered the\ncenterpiece of his philosophical program to be the system of the\nfaculties outlined in the introduction to the Critique of\nJudgment (Rickert 1924b, 167). For Rickert, in particular, already\nin Kant’s first Critique “the focal point\n[…] is not in the transcendental aesthetic and analytic but\nrather in the dialectic, and this means that the main problem\nof this work is not a theory of the experiential sciences\n(Erfahrungswissenschaften). Rather, it revolves around the\nold, ever-recurring problems of metaphysics. The work on these\nproblems becomes the foundation for an encompassing theory of worldview\nculminating in the treatment of issues in the philosophy of religion.\nThe theory of mathematics and physics is merely preparatory\nfor the treatment of these issues” (Rickert 1924b, 153).\nRickert’s Kant is primarily a philosopher of human culture at\nlarge, interested in questions about the meaning and value of our life\nin the world, whereas Cohen’s Kant is primarily (albeit not\nexclusively) a philosopher of the natural sciences. Incidentally, the\nlargely ignored influence of Rickert’s Kant-interpretation is\nstill vivid in Heidegger’s acclaimed book Kant and the\nProblem of Metaphysics (Heidegger 1997). \n\nFrom these diverging interpretations of Kant flows another\nfundamental theoretical difference between the two schools. This\ndifference has been effectively phrased by Rickert’s student,\nEmil Lask in terms of “pan-logism”, attributed to the\nMarburg Neo-Kantians, versus the “pan-archy of\nlogos”, attributed to the Southwestern Neo-Kantians\n(Lask 1923, 133; Crowell 2010). If we take the distinction between\nintuition (Anschauung) and concept (Begriff) to be\nthe fundamental paradigm of Kantian transcendentalism, then in\nLask’s eyes the Marburg Neo-Kantians are committed to a kind of\n‘pan-logism’ to the extent that they tend to minimize the\nrole of intuition. As is particularly evident, for instance, in Natorp\n(1911, 26–67), for the Marburg Neo-Kantians whatever we might be\ntempted to consider a pure given or a raw datum of experience can be\nanalyzed into an underlying thought-process, whereby the given is\nactually constructed according to a conceptually articulable (i.e.,\nlogical) pattern. Every alleged pure given (Gegebenes) is\nactually a task (Aufgegebenes) for conceptual thinking and can\nbe resolved into an underlying thought process governed by logical a\npriori principles. \n\nBy contrast, Rickert and the Southwestern Neo-Kantians emphasize\nthe ultimate irreducibility of what is given in intuition to conceptual\nforms. While everything can be grasped by concepts, and therefore no\ndomain of reality and cultural life eludes in principle conceptual\nmastery (pan-archy), nothing can be grasped\nexhaustively by concepts, and therefore our rationality has to\nconstantly take into account an irrational residue intrinsic\nto every conceptual construction. To conceptualize, for Rickert, is to\nrecast the materials delivered immediately by the senses into\na conceptual form. In so doing, we necessarily have to be\nselective, that is, we have to leave out of consideration an\noverwhelming amount of elements and take up in our conceptuality only\nthose elements that match the criteria originally established for the\npurpose of solving our theoretical task. To give a simple example, in\norder to conceptualize, say, linear motion we have to isolate from the\noverwhelming amount of data stemming from the senses only those\nfeatures that pertain to the movement of bodies (spatial location,\nspeed, reciprocal position, etc.) and leave out of consideration\neverything else. This general characterization can serve as a prelude\nto Rickert’s theory of knowledge, which is the theme of the next\nsection. \n\nFor Rickert epistemology or Erkenntnistheorie\n(‘theory of knowledge’) has to be the point of departure\nand the systematic foundation of philosophy as a whole. He often uses\ninterchangeably the words “logic” (Logik),\n“theory of knowledge” (Erkenntnistheorie),\n“methodology” (Methodologie), “theory of\ntruth” (Wahrheitslehre) and “theory of\nscience” (Wissenschaftslehre). (See for instance Rickert\n1986, 19; Rickert 1909, 170.) This is because ultimately all these\nphrases refer to one and the same problem, i.e., the problem of the\nvalidity of thought and the principles on which valid thought rests.\nErkenntnistheorie, therefore, is his preferred phrase because\nit makes this fundamental problem most explicit. \n\nRickert’s theory of knowledge is designed to answer the\nfollowing question: “what is the subject-independent yardstick of\nknowledge? In other words, through what does knowledge receive its\nobjectivity?” (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his\nmajor work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge?\nIn asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a\ntranscendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that\n(1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true\nthought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some\nthought-independent object, how are we to think this\nthought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert\nrejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to\nskepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that\nskepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be\nmeaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely\nwhat knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version\nof skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl’s\nepoché (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory\nof knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some\npresuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a\nsubject successfully grasps an object. “However, the theory of\nknowledge ought to be ‘presuppositionless’ in the sense\nthat it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon\nwhich the objectivity of knowledge rests” (Rickert 1921a, 12).\nIt is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key\nquestion as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent\nreality existing independently of consciousness as the source\nof validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge,\nthen, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its\nrelation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning\none of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely,\nthat there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion\nthat validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this\nsubject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent\nreality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and\npresumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be\nprecisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully\nconceived of as a reality and that only values can be\nconsidered genuinely transcendent. \n\nRickert argues that we can tackle the problem of the theory of\nknowledge in two ways: “One can begin first with an analysis of\nthe real act of knowledge as a psychic process and then, from there,\nmove progressively to determine the transcendent object. Secondly, one\ncan attempt to reach as quickly as possible the sphere of the\ntranscendent object and deal with it in a purely ‘logical’\nfashion without considering the psychic act of knowing” (Rickert\n1909, 174). He labels these two approaches the\n“transcendental-psychological” (or subjective) and the\n“transcendental-logical” (or objective) ways (Rickert 1909, \n174). While in the first editions of The Object of Knowledge\nRickert privileged the transcendental-psychological way, in the early\n1900s he introduced the transcendental-logical way and incorporated it\ninto later editions of the book, arguing that the two ways should be\nconsidered complementary. \n\nThe most important move at the beginning of the subjective way is to\ndetermine the notions of subject and object that the theory of\nknowledge can legitimately operate with, and, in particular to\ncharacterize “the epistemological subject” (das\nerkenntnistheoretische Subjekt) (Rickert 1921a, 41). Rickert\nexamines three different subject/object dichotomies. (1) We can define\nthe object in spatial terms as what is out there in the world. This is\nwhat the expression ‘external world’ seems to refer to.\nCorrespondingly, the subject, too, will be defined in spatial terms as\nthe animated body, for which there are spatial surroundings populated\nby objects. The first dichotomy construes subject and object as\n“two bodies” (Rickert 1921a, 14) facing each other in\nphysical space. (2) We can construe a second dichotomy, in which we\ntake our body, too, to be an object like other objects and consider\n‘subject’ to refer exclusively to consciousness. “In\nthis second case my consciousness and its content are the subject, and\ntherefore the object is everything that is not my content of\nconsciousness or my consciousness itself” (Rickert 1921a, 15).\nThis second dichotomy captures the traditional distinction between\nimmanence and transcendence. (3) A third dichotomy ensues from a\nfurther distinction that we can carry out within the sphere of\nimmanence, that is, the distinction between the ego and its\nrepresentations, or between any content of consciousness and\nconsciousness itself. In this third case representations, perceptions,\nfeelings, emotions etc. would be the object and the subject would be\nthe ego standing over against them. \n\nBased on these dichotomies, it seems that the problem of\ntranscendence and its possible denial only pertains to (2). It would\nnot make sense to question the transcendence of the object if by object\nwe mean what occupies the spatial surroundings of a psychophysical\nhuman subject and, similarly, it would not make sense to deny the\ntranscendence of our representations, perceptions, emotions etc. from\nthe point of view of the pure ego-subject undergoing such\nrepresentations, perceptions, emotions, etc. Following the subjective\nway, we should then set out to determine whether we necessarily have to\nposit the existence of transcendent objects independent from the\ncontents of our consciousness. We should, it seems, assume what the\npositivists have called “the standpoint of immanence”\n(Rickert 1921a, 21) and see if there is some rationally justifiable way\nto infer our way out of it. \n\nThis conception however, is misleading and if we took it as our\npoint of departure it would put the whole enterprise of the theory of\nknowledge in jeopardy. Who or what is the subject, for which the\nproblem of transcendence can be meaningfully posed? Rickert indicates\nthat the three concepts of subject considered above ought to be seen in\ntheir mutual relations. If we begin with the psychophysical subject in\n(1), we can obtain the notion of subject in (2) by way of a progressive\n‘objectification’ of the body (Rickert 1921a, 35). I can\nprogressively consider each part of my body as itself an\n‘object’ or content of my consciousness and once the whole\nbody has been ‘purged out’ the result will be a purely\npsychic subject, which Rickert defines as “the limit concept\n(Grenzbegriff) of the series, in which the physical component\nin the subject becomes progressively smaller” (Rickert 1921a,\n36). In a similar way, we can continue the process of\n‘de-objectification’ of the subject and consider each and\nevery mental state as itself an object for an absolutely non-objective\nand non-objectifiable ego. In this way we reach the authentic\nepistemological subject, the identical\n“subject-factor” (Rickert 1921a, 42) that provides the form\n‘subjectivity’ to every possible content of consciousness.\nFollowing Kant’s terminology Rickert designates the\nepistemological subject “consciousness in general”, that is,\na “nameless, generic, impersonal consciousness” (Rickert\n1921a, 42). This consciousness in general has to be distinguished\nsharply not only from the individual psychophysical human subject but\nalso from the individual psychic subject with its empirical mental\nstates. \n\nRickert insists: “The question regarding immanence or\ntranscendence only makes epistemological sense with respect to the\nepistemological subject or consciousness in general” (Rickert\n1921a, 43). From this perspective, “to be immanent means nothing\nbut to carry the form of being-conscious (Bewußtheit)\nand to be transcendent means to really exist without such form”\n(Rickert 1921a, 48). Given these definitions, Rickert contends that\nwhile there are many good reasons to reject psychological idealism, if\none holds fast to consciousness in general there is no good reason to\nposit the existence of a transcendent reality beyond the\nsphere encompassed by the epistemological subject. His theory of\nknowledge is therefore committed to transcendental idealism. In order\nto defend this point Rickert examines three types of arguments that\nhave been traditionally played out against transcendental idealism as\ndefenses of the necessity to posit a transcendent reality: (1)\ntranscendence as the unexperienced cause of conscious experiences\n(Rickert 1921a, 62–73); (2) transcendence as necessary in order to fill\nthe gaps in our conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 74–84); (3)\ntranscendence as the objective counterpart of our will, that is, as the\ncorrelate of the experience of a resistance and constraint to our\nwillful actions (Rickert 1921a, 84–93). All these arguments, however,\nonly show that we cannot reduce reality to psychic existence. In other\nwords, they are good arguments only against a psychological idealism\nà la Berkeley according to which reality would\ncoincide with our empirical mental states. From the point of view of\nthe epistemological subject, however, both psychic and physical\noccurrences are objects whose reality is encompassed by the form\n‘consciousness in general’. A transcendental\nidealist, then, emphatically agrees that there is an extra-mental\nphysical reality causing the occurrence of mental states in empirical\nsubjects. To the extent that they are experienced or experienceable,\nhowever, both extra-mental (physical things) and intra-mental realities\n(mental states) have to be seen as content of consciousness,\nnamely, of transcendental consciousness in general. It is important to\nremember that by ‘consciousness in general’ Rickert means\nno individual psychic subject but the general form of subjective\naccessibility. In other words, to say that all reality is a content of\nconsciousness does not mean that all reality is psychic. It means that\nall reality (both psychic and physical) is encompassed by a general\nform of subjectivity, which makes it available for theoretical\ndetermination. Commenting on his own brand of transcendental idealism,\nRickert states: “our standpoint is the true realism”\n(Rickert 1921a, 104), in that it refuses to counterpose an immanent\npsychic reality to an inaccessible transcendent reality to be posited\nvia inferential reasoning. Rickert insists that transcendental idealism\nconsiders real precisely the reality that we encounter in everyday life\nthrough sensory experience, consisting of immediately aware psychic and\nphysical occurrences. What it rejects is that this reality can be\nmeaningfully construed as transcendent vis-à-vis\nconsciousness in general. \n\nThe reason why one might be prone to reject transcendental idealism\nis a wrong conception of what knowledge really is all about. Rickert\nlabels this conception the copy-theory or pictorial theory\n(Abbildtheorie) of knowledge. According to this conception,\n“the act of knowing has to depict (abbilden) a reality\nindependent from its activity of representing\n(vorstellen)” (Rickert 1921a, 119). The rejection of a\npictorial theory of cognition and the ensuing intuitionism (according\nto which to know is merely to intuit some mind-independent real or\nnoetic object), remains a constant in Rickert’s philosophy (see\nRickert 1934a; Staiti 2013a). It also connects Rickert with other\nNeo-Kantians, including Natorp and Cassirer in Marburg, who likewise\nreject the notion that knowledge is a merely picturing representation\nof the object (see Holzey 2010; Kubalica 2013). \n\nIn order to expose the untenable notions in the pictorial theory of\nknowledge Rickert introduces a distinction between the form\nand the content of cognition. While nothing is wrong with the\nidea that in order to have knowledge we have to take up in some\nrepresentations some content, what distinguishes knowledge from other\nkinds of representation must be sought in its form. If I say\nof a piece of paper that it is white, then certainly “my\nrepresentation reproduces what is real with respect to the white, and\nthis is why the statement is true” (Rickert 1921a, 125). However,\nthis is not all. “In the statement at issue (this piece of paper\nis white), in fact, not only is the being-white asserted\nalongside the being-white, but rather, the white as\n‘property’ is also attributed to a ‘thing’,\nand, in so being, the being-white is determined more specifically.\nThing and property, however, are, as much as being and reality,\nconcepts that do not belong in the content of knowledge. One has to\nknow beforehand what it means epistemologically that a\n‘thing’ has a ‘property’ and what the\nobjectivity of this piece of knowledge rests upon in order to be able\nto say: ‘the thought: this piece of paper is white grasps what is\nreal through pictorial representations” (Rickert 1921a, 125–126;\nRickert 1909, 177). The theorist of knowledge cannot overlook the gulf\nthat exists between the pre-discursive perceptual experience of seeing\na white piece of paper and the articulation of the true judgment\n‘this piece of paper is white’. The judgment does not\nmerely mirror or depict perceptual reality. Rather, the judgment\ntransforms and reshapes the perceptual material delivered by the senses\nby way casting it into a new form, whose legitimacy does not rest in\nthe faithful depiction of the perceptual scene but in the logical\nvalidity of such forms. The problem of the pictorial theory of\ncognition is that it “ignores the form” (Rickert 1909,\n178). \n\nThese considerations lead to one of the key theses in\nRickert’s theory of knowledge: “The fundamental problem of\nthe theory of knowledge is the question regarding the yardstick or the\nobject of judging (Rickert 1921a, 131–132). The\nepistemological subject is not merely a representational subject, but\nrather a judging subject. Judgment is for Rickert the place where the\nstandpoint of immanence is necessarily broken and the genuine meaning\nof transcendence becomes manifest. In his analysis of judgment Rickert\ndraws a sharp distinction between the psychological act of judging and\nthe content (Gehalt) of a judgment, which parallels\nHusserl’s treatment of the same issue in Logical\nInvestigations (Husserl 1973). While the act of judging, say, that\n2 + 2 = 4 is a psychic occurrence unfolding in time and differing for\neach empirical subject making this judgment, the objective content\ngrasped by this act, the true relation 2 + 2 = 4 is timelessly\nvalid and it is one over and against the many psychic acts\ndirected towards it. Moreover, if by real we mean either a psychic or a\nphysical entity, then the content of the judgment 2 + 2 = 4 has to be\ndeemed “unreal” (Rickert 1921a, 145). Taking notice of the\nobjective content of an act and reflecting back on the psychological\nact of judging that intends such content we also have to highlight a\nthird component of a judgment, which Rickert labels\n“immanent sense” of the act (Rickert 1921a, 145), i.e. that\nwhich orients the act towards the judged content. As one commentator\nputs it: “the immanent sense of the judgment stands in an\nintermediate position between the real psychic act and the unreal\nlogical content” (Oliva 2006, 97). It is the function\n(Leistung) performed by the psychic act seen purely and\nexclusively in its functionality of connecting psychological\nsubjectivity and logical objectivity. Determining what kind of immanent\nfunction characterizes judgments and how this function sets them apart\nfrom other kinds of psychic occurrences is Rickert’s next\nstep. \n\nIn order to grasp the epistemological essence of judgment and its\nrelation to the fundamental epistemological problem of transcendence we\nhave to describe its difference from a mere representation or string of\nrepresentations. The best way to characterize the specific essence of\njudgment is by “considering the judgment the answer to a\nquestion” (Rickert 1921a, 153). Rickert thus identifies the\nessence of judgment is thus in the function of “affirmation or\nnegation” (Rickert 1921a, 154), thereby following a trend in\nlogic that dates back to Brentano (see Brentano 1995, 194–234). If we\nconsider exclusively the representational content, the judgment,\n“this paper is white”, and the question, “is this\npaper white?” do not differ in the slightest. The same\nrepresentational elements are there in a meaningful connection. The\ngenuine performance of judgment, for Rickert, is all contained in the\n‘yes’ or ‘no’ that we could answer to the\nquestion, thereby taking a stance with regards to the represented\ncontent. In fact, what distinguishes judgment from all sorts of\nrepresentations is the moment of ‘stance-taking’\n(Stellungnehmen) expressed by the words ‘yes’ or\n‘no’. Judging should then be considered a “practical\ncomportment (Verhalten)” (Rickert 1921a, 165), in which\nsomething is acknowledged as true or rejected as\nfalse. In this regard, judging has to be considered an “act of\nvaluing” (Rickert 1921a, 165). What is it, however,\nthat elicits from the epistemological subject an act of stance-taking?\nRickert explains: “With our act of affirming we can only orient\nourselves toward requirements (Forderungen), only\nvis-à-vis a requirement can we comport ourselves in an endorsing\nfashion. In this way we have obtained the broadest concept for the\nobject of knowledge. What is known, that is, what is affirmed or\nacknowledged in the act of judgment must be located in the sphere of\nthe ‘ought’ (Sollen)” (Rickert 1909, 184).\nThis is the kind of transcendence that Rickert set out to determine at\nthe beginning. The object of knowledge has to be conceived as\ntranscendent, however, not as a transcendent reality mirrored\nby a psychological act of representation but as a “transcendent\nought” (Rickert 1909, 187). This prompts the\ntheoretically oriented subject to affirm the transcendent\ntheoretical value of truth in the necessary connection existing\nbetween the form and the content expressed in a true judgment. \n\nExamining retrospectively the results of this first subjective path\nof the theory of knowledge Rickert points out a number of shortcomings.\nIt seems that if we begin with an analysis of the act of judging, we\ncan only reach the transcendent object of knowledge by way of a\n“petitio principii” (Rickert 1909, 190). If we\ntake our cues from the psychologically perceived “feeling of a\nrequirement” (Forderungsgefühl) and from the\nevidence of the judged content as the “immanent indicator of the\ntranscendent” (Rickert 1909, 189), we have no sufficient reason\nto posit a transcendent object of knowledge unless we somehow already\npresupposed it in the very analysis of this feeling and its\npsychological connotations. It seems that the only conclusion we could\nlegitimately draw without falling into circular reasoning is that when\na certain compelling feeling of evidence occurs, we feel the urge to\naffirm the truth of a certain connection between a form and a content.\nBut this does not really amount to proving that the internally felt\nsense of ought is connected to a transcendent ought. Rickert considers\npetitio principii inherent in the subjective path to be\nproblematic but nonetheless a useful starting point, in that it allows\nus to analyze the meaning of certain fundamental concepts of the theory\nof knowledge such as transcendence, ought, stance-taking and\nrecognition. However, in order to have a complete theory of knowledge,\nan objective or transcendental-logical path has to be taken. \n\nActs of judgments are not the only kinds of realities to which truth\nor falsehood attach. Propositions can also be true or false and their\nmeanings can be taken as a new point of departure for the sake of\ndetermining the transcendent object of knowledge avoiding a petitio\nprincipii (Rickert 1909, 197). The meaning of a proposition can be\ntaken objectively and independently of empirical acts of thought. In\nthis case, we can say of the proposition itself that is either true or\nfalse, without thereby referring to the feeling of evidence or\nnecessity perceived by the subject of judgment. In propositional logic\nwe are accustomed to assign a truth-value to a given\nproposition and in so doing we think of the truth-value as pertaining\nto the proposition itself and not to the immanent psychological act\nthat affirms the proposition’s truth. This is the advantage of\nthe objective path over the subjective path: “The subjective path\nled us to the object as a requirement (Forderung) and this\nrequirement was then interpreted as a transcendent ought. The objective\npath leads us directly to a transcendent value, and this concept yields\nthe form of the object in its purity for the first time. Value and\nought do not coincide. The ought is not the pure value. It represents\nthe unreal as a command and relates it to a subject from which it\ndemands obedience, recognition and submission. This is a secondary and\neven misleading addition. Only the value which rests upon itself and\nholds valid as value […] is the transcendent object”\n(Rickert 1921a, 242). \n\nRickert considers the concept of transcendent value (as pure\nvalidity independent of subjective acts of valuing) the culmination of\nhis theory of knowledge. It is ultimately the theoretical value of\ntruth, the unreal transcendent object, that is\n‘known’ or grasped in every act of true judgment. However,\nthis does not imply a complete rejection or neglect of the valuing\nsubjectivity. Rickert maintains that once the theory of knowledge has\nestablished the absolute transcendence of values and their independence\nfrom empirical acts of valuing, it is then possible to relate values\nback to subjectivity. As we know, the immanent sense of acts\n(Aktsinn) is the unreal component of acts that mediates\nbetween the empirical sphere of psyche and the unreal sphere of values.\nSubjectivity is then interpreted as the ‘middle’ factor\ncapable of mediating between reality and value, and thereby it receives\nits philosophical ‘dignification’. It is fair to say that\nRickert’s work in all other fields of philosophy and in\nparticular in the theory of the empirical sciences is an attempt to\nreconstruct the meaning of various spheres of reality and knowledge\nfrom his fundamental insight into the transcendence of values. \n\nRickert’s theory of science is primarily geared towards a\nphilosophical elucidation of the natural and the historical sciences.\nThis is intended to provide a defense of the sui generis\nscientificity of the historical sciences against the threat of\npositivism and naturalism. Rickert’s work on this issue builds\nupon Windelband’s influential paper History and Natural\nScience (Windelband 1980, 169–185). While Rickert criticizes some\nterminological and argumentative limits of his teacher’s essay,\nthe bulk of his lengthy volume, The Limits of Concept Formation in\nNatural Science: An Introduction to the Historical Sciences\n(Rickert 1986), is consistent with the tenets of Windelband’s\nposition. \n\nWindelband pointed out that the customary distinction of the\nempirical sciences into natural sciences and\nGeisteswissenschaften (that is, literally spiritual or mental\nsciences and used in German to indicate the humanities and the social\nsciences) is deeply misleading (Windelband 1980, 173). This is because\nit seems to suggest that these two groups of sciences differ primarily\nwith respect to their subject matter, that is, in the first case\n‘nature’ and in the second case ‘mind’.\nHowever, there are at least two problems with this classification: (1)\na significant number of disciplines commonly considered\nGeisteswissenschaften have little or nothing to do with the\nstudy of the human mind. Take, for instance, art history, political\neconomics or archeology. None of these disciplines seems to have mental\nprocesses and states as their subject matter. (2) According to this\nclassification psychology should be considered a\nGeisteswissenschaft and presumably even the most fundamental\nof all Geisteswissenschaften in that it studies the human mind\nin the most direct and rigorous fashion. Indeed, in late nineteenth\ncentury Germany there was a widely spread expectation that progress in\npsychology should have led to significant reforms in all other\nhumanistic fields of research. This expectation, however, clashes with\nthe fact that psychology’s method is much more similar to that of\nphysics, chemistry, and biology than with that of literary studies or\nmusicology. Psychology, too, seeks to determine its subject matter in\nterms of general laws and works with the aid of mathematical\nmodels and experiments. Considering these anomalies Windelband’s\nproposal is to drop content-related distinctions altogether and rely\nexclusively on a methodological distinction between\n“nomothetic” and “idiographic” sciences\n(Windelband 1980, 175). One group of sciences works by way of positing\ngeneral laws and understanding its objects as examples of such general\nlaws (nomo-thetic). Another group of sciences aims at producing\nilluminating descriptions of irreducibly individual and unrepeatable\noccurrences (idiographic). Most importantly, “the same subjects\ncan be the object of both a nomothetic and an idiographic\ninvestigation” (Windelband 1980, 175). From this purely\nmethodological point of view, sciences like psychology, physics,\nchemistry, and biology all belong in the same group as nomothetic,\nwhereas sciences like history, art history, and musicology are to be\nconsidered idiographic. This distinction is meant to reorganize the\nuniverse of knowledge and to avoid unhelpful encroachments of empirical\npsychology on the work of humanistic disciplines, whose theoretical\naims are fundamentally alien to nomothetic inquiry. \n\nRickert enhances and corrects Windelband’s perspective in two\nways: (1) He revises his terminology and rejects the phrase\n‘idiographic’, which seems to suggest a purely pictorial or\nreproductive procedure. This would not qualify as knowledge by\nRickert’s epistemological standards (see Zijderveld 2006,\n246–255; Ferrari 1998). (2) He insists on the necessity of\nbeginning a reflection on the classification of the sciences with\na purely methodological criterion, but only to articulate subsequently a\nmore adequate content-related distinction to replace the customary\nNaturwissenschaft/Geisteswissenschaft pair (Rickert 1962,\n11). \n\nRickert defines the task of a logical/methodological investigation\nof the sciences in the following terms: “The logical\ndistinctiveness of an empirical science is to be understood in terms of\nthe relationship the content of its concepts bears to empirical reality\nin its unique and distinctive form” (Rickert 1986, 114). In\nother words, the task of a theory of science is to determine how the\nscience under scrutiny forms its concepts and in so doing\novercomes the unsurveyable, “immeasurable manifold”\n(Rickert 1962, 32) of empirical reality as it is given in intuition.\nConcept formation for Rickert indicates “the conclusion of an\ninvestigation” (Rickert 1986, 27), that is the fulfillment of the\nscientific task posed at the beginning of that investigation. In\nkeeping with his general rejection of a pictorial theory of knowledge\n(see above), Rickert rejects the view that the empirical sciences would\nsimply have to depict (abbilden) reality as it is in itself.\nRather, the task of the empirical sciences is to re-mold\n(umbilden) immediately given reality and form\nconcepts, in which only a small fraction of the original given\nis taken up. The criteria for such selections and re-molding activities\nculminating in the formation of a scientific concept are the\nspecific preoccupation of the philosophy of science. \n\nAs for the natural sciences, Rickert contends that Kant already\nprovided a satisfactory definition of their logical structure. In the\nProlegomena Kant stated: “Nature is the\nexistence of things, insofar as [sofern] that\nexistence is determined according to universal laws” (Kant 2002,\n89; Rickert 1962, 5). Following Kant, Rickert defines the natural\nsciences as generalizing (Rickert 1986, 34; Rickert 1962, 46),\nthat is, they form their concepts by way of moving away from\nthe individual, unrepeatable occurrences encountered in experience. As\nWindelband already saw, the natural sciences view individual\noccurrences as mere examples of general laws. In this way,\nindividuality “fixes the limits of natural scientific\nconcept formation” (Rickert 1986, 40) and calls forth its logical\ncomplement: “individualizing concept-formation”\n(Rickert 1986, 62) as the method defining the historical sciences. The\nlogical distinction between the sciences, then, has to be between the\ngeneralizing natural sciences and the individualizing historical\nsciences. In other words, while the natural sciences build their\nconcepts by way of disregarding what is individual, the historical\nsciences build their concepts in order to grasp precisely what is\nindividual. \n\nHow are we to understand, then, historical individuality?\nRickert’s definition unfolds in three stages (Rickert 1986, 98).\n(1) In the broadest sense, the individual is every single empirical\nreality in its uniqueness and distinctiveness. This, however, is not\nyet historically relevant individuality. (2) In a more\nspecific and etymological sense, a historical individual is what\n“should not be divided” (Rickert 1986, 85), that is, it is\nan individual whose “uniqueness is related to a value”\n(Rickert 1986, 84). Rickert suggests to compare a lump of coal and the\nfamous Koh-i-noor diamond. While the lump of coal can be split at any\ntime without any significant loss, the Koh-i-noor ought not be\nspilt because it is a good, that is, a bit of reality related\nto a value and valued by any subject capable of carrying out\nvaluations. (3) The historical individual as the object of the\nhistorical sciences has to be a good related to generally\nacknowledged values as opposed to merely personal values. In other\nwords, while a certain item can be valuable to me as an individual (for\ninstance, because a beloved person gave it to me), this is not enough\nto make it an object of historical interest. The Koh-i-noor, on the\ncontrary, has a more than merely individual historical relevance\nbecause it is inextricably related to the historical vicissitudes of\nIndia and British colonialism. \n\nThe notions of value and value-relatedness are\ncrucial to determine Rickert’s material or\ncontent-related (inhaltlich) criterion for the demarcation of\nthe sciences. In this respect we have to distinguish between the\nvalue-free sphere of nature and the value-related sphere of\nculture (Rickert 1962, 21). Accordingly, the material\ndistinction that has to replace the customary distinction between\nnatural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften is the distinction\nbetween the sciences of nature (value-free objects) and the sciences of\nculture (value-related objects). It is the reference to objectively\nacknowledged cultural values that ‘preserves’ the\nindividuality of empirical objects and makes them relevant to\nhistorical inquiry. \n\nIn the context of this distinction Rickert insists on the important\ndistinction between Wertung, or valuation, and\nWertbeziehung, or the act of relating something to a value.\nThe two notions stand in sharp opposition. While human subjects in\ntheir practical lives constantly engage in valuations resulting in\npositive or negative value-judgments, the historical scientist must\nabstain from every act of valuation and limit herself to the\nascertainment of objective value-relations in the cultural materials\nunder scrutiny. “Accordingly, if it is to express the character\nof history as a theoretical science, the procedure that we speak of as\noriented to values is to be most sharply separated from one\nthat posits values. This means that history treats values only\nin so far as they are actually accepted by subjects so that\ncertain objects are actually denoted as goods. Thus, even if\nhistory deals with values, it is not a science that posits\nvalues” (Rickert 1962, 89). Rickert gives the following example\nto illustrate this distinction: “We can regard the personality of\nLuther as either a good thing or a bad thing. In other words, we can\nbelieve that it was a stroke of luck for the cultural development of\nGermany or that it brought misfortune. On this point, the opinions of\nhistorians will probably always be in disagreement. But no one who\nknows the facts will doubt that Luther had some sort of\nsignificance with reference to generally acknowledged values,\nand it can never occur to a historian to claim that Luther’s\npersonality is historically unimportant” (Rickert 1986,\n93; for a critical response to this view see Oakes 1988, 111–144). \n\nBy contrasting the generalizing method of the natural sciences dealing\nwith value-free objects and the individualizing (i.e., historical)\nmethod of the cultural sciences dealing with value-related objects,\nRickert does not mean to say that values play no role in the natural\nsciences or that generalizing procedures and general objects are\ncompletely absent form the cultural sciences. On the contrary, he\nemphasizes that “natural science is not free of\nvaluations” (Rickert 1986, 93). In a way that anticipates much\nlate twentieth century philosophy of science (see for instance Laudan\n1985; Lacey 1999; Allchin 1999) Rickert insists that natural science\nand, for that matter, science in general obeys “logical values\nto which the investigator is committed, and which are implicitly\npresupposed in all scientific concept formation” (Rickert 1986,\n94). What remains ‘value-free’ is the material that the\nnatural sciences investigate. To stay with the above example, for a\nmineralogist studying diamonds the Koh-i-noor will be merely an\ninstance of some general law of crystallization as much as any other\ndiamond. It is not considered in its relation to culturally\nacknowledged values. On the other hand, the historical sciences do not\ncompletely dispense with elements of generality. Rickert identifies\nfour senses in which ‘the general’ is at play in\nhistorical research.  “First, the elements of all scientific\nconcepts are general” (Rickert 1986, 115). This means that, for\nexample, in order to form the concept ‘French Revolution’\nwe have to use general concepts such as ‘French’ and\n‘revolution’. However, these two general concepts are\ncompounded in order to capture a unique historical event. In a second\nsense, as we saw, history has to take into account the relation of\nevents and objects to general values. However, the fact that\na certain object has a reference to a general value (e.g. the French\nRevolution bears a reference to the general value ‘political\nfreedom’) does not make the concept of that object general.\n“Third, historical science never regards individuals in\nisolation, as the generalizing sciences do, but in a general\nnexus” (Rickert 1986, 115). We cannot understand the\nindividual Robespierre unless we view his actions in the meaningful\ngeneral context of the French Revolution. Such ‘nexus’,\nhowever, is not itself a general concept but is itself an\n‘individual’, that is, a unique and unrepeatable\nconstellation of events. Fourth, in some cases the historical\nscientist will deliberately study groups of individuals, say,\nlate-medieval serfs in Holland. In this case single individuals\n(either people or objects) will be seen as mere examples of dynamics\nand characteristics pertaining to their group in a way that seems to\nresemble the generalizing procedure of natural science.  However, even\nin this case the historian is not interested in the ‘general\nnature’ of human groups but in the individuality of the group at\nissue. \n\nRickert engaged in a lifelong controversy with another prominent\ntheorist of the human sciences, Wilhelm Dilthey (on the controversy see\nMakkreel/Luft 2010 and Makkreel 2010). Dilthey advocated the necessity\nto maintain a primarily content-related distinction to demarcate\ndifferent ambits of science and he defended the legitimacy of the\nphrase Geisteswissenschaft. Dilthey rejected the argument that\npsychology could not be foundational for the human sciences because of\nits methodological similarity to the natural sciences. He considered\nthe empirical (or, in his language, explanative) psychology of his time\nto be deeply flawed in that it imitated the methods of the natural\nsciences without paying attention to the specificity of the mental\ndomain (Dilthey 2010, 119). Psychology, for Dilthey, should be\nconducted in a descriptive-analytical spirit, starting off from the\noverall meaningfulness and intelligibility of mental phenomena and\nworking to describe the intricate connections or nexuses of\nsignificance characterizing human life (Dilthey 2010, 182). “Such\na psychology will become the foundation of the human sciences, just as\nmathematics grounds the natural sciences” (Dilthey 2010, 165).\nThis is because, for Dilthey, all the products of culture studied by\nthe human sciences are nothing but “psychic life that has become\nobjective, […] the products of active forces of a psychic nature\nand stable configurations formed from psychic elements and their\nlaws” (Dilthey 2010, 171). For this reason, Dilthey contends that\nin the human sciences we can only understand, as opposed to\nexplain, (Dilthey 2010, 119) cultural products (poems,\nartworks, juridical systems, etc.) to the extent that we\nreactivate the psychic life at their origin and\nrelive (nacherleben) the life-experience that brought\nthem about. If we had theoretical tools provided by a descriptive\npsychology to orient ourselves in the complexity of psychic\nobjectifications, we would make significant advancements in the human\nsciences, too. \n\nRickert is willing to grant the “paramount significance of\nmental beings within the historical material” (Rickert 1986, 123)\nand the importance of “historical personalities that\nvaluate” (Rickert 1986, 122) for the cultural sciences. He is\nalso open to the use of Geist, provided that this term is\nconsidered synonymous with culture. However, he insists that\nDilthey’s emphasis on psychic life and reliving is both\nsystematically and methodologically misleading. First, not all\nof psychic life is relevant in the cultural sciences. Most psychic\nmanifestations, both those occurring in individuals and those\nobjectified in cultural objects, are completely devoid of historical\nsignificance, in that they lack the reference to a general value.\nSecond, even if we had the capacity to relive past experiences in their\ntotal intensity and vividness, this would not amount to\nunderstanding those experiences and their cultural\nobjectifications. In the historical sciences, too, to know does not\nmean merely to mirror or depict a real object. Only if the notion of\nvalue and the objective value-relatedness of historical\nindividuals (be they physical or psychic) are taken as the\nsystematic point of departure can the subjectivity involved in history\nbe adequately understood. “The fact that history is a science of\nmental entities does not determine its logical structure, for mental\nprocesses can also be represented in a natural scientific or\ngeneralizing fashion. Rather, the converse is true: On the basis of the\nlogical structure of historical science […] it can be understood\nwhy history primarily takes a certain kind of mental life as the object\nof its investigation” (Rickert 1986, 127). \n\nRickert’s theory of generalizing and individualizing concept\nformation as the systematically fundamental criterion for the\ndemarcation of science elicited other waves of criticism. Husserl, for\nexample, considered it an oversimplification of the Kantian problem of\nthe transcendental deduction in that Rickert simply takes for granted\nthat the infinite, unsurveyable manifold of immediate experience is\namenable to conceptualization (Husserl 2001, 91). However, given his\npremises it is hard to see why a completely chaotic and heterogeneous\nimmediate experience would nonetheless lend itself to conceptual\nrationalization. The problem, according to Husserl, is that for Rickert\n“world-experience (Welterfahrung) remains an empty\nword” (Husserl 2001, 100). Moreover, and similarly to Dilthey,\nHusserl laments the fact that Rickert downplays historically active\nsubjectivity as the source of culture. Like Rickert, Husserl\ndistinguishes between nature and culture in terms of “the world\nconsidered without significance” as opposed to “the world\nfull of significance” (Husserl 2002, 139), however, he\nimmediately relates back such significance to the operations of\n“meaning-bestowing subjectivity, which endows things with\nspiritual meaning [vergeistigen] through operations of\nsignificance [Bedeutungsleistungen]” (Husserl 2002,\n140). For this reason, Husserl considers the whole dispute about\nwhether the correct pair of concepts to demarcate the ambits of science\nshould be nature/Geist (Dilthey) or nature/culture (Rickert)\n“a mere verbal dispute” (Husserl 2002, 140). Another line\nof criticism of Rickert’s distinction comes from his student,\nEmil Lask. In his personal notes Lask forcefully asserts that “a\npurely logical meaning of nature must be absolutely denied” (Lask\n1924, 272). Lask argues that in Rickert’s reconstruction\nnatural-scientific generalization and historical individualization are\ntreated as equally legitimate and complementary ways of conceptualizing\nempirical reality. Against this view Lask contends that the\ngeneralizations carried out by the natural sciences presuppose a\npreliminary ‘devitalization’ (Ertötung) and\n‘quantification’ of reality, in which the dimension of\nsignificance and value is put out of play (Lask 1924, 244). In a way\nthat anticipates Husserl’s later treatment of this issue in\nThe Crisis of the European Sciences (Husserl 1970). Lask points\nout that our original experience of the world is pervaded with value\nand significance and it is only by way of an abstractive impoverishment\nof this original experience that the natural sciences create their\nvalue-free (and to that extent artificial) field of research. As a\nmatter of fact, however, there is evidence that Rickert was well aware\nof the quantifying tendency of natural science (see for instance\nRickert 1900, 76), although he did not assign to it a central role. \n\nWhile Rickert does not believe that significant progress in the\nhistorical sciences of culture can be expected from the development of\npsychology, he believes that a philosophy of history grounded\nin an unconditionally valid system of values (Rickert 1924a, 118) would\nbe of paramount importance. If philosophy were able to identify and\njustify a formal set of values common to all cultures and historical\nconstellations, then the historical sciences could employ such a formal\nset of values to orient their inquiries. In order to do this, however,\nphilosophy cannot simply rely on empirical generalizations. Given the\nmultiplicity of cultures and the complexity of human history, it would\nbe impossible to adopt a generalizing procedure in order to identify a\nrobust set of values common to all. “Rather, it would be\nappropriate to reflect (completely independently of the multiplicity of\nthe historical material) on that which holds valid by necessity, that\nis, the formal presupposition of each value-judgment claiming more than\nindividual validity. Only when such timelessly valid formal values are\nfound will it be possible to relate them to the plenitude of\nempirically detectable values actually developed in history”\n(Rickert 1924a, 118). Rickert underscores in various places that such\nsystem, however, should be understood as completely “open”\n(Rickert 1913, 297; Rickert 1921b, 348–355; see Bohlken 2002, 124).\nThis means that it is intended to provide merely the “most\nencompassing framework in which all meaningful cultural life plays\nitself out” (Rickert 1934b, 225). The areas of values identified\nin the system can be filled with the most diverse concrete historical\nvalues. \n\nRickert’s first attempt to articulate a timelessly valid\nsystem of values can be found in his paper On the System of\nValues (Rickert 1913). The position developed here was eventually\nrecast and schematized visually in the first (and only) volume of his\nSystem of Philosophy (Rickert 1921b). Rickert begins his\ninquiry by describing different kinds of goods, that is,\nconcrete objects related to values. His intent is to read off the\nobjectively valid values from concrete classes of goods. The human\ncreation of goods related to values follows a general impulse towards\n“completion” (Vollendung), which can be best\ndescribed as the attainment of a certain goal. Moreover, each\nrealization of values in a good can be understood as the work on a\ncertain ‘content’, which receives a value-related form.\nSuch content can be interpreted as a whole consisting of\nparts. Starting from these abstract distinctions, Rickert\nidentifies three domains of goods, that of the “uncompletable\n(unendlich) totality”, that of “fully completed\n(voll-endlich) particularity” and that which synthesizes\nthe two in a “fully completed totality” (Rickert 1913,\n302). To each of these domains of goods Rickert assigns a temporal\ndimension, such that the goods of un-ending totality are goods of the\nfuture, those of fully completed particularity are goods of the present\nand those of fully completed totality are goods of eternity. A further\noverarching distinction, however, cuts across these three domains of\ngoods, thus giving as a result six domains: the distinction\nbetween contemplation and activity, whose parallel categories\nof objects are “thing” and “person”. After\nfleshing out this general scheme Rickert fills in the six domains with\nactual values and the corresponding cultural activities according to\nthe following schema (Rickert 1921b, annex): \n\nThe following points are distinctive of Rickert’s approach to\nvalues as presented in the above table: \n\n(1) Note that Rickert distinguishes the way in which values\nrelate to their materials in the spheres of contemplation and in the\nsphere of practice. In his language, the value of truth\n‘encompasses’ scientific theories and likewise the value of\nbeauty encompasses works of art. This means that the value is\nexperienced as something essentially ‘beyond’ the\nparticular theory or artwork at issue. On the contrary, in the sphere\nof practice values ‘pervade’ their materials, that is to\nsay they structure them ‘from within’, as it were.  \n\n(2) Rickert prides himself on having ‘discovered’ and\ndefended the autonomy of the fifth domain of values, which he labels\n‘erotics’ (Rickert 1913, 313–319). Erotics is the\nsphere of practical life in which subjects cultivate specific values\nattaching to their relationships to particular people or groups of\npeople. According to Rickert in the philosophical tradition this\nautonomous domain has been unduly overshadowed by the domain of\nethics, which constantly tried to impose its distinctive values on\nerotics (Rickert 1921b, 406). However, for Rickert our practical life\nwould be unbearable if it were dedicated exclusively to the pursuit of\nethical values and the utopian ideal of a community of free subjects\n(that is, Kant’s kingdom of ends). We need a particular sphere of\nrelationships in which the practical thrust of our social life finds\nfull realization in the present. The values characterizing these\nspheres, such as family, homeland, religious community, etc. need to\nbe respected and studied as a class of values in its own right. \n\n(3) Rickert assigns an important role to religion in the\ntotality of cultural life (see Crowe 2010). He points out an inevitable\ntension between the pursuit of goods of totality in domains (1) and\n(4), which are ultimately unattainable in our earthly life, and the\npursuit of goods of particularity in (2) and (5), which are fully\nattainable but inevitably finite. Religion opens up the space for\n‘transcendent syntheses’, in which this tension is overcome\nthrough the pursuit of goods of eternity. These, in Rickert’s\nview, do justice to both our human desire for infinity and our human\nneed for actually experienced fulfillment. Mysticism thus offers a\ntranscendent synthesis between the sense of fulfillment characterizing\naesthetic contemplation and the unending process of scientific\ntheorein via conceptual knowledge. Similarly, the religious\ndevotion to a divinity experienced as ‘dwelling among us’\n(in both polytheistic and monotheistic religions) promises a\ntranscendent synthesis between the values of ethics and those of\nerotics. \n\n(4) For Rickert, however, the transcendent syntheses promised\nby religion are prefigured, as it were, in two earthly kinds of\nsyntheses, that is, the love between man and woman in the sphere of\npractice and the production of a philosophical system oriented towards\na comprehensive worldview-theory in the sphere of contemplation. As for\nthe love between man and woman, Rickert’s view rests on the\ndubious assumption that women are “essentially” more\noriented toward the realization of goods of the present, while men are\n“essentially” more oriented toward the realization of goods\nof the future (Rickert 1921b, 403). Since no meaningful existence can\nbe devoted exclusively to one type of goods (the goods of the\nfuture being ultimately unattainable and the goods of the present being\nultimately too narrow), Rickert argues that the “personal\nunion” (Rickert 1921b, 402) between man and woman amounts to a\nmutual completion and a synthesis of the two domains of values.\nNeedless to say, to a contemporary reader this view sounds extremely\nantiquated and even sexist. However, it has to be interpreted in the\ncontext of Rickert’s time. In his eyes, insisting on the mutual\ncompletion and irreducibility of the values traditionally associated\nwith masculinity and those traditionally associated with feminineness\n(Rickert 1921b, 403) was a way to defend the equal value of men and\nwomen in the whole of cultural life. Philosophy as a worldview-theory\nbased on the system of values, in turn, can provide a comprehensive\npicture of the world in which all contemplative and practical activity\ntakes place. To the extent that it strives towards a comprehensive\nsystem, however, philosophy tends to exceed the sphere of theoretical\ngoods (Rickert 1921b, 408). Instead of partaking in the indefinitely\nopen work of the specialized sciences philosophy attempts to survey the\ntotality of cultural life and to systematically determine its\nunderlying value-related structure. In each successfully articulated\nphilosophical system we then find a completed cultural good,\nwhich differs from the characteristic open-endedness of theories in the\nspecialized sciences. The philosopher thus occupies the middle ground\nbetween the scientist moving indefinitely forward in her specialized\ninvestigations and the artist striving to produce a complete\nartwork. Philosophy, then, can then be considered an immanent synthesis\nbetween the unending totality characterizing the goods of science and\nthe particularity characterizing the goods of art. \n\nRickert’s conception of philosophy is tightly connected to his\nnotion of worldview. Worldview (Weltanschauung) was a buzzword\nin early twentieth century German culture. Life-philosophers and\nanti-rationalists used the phrase ‘Weltanschauung’\nto designate the inherently elusive and obscure source of all cultural\nlife and thinking (see Dilthey 1960, 80; Simmel 1996, 29; Mannheim\n1952, 38). On this reading philosophy is nothing but the conceptual\narticulation of pre-theoretical worldviews that are inextricably\nrelated to the historical, psychological, and cultural conditions of\nindividual philosophers. Worldview philosophy was extremely critical of\nall attempts to describe the discipline as a science, that is, as a\npurely theoretical enterprise. Rooted in existentially grounded\nworldviews, philosophy is an expression of the whole human\nbeing and not merely an impersonal conceptual construction of the\none-sided ‘theoretical man’ (see Staiti 2013b, 795–799). \n\nRickert agrees that philosophy, unlike the specialized empirical\nsciences, must be oriented toward the world as a whole\n(Weltganze), and not merely toward this or that specific part\nof the world (Rickert 1910, 1; Rickert 1934, 1). However, he firmly\nrejects the view that, in order to grasp the world as a whole,\nphilosophers ought to shun the ideal of scientificity and work as\nwhole human beings merely expressing what their existential\nintuition of the world-whole suggests. In this regard, for Rickert,\nthe phrase ‘worldview’ should designate the goal\nof philosophical work and not philosophy’s obscure existential\norigin. Furthermore, the goal of a comprehensive theory of\nworldview can only be achieved with the aid of concepts and logical\nthinking, that is, adopting a scientific standpoint. Contra\nDilthey, Simmel, and the antirationalist life-philosophers Rickert\npoints out that “only the one-sided, theoretically oriented man\nis able to reflect upon the world in its totality” (Rickert\n1933, 50). On the contrary, “[t]he whole human being, precisely\nas ‘whole’ or ‘existing’ human being, will\nnever transcend his ‘small’ world and this small world\ninevitably takes on different shapes for different people. For the\npre-scientific man only that which stands in an essential connection\nwith his own life can become ‘world’” (Rickert 1933,\n49–50; see Staiti 2013b: 799–804). Rickert contends that the historical beginnings of\nphilosophy in ancient Greece coincide with the birth of a purely\n‘theoretical man’, that is, of a subject who pursues\nknowledge for knowledge’s sake and in so doing discloses a dimension\nof totality unknown to natural, practically oriented human subjects\n(Rickert 1923b). \n\nIn order to produce knowledge about the world as a whole, philosophy\ncannot rely on empirical methods like the specialized sciences do, nor\ncan it simplistically project one concept or set of concepts describing\none of the world’s parts onto the world-whole. For Rickert\nphilosophy has to rely on what he calls “the heterological\nprinciple” (Rickert 1921b, 57; Rickert 1934b, 39). Scholars agree\nthat the notion of heterology is the most distinctive element of\nRickert’s philosophy (Glockner 1937, 11; Flach 1958, 564; Orth\n1998, 81) and even his “principle of all principles”\n(Krijnen 2001, 256). Heterology is a relational mode of thinking, which\nRickert considers paramount to the theoretical determination of objects\nin general (Rickert 1921b, 57) and utterly unavoidable for a conceptual\ngrasp of totalities. It consists in using a pair of mutually\nexclusive concepts, that is, concepts that negate each other, and take\nthem together as complementary. To think heterologically means to posit\na given initial concept (thesis) and then proceed to posit a\nsecond concept that can be seen as its ‘other’\n(hetero-thesis), so that the two concepts taken together cover\nthe entirety of the totality to be theoretically determined.\n“Wherever we can construct concepts that, through their\ndeterminations (i.e., their limitations), do not merely negate, but\nthey simultaneously determine positively the negated component that is\nmissing from the whole, we can think in terms of alternatives. In so\ndoing we are able to grasp conceptually, through a kind of detour, a\nwhole that cannot be grasped through concepts in a direct fashion. This\nis because we can construct two concepts, under which every element\nbelonging to the whole necessarily falls” (Rickert 1934b, 34). We\nalready encountered heterological pairs of concepts in the previous\nsections, for instance, the transcendental-psychological and the\ntranscendental-logical paths in the theory of knowledge and\ngeneralizing and individualizing concept formation in the theory of\nscience (see above.) In both cases the two opposite concepts, if taken\ntogether, circumscribe a totality: in the first case, the totality of\nepistemology, and, in the second case, the totality of scientific\nmethods in empirical research. The ‘test’ for successful\nheterological reasoning is that the negation of one of the two related\nconcepts results positively into the other concept, so that one can be\na priori certain that any item not falling under the first\nconcept necessarily falls under the second concept. As an\nexample Rickert illustrates how to determine heterologically the\ntotality of bodies (Rickert 1934b, 42). We can start with the thesis\n‘organic living bodies’ and if we proceed to negate it we\nsee that the merely negative concept ‘~ organic living\nbodies’ immediately results in the positive concept ‘dead\nmechanical bodies’. Taken together the two concepts amount to a\nsuccessful theoretical grasp of the whole ‘bodies’. We can\nsee with evidence that within the totality ‘bodies’,\nwhatever body does not fall under the category ‘organic living\nbody’ necessarily falls under the category ‘dead mechanical\nbody’. Using heterology philosophy can reflect upon the world as\na whole in terms of “world-alternatives” (Rickert 1934b,\n42) and set out to determine what pair of concepts is best suited to\nencompass the totality of what is. As we know from previous sections,\nRickert contends that the pair of concepts nature/psyche does not\nwithstand the heterological test, in that what is not nature can be\neither psyche or timelessly valid value. Ultimately\nfor Rickert the correct heterology in terms of which we can approach\nphilosophically the world as a whole is reality/value (Rickert 1913,\n11). This is because whatever is not an empirical reality (be\nit physical or psychic) lies necessarily in the sphere of value and\nvice versa. Once this broad categorization of the world as whole is\nestablished, philosophy can set out to determine more specifically the\nsubordinated wholes out of which the world as a whole is constituted\nand to articulate meaningfully their mutual relations. \n\nFrom roughly the beginning of the 1920s Rickert’s philosophy\nis characterized by what has been referred to as an “ontological\nturn” (Farges 2010, 26; Kuttig 1987). However, in Rickert’s\neyes the introduction of ontology is not a departure from his earlier\nepistemological focus or the leap into a completely new philosophical\ndimension. As his definition of ontology as “the doctrine of what\nis predicated as being” (Rickert 1934b, 54) already suggests,\nontological questions are deeply connected to questions about judgment\nand predication. In other words, if we take our knowledge to consist of\njudgments and if we take our judgments to consist of a formal and a\nmaterial component, then it is legitimate to ask what is the\nmaterial component cast into conceptual forms in judgments. As the\nopening quote of this section indicates, for Rickert it is important to\nuphold pluralism in ontology. In keeping with the pluralism of\nmeaningful predication (there is a plurality of things that we can\nmeaningfully articulate judgments about), we cannot dogmatically\npresuppose that there is only one meaning of the\n‘being’ addressed in our predicative activities. In this\nregard, far from being detrimental to a genuine ontological\ninvestigation, Rickert’s insistence on the preeminence of\nepistemology turns out to have a positive effect on ontology. If the\ncompass to orient ourselves in ontology is meaningful predication, then\nwe are from the beginning immune to dogmatic reductions of what\nis to one monistically conceived dimension of reality (Rickert\n1934b, 57). \n\nRickert’s ontology contemplates four “kinds of being\n(Seinsarten) of the world” (Rickert 1934b, 153): (1)\nsensible (sinnlich) being; (2) non-sensible\n(unsinnlich) being; (3) pro-physical (pro-physisches)\nbeing; (4) supersensible (übersinnlich) being. \n\n(1) Sensible being is the ontological category under which\nfall both physical and psychological being, that is, material things\nand mental states. Both the sphere of the physical and the sphere of\nthe psychological are directly accessible to experience (Rickert 1934b,\n63–64) and can be the object of meaningful predication. Therefore they\nmust be granted equal ontological worth. Psychophysical dualism,\nhowever, causes the classical problems of mind-body causal interaction\nversus mind-body parallelism. Rickert’s sympathies are clearly\nwith the idea of psychophysical causality (both body to mind and mind\nto body) versus the hypothesis of psychophysical parallelism and the\nensuing panpsychism (Rickert 1900). He considers psychophysical\nparallelism a self-undermining hypothesis to the extent that it relies\non the atomization and quantification of psyche. Defenders of\npsychophysical parallelism (such as Baruch Spinoza and Gustav Fechner)\nintroduced this hypothesis in order to preserve the autonomy of the\npsyche as the domain of the qualitative, which they take to be\nessentially different from merely quantitative physical being. However,\nin order to articulate their model they have to rely on a\nquantification of the psyche, which undercuts precisely the premise,\nbased on which psychophysical parallelism was considered a good\nalternative to psychophysical causality to begin with (Rickert 1900,\n76; Rickert 1934b, 66–73). The reason why the idea of a two-way causal\nlink between mental and physical being seems to pose an impossible\npuzzle is that, prima facie, the order of the psychic and the\norder of the physical strike us as belonging to two separate\nontological domains. However, for Rickert this is because we generally\noverlook the tertium comparationis, which proves that they\nactually belong in one an the same ontological dimension, namely, that\nthey are both domains of sensible being, i.e., being that is\ndirectly accessible to perception. From this perspective causal\ninteraction between mind and body is nothing but causal interaction\nbetween two ontologically homogeneous species of one and the same\nontological genus ‘sensible being’. To be sure, the\nphysical and the psychic display vastly different characteristics\n(extension vs. unextendedness; intentionality vs. lack of\nintentionality; spatiotemporal individuation vs. temporal\nindividuation.) However, for Rickert this is not enough reason to\nconsider the two dimensions as ontologically heterogeneous. If they are\nontologically homogeneous, then it is the task of specialized empirical\nresearch and not of philosophy to determine their causal relations. \n\n(2) The ontological homogeneity of the physical and the\npsychic becomes even more clear if we turn our attention to a\ncompletely different ontological sphere, which taken together\nheterologically with sensible being completes the concept of the world\nof experience (Erfahrungswelt). The second kind of being in\nRickert’s ontology is what he calls non-sensible being.\nIn order to introduce non-sensible being Rickert recommends that we\nturn our attention to word-meanings (Rickert 1934b, 79). While having a\nconversation, we do not only perceive the physical body of our\ninterlocutor and the psychic reality attached to it. We also\n‘receive’ in the same direct, immediate way the meanings of\nthe words that he or she is uttering. These meanings are not psychic\nrealities. They do not coincide with the thoughts of the speaker or\nwith the acoustic stimuli of the listener. The very same meanings could\nbe conveyed by a completely different sensible ‘support’\nsuch as ink scribbles on paper. We can even recognize the same meaning\nas being instantiated by different words in different languages, such\nas the identical meaning of ‘red’, ‘rot’,\n‘rosso’ and ‘rouge’. While the meaning of words\nmust be carried by some sensible support, it is itself not\nsensible. It is not sensed or perceived but rather understood.\nThis is why Rickert proposes to call the second ontological domain the\nnon-sensible sphere of understandable meaning-configurations\n(verstehbare Sinngebilde) (Rickert 1934b, 81). Word-meanings,\nhowever, are only a tiny fraction of the meaning-configurations that we\ncan experience. The arrangement of the musical notes in a symphony is\nlikewise understood as a meaning-configuration possibly carried by\ndifferent sensible supports—the same melody can be played in a\ndifferent key, with a different instrument, it can be sung, etc.\nLooking at the works of a great artist we can understand one and the\nsame non-sensible meaning-configuration (say, the same\n‘style’) realized sensibly in different media. The universe\nof meaning-configurations constitutes for Rickert an authentic\nmundus intelligibilis experienced in concomitance with but as\ndifferent from the mundus sensibilis of perceivable being.\nHowever, he takes pains to remind us that we should not repeat the old\nPlatonic mistake of taking the world of non-sensible being to be a\nmetaphysically separate reality. Understandable meaning-configurations\nare an ingredient of our everyday experience and so they have to be\ncounted among the ontological ingredients of the experiential world. In\nexploring the world of meaning-configurations we must take into account\nthe principles that allow for meaning-configurations to be\nintelligible. Not every string of words is intelligible and, most\nimportantly, not every intelligible string of words is true. The same\nholds for every meaning-configuration. It is intelligible only if its\nconstitutive non-sensible elements are held together by the reference\nto a specific value. True sentences, for instance, are unified\nby their reference to the theoretical value of truth. In this way,\nRickert clarifies the ontological status of values as non-sensible\nbeings. The real dualism pertaining to the world of experience, then,\nis not the one between body and mind but the one between the sensible\nworld of perceivable entities and the non-sensible world of\nunderstandable meaning-configurations (Rickert 1934b, 92–97). This\ninsight defeats a view Rickert calls “hyletic sensualism”\n(Rickert 1934b, 93) that he attributes to both Kant and Husserl.\nHyletic sensualists assume that the content of our experience\ncan only be sensible, and that whatever is non-sensible and\nintelligible must be ascribed to the form of our experience\ninstead. However, based on the above analyses, Rickert emphasizes that\nthe very content of our experience is both sensible\n(perceivable) and non-sensible (intelligible). Accordingly, in\norder to generate knowledge of sensible entities and intelligible\nmeaning-configurations the conceptual forms of our cognition must apply\nto both domains. \n\n(3) Upon closer scrutiny, the kind of content that we\nencounter in the world of experience and conceptualize in the empirical\nsciences shows itself to be a compound of form and\ncontent. In fact, the entities that we encounter and theorize\nabout in the world of experience are always objects, in a\nbroad sense comprising physical, psychic and non-sensible entities\n(meaning-configurations). In keeping with the Kantian tradition,\nhowever, objects are the result of synthetic processes of\nobjectification guided by some categories (forms). It is\ntherefore possible to raise a question about a third domain of being:\nhow are we to think the pure content or hyle that is\nimmediately experienced prior to all objectification and\ncategorization? At first this universe of absolutely raw and\nunsynthesized content has to be conceived of as prior to the\ndistinction between sensible and non-sensible being, and, within the\nsphere of sensible being, prior to the distinction between physical and\npsychic reality. This is why Rickert suggests to call this third domain\nof being the “pro-physical world” (Rickert 1934b,\n111; Rickert 1921b, 296), using improperly the term\n‘physical’ in the phrase to indicate the whole domain of\nthe experiential world. In this sense, “the problem of prophysics\n[is] at the same time the problem of the immediate” (Rickert\n1934b, 112), that is of the pure, immediately lived content preceding\nall synthesis and categorization. The regression to the prophysical\nworld, however, does not leave us with a completely undifferentiated\nand inchoate mass of raw ‘content’. If we think of objects\nas the products of a subject’s activity of categorial formation,\nthen suspending all categorial syntheses leads us back to a\npre-objective subject (Rickert 1934b, 115), whose synthetic\nactivity brings about objects out of the pure pro-physical material in\nthe first place. One might be inclined to think that the pro-physical\nsubject coincides with Kant’s transcendental apperception, that\nis, a mere empty ‘form’ of subjectivity or consciousness in\ngeneral. However, and in keeping with the analyses of subjectivity in\nThe Object of Knowledge (see above), in order to be\nresponsible for the processes of objectification and thus form\nprimordial materials into proper objects, the pro-physical subject must\nbe conceived of as active and capable of stance-takings toward\nvalues (Rickert 1934b, 118). In other words, the pro-physical subject\nthat we necessarily have to think as prior to all psychic, physical and\nmeaning-related objectifications must be conceived of as free\n(Rickert 1934b, 120). While empirical psychology operating in the\nsphere of already objectified sensible being presents us with empirical\nsubjects who are causally determined in various ways, pro-physics\nunearths a transcendental dimension of freedom that is presupposed by\nall objectifications. Rickert suggests that this insight solves the\n“mystery” (Rickert 1934b, 123) of freedom by way of\ndissolving, as it were, the traditional antinomy between freedom and\ndeterminism. These two notions, in Rickert’s view, belong in two\ndistinct ontological spheres. While the objectified psychic subject is\nindeed causally determined as much as any other bit of sensible being,\nthe pro-physical subject responsible for each objectification is\ninherently free. In this sense, freedom and determinism are not\nopposed. To the extent that determinism presupposed the process of\nobjectification, (psychophysical) determinism presupposes\n(prophysical) freedom. After establishing the ontological features of\nthe prophysical subject, we can turn to the primordial materials or\ncontents that the prophysical subject forms. Rickert suggests to calls\nthe branch of prophysics dealing with pure materials\nZustandslehre, an expression hardly translatable into English\nwithout losing its intended assonance with Gegenstandslehre\n(Rickert 1934b, 127). Gegen-stand is the German term for\nobject, that is, literally, that which stands over and against a\nsubject. However, if Gegend-stand is the product of an\nobjectifying process, then Rickert suggests that we call that which is\nthereby objectified and placed ‘over and against’\nZu-stand, which can be roughly translated as\n‘state’. A doctrine of pure states (reine\nZustände) is meant to investigate the pre-objectified, pure\ncontent independently of the categorial forms that pervade such content\nin our sensible experiences of fully formed objects (Rickert 1934b,\n129). The gist of Rickert’s Zustandslehre is that even\nin the pro-physical world we have no reason to think of content in a\nmonistic fashion. “In the Zustandslehre we can exhibit\nthe ultimate ground for the encompassing dualism of the world of\nobjects. Already the dimension of pure states (das\nZuständliche) pertaining to understandable objects, that is,\nits bare material, is as non-sensible as the form which creates\nnon-sensible objects out of it. The understandable\nmeaning-configuration has both a non-sensible form and a non-sensible\ncontent” (Rickert 1934b, 131). In other words, Rickert wants to\nsay that the understandable meaning-configurations considered in the\nsecond domain of ontology are non-sensible through and\nthrough. One might be tempted to think that a word-meaning is\ncomposed of a non-sensible form (the ideal Bedeutung) and a\nsensible content, say, the acoustic data forming the distinctive sound\nof the word ‘red’ in English or those forming the\ndistinctive sound of the word ‘rosso’ in Italian. On\nRickert’s account, however, this would be wrong. We have to\ndistinguish the acoustic carrier of the word-meaning from the\nword-meaning as a whole, in both its form and its\ncontent. The acoustic carrier is entirely sensible and the word-meaning\nitself is entirely non-sensible. The conclusion of Rickert’s\nprophysics is that if we consider its domain as that of the\n“universal minimum” of thinkability (Rickert 1934b, 133),\nthen we have to concede that such universal minimum already entails\na plurality of factors, namely, the minimal distinction\nbetween I (the prophysical subject) and non-I (the domain of pure\nstates) and the further distinction within the sphere of non-I between\nthe pro-physical sensible and the pro-physical non-sensible, whose\nobjectifications carried out by the free pro-physical subject give rise\nto the objects in the world of experience. \n\n(4) The fourth and last ontological domain Rickert considers\nis that of supersensible being, traditionally addressed by\nmetaphysics. Rickert’s approach to metaphysics is guided by the\nproblem of the ultimate connection between reality and value. Both the\nanalysis of the world of experience and the analysis of the prophysical\nworld resulted in an inevitable dualism between the sensible and the\nnon-sensible, viz., the perceivable and the understandable. This poses\nthe problem of how to preserve the dualism and still be able to\nconceive of the world as a whole in a unitary fashion. The first clue\nto think about the unity of the world is provided by the doctrine of\nthe prophysical subject: “It produces a connection of what is\nreal and what is meaningful (das Sinnhafte) and at the same\ntime with the valid value” (Rickert 1934b, 135). With its free\nstance-takings relating (sensible and non-sensible) materials to\n(non-sensible) values the prophysical subject encompasses both terms of\nthe dualism and thus provides a criterion to conceive of them as\nunited. However, this seems to tie the unity of reality and value to\nthe particularity and contingency of actual stance-takings. This unity\nseems to be extremely precarious and ultimately grounded in the\narbitrary acts of a pro-physical subject. The thought of a unity of\nreality and value beyond the particular acts of valuing\nsubjectivity and thus beyond the scope of contents of consciousness\nopens up the intellectual space of metaphysics. Rickert is adamant that\nultimately the transcendent unity of reality and value beyond\nsubjectivity is the object of “faith” (Rickert 1934b, 137)\nand not scientific knowledge. However, he insists that we need such\nfaith in order to live both as practical and as theoretical human\nbeings. “If the world were not arranged in such a way that our\nstance-taking toward the value of truth ‘succeeds’ beyond\nthe I’s act, then science, which pushes forward to cognize the\nworld, is impossible. As scientific people, too, we need the assumption\nthat there is a more than particular, ‘cosmic’ connection\nof value and reality” (Rickert 1934b, 138). The\n“supersensible unity” of value and reality\n(Wirklichkeit) or the domain of “value-reality”\n(Wertrealität) (Rickert 1934b, 139) is the object of\nmetaphysics. Describing the mode of access to the domain of\nvalue-reality in metaphysics, Rickert holds fast to Kant’s view\nthat metaphysics is not possible as a science. This, however,\nentails neither that metaphysics is altogether impossible, nor\nthat some other kind of non-scientific knowledge may not be produced as\nlegitimate metaphysical knowledge. Rickert refers to metaphysical\nknowledge in scare quotes as “allegoric”,\n“image-building” (sinnbildlich) or\n“symbolic” (Rickert 1934b, 140). In other words,\nmetaphysics is bound to employ images, metaphors and oblique\nexpressions in order to produce indirect knowledge of the transcendent,\nsubject-independent unity of reality and value. Rickert here clearly\nhas in mind the most illustrious of all metaphysicians: Plato. When he\ncalled the Forms ‘real’ he borrowed a phrase that has an\nestablished meaning for this-worldly realities and applied it\nmetaphorically to the domain of otherworldly or supersensible being.\nMoreover, as is well known, he made abundant use of allegories, similes\nand mythological stories in order to illustrate the ultimately\ninaccessible world of the supersensible. Finally, Rickert warns against\na conflation of metaphysics and religion (Rickert 1934, 201). While in\nconcrete cultural worlds and living individuals these two spheres of\nculture often intersect and overlap, it is important to keep them\nconceptually distinct. Metaphysics is a theoretical enterprise trying\nto determine conceptually supersensible being with the aid of\nmetaphors, symbols, etc. It does involve faith but it is a purely\nrational faith in some kind of transcendent unity of reality\nand value. Religion, on the contrary, is characterized by faith in the\nexistence of a supersensible divine being, in which ultimately all\nvalues and meanings are grounded. Both are valuable and important\ncomponent of culture. Empirically speaking, they often occur together\nand have numerous mutual influences. However, they can never be reduced\ntheoretically to one another. In other words, the rational\nfaith of metaphysics does not automatically lead to religious faith in\na divine being and, conversely, religious faith does not necessitate\nthe believer to accept that the ultimate unity of reality and value is\naccessible (through symbolic knowledge) to the rational discourse of\nmetaphysics.","contact.mail":"andrea.staiti@bc.edu","contact.domain":"bc.edu"}]
