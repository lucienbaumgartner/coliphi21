No doubt this is in part because justice, often regarded as\nthe “first virtue of social institutions” (Rawls 1971: 3),\nis central to the evaluation of social policies and public\ninstitutions. But it is also because disability has played at least\ntwo distinct roles in recent discussions of social justice. First,\ndisability has been seen by many as a paradigm example of unchosen\ndisadvantage. Hence, disability has played a central role in internal\ndiscussions of luck egalitarianism, in particular with respect to the\n“currency” question—equality of what?—and\nexternal discussions, in particular with respect to the question of\nwhether luck egalitarianism is disrespectful or stigmatizing. Second,\npeople with disabilities, particularly intellectual or cognitive\ndisabilities, have been seen by many as a “limit case” for\ncontractarian or contractualist theories of justice. Hence, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the eligibility\nconditions for being party to the contractual procedures by which\nprinciples of justice are chosen and for being subject to the\nprinciples of justice so chosen.\n\n\nDisability also presents difficult issues as a social or group\nidentity: roughly, a central part of the way an individual\nunderstands, presents, or values herself. This aspect of disability\nhas been made salient by the civil rights movement that established\ndisability as an important category in antidiscrimination law.\nTheories that assess justice in terms of the distribution of resources\nor opportunities have sometimes been criticized for failing to take\nadequate account of such identities. But the embrace of social\nidentity as a component of justice can be equally problematic.\n\n\nDisability is of special interest for justice because of the way in\nwhich it juxtaposes two basic and powerful senses of\ninjustice. These two senses of injustice are sometimes\nexpressed in terms of a distinction between the justice of\ndistributions and the justice of recognition, or\nmore recently, between distributive justice and\nrelational injustice. Very roughly, we can think of these\nlabels as denoting a distinction between the injustice of certain\noutcomes—in particular, outcomes in which there is an\ninequality of income, wealth, health, or other aspects of well-being\nresulting from morally irrelevant factors—and the injustice of\ncertain forms of treatment—in particular, the treatment\nof some people as moral, social, or political inferiors on\nthe basis of morally irrelevant characteristics. Correcting the first\nform of injustice is thought to require, fundamentally, a change in\nthe distribution of resources, broadly construed, that affect\nwell-being. Correcting the first form of injustice is thought to\nrequire, fundamentally, a change in the structure and character of\ninterpersonal relationships, which may in turn require changes to\nsocial and institutional norms and practices. Needless to say, the\nrelationship and comparative importance of these two forms of\ninjustice have been the subject of considerable discussion, and there\nis no canonical statement of the distinction (Fourie et al. 2015;\nAnderson 1999; Fraser 2001, 1996; Honneth 1992).\n\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Section 1 will discuss disability\nin terms of these two broad types of injustice. Sections 2 and 3 will\nexamine the implications of different models of disability for the\ndistinction between redistribution and recognition. Section 4 will\nthen examine the treatment of disability in contemporary theories of\ndistributive justice. It will explain how the environmental and social\ncharacter of disability has been largely overlooked by contractarian\nand egalitarian theories, not so much because of their distributive\nfocus, but because of their narrow focus on one aspect of\ndisability—functional limitation—to the neglect of\nexclusionary attitudes and practices. Section 4 will conclude by\ndiscussing recent efforts to rectify this neglect, describing several\nways in which distributive justice theorists have sought to take\naccount of environmental and social barriers and to address claims for\nrecognition. These efforts include broadening the metric for just\ndistributions to encompass respectful relationships and social\npractices; arguing that a just distribution on such broader metrics\ncan be attained more effectively and appropriately by modifying the\nphysical and social environment than by redistributing resources among\nindividuals; and adopting outcome standards that do not require strict\nequality on any metric but rather the reduction or elimination of\ndisrespectful inequalities. Section 5 will discuss a major issue in\nthe recognition of disability: the relationship of disability identity\nto various approaches to justice, where “identity” is\nunderstood as a part of an individual’s self-understanding or\nself-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that people with disabilities have long been treated as\nmoral and social inferiors, at the same time that they have suffered\ndistributive injustices of various kinds (see generally, Barclay\n2018). Routinely, people with disabilities have been denied jobs for\nwhich they are highly qualified because they have been considered\nincompetent, or because employers have not been comfortable with their\npresence in the workplace. Often, people with certain disabilities\nhave been consigned to segregated institutions and facilities because\nthey have been regarded as incapable of making decisions or caring for\nthemselves, or because others in the community did not want to\ninteract with them. \nThese forms of relational injustice are associated with very concrete\nmaterial inequalities. In 2009, almost 20 years after the passage of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the employment-population ratio\nof people with disabilities in the United States was 19.2%, compared\nto 64.5% for persons without a disability (Bureau of Labor Statistics\n2010). Based on data from 1996–1999, researchers estimate that\n47.4% of working-age adults who experienced poverty for a year or more\nhad at least one disability (Fremstad 2009). \nFacts such as these have led some to conclude that  \nin particular, internally diverse ways, people with disabilities have\nbeen on the end of a kind of pincer movement between Fraser’s\ntwo impediments to parity: “misrecognition” and\n“maldistribution” (Calder 2010: 62). \nIn these respects, people with disabilities are in a comparable\nposition to members of other “discrete and insular\nminorities” with a history of being subject to both distributive\nand relational injustice. But there is a significant difference.\nSimply put, there is no reason to think that it need be particularly\nexpensive to eliminate disrespect and misrecognition towards\nracial, ethnic, and sexual minorities. But insofar as accommodation\nand reconstruction of the built environment are necessary to eliminate\ndisrespect and misrecognition towards people with disabilities,\nrelational justice for people with disabilities may require diverting\nsignificant resources from other causes. In that sense, achieving\njustice for people with disabilities requires us to directly address\nthe relationship between relational justice and distributive justice\nto a degree that achieving justice for members of other groups\ngenerally does not.  \nTo be sure, the costs associated with accommodation and reconstruction\nof the built environment need not be understood as\ncompensation for the alleged deficits of people with\ndisabilities. Indeed, they would have to be acknowledged even if\ndisabilities were seen as intrinsically neutral physical or mental\ncharacteristics that merely differ from those of a majority of the\npopulation. In any society whose physical structures and social\npractices are designed for average or typical members, people with\ndisabilities will be disadvantaged just because of their minority\nstatus. A similar point has been made by feminist scholars, who have\npointed out the structural discrimination of workplaces and public\nsettings designed exclusively for men. The expenses of additional\nrestrooms, stalls, or pumping stations do not compensate women for\ntheir deficiencies. They simply accommodate differences ignored in a\nsociety that saw a woman’s place as in the home (Wendell 1996;\nWasserman 1998: 178–179). \nStill, the rectification of such structural discrimination may raise\nmore difficult issues for people with disabilities than for women,\nbecause there is greater uncertainty and potential for disagreement\nabout the extent of the changes that are required to treat people with\ndisabilities as social and political equals. Indeed, the range and\nvariety of physical and mental differences within a society raise\nissues of distributive justice that have no obvious analogue for other\nstigmatized groups. A “gender-neutral” environment can be\nreadily conceived, and achieved at modest cost. In contrast,\ndisability scholars and activists have not specified what it would\nmean to achieve an “ability-neutral” environment—one\nthat was no more advantageous to people with some physical and mental\ncharacteristics than others. And some argued that the ideas of an\n“ability-neutral” environment is either conceptually\nincoherent or prohibitively expensive (Barclay 2011, 2018). Moreover,\nit seems likely that questions about the extent to which justice\nrequires reconstructing or modifying the built environment would arise\nwith respect to people with disabilities even in a society with no\nhistory of invidious attitudes or practices toward such persons. By\ncontrast, it seems less likely that such questions would arise in a\nsociety with no history of sexism, for example. \nJustice for people with disabilities, then, appears to raise questions\nabout the relationship between distributive justice and relational\njustice that justice for other stigmatized groups does not. Yet the\nneed for redistribution hardly reduces the importance of recognition\nin achieving justice. Indeed, the complex, disputed relationship\nbetween the two makes disability a significant challenge for theories\nof justice. \n“Disability” is typically defined in terms of two\nelements: (i) a physical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived\nas an impairment or dysfunction, and (ii) a significant personal or\nsocial limitation associated with that characteristic. The\nrelationship between these two elements—and the role of the\nenvironment in mediating them—is a core issue in the\nconceptualization of, and social response to, disability. The\nmedical model treats disability as an individual physical or\nmental characteristic with significant personal and social\nconsequences. In particular, it sees the limitations faced by people\nwith disabilities as resulting primarily or solely from their\nimpairments. By contrast, the various social models see\ndisability as a relationship between individuals and their social\nenvironments: physical and mental characteristics are limiting only or\nprimarily in virtue of social practices that lead to the exclusion of\npeople with those characteristics. This exclusion is manifested not\nonly in deliberate segregation, but in built environments and social\npractices that restrict the participation of people regarded as having\ndisabilities (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience). \nIn their extreme forms, which treat the impairment or environment\n(respectively) as the sole cause of personal and social limitation,\nthe medical and social models have few, if any, defenders. Rather,\nthey mark the limits of possible relationships between impairment and\nlimitation. Almost all writers on disability acknowledge some role for\nboth the impairment and the environment in causing limitations; the\ndisagreement largely concerns the assessment of their comparative\ncontribution, and their interaction. Most scholars who embrace some\nversion of the social model acknowledge that\nimpairments—generally but not universally understood as\ndeviations from species-relative statistical norms—can be\nsources of discomfort and limitation even in the absence of\ndisadvantaging social practices (e.g., Shakespeare 2006, Thomas 2004).\nThese scholars would argue, however, that such adverse effects are far\nless damaging than social exclusion, are greatly magnified by hostile\nenvironments, and could be significantly reduced by more inclusive\nenvironments. The medical model is less often explicitly defended than\nunreflectively adopted—by health care professionals,\nbioethicists, and philosophers who ignore or underestimate the\ncontribution of social and other environmental factors to the\nlimitations faced by people with disabilities. Even among these\ngroups, however, there is a growing awareness of the environmental\ncontribution to disability and a partial embrace of the social model\n(Cureton and Brownlee 2009). \nTo the extent that it is held by anyone in unalloyed form, the medical\nmodel of disability would not deny that disability raises issues of\njustice. Indeed, that model might give support to the view that the\ndisadvantages perceived as inherent to disability raise some of the\nmost urgent claims of justice (Barclay 2011, 2018). But such a model\ndoes not recognize any principled rationale for preferring\nreconstruction of the social and built environment over compensation\nor correction as a means for correcting disability-related\ndisadvantage, a point made by Wolff (2009a, 2009b), among others. In\ncontrast, the social model strongly supports such a rationale, since\nit construes many aspects of disability-related disadvantage as\nessentially connected to various forms of literal and\nfigurative exclusion. Relatedly, the social model construes\nreconstruction as a public good: more accessible structures and more\ninclusive practices can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people with\nand without disabilities (Scotch and Schriner 1997). But such\nreconstruction also helps to achieve a fairer distribution of tangible\nand intangible goods, particularly social and economic\nopportunities. \nSome critics accuse social model theorists of assuming that any\ndisadvantage caused by the social environment is ipso facto\nunjust (Samaha 2007). This assumption would reflect an oversimplified\nview of the relationship between causing disadvantage and creating\ninjustice. The fact that social structures or practices cause\ndisadvantage does not imply that there is a duty of justice to correct\nor compensate for the disadvantage. That will depend on the costs of\nalleviating it, and—under any plausible theory of\njustice—some comparison with the advantages and disadvantages\nthat would result from alternative social arrangements. Thus, for\nexample, choosing to spend the bulk of a municipal arts budget on a\nconcert hall rather than an art museum may disadvantage those who\ncannot hear. But that disadvantage, although caused by a social\ndecision, is not necessarily unjust. That will depend, inter\nalia, on the availability of non-auditory forms of aesthetic\nexperience and the comparative costs of building the museum instead.\nTo take another example, placing ramps and elevators in new high-rise\nbuildings is relatively inexpensive and beneficial to most users,\nwhereas placing them in nineteenth century walk-ups is difficult and\nexpensive; holding public meetings or events in buildings with ramps\nand elevators has negligible costs, whereas moving an existing\nbusiness from a building that lacks them to one that has them may be\nvery expensive (Samaha 2007; Wasserman 2001). \nThe difficulty of inferring injustice from socially caused\ndisadvantage is clear in contexts where greater social provision\nsecures incremental advantage. In such contexts, the question of how\nmuch is just will not always have an obvious answer. For example, it\nwould at least marginally benefit wheelchair-users to have additional\nrestricted parking spaces, but we could hardly infer an injustice from\nthe fact that an institution provided N rather than N +\n1 such spaces. Intuitively, the allotment should be proportionate to\nthe number of wheelchair users in the community or at the facility,\nbut that number may be uncertain, and a range of spaces would likely\nsatisfy any proportionality\n requirement.[1]\n In deciding how many spaces are enough, we would receive no guidance\nfrom the indisputable fact that any disadvantage or advantage in this\ncontext would have social causes. \nConversely, the fact that social arrangements do not cause or\ncontribute to a disadvantage does not insulate it from claims of\njustice; the failure to alleviate that disadvantage may be unjust on\nplausible accounts of justice. Thus, although many\n“natural” disasters like Hurricanes Katrina owe much\nof their destructive impact to social arrangements, it is plausible\nthat the state’s duty to support the victims of hurricanes and\ntsunamis is not contingent on its responsibility for causing or\nexacerbating them (Wasserman\n 2001).[2]\n Indeed, as we discuss below, various forms of luck egalitarianism do\nnot distinguish between disadvantages caused versus merely not\ncorrected by society’s institutions, provided that the relevant\ndisadvantages are equally severe and equally unchosen by those\ndisadvantaged. \nNevertheless, the causal claims made by social-model theorists are\nrelevant to justice in several ways. First, as suggested above, for\nmost theories of justice, the mere fact that the social environment\ncan be modified in ways that alleviate the disadvantages associated\nwith impairment places demands for their alleviation within the scope\nof justice—as claims that a theory of justice must consider and\nweigh. Second, the fact that those disadvantages are caused by social\narrangements is relevant for those theories that regard society as\nhaving a stronger duty not to create or aggravate disadvantages than\nit has to prevent or correct them (Wasserman 2001, Schemmel 2012).\nFinally, alleviating the disadvantages attributable to prejudice or\nstigma will enjoy priority on any theory of justice that treats\ndisadvantage resulting from prejudice or stigma as a greater injustice\nthan innocently-created\n disadvantage.[3] \nBeyond a shared concern with the social causation of disability,\ndifferent versions of the social model emphasize different features of\nthe exclusionary structures and practices (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n The minority group model regards people with impairments as\na stigmatized minority group. It holds that the main reason people\nwith disabilities encounter special hardships is that they face\ndiscrimination akin to that faced by racial or ethnic minorities (Hahn\n1987, Oliver 1990). The human variation model holds that many\nof the challenges faced by disabled people do not result from\ndeliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch between their\ncharacteristics and the physical and social environment (Scotch and\nSchriner 1997). These two versions of the social model differ mainly\nin emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group model\ngenerally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with stigmatized differences. Yet the failure to\nfully accommodate people with various differences, from extreme height\nto intellectual impairment, does not necessarily arise from stigma.\nBut often, disparities in access that were initially caused by\nresource or technological limits are maintained by stigma. For\nexample, an employer’s initial purchase of communications\ntechnology inaccessible to blind or deaf employees may be explained by\nthe fact that accessible technology had not been developed at the time\nof purchase. But those historic facts would not justify the\nemployer’s refusal to include modestly priced accessibility\nfeatures when purchasing upgrades a decade later, for example. \nBoth versions of the social model require the removal of barriers and\npractices serving to exclude people with disabilities, and the\nreconstruction of the environment to more fully include them. Under a\nminority-group model, these measures are dictated primarily by a\ndemand for recognition and respect, and for the correction of past\nexpressions of disrespect found in the knowing exclusion of people\nwith disabilities from many aspects of social, political, and economic\nlife. The human variation model puts less weight on the expressive or\nsymbolic significance of past exclusion. Rather than construing people\nwith disabilities as a “discrete and insular minority”\ncreated by practices of more or less deliberate exclusion, the human\nvariation model construes people with disabilities as simply people\nwho differ in degree from the majority of statistically normal\npopulation with respect to one or more physical or mental\ncharacteristics. The purpose of reconstruction is not so much to end\nspecific exclusionary practices as to create a more inclusive physical\nand social environment. Given this difference in emphasis, it is\nnatural to understand the human variation model as appealing\nprincipally to norms of distributive fairness, ensuring equal or\nadequate access to the physical and social environment, in contrast to\nthe minority group model, which appeals more explicitly to norms of\nrespect and recognition.  \nThe demand for greater inclusiveness is less categorical than the\ndemand to eliminate discrimination. Although any environment can be\nmade more inclusive, none can be fully inclusive for everyone (Barclay\n2010, 2018). This is not necessarily because, as Barclay, following\nShakespeare (2006), claims, the inclusionary features required for one\nimpairment often conflict with those required by another. Such\nconflicts may be minor, temporary, and remediable. The problem is more\ngeneral: 1) for many characteristics, from height to mathematical\naptitude, one “size” does not fit all; 2) providing\ndifferent sizes increases fit for a wider range of variation, but at\nincreasing cost (albeit less than often assumed); and 3) it is\nfrequently impractical, and may arguably be unjust, to ensure that\neveryone is equally well-or ill-fitted; it may, for example, be too\nexpensive to ensure that left-handed or extremely tall individuals\nsuffer no inconvenience in being statistical minorities. Full\ninclusion, like universal design, is an ideal—one that cannot be\nfully achieved, and that must be compromised in the partial\nsatisfaction of other legitimate claims. \nEven if it would be impossible or unreasonable to achieve full\ninclusion through wholesale changes in the physical or social\nenvironment, modest changes could significantly increase inclusion at\nlittle cost. Some examples come from a study of environment\nmodification for autistic individuals (Owren 2013). Some people with\nautism face significant barriers to taking part in routine social\nactivities: they find such familiar stimuli as applause, light\ntouching, and deodorant as highly aversive; they must be explicitly\ninstructed about social expectations because they cannot\n“read” most facial expressions or social clues. The\nstudy’s author recognizes that the “neurotypical\nmajority” cannot be expected to give up applause, light\ntouching, or even deodorant, let alone nuance in communication: \nWhat would be lost? Large parts of what may be some of the most\ntreasured areas of communication: the art of innuendo, the double\nmeaning at the heart of much comedy, irony, the implied meaning at the\nheart of so much poetry,… flirtation and “feeling each\nother out” before committing to something that cannot be\nretracted. (2013: 23-24) \nAt the same time, the author points out that the majority could often\ngain from more modest accommodations.  \nMany neurotypicals might profit from being more explicit and from\nothers being more explicit, as can be illustrated by the extensive\nfocus in couples therapy on getting partners to state their needs and\nexpectations more explicitly, not relying on other to pick up on\n“vaguely described, implied, or unspoken behavioral\nexpectations”. (2013: 92)  \nThe author suggests (2013: 111) that it may be feasible to develop\n“best practices”: “strategies for enhancing\naccessibility and reducing sensory issues in a larger scale”\nwithout unduly burdening the majority: \nOne strategy might be to incorporate into Universal design the\npractice of providing access to low stimulation areas in mainstream\nsettings. Another might be to create more public acceptance of\nautistic behaviors like\n stimming,[4]\n which seem to help many autistic people reduce the impact of aversive\nsensory stimuli.… (2013: 111) \nSuch strategies clearly involve tradeoffs, but those tradeoffs would\ninvolve small economic and social costs for a majority to achieve\nlarge gains in inclusion for a minority. The claim that it is\nimpossible to achieve, or even understand, full inclusion for people\nwith autism does not deny that there is significant injustice in their\ncurrent state of social isolation. \nThe challenges for social models of disability for justice may seem\ngreatest for intellectual and psychiatric impairments, as well as for\ncomplex physical impairments such as fibromyalgia, multiple chemical\nsensitivity, and other conditions that radically and unpredictably\naffect energy, stamina, and functioning (Wendell 1989, 1996; Davis\n2005). First, these conditions strikingly display both aspects of\nimpairment, as markers for stigma and as sources of functional\nlimitation (see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Cognitive and psychiatric impairments evoke some of the strongest\nprejudice and all present some of the most difficult functional\nlimitations, e.g., on the capacities to engage in practical reasoning,\nto recognize the intentions and attitudes of other people, or to\nparticipate in shared activities.Second, some theorists contend that\nthese conditions pose more of a practical challenge for the social\nmodel than even the most severe physical disabilities, in part because\nthe measures required for greater inclusion are not as concrete or\ntangible, and may demand greater imagination to envision and\n implement.[5] \nAlthough significant practical work has been done in educational and\nworkplace inclusion, philosophers have been daunted by the challenge\nof social reconstruction for cognitive disabilities. Thus Jonathan\nWolff, who generally favors such reconstruction—which he calls\n“status enhancement”—as the most respectful\nintervention, asks  \nWhat would it mean to change the world so that people with cognitive\ndisabilities and other people were equally able to find a worthwhile\nplace in the world? Can we even imagine what this would be? (2009a:\n407)  \nMany rights and privileges are thought to require a certain level of\ncognitive capacity, e.g., the right to vote or contract (Wikler 1979).\nSimilarly, most jobs are structured to require regular hours,\nuninterrupted activity, undivided attention, and general\nsociability. \nHow much should a society modify these requirements or restructure\nthese activities to include people with various intellectual,\npsychiatric, and complex physical disabilities? A total relaxation of\nsuch requirements would impose large, even “unduly\nburdensome” costs. However, many modifications to promote the\ninclusion of people with significant cognitive impairments would also\nbenefit people with typical cognitive function: simplified task\nexplanations, warning labels, news copy, and jury instructions. Many\naccommodations employers are already making to increase flexibility\nand reduce stress, from individually-tailored schedules to\ntelecommuting, would ease the entry of people with these disabilities\ninto the workplace. There is a growing body of practical and policy\nwork that applies social models of disability to people with\nintellectual, psychiatric, and complex physical impairments (e.g.,\nBiklen 1992; Block 2006; Connor et al. 2008; Hehir 2002). \nAs discussed later in this Entry, there is sharp disagreement about\nwhether individuals with the most severe intellectual impairments\nqualify as subjects of justice. But even if individuals with the most\nsubstantial intellectual impairments are regarded as subjects of\njustice, what justice demands for them, and of them, may be uncertain\nor disputed. Nussbaum (2009) contends that the equal citizenship of\nthose individuals requires that they be enabled to exercise such\npolitical rights as voting and jury service through appropriate\nsurrogates. Wasserman and McMahan (2012) question whether those rights\ncould be meaningfully exercised by surrogates for individuals with the\nmost severe intellectual disabilities. \nSome philosophical intimation of a social model approach to cognitive\ndisability can be found in Dan Wikler’s 1979 essay,\n“Paternalism and the Mildly Retarded”. Wikler held that\nthe category of cognitive disability was socially constructed by the\ncompetence thresholds set for important social activities, such as\nsigning a contract or voting in an election. But although society\nchooses, in this sense, who will be cognitively impaired, it does not\nhave unlimited flexibility, since there can be significant social\ncosts in altering those thresholds. The issue, Wikler concluded, was\nultimately one of justice; of fairly distributing the burdens of\nsetting thresholds that will be too high for some or too low for\nothers. Yet Wikler questioned whether justice would require, or even\npermit, the kind of modifications necessary for significantly greater\nparticipation. Writing two decades later, Wolff cited Wikler in\nstating,  \nthe fact is that what makes much of modern life possible now relies on\nbinding and enforceable contracts that in turn assume a certain level\nof intellectual competence. To change the world so that such a bar is\nlowered would have tremendous costs. (2009a: 407) \nThis pessimism has prevailed in the years since Wikler wrote, and\nthere has been little philosophical attention to practical\npossibilities for the inclusion of people with cognitive impairments.\nAlthough there have been interesting discussions of this issue in the\ncontext of education (e.g., Howe 1996; Ladenson 2005; Veatch 1986),\nthe general issue has tended to be dealt with in summary fashion.\n(Exceptions include Kittay and Carlson 2010; Hartley 2009a; Silvers\nand Francis 2009; Wong 2007, 2009.) Thus, for cognitive disabilities,\nWolff emphasizes “targeted resource enhancement” rather\nthan status enhancement, arguing for an entitlement scheme that gives\npeople with cognitive disabilities maximum possible control over an\nindividual budget for personal assistance and social support (2009a:\n407–413). He does regard some forms of status enhancement,\nnotably antidiscrimination measures, “as essential”, but\nhe accepts Wikler’s conclusion that broader changes in social\npractice carry “intolerable costs” (2009a: 413). \nIn their influential book From Chance to Choice, Buchanan et\nal. (2000) repeat the assertion that there would be excessive social\ncosts in reconstructing society to permit the full participation of\npeople with significant cognitive impairments. They compare the\nreconstruction of society for greater inclusion with a family decision\nto play only the card games that a young child can understand. They\ncontend that just as adults will tire of a constant game of Go Fish,\nthe society will be “dumbed down” if it refashions itself\nto fully include people with cognitive impairments. \nAlthough the meaning of inclusion is debatable, and different forms of\ninclusion will have differing value for different people, the\ncard-game analogy oversimplifies the challenge. To present inclusion\nas a zero-sum allocation is to dumb down the incredibly complex task\nof rearranging society to respect and nurture all its members. The\nanalogy assumes that every activity must be done by everyone, which is\nfalse. \nA more apt analogy to organized social activity might be an assortment\nof games that can be played by different combinations of people in\ndifferent ways. Some games could be played by everyone; others could\nbe modified to include cognitively impaired people in a way that\npreserved the interest of non-disabled players; some would be beyond\nthe reach of people with certain cognitive impairments. But even the\nmost cognitively gifted individuals could not participate in all\ngames—the sheer amount of training and practice required to\nmaster some of them, and the considerable time and energy many of them\nrequire, would preclude participation in many or most. Indeed, society\nmay function better if people have varying aptitudes for, and\ninterests in, different activities. (A similar criticism of the\ncard-game analogy is offered by Wong (2007), who recounts how her\nbrother with Down enriched rather than impoverished family life.) The\nfact that a smaller set of activities may be available to people with\ncognitive impairments need not present a problem, if it does not\nresult in their social isolation or deny them intellectual challenges\n(Parens & Asch 2000: 25–26 [quoting Philip Ferguson,\npersonal correspondence]). But ensuring their participation may\nrequire society to refashion itself in significant ways. \nIt is not clear that such refashioning would impose the\n“intolerable costs” feared by Wolff. Social inclusion does\nnot require, for example, that individuals with significant cognitive\nimpairments be able to make binding contracts in every domain of law\nand business; it requires that competence standards be graduated to\nreflect the complexity of specific tasks so that those individuals are\nnot categorically excluded –a suggestion made more than two\ndecades ago by the authors of the card-game metaphor (Buchanan and\nBrock 1990). Social model theorists know full well that\nimpairments—physical as well as cognitive—differ from skin\ncolor in that they are sometimes relevant to what people can do, as\nare such other attributes as education and income. But that feature of\nimpairment hardly precludes social reconstruction. Indeed, the most\neffective rebuttal to the card-game metaphor may be found in the\npractical work that already has been done in educational and workplace\ninclusion (e.g., Biklen 1992; Block 2006; Hehir 2002; McGuire et al.\n2006). At the same time, it bears emphasis that the social model of\ndisability was originally conceptualized in terms of physical\ndisabilities. And there may be significant limitations on the extent\nto which it applies to cognitive disabilities. More generally,\nalthough it may be useful to speak of “the” social model\nof “disability”, the diversity of impairments that fall\nunder the extension of “disability” suggests that the\naptness of the social model in any given context will vary depending\non the nature of the impairments at issue. \nAs suggested in\n §1,\n the disabling impact of social arrangements may be relevant to the\ntype and scope of interventions that justice requires. In stressing\nthe impact and the malleability of the environment, social-model\ntheorists have shifted the focus from claims for correction and\ncompensation to claims for reconstruction. \nConsider a society with much greater height variation than our own.\nEven if very tall or short stature was neither stigmatized nor\nfunctionally limiting, that society would, on any plausible theory of\njustice, be obliged to construct its public spaces, buildings, and\nvehicles to accommodate them. They would be treated unjustly if the\nconstruction of the physical environment took no account of them,\nespecially if the failure to do so caused them significant\ndisadvantage. Of course, the extent to which their height differences\nneeded to be taken into account would depend on the distribution of\nheight in the society, as well as on its level of resources and\ncompeting needs. No plausible theory of justice would require that the\nbuilt environment be equally accommodating to all heights, if such a\nthing were possible, but all would condemn some environments as\nunjustly restrictive. What even this simple case suggests is that the\ndemand for a more inclusive environment need not be seen in terms of\ncompensating individuals, tall or impaired, for their internal\ndeficits, but of accommodating as wide as possible a range of human\nvariation. \nEven if environmental reconstruction should not be seen as\ncompensating for deficits, a question remains about the extent to\nwhich it should be seen as a matter of redistribution or recognition.\nThis question is raised by the legal requirement of “reasonable\naccommodation”. Under the ADA and ADAAA,\n“accommodations” include ramps, elevators, texts in\nmultiple formats, sign-language interpreters, flexible work schedules,\nand job coaches or assistance. The failure to make reasonable\naccommodation for disabled employees or users of public facilities\nconstitutes, with some notable exceptions, discrimination (ADA 1990).\nThere is no reference to that concept in the laws banning\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or age; the term was\nintroduced in cases addressing claims of religious discrimination\n(see, e.g., Karlan and Rutherglen 1996). Like practitioners of\nminority religions, but unlike women, people of color, or older\npeople, people with disabilities must be “reasonably\naccommodated”. \nFor the human variation model, reasonable accommodation requires\nchanges in the physical and social environment, from installing ramps\nto modifying work schedules and altering the location of meetings and\nclasses. Often, such changes require little more than flexibility and\nimagination. But some of these changes can be expensive; at some\npoint, the cost may make further change unreasonable. On this\napproach, the legislative understanding of such accommodation as a\nmatter of distributive justice is reflected in the qualifying use of\n“reasonable” and the exemption of accommodations that\nwould impose an “undue” burden or hardship on the entity\nrequired to make accommodations (Wasserman 1998).  But it is also possible to see reasonable accommodation as a\nrequirement of equality for people with disabilities without recourse\nto a theory of distributive justice (e.g., Crossley 2004; Karlan and\nRutherglen 1996). Accommodating religious practices may be expensive\nin various ways, but no one regards doing so either as compensating\nreligions for their deficits. Indeed, such a rationale would appear to\nviolate the state’s constitutionally-mandated neutrality among\nreligions. Rather, because the state is required to treat religions\nand their adherents with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2003), it\ndisfavors rules and practices that interfere with religious\nobservance. Somewhat similarly, a state that regards people with\ndisabilities with equal respect and concern will disfavor arrangements\nthat interfere with their participation.  With respect to both groups,\nsubstantive equality may require unequal provisions. In the case of\ndisability as well as religion, how much additional provision is\nrequired is indeterminate, not for lack of a complete theory of\njustice to specify the amount or proportion, but because the demands\nof equal respect are indeterminate. \nConsider, for example, the question of how much it is reasonable for a\nsmall business to spend on an elevator or ground-floor space to be\nable to employ a talented IT technician with emphysema. To answer that\nquestion, we might do better to decide what respect for that person\ndemands, based in part on current social practice and convention,\nrather than to consult a comprehensive but abstract theory of\ndistributive justice. In any case, it may be unreasonable to expect a\ndeterminate answer; it may be appropriate to rely on a fair procedure\nto select among a range of plausible outcomes. But by the same token,\nthe utter lack of accommodation in many workplaces and public\nfacilities is clearly unjust on any plausible theory of justice. \nThe debate over the accommodations available for a minority group may\noften reflect a complex mix of claims concerning redistribution and\nrecognition. For example, people in wheelchairs are sometimes provided\nrestaurant access only through the service entrance. The restaurant\nowners often claim that such access is quite reasonable, since the\nservice entrances already have ramps—a distributive\nconsideration. Disability advocates claim that however convenient it\nmay be for the owners, such access treats wheelchair users as\nsecond-class customers—a claim of misrecognition. In this case,\nit may seem that the recognition claims clearly trump the conflicting\ndistributional claims. But this will not always be the case. \nAgain, resolving such conflicts may involve the same kind of judgment\nemployed in debates over accommodating minority religious practices.\nIt may be that some jobs cannot be made available to people whose\nSabbath falls on Friday or Saturday, because (in light of demographic\nconsiderations) the essential functions of those jobs require working\non those days. But although the “essential function”\nstandard appears objective and determinate, it is often subject to\ndistributive considerations, e.g., about staffing requirements and\nbusiness volume. A refusal to sustain the slightest loss of revenue to\naccommodate any minority religion might be a distributive injustice; a\nwillingness to sustain greater losses to accommodate Jewish and\nAdventist employees than Muslim ones might involve misrecognition as\nwell—the failure to treat Islamic practice as having the same\nvalue as other religious practices. Similarly, the violation of the\nADA involved in refusing to display the same flexibility for disabled\nas for pregnant employees arguably constitutes both distributive\ninjustice and misrecognition. \nThe uncertainty about the distributive character of reasonable\naccommodation suggests that in the case of disability, it may often be\ndifficult to sharply distinguish claims for redistribution and\n recognition.[6]\n Recognition may require redistribution, and redistribution should aim\nat securing recognition. Asch (1989) has gone even further, arguing\nthat recognition must precede redistribution; that if people with\ndisabilities were recognized as equals, capable of significant\ncontributions to others, society would be more willing to adopt\nappropriate measures for redistribution and reconstruction. \nThe resurgence of philosophical interest in justice is often dated to\nthe publication of John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice in\n1971. Although that was only two years before the passage of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, embodying a social model of disability\n(see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience),\n it was well before the academic reconceptualization of disability as\na social phenomenon. For the 25 years after A Theory of\nJustice, many justice theorists tacitly accepted the medical\nmodel (e.g., Dworkin 1981a,b; Daniels 1985). They treated disability\nas a physical or mental limitation of the individual, the principal\ncause of disability-related disadvantage. Disability thus posed a\nproblem for justice theories based on mutual advantage, hypothetical\nagreement, or material or social equality. People with disabilities\ndid not appear to offer reciprocal advantages; they complicated the\ntask of reaching a hypothetical agreement on the basic structure of\nsociety; and they made the goal of equality seem impossibly\ndemanding. \nBy the late 1990s, some mainstream political philosophers were\nbecoming acquainted with social models of disability, and some\ndisability theorists were gaining a hearing among political\nphilosophers. Some philosophers sought to modify distributive theories\nof justice to take account of the social and environmental character\nof disability; others cited the failure of those theories to take\nappropriate account of disability as one reason to reject exclusively\ndistributive approaches. \nBefore describing these developments, it is useful to distinguish two\ntypes of distributive theories. Modern social contract theories,\nnotably Rawls’ (1971), seek to determine the fair terms of\nsocial cooperation to which individuals (generally with limited\nknowledge of their own situations) would agree; they argue that\ncertain distributive principles would be among those terms\n(Rawls’ “difference principle” may be the most\nfamiliar). Rawlsian theories are procedural in one sense: they regard\nany distribution as just if and only if it is consistent with the\ndistributive principles that would be chosen by those individuals.\nDisability-oriented criticism of these theories has focused on their\nassumptions about the individuals who are eligible to make a\nhypothetical contract or participate in the cooperative scheme it\nestablishes. Critics have argued for the eligibility of people with\ndisabilities or their representatives to participate in the\ncontract-making processes and resulting cooperative scheme more than\nabout the validity of the principles or rules yielded by that process\n(Richardson 2006; Silvers and Francis 2005; Stark 2007). The second\ntype of theory is primarily interested in outcomes; in the kind of end\nstate a just society should strive for: either equality on some\noutcome metric or the reduction of certain kinds of inequality. Here,\ndisability-informed criticism has favored outcome metrics that take\naccount of the social contribution to disability-related disadvantage,\nand standards for just distributions that are oriented toward\ndisrespectful inequalities (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006a; Wolff\n2009b). \nWithin social contract theories, a distinction is often drawn between\ncontractarian/Hobbesian and contractualist/Lockean accounts (see SEP\nentry on\n contractarianism).\n One way to characterize this distinction is in terms of the\nparties’ motivation and interaction. In the former, they are\nnarrowly self-interested and hard-bargaining; in the latter, their\nself-interest is tempered or balanced by their commitment to\njustifying themselves to others, and they proceed by deliberating\nrather than by bargaining. This distinction is often formulated in\nterms of a distinction between (merely) rational agents, and\n“reasonable” agents. \nA Rawlsian approach might seem more congenial than a Hobbesian\napproach to people with disabilities. It derives the basic structure\nof society from a hypothetical choice situation, the Original\nPosition, in which a veil of ignorance precludes reliance on the\ncontractors’ actual limitations—limitations that a\nHobbesian contractor might ruthlessly (albeit rationally, if not\nreasonably) exploit (cf.\n note 10).\n Although the parties themselves are motivated exclusively by\nconsiderations of self-interest, which Rawls understands in terms of\nthe fulfillment of two higher-order interests (see SEP Entry on\n the original position),\n the informational constraints of the Original Position compel the\nparties to motivate as if they are reasonable, at least in\nthe sense that it compels them to be impartial between the claims of\nall who will be subject to the principles they choose. \nBut even if Rawlsian contractors do not know their specific\nlimitations, they do know that they, or the individuals they\nrepresent, are not permanently disabled. Rawls stipulated that the\nidealized society whose “basic structure” was the subject\nof hypothetical agreement was restricted to members who would be\n“fully-cooperating” over the course of their adult lives.\nRawls assumed that this restriction would exclude people with severe\nand permanent physical and mental disabilities (Rawls 1993:\n18–20). He did not defend that assumption, nor provide for the\nrepresentation of those people in the process by which the basic\nstructure of society is to be determined. Instead, he consigned their\nfate to the later, legislative phase. Rawls also restricted\nparticipation in the Original Position to those with two “moral\npowers”: the capacity to form and revise one’s own\nconception of the good; and the capacity for a sense of justice, the\ncapacity to act on and apply fair terms of cooperation\n(ibid.). It is doubtful that these powers can be attributed\nto people with the most severe intellectual and psychiatric\nimpairments, although some philosophers and disability scholars have\nargued that a just society should treat all human beings as having the\npotential to develop such functioning (Wong 2007, 2009). \nDisability scholars have been particularly critical of these\neligibility conditions for the Original Position. If the deliberators\nin the Original Position do not believe that they could be\nrepresenting, or could turn out to actually be, people with\n“severe and permanent” disabilities when the veil is\nlifted, they will have no prudential reason to choose a basic\nstructure for their society that will provide for the inclusion of\nthose people. Indeed, insofar as such measures would impose costs on\npeople with non-disabilities, the parties will have prudential reasons\nnot to support such measures, since doing so would undermine\nthe interests of people whom they know they could represent (the\nable-bodied on whom the costs are imposed) for the sake of those whom\nthey explicitly know they don’t represent (the disabled for whom\nthe costs are imposed). \nSeveral philosophers sympathetic to the Rawlsian framework have\nsuggested modifications that would give people with disabilities a\ngreater and more direct role in the social contracting process. Some\nhave argued that the “full cooperation” requirement, and\nthe kind of reciprocity it involves, can be liberally interpreted so\nas not to exclude most people with significant physical disabilities\n(Hartley 2009b; Stark 2009). Henry Richardson has gone even further,\nmaintaining that “Rawls’ arguments making use of the\ndevice of the [Original Position] do not essentially depend on any\nreciprocity premise” (2006: 427). He examines modified versions\nof the Original Position that drop the assumption that no one has\nsevere and permanent disabilities. He contends that with such\nmodifications, the Original Position can yield principles more\nsensitive to disability concerns about the continuous nature of\nabilities, the stigmatization resulting from false dichotomization,\nand the exclusion of severely disabled human beings. \nIn response, Martha Nussbaum (2006b: 490–498) concedes that\nRichardson’s proposed reconstruction of Rawls would largely\navoid the exclusionary features of the OP to which disability scholars\nhave objected. But she argues that this reconstruction is a more\nradical departure from Rawls than Richardson acknowledges. She\nsuggests that the theory loses its contractual character if it\ndispenses, per Richardson, with the reciprocity requirement and the\nassumption that the contractors have roughly equal physical and mental\npowers. \nRawls’ “moral powers” condition has posed further\nproblems. Harry Brighouse (2001) observes that modifying the\ncooperation requirement still excludes those whose cognitive\nimpairments preclude their possession of the two moral powers. Sophia\nWong (2009, 2007) argues that those powers can be acquired by people\nwith severe intellectual impairments, with adequate social support.\nLeslie Francis (2009) and Anita Silvers (Silvers and Francis 2009)\ncontend that many individuals with severe cognitive impairments can\ncollaborate with others to construct individualized, authentic\nconceptions of the good. Silvers and Francis (2005) and Christie\nHartley (2009a) also maintain that people with severe intellectual\nimpairments can be represented adequately in a contracting process\nthat consists in trust-building more than hard bargaining, even if\nthey cannot participate in it personally. \nOthers have argued that exclusion from the Original Position need not\nadversely affect people with disabilities or treat them with\ndisrespect. Adam Cureton (2008) argues that the exclusion of people\nwith severe disabilities from the Original Position is just part of\nits idealization, and does not diminish the urgency or priority of\ntheir claims. Cynthia Stark (2007) proposes lifting the\nfull-cooperation requirement to include people with disabilities at\nthe second stage of Rawlsian deliberation, where the society’s\nconstitution is established and where the hypothetical decision makers\nacquire some knowledge about the resources, development level, and\nother characteristics of their society. \nThe plausibility of these responses to Rawls depends to some extent on\nwhich version of the Original Position we consider. Rawls made a\nchange in his presentation of the Original Position in his\nRestatement (2001) that is especially pertinent to people\nwith cognitive disabilities. He emphasized that the participants in\nthe Original Position are representatives of people in the future\nsociety, not people living in the future society denied knowledge of\ntheir social position. If representatives were made to take into\naccount the possibility that those they represent might be disabled,\nthis might help to ensure that the interests of the disabled were\nrepresented. It would only do so, however, if the contractors have the\nability to imagine the very different embodiments of people with a\nvariety of disabilities, an ability feminist critics of Rawls have\nquestioned with respect to men representing women (Young 1990;\nBenhabib 1992; Okin 1994). The strictly representational role of\nparticipants in the Original Position would also avoid the conflict of\ninterest faced by cognitively unimpaired individuals representing\nthemselves and cognitively impaired individuals. \nMore broadly, philosophers have varied widely in their optimism about\nthe prospects for including people with disabilities in contractarian\nor contractualist deliberations. On the one hand, Lawrence Becker\n(2005) suggests that even selfish, hard-bargaining contractarians (his\n“tough crowd”) would accept an expansive notion of\n“reciprocity”, one that would ensure adequate provision\nfor people with disabilities in the scheme of social cooperation they\nadopt. Their acceptance of reciprocity would arise from recognition of\nthe needs and vulnerabilities they and their loved ones have or will\nlikely acquire. That recognition places a premium on social provisions\nfor health.  \nEven for the tough crowd, health is now ripe for inclusion in the list\nof basic goods. And it may be that a robust social commitment to\nhealth will address questions of justice for the disabled—as\nlong as we are careful to include fundamental aspects of psychological\nhealth (i.e., those associated with active rational agency….\n(2005: 35)  \nMembers of the tough crowd may not be so careful, however. Indeed,\nsome may not even regard “active rational agency” as a\nmatter of health as they more narrowly construe it, with an emphasis\non physical survival and comfort. In contrast to Becker, Eva Kittay\n(1999) holds that even the most liberal interpretation of Rawls’\nscheme will not be sufficiently responsive to the egalitarian concerns\nthat motivate his theory. Rawls’ assumption that the\nparticipants in the original position are or represent fully\nproductive members of society neglects the fact of pervasive,\ninevitable human dependency. “[T]hose within relationships of\ndependency fall outside the conceptual perimeters of Rawls’\negalitarianism” (1999: 79). \nAnother debate within contractarian theories that has particular\nrelevance to disability concerns the scope of justice itself: Is\njustice concerned only with the distribution of social goods, or also\nwith the rectification of “natural inequalities” (Pogge\n1989: 44–47). Pogge (1995) argues that in the Original Position,\nit would be irrational for parties to ignore the contribution of\nnatural advantages to the well-being (understood in terms of the\nfulfillment of the two “higher-order interests”) of\nprospective citizens, since from that standpoint, it is just as bad to\nbe disadvantaged by uncompensated disabilities as it is to be\ndisadvantaged (to the same degree) by a small share of social primary\ngoods. But Pogge claims that attempting to eliminate those\ninequalities would go beyond the scope of justice. Some philosophers\nargue, however, that many natural inequalities are within the scope of\njustice, and that health care to mitigate them is a requirement of\njustice (Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000). \nOther philosophers and disability scholars would deny that the\ninequalities associated with impairments can be regarded as\n“natural” (Amundson 1992; Wasserman 2001). In questioning\nthe very notion of “natural inequalities”, they join a\nbroader philosophical debate about whether it is possible to draw a\ncoherent distinction between natural and artificial or social\ninequalities (see Lippert-Rasmussen 2004; Nagel 1997; Pogge 2004a,b;\nAas and Wasserman,\n 2016).[7]\n Even if such a distinction can be plausibly drawn, it may turn out\nthat many or most inequalities in abilities are artificial: as with of\nobsolete skills, those inequalities may be largely attributable to the\nphysical and social environment (Bickenbach 1993). \nOther distributive theories of justice take a less procedural approach\nthan Rawls. They are directly concerned with the kinds of outcomes a\njust society should pursue. These theories differ in the outcome\nmetrics they adopt—the “currency” of distributive\njustice (Cohen 1989). Some adopt a resource metric (Dworkin 1981b);\nstill others, a metric based on opportunities for welfare (Arneson\n1989) or access to advantage (Cohen 1989). Finally, capability\ntheories assess outcomes not only by the goods or resources that\npeople have, but also by what people are able to do with what they\nhave (Nussbaum 1990; Sen 1980). Such outcome-oriented theories may be\nmore or less demanding, depending on whether they require equality or\nmerely priority for the worst-off, and on whether they support\nequality of a sort that may not require the significant redistribution\nof goods or resources. \nThe most prominent family of outcome-oriented approaches has been\ncalled “luck egalitarianism” (see, for example, Arneson\n2000; Dworkin 2003; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015). According to the dominant\ncharacterization of that position, its central claim is that it is\nunjust when there are unfair inequalities in the distribution of\n“brute luck”—an advantage or disadvantage with\nrespect to the relevant metric that is not attributable to an\nindividual’s fault, choice, or assumption of risk. “Option\nluck”, in contrast, refers to an advantage or disadvantage an\nindividual acquires through the foreseeable consequences of his or her\nactions. The stronger versions of luck egalitarianism (e.g., Dworkin\n81b) deny that any inequality resulting from option luck generates\nclaims of justice. On those versions, only some disabilities generate\njustice claims—those that resulted from brute bad luck (e.g.,\ncongenital impairments)—whereas others, which may involve the\nsame or greater disadvantage, do not, simply because they resulted\nfrom a free choice (e.g., reckless pastimes or an unhealthy\nlifestyle). \nSome philosophers have taken these implications as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of luck egalitarianism (Anderson 1999), and they would\nno doubt be rejected by many writers on health care, who have\nquestioned the moral and policy relevance of individual responsibility\n(Cavallero 2011; Feiring 2008; Galvin 2002; Wikler 1987). The greater\nconcern for disability scholars may be with the conflation of\ndisadvantages resulting from unchosen impairments with disadvantages\nresulting from unchosen social conditions under the one heading of\n“bad brute luck”. Luck egalitarianism does not, as\nsuch, provide any principled rationale for distinguishing between\nequally severe setbacks to the well-being of people with disabilities\nthat result from the “bad luck” of being born in a society\nwith disability discrimination and the “bad luck” of being\nborn with an intrinsically disadvantageous set of physical\nabilities. Both are equally unchosen from the individual’s\nstandpoint, and it is individual responsibility, rather than some\ncombination of individual and collective responsibility, that\ndetermines whether a given disadvantage generates a valid justice\ncomplaint. This is not to deny that luck egalitarianism can be\nsupplemented to account for the intuition that the “bad\nluck” of being born in a disabling environment (Fine and Asch\n1988) differs morally from less socially mediated forms of bad luck,\nas we will see in our discussion of the capabilities approach. \nThe implications of outcome-oriented theories for disability depend on\ntwo features of those theories. The first is the metric, or\n“currency” of justice they adopt—welfare, resources,\nprimary goods, or capabilities. The second is the distributive\nstandard they impose—strict equality, priority for the worse\noff, or merely some minimum for everyone (sufficientarianism). We will\nconsider these two features in order, although they are sometimes\nintertwined. \nRawls and other social contract theorists adopted a broad outcome\nmetric for assessing the comparative advantage of the individual in a\nsociety: “social primary goods”, which include\nopportunities, basic liberties, income, and the social bases of\nself-respect. This breadth is intended to achieve neutrality between\ncompeting substantive conceptions of the good, since the social\nprimary goods are construed as “all-purpose means” that\nare valuable to have irrespective of the content of one’s\nparticular conception of the good. For many disability scholars, the\ndifficulty in this approach does not concern its neutrality, but its\nfailure to take account of the environment in which those goods must\nbe utilized, which may profoundly affect their value to those\nreceiving them. Two persons might be alike in their share of social\nprimary goods, and have similar projects, aims, commitments, and\nvalues, but nonetheless differ in the value they can derive from those\ngoods, if one person is disabled and the other is not. As we shall see\nbelow, the capabilities approach takes into account this objection,\nwhen the difference between the uses to which each person can put her\nprimary goods is construed as the result of differences in\n“internal resources”, or the rate at which the individual\ncan convert resources to “functionings”. \nA failure to take adequate account of the environment may also be\nfound in directly-egalitarian resource-based approaches. Dworkin\n(1981a,b), for example, appears to take the social environment for\ngranted in proposing a hypothetical division of resources into\nindividual bundles. Giving people with impairments equal material\nshares in a society like our own would hardly satisfy the demands of\nequality in a physical and social environment designed exclusively for\npeople with standard endowments. Dworkin is aware of the problem, but\nhis solution is to adjust individual shares to include insurance\npayouts against poor environmental fit, rather than to redesign the\nenvironment to reduce inequalities in fit. To that degree, Dworkin\nappears to tacitly assume a medical model of disability, according to\nwhich limitations resulting from impairments are solely attributable\nto the impairment itself, and, if not correctable, compensable only by\nthe redistribution of resources to people with such impairments. Such\ncompensation may ensure survival, but it does little to enhance or\nequalize participation, and may in fact hinder participation if\nAnderson (1999) is right that compensating for disabilities expresses\ndisrespect. Moreover, the size of the insurance payout for a given\ndisability is determined by the amount by which able-bodied people\nwould be willing to insure themselves against the prospect of\nincurring that disability. Insofar as the judgments of able-bodied\npeople don’t always track the intuitively relevant facts about\ndisability-related disadvantage, such an approach threatens to\n“bake in” flawed assumptions about the experience of\ndisability into its account of just entitlements for people with\ndisabilities (Bodenheimer 1997a,b). \nSeveral alternatives for assessing outcomes for purposes of political\nand social equality seem more responsive to the disabling role of the\nsocial environment. The most familiar and influential of these\nalternatives is the capabilities approach, developed in different ways\nby Martha Nussbaum (2006a) and Amartya Sen (1980). Their accounts are concerned\nnot only with the resources an individual has but also with what she\ncan do with them; with her “capability” of engaging in a\nnumber of valuable “functionings”, such as forming\nintimate relationships and having rich sensory and aesthetic\nexperiences. \nNussbaum’s earlier formulations of the capabilities placed\nconsiderable emphasis on species-typical functioning. For example, she\ninitially treated “the exercise of the five senses” as a\nnecessary constituent of human flourishing. More recent formulations\nare more congenial to social models of disability, in part because of\nNussbaum’s encounter with disability scholarship. She now makes\nroom for the social contribution to “natural” deficits\n(see Wasserman 1998; Terzi 2009), recognizing that most capabilities\nbear only a contingent, environmentally-mediated relationship to\npeople’s “natural endowment”. She abstracts from\ndifferences between people with impaired and normal limb function to\nfind a common claim to the means of moving about from place to place.\nSuch means may be architectural, vehicular, mechanical, or prosthetic;\nthey may involve making places more accessible or making the\nindividual more mobile. Similarly, a person lacking sight or hearing\ncan achieve aesthetic satisfaction by other means; a person with\nintellectual impairments can participate in activities structured to\ninclude individuals of varying cognitive skills. An individual with\nemphysema could increase his capacity for affiliation and control over\nthe material environment (two capabilities from Nussbaum’s\n2006a list) not only by\nmeasures to increase his lung capacity but also by measures to\nincrease his access to social and business venues through better\ntransit and architectural design. \nNussbaum’s broader framing enables her to recognize the\nprospects for flourishing of people with severe impairments. The\nplausibility of the capabilities approach for disability critics of\ndistributive accounts lies in the way the capabilities are\nindividuated. A basis for individuation might be found in a\ncomprehensive account of human nature and human flourishing, such as\nthe Aristotelian account that informs Nussbaum’s work. As Becker\nnotes, however, such a comprehensive account would have limited appeal\nin justifying a distributive scheme in a pluralistic society (2005:\n35). Despite its promise, considerably more work is needed to clarify\nher approach. Another feature of Nussbaum’s theory that some\ndisability theorists find congenial is her incorporation of\nrecognition and respect into her set of basic capabilities. Thus, the\ncapability for “affiliation” encompasses not only\nintimacy, but self-respect and dignity; the capability for\n“control over the environment” includes both the material\nand political environments. \nLess ambitiously than Nussbaum, Jonathan Wolff (2009b) classifies\nequality-enhancing measures for people with disabilities by the extent\nto which they address recognition as well as redistribution. Thus, the\nindividual limitations of people with disabilities can be addressed\nwith either cash compensation or “personal enhancement”,\nmedical, surgical, or rehabilitative measures to correct those\nlimitations. “Targeted resource enhancement” offers an\nintermediate option, which tries to improve the fit of the individual\nand the environment with a range of restricted resources such as\npersonal assistance and assistive technology. Finally, “status\nenhancement” alters the built environment and social practices\nto reduce the impact of individual differences in abilities on social\nequality. Wolff generally favors status enhancement as the most\nrespectful intervention, because it shapes the environment to the\nneeds of all members of society. It is also the most stable\nintervention, because it protects the social equality against sudden\nchanges in individuals’ levels of functioning. \nAlthough Wolff does not adopt the device of hypothetical decision\nmaking to justify a preference for status enhancement, that preference\ncould be underwritten by a suitably modified Original Position. As\nRichardson (2006) suggests, hypothetical decision makers who know that\nthey may represent individuals with severe impairments are more likely\nto be concerned with capabilities than with primary goods, since the\nlatter by themselves may be of limited value to those they represent.\nFurther, those decision makers would recognize that capabilities often\ncan be increased more respectfully, as well as more effectively, by\nstatus enhancements than by other measures. \nYet doubts remain about the extent to which concerns about\nrecognition, respect, and social equality can be captured in any\noutcome metric of individual well-being, however broad. Thus,\nChristian Schemmel (2012) argues that the treatment of people as\nequals must be understood in terms of respectful relationships among\nindividuals and institutions, and that the presence of such\nrelationships cannot plausibly be regarded in what Pogge (2004a,b)\ncalls “recipient-oriented” terms, as components of\nindividual well-being. The moral significance of respectful treatment\nis neither exhausted by, nor derivative of, its contribution to\nindividual well-being. As Schemmel argues (2012: 19), people may need\nsome forms of affiliation to flourish but do not necessarily require\nsocial and political equality for their own well-being. The\nplausibility of these claims depends to some extent on how narrow or\nbroad a conception of well-being one adopts. A conception that\nencompasses virtually all that a person has reason to care about will\nmore easily accommodate social equality and respectful\nrelationships. \nTwo approaches seek to moderate the ambitions of distributive justice\nin ways that may be more inclusive of people with disabilities. One\ntakes the end-state of justice not as equality or priority but\nsufficiency: it requires that every member of society reach some\nminimum in the appropriate “currency”. This approach,\nlabeled “sufficientarian” by one critic (Arneson 2006), is\nsuggested but not endorsed by Nussbaum, and it serves to make\ncapabilities a less demanding metric for distributive justice.\n(Nussbaum notes that certain capabilities must be distributed equally\nif anyone is to have a sufficient level of them, e.g., voting rights.)\nThe requirement that a just society ensure that every citizen reaches\na minimum level of each capability may be far less demanding than the\nrequirement of equal capabilities. One way of setting the minimum\nappeals to the requirements for participation in a democratic society\n(Gutmann 1987; Anderson 1999). \nAlthough sufficientarian approaches claim to make the demands of\njustice less oppressive, they have been criticized as demanding both too\nmuch and too little. They demand too much if the minimum for every\ncapability must be met in the face of recalcitrant impairments or\nenvironments. They demand too little if attaining the minimum could\nstill leave the individual with a miserable life (Arneson 2006;\nWasserman 2006; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007). Those approaches have also\nbeen criticized for lacking a mechanism for prioritizing capabilities\n(Wolff and de-Shalit 2007) and for assessing whether the minimum has\nbeen reached for any one capability (Riddle 2010). Clearly, the extent\nto which justice is achievable on such approaches for people with\nsevere disabilities will depend on where the minimum is set, how its\nsatisfaction is assessed, and how the capabilities are defined. \nA second approach would replace equality on a specific metric of\nadvantage with social equality or equality of respect (Anderson 1999;\nMiller 1999; Norman 1997, 1999). This approach would involve a more\nradical departure from luck egalitarianism than a sufficiency account,\nsince it does not lower the standard for a just distribution so much\nas propose a non-distributive standard for justice. That standard\nwould see justice in terms of recognition rather than, or as well as,\nredistribution. Although this approach may demand strict equality of a\nsort, it is a sort that does not appear to set determinate\ndistributive requirements. A society of social equals, abounding in\nmutual respect, can arguably tolerate significant disparities in\nwelfare, resources, opportunities, or capabilities. \nUnderlying this approach is the more fundamental distinction between\nrelational and distributive theories of justice. Although this\ndistinction can be drawn in different ways (see, e.g.,\nLippert-Rasmussen 2015, Fourie et al. 2015), it identifies two\ncritical dimensions of justice. One concerns how well-off individual\npeople are, both absolutely and in comparison to each other. The other\nconcerns the kinds of social relationships people stand in to one\nanother. As discussed in\n §4.3,\n it is a difficult question to what extent either dimension of justice\ncan be reduced to, or expressed in terms of, the other. \nAgainst the claim that relational justice can be understood as an\ninstance of distributive justice, one may observe that at least with\nrespect to equality, there seems to be an important\nstructural difference between two people standing in some\nrelation to some third thing (i.e., some good) to the same\ndegree and two people standing in some relation to one\nanother to the same degree (e.g., the relation of being\nrespected, recognized, and so on). Insofar as interpersonal equality\nhas a different structure when construed as relational, it is a\nmistake to think that it can be reduced to a species of distributive\nequality, for “equal” means something different in each\ncase. For example, it is one thing for any two people in society to\nhave equal respect from others; it is a different thing for\nany two people in society to have equal respect for one\nanother. This distinction is relevant to debates about disability\nin particular, because one way to understand the social model is in\nterms of the relational view—its core insight is that disability\nis not a one-place property of individuals, defined in terms of some\nwelfare deficit, but an n-place relation between individuals (n>2)\ndefined by stigmatizing or excluding attitudes, dispositions,\npractices, and forms of treatment. \nSome of these issues have taken center-stage in a recent debate over\nthe expressive significance of different measures to remediate the\ndisadvantages associated with disability. Pogge (2002) and Anderson\n(1999) have claimed that it is disrespectful to attribute a\nperson’s disadvantage to features of his or her natural\nendowment because it treats her as needy, deficient, or inferior. For\nthis reason, they argue against justifying redistributive measures to\nachieve inclusion on the grounds that they correct natural\ninequalities in skills, talents, or the ability to convert resources\ninto welfare. Instead, they contend that such measures can and should\nbe justified as redressing discrimination, and conversely, that\nfailures to achieve inclusion should be recognized as unjustly\ndiscriminatory. \nBarclay (2010, 2018) challenges the argument that a claim for\nredistribution treats the claimant as deficient or inferior. Such\nclaims need only recognize that some traits are less suited than\nothers for specific environments—a contingency that does not\nimply the intrinsic superiority or inferiority of a given endowment.\nShe thus questions those (e.g, Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000) who\nclaim that certain characteristics or traits are universally valuable,\nsuch that an individual who lacked them would be deficient in any\nenvironment. Although she tends to see the environment as fixed rather\nthan malleable, Barclay argues that the project of achieving inclusion\nis best seen in terms of maximizing individuals’ environmental\nfit. Achieving that fit may require expending more resources for some\nindividuals than others in any given environment. The demands made by\nvery tall or left-handed people for greater accommodation do not\npresuppose their inferiority, only their minority status (see\n §2,\n infra). These comparisons suggest that the demands for accommodation\nof people with such statistically atypical features differ merely in\ndegree, not kind, from those made by people with various\nimpairments. \nEven if compensation for disadvantage need bit be demeaning, however,\nspecific grounds for compensation may well be. Laws and policies that\ncompensate people simply because they are disabled, or have a specific\ndisability, may be objectionable because of the social meaning of\ndisability-compensation. Compensation that is based on the medical\nclassification of disability may reinforce the humanity-obscuring\nstereotype of “the cripple” as helpless and pitiable. This\ngrave threat to social equality should make us wary of drawing\ndistributive implications from the claim that disability is a\n“bad difference” rather than a “mere difference\n“(see entry, “Disability: Well-Being, Health, and Personal\nRelationships”). Even if disability in general, or specific\ndisabilities, were bad differences, that would hardly imply that\nindividuals who had (those) disabilities were entitled to compensation\nsimply by virtue of that fact. \nThere are many categories or groups into which people can place\nthemselves, and be placed, on the basis of their varying\ncharacteristics. The salience and appeal of these categories depend on\nsocial and historical context as well as individual preferences and\nvalues. Identity and identity politics become important as members of\nhistorically excluded groups challenge their status and work for\ninclusion. Many women gained a sense of group identity in opposing\nlaws that limited voting and other political rights to men; racial\nidentities have been forged in the fight against segregation. Although\npeople with disabilities are not always understood as sharing an\nidentity, their awareness of membership in an oppressed group has been\nshaped by exclusionary laws and customs, from “ugly laws”\nprohibiting people with physical deformities from appearing in public\nto the state-sponsored involuntary sterilization of “mental\ndefectives”. A sense of group identity has been further\nencouraged by welfare, social security and other laws that place\npeople with various disabilities in a single category, even if they\ndefine that category in different ways. \nThe importance of disability as a social category was increased by the\nmovement to establish civil rights for people with disabilities. As in\nthe case of other stigmatized groups, the characteristics used as a\nground for exclusion became a basis for mobilization and a source of\npride. The social model of disability, which informed the movement for\ndisability rights, emphasized what people with various impairments\nhave in common—their stigmatization and exclusion—and\nthereby promoted the emergence of disability as a powerful social\nidentity. \nCritics like Fraser argue that the importance of social identity\ncannot be adequately captured in any metric of individual advantage.\nAn effective social response to stigmatized identities requires both\nrecognition and transformation—changes in cultural framing and\nsocial perception that are poorly served by redistribution. An\nemphasis on redistribution is often self-defeating, exacerbating\nstigma and reinforcing the impression of the stigmatized group as\ndeficient (Fraser 1995, 1997; see Olsen 2001). Yet as we will discuss, some\nways of transforming social identity have significant dangers as\nwell. \nFor proponents of recognition, one issue is whether justice requires\nnot only respect for individual members of society, but also respect\nfor their group or cultural identities. Must a just society recognize\n“group-specific cultural identity” or merely “the\nstatus of group members as full partners in social interaction”\n(Fraser 2001: 23, 24)? Are these separate requirements, or does\nrespect for an individual entail respect for her social or cultural\nidentities? These questions have been addressed primarily with respect\nto religious, ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. Very little work\nhas been done on the question of what a disability identity would look\nlike and what sorts of recognition claims it would implicate. \nA somewhat parallel issue has been raised in distributive\njustice—must society allocate resources, broadly construed, to\nsupport the group and cultural identities of its members? That support\ncould be based on the claim that such identities are a constituent,\nperhaps an irreducible one, of the well-being of the individual\nmembers of society. This claim has been suggested by justice theorists\nwho argue for the importance of culture as a “context of\nchoice” for individuals (e.g., Kymlicka 1989, Sparrow 2005). An\nindividual deprived of a culture through which he has experienced and\ninterpreted the world will find it far more difficult to flourish. As\nwe will discuss, however, it is doubtful that disability in general,\nor particular impairments, play such a comprehensive role in the lives\nof many—let alone all—people with\n disabilities.[8] \nWe begin by describing the different characteristics of an\nindividual’s “identity”. One sense of this term is\nthat of numerical identity over time: what makes some person at time\nt1 the same person as the person at time t2? (see SEP entry on\n identity over time).\n This is, in the first instance, a metaphysical question and not our\ninterest here. A different sense of “identity” refers to\nthose characteristics that make one the particular person one is, as\njudged both by oneself and by others. This includes narrative,\nbiographical, and practical identities. It is less about criteria for\nsameness over time and more about the constitutive or defining\nfeatures of one’s self- (or social) conception. This is the\nsense of “identity” we will be concerned with. \nThe sense of individual identity most directly relevant to respect and\nrecognition is arguably that of practical identity. Following\nKorsgaard (1996, 2009), we can understand a practical identity to be a\ndescription under which a person values herself, where valuing oneself\ninvolves treating oneself as a source of reasons. For example, someone\nwho identifies as a mother in this sense values herself under the\ndescription “mother” and for that reason treats the fact\nthat she is a mother as a source of (normative practical) reasons.\nMoreover, to “drop” this identification is not like\ndropping a desire or short-term goal. It involves changing one’s\nsense of who one is as a person and what gives one’s life\nvalue. \nOn this view, a person’s practical identities should be\nnormatively significant for other people as well. For one thing, many\nof a person’s significant interests are derived from\nher practical identities. Since it is uncontroversial that respect and\nconcern require giving appropriate weight to the interests of others,\nit follows that respect and concern require giving appropriate weight\nto other people’s practical identities, at least insofar as they\ngenerate (legitimate) interests. In addition, respecting a\nperson’s practical identities plausibly falls under a more\ngeneral requirement of respect for personal autonomy. Personal\nautonomy is a foundational value of liberal democracies, whose laws\nand policies do not require individuals to organize their lives around\nany particular identity, but rather give them the latitude to make of\ntheir identities what they will (Appiah 2005; Appiah and Gutmann 1996;\nsee also the SEP entry on\n identity politics).\n This can be seen as a part of liberalism’s broader commitment\nto neutrality about conceptions of the good (e.g., Rawls 1993). \nThese issues become especially charged if we move from individual to\ngroup identities, bringing us closer to the question of disability\nidentities. As K. Anthony Appiah points out, though individual\nidentity is different from group identity, it nevertheless has a\ncollective or social dimension (Appiah 2005: 21). For example,\nPalestinians living in the West Bank have a distinct collective\nidentity. This is different from, though certainly compatible with,\nsome specific West Bank resident having as part of his individual\nidentity being a\n Palestinian.[9]\n It is important to bear this distinction between individual and\ncollective identities in mind, because the latter, to a greater extent\nthan the former, is imposed or “ascribed” by the larger\nsociety rather than chosen by the individual. \nBeing disabled, like being a member of a minority race, subjects one\nto particular treatment. But one can experience that treatment without\nfeeling compelled to regard one’s disability or minority status\nas part of one’s individual identity in the practical sense of\nbeing a description under which one values oneself. Often, having a\ndisability identity ascribed to one, like having a racial identity\nascribed, consists in part in being the object of, and provides an\nexcuse for, discriminatory, demeaning or degrading treatment of\nvarious sorts. This is so both for people whose impairments are\nimmediately observable and for those whose impairments are hidden but\nsubject to exposure and ridicule by a temporary change in appearance,\ne.g., a person with epilepsy who has a seizure in public (Schneider\nand Conrad 1985; more generally, Davis 2005). And since this social\nidentity is often part of one’s individual identity, such\ntreatment is likely to be injurious to the self-respect of the one\nwith this identity, and in that sense constitute an instance of\nmisrecognition. Ironically, the fact of being unfairly stereotyped can\nitself shape the identities of those who are treated in this way, as\nAppiah notes, even if initially they did not identify strongly with\nthe group in question. \nDesirable change with respect to social identities is possible in at\nleast two ways. First, even if some important aspects of one’s\nself are not chosen—say, the fact that one has paraplegia or\ndeafness—how central they are to one’s self-conception,\nhow much they matter to one’s interests and plans, is to some\nextent within one’s voluntary control. On some views, notably\nKorsgaard’s, reflective endorsement of an identity is a\nnecessary condition of its being normative for the agent, i.e.,\nproviding reasons for her. At the same time, the extent to which\none’s identifications are voluntary depends on the constraints\nof the social environment. One cannot simply decide to make\none’s disability a less salient feature of one’s\nbiographical identity, at least, especially if one’s disability\nis not “hidden”. If the identity is ascribed, and\nemphasized, by the larger society, it may be difficult to reduce its\nimportance in one’s own practical reasoning. But one still has\nsome choice about whether to accept or resist that emphasis. \nSecond, there can be a change in the valence of the label, as\nthere has been with the term “queer”: what was once a\nnegative label, accompanied by unjust treatment of various sorts, can\nbe transformed into a positive label and championed as a source of\nself-respect and pride for those who share in the collective identity.\nJohn Lawson discusses how special education for disabled children,\nonce seen as a major factor in the creation of a negative,\nsecond-class identity, can be transformed into “sites for the\npositive promotion of disability as a cultural identity” (Lawson\n2001: 203–21). Neither sort of change—in identification or\nvalence—can be accomplished without struggle, personal as well\nas political, but partial success is sometimes achievable. \nEven if disability is not and does not have to be a central component\nof every disabled person’s identity, this does not negate the\nsignificance of disability as an organizing principle of political\naction. But when the social and political recognition of disability\nbecomes the objective of political action, as it is in identity\npolitics, it gives rise to the “dilemma of difference”\n(Minow 1990). Consider special education for children: On the one\nhand, labeling a child “disabled” risks stigmatizing and\nisolating the child. In this sense, to be “different” is\nto be inferior. Alternatively, being labeled “disabled” is\na way for parents to secure attention to the child’s particular\nways of learning and functioning. In this sense, to be\n“different” is to be entitled to appropriate educational\nassistance. \nThe dilemma may not be insurmountable. The movement for universal\ndesign in education aims to refashion classrooms and teaching\npractices to encourage the participation of all students. To the\nextent that the movement is successful, it will minimize the need for\n“special education” (Biklen 1992; Gartner and Lipsky 2002;\nLipsky and Gartner 1996). Law and public policy must think creatively\nabout ways to solve this dilemma so that the stigma they seek to\neliminate is not in effect reinforced. Success in resolving the\ndilemma of difference may reduce the importance of disability identity\nfor justice. If disability is simply a characteristic to be taken\naccount of in social arrangements, it could become as significant or\ninsignificant as height or aptitude. \nThere are at least two other risks for an identity politics of\ndisability. One involves the danger of assuming that the members of a\nparticular marginalized group all share the same culture, be it\nAfrican-American culture or disability culture. This assumption is not\nrequired by a mature identity politics, but it may be encouraged by\nefforts to mobilize diverse individuals around a single identity. Two\nconsiderations may help to resist this tendency. First, we must\nrecognize that culture is a complex concept, and that defining it is\nno easy task. Second, we must recognize that on any plausible\ndefinition, people with the same disability (let alone different\ndisabilities) need not share a common culture. There are some examples\nof a shared disability culture: Deaf culture is perhaps the best\nknown. But many people who are deaf, particularly those who do not\nsign, do not identify as Deaf or take part in Deaf culture (Tucker\n1997[10]\n And even for those who participate, Deaf culture does not appear to\nbe the kind of “encompassing” or\n“comprehensive” culture claimed by Kymlicka, Margalit, and\nRaz to provide a “context of choice” for its\n members.[11] \nThe second, related risk involves privileging one identity over\nothers. This is especially important for people with multiple or\n“intersectional” identities. People who are\nAfrican-American and disabled, or female and disabled, or disabled and\nLGBT may sometimes feel a conflict between those identities. In one\nstudy, for example, African-American women with mobility impairments\nreported that they felt estranged from the disability-rights movement,\npartly because its leadership seemed predominantly white, and partly\nbecause some of its principal goals—to maximize\nindependence—went against their more communal values, which\nemphasized family and co-dependence (Feldman and Tegart 2003). More\ngenerally, although there has been comparatively little discussion of\nthe intersection between disability and race within philosophical work\non disability (though see Stubblefield 2009), more discussion can be\nfound in disability studies more generally (e.g., Bell 2011). Also,\nsome have noted that mainstream feminism’s focus on independence\nand self-sufficiency has tended to exclude women with disabilities,\nwho are perceived as lacking in these cardinal virtues (Crawford and\nOstrove 2003; Wendell 1996). At the same time, disabled women are\noften particularly vulnerable to the injustices that motivate the\nfeminist movement: they are frequently victims of sexual exploitation\n(Crawford and Ostrove 2003), encounter many obstacles to leaving\ndissatisfying relationships because of physical, psychological and\nfinancial dependency (Olkin 2003), and have median incomes below the\npoverty line and substantially lower than those of their male\ncounterparts (Crawford and Ostrove 2003; Olkin 1999). \nIn addition to these potential risks associated with emphasizing\nidentity politics for persons with disabilities and other stigmatized\nminorities, there have been several major challenges in mobilizing\npeople with disabilities around an affirmative group or cultural\nidentity. The first, addressed by the disability rights movement, was\ngetting people with disabilities to recognize that they have something\nin common with others who are differently impaired but also suffer\nstigma and exclusion because of their impairment. This has been\ndifficult because people who are born with disabilities or acquire\nthem in childhood come from widely dispersed socioeconomic, geographic\nand racial groups (Scotch 1988) and so are less likely to grow up with\na sense of group identity. Another obstacle has been the\noverwhelmingly negative connotation of the label\n“disabled”. Indeed, the challenge for people with visual,\nmotor, and psychiatric impairments has been to recognize that they\nshare a “disabled” identity while denying that this makes\nthem dependent, child-like, or powerless (Asch 1985; Scotch 1988);\nsuch a self-identity would quite literally disable\none’s capacity for social participation and political\naction. \nIt is instructive to compare how the medical and social models would\naddress these challenges. The medical model suggests a disability\nidentity that is both fragmented and negative. Because the medical\nmodel defines disability in terms of particular physical or mental\nimpairments, the primary commonalities it recognizes among disabled\npeople are strictly functional; it views the blind person and the deaf\nperson as having very different problems. Although it could recognize\nthe fact that such biomedically distinct conditions had similar social\nconsequences—stigmatization and exclusion—it would treat\nthose similar consequences merely as secondary effects of the two\nconditions. Even within a single impairment, a medical model\nencourages distinctions based on etiology. For example, it would\ndistinguish blindness due to Leber’s congenital amaurosis from\nblindness due to retinaopathy of prematurity, focusing on genetic\ntesting for the former and treatment for the latter, and placing less\nemphasis on the shared challenges of living with blindness. Although\nthis narrow focus may be appropriate for the purposes of clinical\nintervention, it obscures the recognition of disability as a social\nand political problem, except insofar as it raises perennial questions\nabout how to distribute scarce health-care resources (Barnartt et al.\n2001). \nIn contrast, the various social models were explicitly formulated to\nsupport a disability identity that could serve as the basis for claims\nof respect and recognition. The inclusion of people with a vast array\nof different impairments in United States and other national civil\nrights laws, and the creation of the United Nations convention on the\nrights of persons with disabilities, have helped to forge a shared\ndisability identity. The emergence of disability studies as a\nrecognized field of academic inquiry has also contributed. The\nminority group model promotes a trans-impairment identity by treating\npeople with disabilities as a “discrete and insular\nminority” making claims on a generally stigmatizing able-bodied\nmajority. Though the minority group model has proven extremely useful\nin passing anti-discrimination laws, it may do so at the expense of\nemphasizing the differences between people with disabilities\nand people without them, rather than highlighting the many ways in\nwhich identity need not be tied to the presence or absence of an\nimpairment. The human variation model tempers this emphasis, and\nresists essentialism about disability identity, by treating the group\nitself as socially constructed. It sees the category of “the\ndisabled” as resting on an artificial dichotomy imposed on a\ncontinuum of variation. The conceptualization of disability as just\none source of difference, and as a difference in kind more than\ndegree, can undercut a sense of disability as the basis for a unique\nand exclusive identity. \nThe more the redesign of the physical and social environment is guided\nby a thoroughgoing human-variation model, the less dominant disability\nidentity and identity politics may become for people with\ndisabilities. A society in which disabilities lack the social and\npractical significance they currently have may be one in which the\nequality of people with disabilities can be fully recognized without\nhaving to treat disability as a salient feature of their\nidentities. \nIt may be, though, that the physical, sensory, or psychic experience\nof a particular impairment turns out to be central and salient to how\nthose with the impairment live—even in a society deeply\ncommitted to inclusion, participation, and non-discrimination. Perhaps\ncommunicating primarily gesturally and not vocally, or moving through\nthe world with wheels and not on legs, or focusing on detail rather than context, makes the lives of people who are deaf, or\nparalyzed, or autistic sufficiently distinctive that they feel a\nstrong affinity and connection with others who have the same\nimpairment (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for a discussion of this claim.) Disability theorists who adopt\ndifferent social model approaches might profitably consider how\ndifferent views about group and individual identity apply to people\nwith disabilities. \nThe connection between different models of disability and different\nways of understanding disability identity points us in the direction\nof an important category of injustice, in addition to the distributive\nand relational conceptions already discussed. This is epistemic\ninjustice (Fricker 2007; Barnes, 2016). Epistemic injustice\nconsists in a person’s being wronged in her capacity as an\nepistemic subject. Testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nknowledge, while hermeneutical injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nunderstanding. More specifically, testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s testimony being given less credence than the evidence\nwarrants due to prejudice on the part of the hearer, while\nhermeneutical injustice consists in someone’s experiences being\nobscured from individual and collective understanding due to wrongful\nexclusion from the practices by which those understandings are\ngenerated. Both have clear implications for disability, justice, and\nidentity. \nFor example, consider the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\nto assess the prospective benefits of health care interventions. The\nstandard method of “quality adjustment” involves (i)\nassigning a value of 1 to each life-year one can reasonably expect to\nsave through a given intervention, and (ii) discounting each life-year\nthat would be lived by a person with a disability by some coefficient\n(between 0 and 1) which is thought to reflect the badness of living\nwith the disability in question. These coefficients are typically\narrived at by asking people how many years of life with the\ndisability people would be willing to exchange for each year of life\nwithout the disability. For example, suppose survey data\nindicate that people would trade 8 years of life with blindness for 4\nyears of life with sight. The method of quality-adjustment would\nassign a QALY of 0.5 to each year of life lived with blindness. The\nupshot is that saving nondisabled life-years provides more “bang\nfor your buck” in the QALY model, and as such is to be preferred\nto saving disabled life-years. \nThis implication has led some to criticize the method of\nquality-adjustment on the grounds that it produces a kind of\n“double jeopardy:” people with disabilities are\ndisadvantaged twice-over, first by having the disability itself,\nsecond by having their health care needs discounted for that very\nreason (e.g., Singer et al. 1995; Bognar 2011; John et al. 2017). But\nthere is another way of thinking about QALYs which takes issue with\nboth quality-adjustment and an assumption behind the double-jeopardy\ncriticism. When the “exchange rate” between disabled and\nnon-disabled life-years is calculated, it is primarily or exclusively\nbased the judgments of able-bodied people. This feature is\ncriticizable on two distinct grounds. One is that it disrespects the\nfirst-person authority of people with disabilities, who know\nfirst-hand what it’s like to have the disability in question\n(and, if disabled as adults, know also what it’s like\nnot to have the disability). This disrespect for first-person\nauthority is plausibly an example of testimonial injustice, at least\ninsofar as it reflects prejudicial or otherwise biased attitudes on\nthe part of the able-bodied. A second, related criticism is that this\napproach exaggerates the difference in quality between able-bodied and\ndisabled lives, relative to an approach that appropriately\nincorporated and weighed the perspectives of people with disabilities.\nAble-bodied people often overestimate how bad it would be to have a\ngiven disability, given popular stereotypes which depict life with\ndisability as tragic, occlusive of life’s major goods, and so\non. This is plausibly an example of hermeneutical injustice, insofar\nas the poor understanding of disabled people’s experiences and\nidentities results from their exclusion from the public sphere. This\nis only one example; much work remains to be done exploring the\nimplications of epistemic injustice for people with disabilities. \nThis entry began by pointing out a feature of disability that\ndistinguishes it from other characteristics which have often been seen\nas grounding legitimate claims of justice, such as race, sex, sexual\nand gender identity, and religion. Simply put, achieving full\ninclusion for people with disabilities is expensive to a\ndegree that achieving full inclusion for other minorities is not. Any\nplausible theory of inclusion implies the necessity of considerable\naccommodation and environmental reconstruction. And even if the costs\nof such measures have often been exaggerated, it is difficult to see\nhow the appropriate degree of accommodation and reconstruction would\nnot require diverting significant amounts of resources from other\nworthy goals, including some goals which are supported by\ncountervailing considerations of justice. One implication of this\nfeature of disability is that disability requires us to directly\ncompare, and perhaps trade off, values of relational justice, which\nground the demand for full inclusion as part of a society of equals,\nand values of distributive justice, which ground the demand for a fair\ndistribution of scarce resources.  \nHaving made this general point, the entry proceeded to discuss\ndifferent models of disability, which differ principally in their\nunderstanding of the relationship between impairment and limitation.\nWhereas the medical model of disability tends to attribute most of the\nlimitations associated with disability to functional aspects of the\nrelevant impairments, the social model of disability emphasizes the\nmediating role of the social environment—broadly understood to\ninclude the configuration of physical space, the availability of\nvarious forms of accommodation, social practices and norms,\netc.—in generating disability-related disadvantage. Among other\nthings, the social model highlights the relational aspects of\ndisability-related disadvantage, such as stigma, invisibility, and\nexclusion, whereas the medical model lends itself to a narrow\ndistributive interpretation of the claims of justice generated by\ndisability. \nIn subsequent sections, the entry focused on the role of disability in\ncontractualist and other distributive theories of justice. Disability\nhas often been regarded as a “limit case” for\ncontractualist theories of justice, and more specifically for the\nidealizing assumptions these theories make about the capacities of\nthose who choose and those who are governed by contractualist\nprinciples of justice. We also saw that disability has played a\ncentral role in discussions of outcome-oriented, distributive theories\nof justice, in particular luck egalitarianism. Internally, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the\n“currency” of justice, since it has often been seen as a\nparadigm example of unchosen disadvantage. Externally, disability has\nplayed a central role in relational criticisms of luck egalitarian\ntheories of justice. At best, these theories have been seen as failing\nto attribute normative significance to morally relevant differences\nbetween identical patterns of distribution which differ in the causal\ncontribution of the social environment. At worst, these theories have\nbeen criticized for expressing disrespect towards people with\ndisabilities in virtue of characterizing them as “mere”\nunfortunates or objects of pity. Although some of these criticisms may\nbe overstated, they have been taken to heart by many theorists of\ndistributive justice, especially proponents of the capabilities\napproach. Finally, the entry concluded by pointing to a topic which\nhas received far less attention in discussions of disability and\njustice: namely, the normative significance of disability as a form of\nsocial identity, and the connections between disability and epistemic\ninjustice. \nThis entry raises a number of questions which would benefit from\nfurther exploration. Clearly, one general question is how exactly to\nunderstand the distinction between distributive and relational values\nof justice. Another, related question is how to assess the comparative\nweight or importance of these values. And if, as many find plausible,\nsome form of pluralism about justice is the correct answer, then we\nwill need to work out how the relevant trade-offs, weights, and so on\napply to the special case of disability, which simultaneously raises\nboth distributive and relational concerns. A third question which\ncalls for further research is the link between disability and\nepistemic injustice. We briefly discussed two examples of testimonial\nand hermeneutical injustice concerning people with disabilities, but\nthere are—needless to say—many more. Indeed, disability\nmay be an especially powerful example of epistemic injustice precisely\nbecause the phenomenological experiences of people with disabilities,\nespecially those with sensory impairments, differ considerably\nfrom the experiences of the able-bodied majority, raising the hard\nquestion of how well we must understand others in order to treat them\nas justice requires.","contact.mail":"daniel.m.putnam@dartmouth.edu","contact.domain":"dartmouth.edu"},{"date.published":"2013-05-23","date.changed":"2019-07-02","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-justice/","author1":"Daniel Putnam","author2":"David Wasserman","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"disability-justice","body.text":"\n\n\nAmong the topics in philosophy and disability, the relationship\nbetween disability and justice has received the lion’s share of\nattention. No doubt this is in part because justice, often regarded as\nthe “first virtue of social institutions” (Rawls 1971: 3),\nis central to the evaluation of social policies and public\ninstitutions. But it is also because disability has played at least\ntwo distinct roles in recent discussions of social justice. First,\ndisability has been seen by many as a paradigm example of unchosen\ndisadvantage. Hence, disability has played a central role in internal\ndiscussions of luck egalitarianism, in particular with respect to the\n“currency” question—equality of what?—and\nexternal discussions, in particular with respect to the question of\nwhether luck egalitarianism is disrespectful or stigmatizing. Second,\npeople with disabilities, particularly intellectual or cognitive\ndisabilities, have been seen by many as a “limit case” for\ncontractarian or contractualist theories of justice. Hence, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the eligibility\nconditions for being party to the contractual procedures by which\nprinciples of justice are chosen and for being subject to the\nprinciples of justice so chosen.\n\n\nDisability also presents difficult issues as a social or group\nidentity: roughly, a central part of the way an individual\nunderstands, presents, or values herself. This aspect of disability\nhas been made salient by the civil rights movement that established\ndisability as an important category in antidiscrimination law.\nTheories that assess justice in terms of the distribution of resources\nor opportunities have sometimes been criticized for failing to take\nadequate account of such identities. But the embrace of social\nidentity as a component of justice can be equally problematic.\n\n\nDisability is of special interest for justice because of the way in\nwhich it juxtaposes two basic and powerful senses of\ninjustice. These two senses of injustice are sometimes\nexpressed in terms of a distinction between the justice of\ndistributions and the justice of recognition, or\nmore recently, between distributive justice and\nrelational injustice. Very roughly, we can think of these\nlabels as denoting a distinction between the injustice of certain\noutcomes—in particular, outcomes in which there is an\ninequality of income, wealth, health, or other aspects of well-being\nresulting from morally irrelevant factors—and the injustice of\ncertain forms of treatment—in particular, the treatment\nof some people as moral, social, or political inferiors on\nthe basis of morally irrelevant characteristics. Correcting the first\nform of injustice is thought to require, fundamentally, a change in\nthe distribution of resources, broadly construed, that affect\nwell-being. Correcting the first form of injustice is thought to\nrequire, fundamentally, a change in the structure and character of\ninterpersonal relationships, which may in turn require changes to\nsocial and institutional norms and practices. Needless to say, the\nrelationship and comparative importance of these two forms of\ninjustice have been the subject of considerable discussion, and there\nis no canonical statement of the distinction (Fourie et al. 2015;\nAnderson 1999; Fraser 2001, 1996; Honneth 1992).\n\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Section 1 will discuss disability\nin terms of these two broad types of injustice. Sections 2 and 3 will\nexamine the implications of different models of disability for the\ndistinction between redistribution and recognition. Section 4 will\nthen examine the treatment of disability in contemporary theories of\ndistributive justice. It will explain how the environmental and social\ncharacter of disability has been largely overlooked by contractarian\nand egalitarian theories, not so much because of their distributive\nfocus, but because of their narrow focus on one aspect of\ndisability—functional limitation—to the neglect of\nexclusionary attitudes and practices. Section 4 will conclude by\ndiscussing recent efforts to rectify this neglect, describing several\nways in which distributive justice theorists have sought to take\naccount of environmental and social barriers and to address claims for\nrecognition. These efforts include broadening the metric for just\ndistributions to encompass respectful relationships and social\npractices; arguing that a just distribution on such broader metrics\ncan be attained more effectively and appropriately by modifying the\nphysical and social environment than by redistributing resources among\nindividuals; and adopting outcome standards that do not require strict\nequality on any metric but rather the reduction or elimination of\ndisrespectful inequalities. Section 5 will discuss a major issue in\nthe recognition of disability: the relationship of disability identity\nto various approaches to justice, where “identity” is\nunderstood as a part of an individual’s self-understanding or\nself-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that people with disabilities have long been treated as\nmoral and social inferiors, at the same time that they have suffered\ndistributive injustices of various kinds (see generally, Barclay\n2018). Routinely, people with disabilities have been denied jobs for\nwhich they are highly qualified because they have been considered\nincompetent, or because employers have not been comfortable with their\npresence in the workplace. Often, people with certain disabilities\nhave been consigned to segregated institutions and facilities because\nthey have been regarded as incapable of making decisions or caring for\nthemselves, or because others in the community did not want to\ninteract with them. \nThese forms of relational injustice are associated with very concrete\nmaterial inequalities. In 2009, almost 20 years after the passage of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the employment-population ratio\nof people with disabilities in the United States was 19.2%, compared\nto 64.5% for persons without a disability (Bureau of Labor Statistics\n2010). Based on data from 1996–1999, researchers estimate that\n47.4% of working-age adults who experienced poverty for a year or more\nhad at least one disability (Fremstad 2009). \nFacts such as these have led some to conclude that  \nin particular, internally diverse ways, people with disabilities have\nbeen on the end of a kind of pincer movement between Fraser’s\ntwo impediments to parity: “misrecognition” and\n“maldistribution” (Calder 2010: 62). \nIn these respects, people with disabilities are in a comparable\nposition to members of other “discrete and insular\nminorities” with a history of being subject to both distributive\nand relational injustice. But there is a significant difference.\nSimply put, there is no reason to think that it need be particularly\nexpensive to eliminate disrespect and misrecognition towards\nracial, ethnic, and sexual minorities. But insofar as accommodation\nand reconstruction of the built environment are necessary to eliminate\ndisrespect and misrecognition towards people with disabilities,\nrelational justice for people with disabilities may require diverting\nsignificant resources from other causes. In that sense, achieving\njustice for people with disabilities requires us to directly address\nthe relationship between relational justice and distributive justice\nto a degree that achieving justice for members of other groups\ngenerally does not.  \nTo be sure, the costs associated with accommodation and reconstruction\nof the built environment need not be understood as\ncompensation for the alleged deficits of people with\ndisabilities. Indeed, they would have to be acknowledged even if\ndisabilities were seen as intrinsically neutral physical or mental\ncharacteristics that merely differ from those of a majority of the\npopulation. In any society whose physical structures and social\npractices are designed for average or typical members, people with\ndisabilities will be disadvantaged just because of their minority\nstatus. A similar point has been made by feminist scholars, who have\npointed out the structural discrimination of workplaces and public\nsettings designed exclusively for men. The expenses of additional\nrestrooms, stalls, or pumping stations do not compensate women for\ntheir deficiencies. They simply accommodate differences ignored in a\nsociety that saw a woman’s place as in the home (Wendell 1996;\nWasserman 1998: 178–179). \nStill, the rectification of such structural discrimination may raise\nmore difficult issues for people with disabilities than for women,\nbecause there is greater uncertainty and potential for disagreement\nabout the extent of the changes that are required to treat people with\ndisabilities as social and political equals. Indeed, the range and\nvariety of physical and mental differences within a society raise\nissues of distributive justice that have no obvious analogue for other\nstigmatized groups. A “gender-neutral” environment can be\nreadily conceived, and achieved at modest cost. In contrast,\ndisability scholars and activists have not specified what it would\nmean to achieve an “ability-neutral” environment—one\nthat was no more advantageous to people with some physical and mental\ncharacteristics than others. And some argued that the ideas of an\n“ability-neutral” environment is either conceptually\nincoherent or prohibitively expensive (Barclay 2011, 2018). Moreover,\nit seems likely that questions about the extent to which justice\nrequires reconstructing or modifying the built environment would arise\nwith respect to people with disabilities even in a society with no\nhistory of invidious attitudes or practices toward such persons. By\ncontrast, it seems less likely that such questions would arise in a\nsociety with no history of sexism, for example. \nJustice for people with disabilities, then, appears to raise questions\nabout the relationship between distributive justice and relational\njustice that justice for other stigmatized groups does not. Yet the\nneed for redistribution hardly reduces the importance of recognition\nin achieving justice. Indeed, the complex, disputed relationship\nbetween the two makes disability a significant challenge for theories\nof justice. \n“Disability” is typically defined in terms of two\nelements: (i) a physical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived\nas an impairment or dysfunction, and (ii) a significant personal or\nsocial limitation associated with that characteristic. The\nrelationship between these two elements—and the role of the\nenvironment in mediating them—is a core issue in the\nconceptualization of, and social response to, disability. The\nmedical model treats disability as an individual physical or\nmental characteristic with significant personal and social\nconsequences. In particular, it sees the limitations faced by people\nwith disabilities as resulting primarily or solely from their\nimpairments. By contrast, the various social models see\ndisability as a relationship between individuals and their social\nenvironments: physical and mental characteristics are limiting only or\nprimarily in virtue of social practices that lead to the exclusion of\npeople with those characteristics. This exclusion is manifested not\nonly in deliberate segregation, but in built environments and social\npractices that restrict the participation of people regarded as having\ndisabilities (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience). \nIn their extreme forms, which treat the impairment or environment\n(respectively) as the sole cause of personal and social limitation,\nthe medical and social models have few, if any, defenders. Rather,\nthey mark the limits of possible relationships between impairment and\nlimitation. Almost all writers on disability acknowledge some role for\nboth the impairment and the environment in causing limitations; the\ndisagreement largely concerns the assessment of their comparative\ncontribution, and their interaction. Most scholars who embrace some\nversion of the social model acknowledge that\nimpairments—generally but not universally understood as\ndeviations from species-relative statistical norms—can be\nsources of discomfort and limitation even in the absence of\ndisadvantaging social practices (e.g., Shakespeare 2006, Thomas 2004).\nThese scholars would argue, however, that such adverse effects are far\nless damaging than social exclusion, are greatly magnified by hostile\nenvironments, and could be significantly reduced by more inclusive\nenvironments. The medical model is less often explicitly defended than\nunreflectively adopted—by health care professionals,\nbioethicists, and philosophers who ignore or underestimate the\ncontribution of social and other environmental factors to the\nlimitations faced by people with disabilities. Even among these\ngroups, however, there is a growing awareness of the environmental\ncontribution to disability and a partial embrace of the social model\n(Cureton and Brownlee 2009). \nTo the extent that it is held by anyone in unalloyed form, the medical\nmodel of disability would not deny that disability raises issues of\njustice. Indeed, that model might give support to the view that the\ndisadvantages perceived as inherent to disability raise some of the\nmost urgent claims of justice (Barclay 2011, 2018). But such a model\ndoes not recognize any principled rationale for preferring\nreconstruction of the social and built environment over compensation\nor correction as a means for correcting disability-related\ndisadvantage, a point made by Wolff (2009a, 2009b), among others. In\ncontrast, the social model strongly supports such a rationale, since\nit construes many aspects of disability-related disadvantage as\nessentially connected to various forms of literal and\nfigurative exclusion. Relatedly, the social model construes\nreconstruction as a public good: more accessible structures and more\ninclusive practices can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people with\nand without disabilities (Scotch and Schriner 1997). But such\nreconstruction also helps to achieve a fairer distribution of tangible\nand intangible goods, particularly social and economic\nopportunities. \nSome critics accuse social model theorists of assuming that any\ndisadvantage caused by the social environment is ipso facto\nunjust (Samaha 2007). This assumption would reflect an oversimplified\nview of the relationship between causing disadvantage and creating\ninjustice. The fact that social structures or practices cause\ndisadvantage does not imply that there is a duty of justice to correct\nor compensate for the disadvantage. That will depend on the costs of\nalleviating it, and—under any plausible theory of\njustice—some comparison with the advantages and disadvantages\nthat would result from alternative social arrangements. Thus, for\nexample, choosing to spend the bulk of a municipal arts budget on a\nconcert hall rather than an art museum may disadvantage those who\ncannot hear. But that disadvantage, although caused by a social\ndecision, is not necessarily unjust. That will depend, inter\nalia, on the availability of non-auditory forms of aesthetic\nexperience and the comparative costs of building the museum instead.\nTo take another example, placing ramps and elevators in new high-rise\nbuildings is relatively inexpensive and beneficial to most users,\nwhereas placing them in nineteenth century walk-ups is difficult and\nexpensive; holding public meetings or events in buildings with ramps\nand elevators has negligible costs, whereas moving an existing\nbusiness from a building that lacks them to one that has them may be\nvery expensive (Samaha 2007; Wasserman 2001). \nThe difficulty of inferring injustice from socially caused\ndisadvantage is clear in contexts where greater social provision\nsecures incremental advantage. In such contexts, the question of how\nmuch is just will not always have an obvious answer. For example, it\nwould at least marginally benefit wheelchair-users to have additional\nrestricted parking spaces, but we could hardly infer an injustice from\nthe fact that an institution provided N rather than N +\n1 such spaces. Intuitively, the allotment should be proportionate to\nthe number of wheelchair users in the community or at the facility,\nbut that number may be uncertain, and a range of spaces would likely\nsatisfy any proportionality\n requirement.[1]\n In deciding how many spaces are enough, we would receive no guidance\nfrom the indisputable fact that any disadvantage or advantage in this\ncontext would have social causes. \nConversely, the fact that social arrangements do not cause or\ncontribute to a disadvantage does not insulate it from claims of\njustice; the failure to alleviate that disadvantage may be unjust on\nplausible accounts of justice. Thus, although many\n“natural” disasters like Hurricanes Katrina owe much\nof their destructive impact to social arrangements, it is plausible\nthat the state’s duty to support the victims of hurricanes and\ntsunamis is not contingent on its responsibility for causing or\nexacerbating them (Wasserman\n 2001).[2]\n Indeed, as we discuss below, various forms of luck egalitarianism do\nnot distinguish between disadvantages caused versus merely not\ncorrected by society’s institutions, provided that the relevant\ndisadvantages are equally severe and equally unchosen by those\ndisadvantaged. \nNevertheless, the causal claims made by social-model theorists are\nrelevant to justice in several ways. First, as suggested above, for\nmost theories of justice, the mere fact that the social environment\ncan be modified in ways that alleviate the disadvantages associated\nwith impairment places demands for their alleviation within the scope\nof justice—as claims that a theory of justice must consider and\nweigh. Second, the fact that those disadvantages are caused by social\narrangements is relevant for those theories that regard society as\nhaving a stronger duty not to create or aggravate disadvantages than\nit has to prevent or correct them (Wasserman 2001, Schemmel 2012).\nFinally, alleviating the disadvantages attributable to prejudice or\nstigma will enjoy priority on any theory of justice that treats\ndisadvantage resulting from prejudice or stigma as a greater injustice\nthan innocently-created\n disadvantage.[3] \nBeyond a shared concern with the social causation of disability,\ndifferent versions of the social model emphasize different features of\nthe exclusionary structures and practices (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n The minority group model regards people with impairments as\na stigmatized minority group. It holds that the main reason people\nwith disabilities encounter special hardships is that they face\ndiscrimination akin to that faced by racial or ethnic minorities (Hahn\n1987, Oliver 1990). The human variation model holds that many\nof the challenges faced by disabled people do not result from\ndeliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch between their\ncharacteristics and the physical and social environment (Scotch and\nSchriner 1997). These two versions of the social model differ mainly\nin emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group model\ngenerally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with stigmatized differences. Yet the failure to\nfully accommodate people with various differences, from extreme height\nto intellectual impairment, does not necessarily arise from stigma.\nBut often, disparities in access that were initially caused by\nresource or technological limits are maintained by stigma. For\nexample, an employer’s initial purchase of communications\ntechnology inaccessible to blind or deaf employees may be explained by\nthe fact that accessible technology had not been developed at the time\nof purchase. But those historic facts would not justify the\nemployer’s refusal to include modestly priced accessibility\nfeatures when purchasing upgrades a decade later, for example. \nBoth versions of the social model require the removal of barriers and\npractices serving to exclude people with disabilities, and the\nreconstruction of the environment to more fully include them. Under a\nminority-group model, these measures are dictated primarily by a\ndemand for recognition and respect, and for the correction of past\nexpressions of disrespect found in the knowing exclusion of people\nwith disabilities from many aspects of social, political, and economic\nlife. The human variation model puts less weight on the expressive or\nsymbolic significance of past exclusion. Rather than construing people\nwith disabilities as a “discrete and insular minority”\ncreated by practices of more or less deliberate exclusion, the human\nvariation model construes people with disabilities as simply people\nwho differ in degree from the majority of statistically normal\npopulation with respect to one or more physical or mental\ncharacteristics. The purpose of reconstruction is not so much to end\nspecific exclusionary practices as to create a more inclusive physical\nand social environment. Given this difference in emphasis, it is\nnatural to understand the human variation model as appealing\nprincipally to norms of distributive fairness, ensuring equal or\nadequate access to the physical and social environment, in contrast to\nthe minority group model, which appeals more explicitly to norms of\nrespect and recognition.  \nThe demand for greater inclusiveness is less categorical than the\ndemand to eliminate discrimination. Although any environment can be\nmade more inclusive, none can be fully inclusive for everyone (Barclay\n2010, 2018). This is not necessarily because, as Barclay, following\nShakespeare (2006), claims, the inclusionary features required for one\nimpairment often conflict with those required by another. Such\nconflicts may be minor, temporary, and remediable. The problem is more\ngeneral: 1) for many characteristics, from height to mathematical\naptitude, one “size” does not fit all; 2) providing\ndifferent sizes increases fit for a wider range of variation, but at\nincreasing cost (albeit less than often assumed); and 3) it is\nfrequently impractical, and may arguably be unjust, to ensure that\neveryone is equally well-or ill-fitted; it may, for example, be too\nexpensive to ensure that left-handed or extremely tall individuals\nsuffer no inconvenience in being statistical minorities. Full\ninclusion, like universal design, is an ideal—one that cannot be\nfully achieved, and that must be compromised in the partial\nsatisfaction of other legitimate claims. \nEven if it would be impossible or unreasonable to achieve full\ninclusion through wholesale changes in the physical or social\nenvironment, modest changes could significantly increase inclusion at\nlittle cost. Some examples come from a study of environment\nmodification for autistic individuals (Owren 2013). Some people with\nautism face significant barriers to taking part in routine social\nactivities: they find such familiar stimuli as applause, light\ntouching, and deodorant as highly aversive; they must be explicitly\ninstructed about social expectations because they cannot\n“read” most facial expressions or social clues. The\nstudy’s author recognizes that the “neurotypical\nmajority” cannot be expected to give up applause, light\ntouching, or even deodorant, let alone nuance in communication: \nWhat would be lost? Large parts of what may be some of the most\ntreasured areas of communication: the art of innuendo, the double\nmeaning at the heart of much comedy, irony, the implied meaning at the\nheart of so much poetry,… flirtation and “feeling each\nother out” before committing to something that cannot be\nretracted. (2013: 23-24) \nAt the same time, the author points out that the majority could often\ngain from more modest accommodations.  \nMany neurotypicals might profit from being more explicit and from\nothers being more explicit, as can be illustrated by the extensive\nfocus in couples therapy on getting partners to state their needs and\nexpectations more explicitly, not relying on other to pick up on\n“vaguely described, implied, or unspoken behavioral\nexpectations”. (2013: 92)  \nThe author suggests (2013: 111) that it may be feasible to develop\n“best practices”: “strategies for enhancing\naccessibility and reducing sensory issues in a larger scale”\nwithout unduly burdening the majority: \nOne strategy might be to incorporate into Universal design the\npractice of providing access to low stimulation areas in mainstream\nsettings. Another might be to create more public acceptance of\nautistic behaviors like\n stimming,[4]\n which seem to help many autistic people reduce the impact of aversive\nsensory stimuli.… (2013: 111) \nSuch strategies clearly involve tradeoffs, but those tradeoffs would\ninvolve small economic and social costs for a majority to achieve\nlarge gains in inclusion for a minority. The claim that it is\nimpossible to achieve, or even understand, full inclusion for people\nwith autism does not deny that there is significant injustice in their\ncurrent state of social isolation. \nThe challenges for social models of disability for justice may seem\ngreatest for intellectual and psychiatric impairments, as well as for\ncomplex physical impairments such as fibromyalgia, multiple chemical\nsensitivity, and other conditions that radically and unpredictably\naffect energy, stamina, and functioning (Wendell 1989, 1996; Davis\n2005). First, these conditions strikingly display both aspects of\nimpairment, as markers for stigma and as sources of functional\nlimitation (see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Cognitive and psychiatric impairments evoke some of the strongest\nprejudice and all present some of the most difficult functional\nlimitations, e.g., on the capacities to engage in practical reasoning,\nto recognize the intentions and attitudes of other people, or to\nparticipate in shared activities.Second, some theorists contend that\nthese conditions pose more of a practical challenge for the social\nmodel than even the most severe physical disabilities, in part because\nthe measures required for greater inclusion are not as concrete or\ntangible, and may demand greater imagination to envision and\n implement.[5] \nAlthough significant practical work has been done in educational and\nworkplace inclusion, philosophers have been daunted by the challenge\nof social reconstruction for cognitive disabilities. Thus Jonathan\nWolff, who generally favors such reconstruction—which he calls\n“status enhancement”—as the most respectful\nintervention, asks  \nWhat would it mean to change the world so that people with cognitive\ndisabilities and other people were equally able to find a worthwhile\nplace in the world? Can we even imagine what this would be? (2009a:\n407)  \nMany rights and privileges are thought to require a certain level of\ncognitive capacity, e.g., the right to vote or contract (Wikler 1979).\nSimilarly, most jobs are structured to require regular hours,\nuninterrupted activity, undivided attention, and general\nsociability. \nHow much should a society modify these requirements or restructure\nthese activities to include people with various intellectual,\npsychiatric, and complex physical disabilities? A total relaxation of\nsuch requirements would impose large, even “unduly\nburdensome” costs. However, many modifications to promote the\ninclusion of people with significant cognitive impairments would also\nbenefit people with typical cognitive function: simplified task\nexplanations, warning labels, news copy, and jury instructions. Many\naccommodations employers are already making to increase flexibility\nand reduce stress, from individually-tailored schedules to\ntelecommuting, would ease the entry of people with these disabilities\ninto the workplace. There is a growing body of practical and policy\nwork that applies social models of disability to people with\nintellectual, psychiatric, and complex physical impairments (e.g.,\nBiklen 1992; Block 2006; Connor et al. 2008; Hehir 2002). \nAs discussed later in this Entry, there is sharp disagreement about\nwhether individuals with the most severe intellectual impairments\nqualify as subjects of justice. But even if individuals with the most\nsubstantial intellectual impairments are regarded as subjects of\njustice, what justice demands for them, and of them, may be uncertain\nor disputed. Nussbaum (2009) contends that the equal citizenship of\nthose individuals requires that they be enabled to exercise such\npolitical rights as voting and jury service through appropriate\nsurrogates. Wasserman and McMahan (2012) question whether those rights\ncould be meaningfully exercised by surrogates for individuals with the\nmost severe intellectual disabilities. \nSome philosophical intimation of a social model approach to cognitive\ndisability can be found in Dan Wikler’s 1979 essay,\n“Paternalism and the Mildly Retarded”. Wikler held that\nthe category of cognitive disability was socially constructed by the\ncompetence thresholds set for important social activities, such as\nsigning a contract or voting in an election. But although society\nchooses, in this sense, who will be cognitively impaired, it does not\nhave unlimited flexibility, since there can be significant social\ncosts in altering those thresholds. The issue, Wikler concluded, was\nultimately one of justice; of fairly distributing the burdens of\nsetting thresholds that will be too high for some or too low for\nothers. Yet Wikler questioned whether justice would require, or even\npermit, the kind of modifications necessary for significantly greater\nparticipation. Writing two decades later, Wolff cited Wikler in\nstating,  \nthe fact is that what makes much of modern life possible now relies on\nbinding and enforceable contracts that in turn assume a certain level\nof intellectual competence. To change the world so that such a bar is\nlowered would have tremendous costs. (2009a: 407) \nThis pessimism has prevailed in the years since Wikler wrote, and\nthere has been little philosophical attention to practical\npossibilities for the inclusion of people with cognitive impairments.\nAlthough there have been interesting discussions of this issue in the\ncontext of education (e.g., Howe 1996; Ladenson 2005; Veatch 1986),\nthe general issue has tended to be dealt with in summary fashion.\n(Exceptions include Kittay and Carlson 2010; Hartley 2009a; Silvers\nand Francis 2009; Wong 2007, 2009.) Thus, for cognitive disabilities,\nWolff emphasizes “targeted resource enhancement” rather\nthan status enhancement, arguing for an entitlement scheme that gives\npeople with cognitive disabilities maximum possible control over an\nindividual budget for personal assistance and social support (2009a:\n407–413). He does regard some forms of status enhancement,\nnotably antidiscrimination measures, “as essential”, but\nhe accepts Wikler’s conclusion that broader changes in social\npractice carry “intolerable costs” (2009a: 413). \nIn their influential book From Chance to Choice, Buchanan et\nal. (2000) repeat the assertion that there would be excessive social\ncosts in reconstructing society to permit the full participation of\npeople with significant cognitive impairments. They compare the\nreconstruction of society for greater inclusion with a family decision\nto play only the card games that a young child can understand. They\ncontend that just as adults will tire of a constant game of Go Fish,\nthe society will be “dumbed down” if it refashions itself\nto fully include people with cognitive impairments. \nAlthough the meaning of inclusion is debatable, and different forms of\ninclusion will have differing value for different people, the\ncard-game analogy oversimplifies the challenge. To present inclusion\nas a zero-sum allocation is to dumb down the incredibly complex task\nof rearranging society to respect and nurture all its members. The\nanalogy assumes that every activity must be done by everyone, which is\nfalse. \nA more apt analogy to organized social activity might be an assortment\nof games that can be played by different combinations of people in\ndifferent ways. Some games could be played by everyone; others could\nbe modified to include cognitively impaired people in a way that\npreserved the interest of non-disabled players; some would be beyond\nthe reach of people with certain cognitive impairments. But even the\nmost cognitively gifted individuals could not participate in all\ngames—the sheer amount of training and practice required to\nmaster some of them, and the considerable time and energy many of them\nrequire, would preclude participation in many or most. Indeed, society\nmay function better if people have varying aptitudes for, and\ninterests in, different activities. (A similar criticism of the\ncard-game analogy is offered by Wong (2007), who recounts how her\nbrother with Down enriched rather than impoverished family life.) The\nfact that a smaller set of activities may be available to people with\ncognitive impairments need not present a problem, if it does not\nresult in their social isolation or deny them intellectual challenges\n(Parens & Asch 2000: 25–26 [quoting Philip Ferguson,\npersonal correspondence]). But ensuring their participation may\nrequire society to refashion itself in significant ways. \nIt is not clear that such refashioning would impose the\n“intolerable costs” feared by Wolff. Social inclusion does\nnot require, for example, that individuals with significant cognitive\nimpairments be able to make binding contracts in every domain of law\nand business; it requires that competence standards be graduated to\nreflect the complexity of specific tasks so that those individuals are\nnot categorically excluded –a suggestion made more than two\ndecades ago by the authors of the card-game metaphor (Buchanan and\nBrock 1990). Social model theorists know full well that\nimpairments—physical as well as cognitive—differ from skin\ncolor in that they are sometimes relevant to what people can do, as\nare such other attributes as education and income. But that feature of\nimpairment hardly precludes social reconstruction. Indeed, the most\neffective rebuttal to the card-game metaphor may be found in the\npractical work that already has been done in educational and workplace\ninclusion (e.g., Biklen 1992; Block 2006; Hehir 2002; McGuire et al.\n2006). At the same time, it bears emphasis that the social model of\ndisability was originally conceptualized in terms of physical\ndisabilities. And there may be significant limitations on the extent\nto which it applies to cognitive disabilities. More generally,\nalthough it may be useful to speak of “the” social model\nof “disability”, the diversity of impairments that fall\nunder the extension of “disability” suggests that the\naptness of the social model in any given context will vary depending\non the nature of the impairments at issue. \nAs suggested in\n §1,\n the disabling impact of social arrangements may be relevant to the\ntype and scope of interventions that justice requires. In stressing\nthe impact and the malleability of the environment, social-model\ntheorists have shifted the focus from claims for correction and\ncompensation to claims for reconstruction. \nConsider a society with much greater height variation than our own.\nEven if very tall or short stature was neither stigmatized nor\nfunctionally limiting, that society would, on any plausible theory of\njustice, be obliged to construct its public spaces, buildings, and\nvehicles to accommodate them. They would be treated unjustly if the\nconstruction of the physical environment took no account of them,\nespecially if the failure to do so caused them significant\ndisadvantage. Of course, the extent to which their height differences\nneeded to be taken into account would depend on the distribution of\nheight in the society, as well as on its level of resources and\ncompeting needs. No plausible theory of justice would require that the\nbuilt environment be equally accommodating to all heights, if such a\nthing were possible, but all would condemn some environments as\nunjustly restrictive. What even this simple case suggests is that the\ndemand for a more inclusive environment need not be seen in terms of\ncompensating individuals, tall or impaired, for their internal\ndeficits, but of accommodating as wide as possible a range of human\nvariation. \nEven if environmental reconstruction should not be seen as\ncompensating for deficits, a question remains about the extent to\nwhich it should be seen as a matter of redistribution or recognition.\nThis question is raised by the legal requirement of “reasonable\naccommodation”. Under the ADA and ADAAA,\n“accommodations” include ramps, elevators, texts in\nmultiple formats, sign-language interpreters, flexible work schedules,\nand job coaches or assistance. The failure to make reasonable\naccommodation for disabled employees or users of public facilities\nconstitutes, with some notable exceptions, discrimination (ADA 1990).\nThere is no reference to that concept in the laws banning\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or age; the term was\nintroduced in cases addressing claims of religious discrimination\n(see, e.g., Karlan and Rutherglen 1996). Like practitioners of\nminority religions, but unlike women, people of color, or older\npeople, people with disabilities must be “reasonably\naccommodated”. \nFor the human variation model, reasonable accommodation requires\nchanges in the physical and social environment, from installing ramps\nto modifying work schedules and altering the location of meetings and\nclasses. Often, such changes require little more than flexibility and\nimagination. But some of these changes can be expensive; at some\npoint, the cost may make further change unreasonable. On this\napproach, the legislative understanding of such accommodation as a\nmatter of distributive justice is reflected in the qualifying use of\n“reasonable” and the exemption of accommodations that\nwould impose an “undue” burden or hardship on the entity\nrequired to make accommodations (Wasserman 1998).  But it is also possible to see reasonable accommodation as a\nrequirement of equality for people with disabilities without recourse\nto a theory of distributive justice (e.g., Crossley 2004; Karlan and\nRutherglen 1996). Accommodating religious practices may be expensive\nin various ways, but no one regards doing so either as compensating\nreligions for their deficits. Indeed, such a rationale would appear to\nviolate the state’s constitutionally-mandated neutrality among\nreligions. Rather, because the state is required to treat religions\nand their adherents with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2003), it\ndisfavors rules and practices that interfere with religious\nobservance. Somewhat similarly, a state that regards people with\ndisabilities with equal respect and concern will disfavor arrangements\nthat interfere with their participation.  With respect to both groups,\nsubstantive equality may require unequal provisions. In the case of\ndisability as well as religion, how much additional provision is\nrequired is indeterminate, not for lack of a complete theory of\njustice to specify the amount or proportion, but because the demands\nof equal respect are indeterminate. \nConsider, for example, the question of how much it is reasonable for a\nsmall business to spend on an elevator or ground-floor space to be\nable to employ a talented IT technician with emphysema. To answer that\nquestion, we might do better to decide what respect for that person\ndemands, based in part on current social practice and convention,\nrather than to consult a comprehensive but abstract theory of\ndistributive justice. In any case, it may be unreasonable to expect a\ndeterminate answer; it may be appropriate to rely on a fair procedure\nto select among a range of plausible outcomes. But by the same token,\nthe utter lack of accommodation in many workplaces and public\nfacilities is clearly unjust on any plausible theory of justice. \nThe debate over the accommodations available for a minority group may\noften reflect a complex mix of claims concerning redistribution and\nrecognition. For example, people in wheelchairs are sometimes provided\nrestaurant access only through the service entrance. The restaurant\nowners often claim that such access is quite reasonable, since the\nservice entrances already have ramps—a distributive\nconsideration. Disability advocates claim that however convenient it\nmay be for the owners, such access treats wheelchair users as\nsecond-class customers—a claim of misrecognition. In this case,\nit may seem that the recognition claims clearly trump the conflicting\ndistributional claims. But this will not always be the case. \nAgain, resolving such conflicts may involve the same kind of judgment\nemployed in debates over accommodating minority religious practices.\nIt may be that some jobs cannot be made available to people whose\nSabbath falls on Friday or Saturday, because (in light of demographic\nconsiderations) the essential functions of those jobs require working\non those days. But although the “essential function”\nstandard appears objective and determinate, it is often subject to\ndistributive considerations, e.g., about staffing requirements and\nbusiness volume. A refusal to sustain the slightest loss of revenue to\naccommodate any minority religion might be a distributive injustice; a\nwillingness to sustain greater losses to accommodate Jewish and\nAdventist employees than Muslim ones might involve misrecognition as\nwell—the failure to treat Islamic practice as having the same\nvalue as other religious practices. Similarly, the violation of the\nADA involved in refusing to display the same flexibility for disabled\nas for pregnant employees arguably constitutes both distributive\ninjustice and misrecognition. \nThe uncertainty about the distributive character of reasonable\naccommodation suggests that in the case of disability, it may often be\ndifficult to sharply distinguish claims for redistribution and\n recognition.[6]\n Recognition may require redistribution, and redistribution should aim\nat securing recognition. Asch (1989) has gone even further, arguing\nthat recognition must precede redistribution; that if people with\ndisabilities were recognized as equals, capable of significant\ncontributions to others, society would be more willing to adopt\nappropriate measures for redistribution and reconstruction. \nThe resurgence of philosophical interest in justice is often dated to\nthe publication of John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice in\n1971. Although that was only two years before the passage of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, embodying a social model of disability\n(see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience),\n it was well before the academic reconceptualization of disability as\na social phenomenon. For the 25 years after A Theory of\nJustice, many justice theorists tacitly accepted the medical\nmodel (e.g., Dworkin 1981a,b; Daniels 1985). They treated disability\nas a physical or mental limitation of the individual, the principal\ncause of disability-related disadvantage. Disability thus posed a\nproblem for justice theories based on mutual advantage, hypothetical\nagreement, or material or social equality. People with disabilities\ndid not appear to offer reciprocal advantages; they complicated the\ntask of reaching a hypothetical agreement on the basic structure of\nsociety; and they made the goal of equality seem impossibly\ndemanding. \nBy the late 1990s, some mainstream political philosophers were\nbecoming acquainted with social models of disability, and some\ndisability theorists were gaining a hearing among political\nphilosophers. Some philosophers sought to modify distributive theories\nof justice to take account of the social and environmental character\nof disability; others cited the failure of those theories to take\nappropriate account of disability as one reason to reject exclusively\ndistributive approaches. \nBefore describing these developments, it is useful to distinguish two\ntypes of distributive theories. Modern social contract theories,\nnotably Rawls’ (1971), seek to determine the fair terms of\nsocial cooperation to which individuals (generally with limited\nknowledge of their own situations) would agree; they argue that\ncertain distributive principles would be among those terms\n(Rawls’ “difference principle” may be the most\nfamiliar). Rawlsian theories are procedural in one sense: they regard\nany distribution as just if and only if it is consistent with the\ndistributive principles that would be chosen by those individuals.\nDisability-oriented criticism of these theories has focused on their\nassumptions about the individuals who are eligible to make a\nhypothetical contract or participate in the cooperative scheme it\nestablishes. Critics have argued for the eligibility of people with\ndisabilities or their representatives to participate in the\ncontract-making processes and resulting cooperative scheme more than\nabout the validity of the principles or rules yielded by that process\n(Richardson 2006; Silvers and Francis 2005; Stark 2007). The second\ntype of theory is primarily interested in outcomes; in the kind of end\nstate a just society should strive for: either equality on some\noutcome metric or the reduction of certain kinds of inequality. Here,\ndisability-informed criticism has favored outcome metrics that take\naccount of the social contribution to disability-related disadvantage,\nand standards for just distributions that are oriented toward\ndisrespectful inequalities (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006a; Wolff\n2009b). \nWithin social contract theories, a distinction is often drawn between\ncontractarian/Hobbesian and contractualist/Lockean accounts (see SEP\nentry on\n contractarianism).\n One way to characterize this distinction is in terms of the\nparties’ motivation and interaction. In the former, they are\nnarrowly self-interested and hard-bargaining; in the latter, their\nself-interest is tempered or balanced by their commitment to\njustifying themselves to others, and they proceed by deliberating\nrather than by bargaining. This distinction is often formulated in\nterms of a distinction between (merely) rational agents, and\n“reasonable” agents. \nA Rawlsian approach might seem more congenial than a Hobbesian\napproach to people with disabilities. It derives the basic structure\nof society from a hypothetical choice situation, the Original\nPosition, in which a veil of ignorance precludes reliance on the\ncontractors’ actual limitations—limitations that a\nHobbesian contractor might ruthlessly (albeit rationally, if not\nreasonably) exploit (cf.\n note 10).\n Although the parties themselves are motivated exclusively by\nconsiderations of self-interest, which Rawls understands in terms of\nthe fulfillment of two higher-order interests (see SEP Entry on\n the original position),\n the informational constraints of the Original Position compel the\nparties to motivate as if they are reasonable, at least in\nthe sense that it compels them to be impartial between the claims of\nall who will be subject to the principles they choose. \nBut even if Rawlsian contractors do not know their specific\nlimitations, they do know that they, or the individuals they\nrepresent, are not permanently disabled. Rawls stipulated that the\nidealized society whose “basic structure” was the subject\nof hypothetical agreement was restricted to members who would be\n“fully-cooperating” over the course of their adult lives.\nRawls assumed that this restriction would exclude people with severe\nand permanent physical and mental disabilities (Rawls 1993:\n18–20). He did not defend that assumption, nor provide for the\nrepresentation of those people in the process by which the basic\nstructure of society is to be determined. Instead, he consigned their\nfate to the later, legislative phase. Rawls also restricted\nparticipation in the Original Position to those with two “moral\npowers”: the capacity to form and revise one’s own\nconception of the good; and the capacity for a sense of justice, the\ncapacity to act on and apply fair terms of cooperation\n(ibid.). It is doubtful that these powers can be attributed\nto people with the most severe intellectual and psychiatric\nimpairments, although some philosophers and disability scholars have\nargued that a just society should treat all human beings as having the\npotential to develop such functioning (Wong 2007, 2009). \nDisability scholars have been particularly critical of these\neligibility conditions for the Original Position. If the deliberators\nin the Original Position do not believe that they could be\nrepresenting, or could turn out to actually be, people with\n“severe and permanent” disabilities when the veil is\nlifted, they will have no prudential reason to choose a basic\nstructure for their society that will provide for the inclusion of\nthose people. Indeed, insofar as such measures would impose costs on\npeople with non-disabilities, the parties will have prudential reasons\nnot to support such measures, since doing so would undermine\nthe interests of people whom they know they could represent (the\nable-bodied on whom the costs are imposed) for the sake of those whom\nthey explicitly know they don’t represent (the disabled for whom\nthe costs are imposed). \nSeveral philosophers sympathetic to the Rawlsian framework have\nsuggested modifications that would give people with disabilities a\ngreater and more direct role in the social contracting process. Some\nhave argued that the “full cooperation” requirement, and\nthe kind of reciprocity it involves, can be liberally interpreted so\nas not to exclude most people with significant physical disabilities\n(Hartley 2009b; Stark 2009). Henry Richardson has gone even further,\nmaintaining that “Rawls’ arguments making use of the\ndevice of the [Original Position] do not essentially depend on any\nreciprocity premise” (2006: 427). He examines modified versions\nof the Original Position that drop the assumption that no one has\nsevere and permanent disabilities. He contends that with such\nmodifications, the Original Position can yield principles more\nsensitive to disability concerns about the continuous nature of\nabilities, the stigmatization resulting from false dichotomization,\nand the exclusion of severely disabled human beings. \nIn response, Martha Nussbaum (2006b: 490–498) concedes that\nRichardson’s proposed reconstruction of Rawls would largely\navoid the exclusionary features of the OP to which disability scholars\nhave objected. But she argues that this reconstruction is a more\nradical departure from Rawls than Richardson acknowledges. She\nsuggests that the theory loses its contractual character if it\ndispenses, per Richardson, with the reciprocity requirement and the\nassumption that the contractors have roughly equal physical and mental\npowers. \nRawls’ “moral powers” condition has posed further\nproblems. Harry Brighouse (2001) observes that modifying the\ncooperation requirement still excludes those whose cognitive\nimpairments preclude their possession of the two moral powers. Sophia\nWong (2009, 2007) argues that those powers can be acquired by people\nwith severe intellectual impairments, with adequate social support.\nLeslie Francis (2009) and Anita Silvers (Silvers and Francis 2009)\ncontend that many individuals with severe cognitive impairments can\ncollaborate with others to construct individualized, authentic\nconceptions of the good. Silvers and Francis (2005) and Christie\nHartley (2009a) also maintain that people with severe intellectual\nimpairments can be represented adequately in a contracting process\nthat consists in trust-building more than hard bargaining, even if\nthey cannot participate in it personally. \nOthers have argued that exclusion from the Original Position need not\nadversely affect people with disabilities or treat them with\ndisrespect. Adam Cureton (2008) argues that the exclusion of people\nwith severe disabilities from the Original Position is just part of\nits idealization, and does not diminish the urgency or priority of\ntheir claims. Cynthia Stark (2007) proposes lifting the\nfull-cooperation requirement to include people with disabilities at\nthe second stage of Rawlsian deliberation, where the society’s\nconstitution is established and where the hypothetical decision makers\nacquire some knowledge about the resources, development level, and\nother characteristics of their society. \nThe plausibility of these responses to Rawls depends to some extent on\nwhich version of the Original Position we consider. Rawls made a\nchange in his presentation of the Original Position in his\nRestatement (2001) that is especially pertinent to people\nwith cognitive disabilities. He emphasized that the participants in\nthe Original Position are representatives of people in the future\nsociety, not people living in the future society denied knowledge of\ntheir social position. If representatives were made to take into\naccount the possibility that those they represent might be disabled,\nthis might help to ensure that the interests of the disabled were\nrepresented. It would only do so, however, if the contractors have the\nability to imagine the very different embodiments of people with a\nvariety of disabilities, an ability feminist critics of Rawls have\nquestioned with respect to men representing women (Young 1990;\nBenhabib 1992; Okin 1994). The strictly representational role of\nparticipants in the Original Position would also avoid the conflict of\ninterest faced by cognitively unimpaired individuals representing\nthemselves and cognitively impaired individuals. \nMore broadly, philosophers have varied widely in their optimism about\nthe prospects for including people with disabilities in contractarian\nor contractualist deliberations. On the one hand, Lawrence Becker\n(2005) suggests that even selfish, hard-bargaining contractarians (his\n“tough crowd”) would accept an expansive notion of\n“reciprocity”, one that would ensure adequate provision\nfor people with disabilities in the scheme of social cooperation they\nadopt. Their acceptance of reciprocity would arise from recognition of\nthe needs and vulnerabilities they and their loved ones have or will\nlikely acquire. That recognition places a premium on social provisions\nfor health.  \nEven for the tough crowd, health is now ripe for inclusion in the list\nof basic goods. And it may be that a robust social commitment to\nhealth will address questions of justice for the disabled—as\nlong as we are careful to include fundamental aspects of psychological\nhealth (i.e., those associated with active rational agency….\n(2005: 35)  \nMembers of the tough crowd may not be so careful, however. Indeed,\nsome may not even regard “active rational agency” as a\nmatter of health as they more narrowly construe it, with an emphasis\non physical survival and comfort. In contrast to Becker, Eva Kittay\n(1999) holds that even the most liberal interpretation of Rawls’\nscheme will not be sufficiently responsive to the egalitarian concerns\nthat motivate his theory. Rawls’ assumption that the\nparticipants in the original position are or represent fully\nproductive members of society neglects the fact of pervasive,\ninevitable human dependency. “[T]hose within relationships of\ndependency fall outside the conceptual perimeters of Rawls’\negalitarianism” (1999: 79). \nAnother debate within contractarian theories that has particular\nrelevance to disability concerns the scope of justice itself: Is\njustice concerned only with the distribution of social goods, or also\nwith the rectification of “natural inequalities” (Pogge\n1989: 44–47). Pogge (1995) argues that in the Original Position,\nit would be irrational for parties to ignore the contribution of\nnatural advantages to the well-being (understood in terms of the\nfulfillment of the two “higher-order interests”) of\nprospective citizens, since from that standpoint, it is just as bad to\nbe disadvantaged by uncompensated disabilities as it is to be\ndisadvantaged (to the same degree) by a small share of social primary\ngoods. But Pogge claims that attempting to eliminate those\ninequalities would go beyond the scope of justice. Some philosophers\nargue, however, that many natural inequalities are within the scope of\njustice, and that health care to mitigate them is a requirement of\njustice (Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000). \nOther philosophers and disability scholars would deny that the\ninequalities associated with impairments can be regarded as\n“natural” (Amundson 1992; Wasserman 2001). In questioning\nthe very notion of “natural inequalities”, they join a\nbroader philosophical debate about whether it is possible to draw a\ncoherent distinction between natural and artificial or social\ninequalities (see Lippert-Rasmussen 2004; Nagel 1997; Pogge 2004a,b;\nAas and Wasserman,\n 2016).[7]\n Even if such a distinction can be plausibly drawn, it may turn out\nthat many or most inequalities in abilities are artificial: as with of\nobsolete skills, those inequalities may be largely attributable to the\nphysical and social environment (Bickenbach 1993). \nOther distributive theories of justice take a less procedural approach\nthan Rawls. They are directly concerned with the kinds of outcomes a\njust society should pursue. These theories differ in the outcome\nmetrics they adopt—the “currency” of distributive\njustice (Cohen 1989). Some adopt a resource metric (Dworkin 1981b);\nstill others, a metric based on opportunities for welfare (Arneson\n1989) or access to advantage (Cohen 1989). Finally, capability\ntheories assess outcomes not only by the goods or resources that\npeople have, but also by what people are able to do with what they\nhave (Nussbaum 1990; Sen 1980). Such outcome-oriented theories may be\nmore or less demanding, depending on whether they require equality or\nmerely priority for the worst-off, and on whether they support\nequality of a sort that may not require the significant redistribution\nof goods or resources. \nThe most prominent family of outcome-oriented approaches has been\ncalled “luck egalitarianism” (see, for example, Arneson\n2000; Dworkin 2003; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015). According to the dominant\ncharacterization of that position, its central claim is that it is\nunjust when there are unfair inequalities in the distribution of\n“brute luck”—an advantage or disadvantage with\nrespect to the relevant metric that is not attributable to an\nindividual’s fault, choice, or assumption of risk. “Option\nluck”, in contrast, refers to an advantage or disadvantage an\nindividual acquires through the foreseeable consequences of his or her\nactions. The stronger versions of luck egalitarianism (e.g., Dworkin\n81b) deny that any inequality resulting from option luck generates\nclaims of justice. On those versions, only some disabilities generate\njustice claims—those that resulted from brute bad luck (e.g.,\ncongenital impairments)—whereas others, which may involve the\nsame or greater disadvantage, do not, simply because they resulted\nfrom a free choice (e.g., reckless pastimes or an unhealthy\nlifestyle). \nSome philosophers have taken these implications as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of luck egalitarianism (Anderson 1999), and they would\nno doubt be rejected by many writers on health care, who have\nquestioned the moral and policy relevance of individual responsibility\n(Cavallero 2011; Feiring 2008; Galvin 2002; Wikler 1987). The greater\nconcern for disability scholars may be with the conflation of\ndisadvantages resulting from unchosen impairments with disadvantages\nresulting from unchosen social conditions under the one heading of\n“bad brute luck”. Luck egalitarianism does not, as\nsuch, provide any principled rationale for distinguishing between\nequally severe setbacks to the well-being of people with disabilities\nthat result from the “bad luck” of being born in a society\nwith disability discrimination and the “bad luck” of being\nborn with an intrinsically disadvantageous set of physical\nabilities. Both are equally unchosen from the individual’s\nstandpoint, and it is individual responsibility, rather than some\ncombination of individual and collective responsibility, that\ndetermines whether a given disadvantage generates a valid justice\ncomplaint. This is not to deny that luck egalitarianism can be\nsupplemented to account for the intuition that the “bad\nluck” of being born in a disabling environment (Fine and Asch\n1988) differs morally from less socially mediated forms of bad luck,\nas we will see in our discussion of the capabilities approach. \nThe implications of outcome-oriented theories for disability depend on\ntwo features of those theories. The first is the metric, or\n“currency” of justice they adopt—welfare, resources,\nprimary goods, or capabilities. The second is the distributive\nstandard they impose—strict equality, priority for the worse\noff, or merely some minimum for everyone (sufficientarianism). We will\nconsider these two features in order, although they are sometimes\nintertwined. \nRawls and other social contract theorists adopted a broad outcome\nmetric for assessing the comparative advantage of the individual in a\nsociety: “social primary goods”, which include\nopportunities, basic liberties, income, and the social bases of\nself-respect. This breadth is intended to achieve neutrality between\ncompeting substantive conceptions of the good, since the social\nprimary goods are construed as “all-purpose means” that\nare valuable to have irrespective of the content of one’s\nparticular conception of the good. For many disability scholars, the\ndifficulty in this approach does not concern its neutrality, but its\nfailure to take account of the environment in which those goods must\nbe utilized, which may profoundly affect their value to those\nreceiving them. Two persons might be alike in their share of social\nprimary goods, and have similar projects, aims, commitments, and\nvalues, but nonetheless differ in the value they can derive from those\ngoods, if one person is disabled and the other is not. As we shall see\nbelow, the capabilities approach takes into account this objection,\nwhen the difference between the uses to which each person can put her\nprimary goods is construed as the result of differences in\n“internal resources”, or the rate at which the individual\ncan convert resources to “functionings”. \nA failure to take adequate account of the environment may also be\nfound in directly-egalitarian resource-based approaches. Dworkin\n(1981a,b), for example, appears to take the social environment for\ngranted in proposing a hypothetical division of resources into\nindividual bundles. Giving people with impairments equal material\nshares in a society like our own would hardly satisfy the demands of\nequality in a physical and social environment designed exclusively for\npeople with standard endowments. Dworkin is aware of the problem, but\nhis solution is to adjust individual shares to include insurance\npayouts against poor environmental fit, rather than to redesign the\nenvironment to reduce inequalities in fit. To that degree, Dworkin\nappears to tacitly assume a medical model of disability, according to\nwhich limitations resulting from impairments are solely attributable\nto the impairment itself, and, if not correctable, compensable only by\nthe redistribution of resources to people with such impairments. Such\ncompensation may ensure survival, but it does little to enhance or\nequalize participation, and may in fact hinder participation if\nAnderson (1999) is right that compensating for disabilities expresses\ndisrespect. Moreover, the size of the insurance payout for a given\ndisability is determined by the amount by which able-bodied people\nwould be willing to insure themselves against the prospect of\nincurring that disability. Insofar as the judgments of able-bodied\npeople don’t always track the intuitively relevant facts about\ndisability-related disadvantage, such an approach threatens to\n“bake in” flawed assumptions about the experience of\ndisability into its account of just entitlements for people with\ndisabilities (Bodenheimer 1997a,b). \nSeveral alternatives for assessing outcomes for purposes of political\nand social equality seem more responsive to the disabling role of the\nsocial environment. The most familiar and influential of these\nalternatives is the capabilities approach, developed in different ways\nby Martha Nussbaum (2006a) and Amartya Sen (1980). Their accounts are concerned\nnot only with the resources an individual has but also with what she\ncan do with them; with her “capability” of engaging in a\nnumber of valuable “functionings”, such as forming\nintimate relationships and having rich sensory and aesthetic\nexperiences. \nNussbaum’s earlier formulations of the capabilities placed\nconsiderable emphasis on species-typical functioning. For example, she\ninitially treated “the exercise of the five senses” as a\nnecessary constituent of human flourishing. More recent formulations\nare more congenial to social models of disability, in part because of\nNussbaum’s encounter with disability scholarship. She now makes\nroom for the social contribution to “natural” deficits\n(see Wasserman 1998; Terzi 2009), recognizing that most capabilities\nbear only a contingent, environmentally-mediated relationship to\npeople’s “natural endowment”. She abstracts from\ndifferences between people with impaired and normal limb function to\nfind a common claim to the means of moving about from place to place.\nSuch means may be architectural, vehicular, mechanical, or prosthetic;\nthey may involve making places more accessible or making the\nindividual more mobile. Similarly, a person lacking sight or hearing\ncan achieve aesthetic satisfaction by other means; a person with\nintellectual impairments can participate in activities structured to\ninclude individuals of varying cognitive skills. An individual with\nemphysema could increase his capacity for affiliation and control over\nthe material environment (two capabilities from Nussbaum’s\n2006a list) not only by\nmeasures to increase his lung capacity but also by measures to\nincrease his access to social and business venues through better\ntransit and architectural design. \nNussbaum’s broader framing enables her to recognize the\nprospects for flourishing of people with severe impairments. The\nplausibility of the capabilities approach for disability critics of\ndistributive accounts lies in the way the capabilities are\nindividuated. A basis for individuation might be found in a\ncomprehensive account of human nature and human flourishing, such as\nthe Aristotelian account that informs Nussbaum’s work. As Becker\nnotes, however, such a comprehensive account would have limited appeal\nin justifying a distributive scheme in a pluralistic society (2005:\n35). Despite its promise, considerably more work is needed to clarify\nher approach. Another feature of Nussbaum’s theory that some\ndisability theorists find congenial is her incorporation of\nrecognition and respect into her set of basic capabilities. Thus, the\ncapability for “affiliation” encompasses not only\nintimacy, but self-respect and dignity; the capability for\n“control over the environment” includes both the material\nand political environments. \nLess ambitiously than Nussbaum, Jonathan Wolff (2009b) classifies\nequality-enhancing measures for people with disabilities by the extent\nto which they address recognition as well as redistribution. Thus, the\nindividual limitations of people with disabilities can be addressed\nwith either cash compensation or “personal enhancement”,\nmedical, surgical, or rehabilitative measures to correct those\nlimitations. “Targeted resource enhancement” offers an\nintermediate option, which tries to improve the fit of the individual\nand the environment with a range of restricted resources such as\npersonal assistance and assistive technology. Finally, “status\nenhancement” alters the built environment and social practices\nto reduce the impact of individual differences in abilities on social\nequality. Wolff generally favors status enhancement as the most\nrespectful intervention, because it shapes the environment to the\nneeds of all members of society. It is also the most stable\nintervention, because it protects the social equality against sudden\nchanges in individuals’ levels of functioning. \nAlthough Wolff does not adopt the device of hypothetical decision\nmaking to justify a preference for status enhancement, that preference\ncould be underwritten by a suitably modified Original Position. As\nRichardson (2006) suggests, hypothetical decision makers who know that\nthey may represent individuals with severe impairments are more likely\nto be concerned with capabilities than with primary goods, since the\nlatter by themselves may be of limited value to those they represent.\nFurther, those decision makers would recognize that capabilities often\ncan be increased more respectfully, as well as more effectively, by\nstatus enhancements than by other measures. \nYet doubts remain about the extent to which concerns about\nrecognition, respect, and social equality can be captured in any\noutcome metric of individual well-being, however broad. Thus,\nChristian Schemmel (2012) argues that the treatment of people as\nequals must be understood in terms of respectful relationships among\nindividuals and institutions, and that the presence of such\nrelationships cannot plausibly be regarded in what Pogge (2004a,b)\ncalls “recipient-oriented” terms, as components of\nindividual well-being. The moral significance of respectful treatment\nis neither exhausted by, nor derivative of, its contribution to\nindividual well-being. As Schemmel argues (2012: 19), people may need\nsome forms of affiliation to flourish but do not necessarily require\nsocial and political equality for their own well-being. The\nplausibility of these claims depends to some extent on how narrow or\nbroad a conception of well-being one adopts. A conception that\nencompasses virtually all that a person has reason to care about will\nmore easily accommodate social equality and respectful\nrelationships. \nTwo approaches seek to moderate the ambitions of distributive justice\nin ways that may be more inclusive of people with disabilities. One\ntakes the end-state of justice not as equality or priority but\nsufficiency: it requires that every member of society reach some\nminimum in the appropriate “currency”. This approach,\nlabeled “sufficientarian” by one critic (Arneson 2006), is\nsuggested but not endorsed by Nussbaum, and it serves to make\ncapabilities a less demanding metric for distributive justice.\n(Nussbaum notes that certain capabilities must be distributed equally\nif anyone is to have a sufficient level of them, e.g., voting rights.)\nThe requirement that a just society ensure that every citizen reaches\na minimum level of each capability may be far less demanding than the\nrequirement of equal capabilities. One way of setting the minimum\nappeals to the requirements for participation in a democratic society\n(Gutmann 1987; Anderson 1999). \nAlthough sufficientarian approaches claim to make the demands of\njustice less oppressive, they have been criticized as demanding both too\nmuch and too little. They demand too much if the minimum for every\ncapability must be met in the face of recalcitrant impairments or\nenvironments. They demand too little if attaining the minimum could\nstill leave the individual with a miserable life (Arneson 2006;\nWasserman 2006; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007). Those approaches have also\nbeen criticized for lacking a mechanism for prioritizing capabilities\n(Wolff and de-Shalit 2007) and for assessing whether the minimum has\nbeen reached for any one capability (Riddle 2010). Clearly, the extent\nto which justice is achievable on such approaches for people with\nsevere disabilities will depend on where the minimum is set, how its\nsatisfaction is assessed, and how the capabilities are defined. \nA second approach would replace equality on a specific metric of\nadvantage with social equality or equality of respect (Anderson 1999;\nMiller 1999; Norman 1997, 1999). This approach would involve a more\nradical departure from luck egalitarianism than a sufficiency account,\nsince it does not lower the standard for a just distribution so much\nas propose a non-distributive standard for justice. That standard\nwould see justice in terms of recognition rather than, or as well as,\nredistribution. Although this approach may demand strict equality of a\nsort, it is a sort that does not appear to set determinate\ndistributive requirements. A society of social equals, abounding in\nmutual respect, can arguably tolerate significant disparities in\nwelfare, resources, opportunities, or capabilities. \nUnderlying this approach is the more fundamental distinction between\nrelational and distributive theories of justice. Although this\ndistinction can be drawn in different ways (see, e.g.,\nLippert-Rasmussen 2015, Fourie et al. 2015), it identifies two\ncritical dimensions of justice. One concerns how well-off individual\npeople are, both absolutely and in comparison to each other. The other\nconcerns the kinds of social relationships people stand in to one\nanother. As discussed in\n §4.3,\n it is a difficult question to what extent either dimension of justice\ncan be reduced to, or expressed in terms of, the other. \nAgainst the claim that relational justice can be understood as an\ninstance of distributive justice, one may observe that at least with\nrespect to equality, there seems to be an important\nstructural difference between two people standing in some\nrelation to some third thing (i.e., some good) to the same\ndegree and two people standing in some relation to one\nanother to the same degree (e.g., the relation of being\nrespected, recognized, and so on). Insofar as interpersonal equality\nhas a different structure when construed as relational, it is a\nmistake to think that it can be reduced to a species of distributive\nequality, for “equal” means something different in each\ncase. For example, it is one thing for any two people in society to\nhave equal respect from others; it is a different thing for\nany two people in society to have equal respect for one\nanother. This distinction is relevant to debates about disability\nin particular, because one way to understand the social model is in\nterms of the relational view—its core insight is that disability\nis not a one-place property of individuals, defined in terms of some\nwelfare deficit, but an n-place relation between individuals (n>2)\ndefined by stigmatizing or excluding attitudes, dispositions,\npractices, and forms of treatment. \nSome of these issues have taken center-stage in a recent debate over\nthe expressive significance of different measures to remediate the\ndisadvantages associated with disability. Pogge (2002) and Anderson\n(1999) have claimed that it is disrespectful to attribute a\nperson’s disadvantage to features of his or her natural\nendowment because it treats her as needy, deficient, or inferior. For\nthis reason, they argue against justifying redistributive measures to\nachieve inclusion on the grounds that they correct natural\ninequalities in skills, talents, or the ability to convert resources\ninto welfare. Instead, they contend that such measures can and should\nbe justified as redressing discrimination, and conversely, that\nfailures to achieve inclusion should be recognized as unjustly\ndiscriminatory. \nBarclay (2010, 2018) challenges the argument that a claim for\nredistribution treats the claimant as deficient or inferior. Such\nclaims need only recognize that some traits are less suited than\nothers for specific environments—a contingency that does not\nimply the intrinsic superiority or inferiority of a given endowment.\nShe thus questions those (e.g, Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000) who\nclaim that certain characteristics or traits are universally valuable,\nsuch that an individual who lacked them would be deficient in any\nenvironment. Although she tends to see the environment as fixed rather\nthan malleable, Barclay argues that the project of achieving inclusion\nis best seen in terms of maximizing individuals’ environmental\nfit. Achieving that fit may require expending more resources for some\nindividuals than others in any given environment. The demands made by\nvery tall or left-handed people for greater accommodation do not\npresuppose their inferiority, only their minority status (see\n §2,\n infra). These comparisons suggest that the demands for accommodation\nof people with such statistically atypical features differ merely in\ndegree, not kind, from those made by people with various\nimpairments. \nEven if compensation for disadvantage need bit be demeaning, however,\nspecific grounds for compensation may well be. Laws and policies that\ncompensate people simply because they are disabled, or have a specific\ndisability, may be objectionable because of the social meaning of\ndisability-compensation. Compensation that is based on the medical\nclassification of disability may reinforce the humanity-obscuring\nstereotype of “the cripple” as helpless and pitiable. This\ngrave threat to social equality should make us wary of drawing\ndistributive implications from the claim that disability is a\n“bad difference” rather than a “mere difference\n“(see entry, “Disability: Well-Being, Health, and Personal\nRelationships”). Even if disability in general, or specific\ndisabilities, were bad differences, that would hardly imply that\nindividuals who had (those) disabilities were entitled to compensation\nsimply by virtue of that fact. \nThere are many categories or groups into which people can place\nthemselves, and be placed, on the basis of their varying\ncharacteristics. The salience and appeal of these categories depend on\nsocial and historical context as well as individual preferences and\nvalues. Identity and identity politics become important as members of\nhistorically excluded groups challenge their status and work for\ninclusion. Many women gained a sense of group identity in opposing\nlaws that limited voting and other political rights to men; racial\nidentities have been forged in the fight against segregation. Although\npeople with disabilities are not always understood as sharing an\nidentity, their awareness of membership in an oppressed group has been\nshaped by exclusionary laws and customs, from “ugly laws”\nprohibiting people with physical deformities from appearing in public\nto the state-sponsored involuntary sterilization of “mental\ndefectives”. A sense of group identity has been further\nencouraged by welfare, social security and other laws that place\npeople with various disabilities in a single category, even if they\ndefine that category in different ways. \nThe importance of disability as a social category was increased by the\nmovement to establish civil rights for people with disabilities. As in\nthe case of other stigmatized groups, the characteristics used as a\nground for exclusion became a basis for mobilization and a source of\npride. The social model of disability, which informed the movement for\ndisability rights, emphasized what people with various impairments\nhave in common—their stigmatization and exclusion—and\nthereby promoted the emergence of disability as a powerful social\nidentity. \nCritics like Fraser argue that the importance of social identity\ncannot be adequately captured in any metric of individual advantage.\nAn effective social response to stigmatized identities requires both\nrecognition and transformation—changes in cultural framing and\nsocial perception that are poorly served by redistribution. An\nemphasis on redistribution is often self-defeating, exacerbating\nstigma and reinforcing the impression of the stigmatized group as\ndeficient (Fraser 1995, 1997; see Olsen 2001). Yet as we will discuss, some\nways of transforming social identity have significant dangers as\nwell. \nFor proponents of recognition, one issue is whether justice requires\nnot only respect for individual members of society, but also respect\nfor their group or cultural identities. Must a just society recognize\n“group-specific cultural identity” or merely “the\nstatus of group members as full partners in social interaction”\n(Fraser 2001: 23, 24)? Are these separate requirements, or does\nrespect for an individual entail respect for her social or cultural\nidentities? These questions have been addressed primarily with respect\nto religious, ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. Very little work\nhas been done on the question of what a disability identity would look\nlike and what sorts of recognition claims it would implicate. \nA somewhat parallel issue has been raised in distributive\njustice—must society allocate resources, broadly construed, to\nsupport the group and cultural identities of its members? That support\ncould be based on the claim that such identities are a constituent,\nperhaps an irreducible one, of the well-being of the individual\nmembers of society. This claim has been suggested by justice theorists\nwho argue for the importance of culture as a “context of\nchoice” for individuals (e.g., Kymlicka 1989, Sparrow 2005). An\nindividual deprived of a culture through which he has experienced and\ninterpreted the world will find it far more difficult to flourish. As\nwe will discuss, however, it is doubtful that disability in general,\nor particular impairments, play such a comprehensive role in the lives\nof many—let alone all—people with\n disabilities.[8] \nWe begin by describing the different characteristics of an\nindividual’s “identity”. One sense of this term is\nthat of numerical identity over time: what makes some person at time\nt1 the same person as the person at time t2? (see SEP entry on\n identity over time).\n This is, in the first instance, a metaphysical question and not our\ninterest here. A different sense of “identity” refers to\nthose characteristics that make one the particular person one is, as\njudged both by oneself and by others. This includes narrative,\nbiographical, and practical identities. It is less about criteria for\nsameness over time and more about the constitutive or defining\nfeatures of one’s self- (or social) conception. This is the\nsense of “identity” we will be concerned with. \nThe sense of individual identity most directly relevant to respect and\nrecognition is arguably that of practical identity. Following\nKorsgaard (1996, 2009), we can understand a practical identity to be a\ndescription under which a person values herself, where valuing oneself\ninvolves treating oneself as a source of reasons. For example, someone\nwho identifies as a mother in this sense values herself under the\ndescription “mother” and for that reason treats the fact\nthat she is a mother as a source of (normative practical) reasons.\nMoreover, to “drop” this identification is not like\ndropping a desire or short-term goal. It involves changing one’s\nsense of who one is as a person and what gives one’s life\nvalue. \nOn this view, a person’s practical identities should be\nnormatively significant for other people as well. For one thing, many\nof a person’s significant interests are derived from\nher practical identities. Since it is uncontroversial that respect and\nconcern require giving appropriate weight to the interests of others,\nit follows that respect and concern require giving appropriate weight\nto other people’s practical identities, at least insofar as they\ngenerate (legitimate) interests. In addition, respecting a\nperson’s practical identities plausibly falls under a more\ngeneral requirement of respect for personal autonomy. Personal\nautonomy is a foundational value of liberal democracies, whose laws\nand policies do not require individuals to organize their lives around\nany particular identity, but rather give them the latitude to make of\ntheir identities what they will (Appiah 2005; Appiah and Gutmann 1996;\nsee also the SEP entry on\n identity politics).\n This can be seen as a part of liberalism’s broader commitment\nto neutrality about conceptions of the good (e.g., Rawls 1993). \nThese issues become especially charged if we move from individual to\ngroup identities, bringing us closer to the question of disability\nidentities. As K. Anthony Appiah points out, though individual\nidentity is different from group identity, it nevertheless has a\ncollective or social dimension (Appiah 2005: 21). For example,\nPalestinians living in the West Bank have a distinct collective\nidentity. This is different from, though certainly compatible with,\nsome specific West Bank resident having as part of his individual\nidentity being a\n Palestinian.[9]\n It is important to bear this distinction between individual and\ncollective identities in mind, because the latter, to a greater extent\nthan the former, is imposed or “ascribed” by the larger\nsociety rather than chosen by the individual. \nBeing disabled, like being a member of a minority race, subjects one\nto particular treatment. But one can experience that treatment without\nfeeling compelled to regard one’s disability or minority status\nas part of one’s individual identity in the practical sense of\nbeing a description under which one values oneself. Often, having a\ndisability identity ascribed to one, like having a racial identity\nascribed, consists in part in being the object of, and provides an\nexcuse for, discriminatory, demeaning or degrading treatment of\nvarious sorts. This is so both for people whose impairments are\nimmediately observable and for those whose impairments are hidden but\nsubject to exposure and ridicule by a temporary change in appearance,\ne.g., a person with epilepsy who has a seizure in public (Schneider\nand Conrad 1985; more generally, Davis 2005). And since this social\nidentity is often part of one’s individual identity, such\ntreatment is likely to be injurious to the self-respect of the one\nwith this identity, and in that sense constitute an instance of\nmisrecognition. Ironically, the fact of being unfairly stereotyped can\nitself shape the identities of those who are treated in this way, as\nAppiah notes, even if initially they did not identify strongly with\nthe group in question. \nDesirable change with respect to social identities is possible in at\nleast two ways. First, even if some important aspects of one’s\nself are not chosen—say, the fact that one has paraplegia or\ndeafness—how central they are to one’s self-conception,\nhow much they matter to one’s interests and plans, is to some\nextent within one’s voluntary control. On some views, notably\nKorsgaard’s, reflective endorsement of an identity is a\nnecessary condition of its being normative for the agent, i.e.,\nproviding reasons for her. At the same time, the extent to which\none’s identifications are voluntary depends on the constraints\nof the social environment. One cannot simply decide to make\none’s disability a less salient feature of one’s\nbiographical identity, at least, especially if one’s disability\nis not “hidden”. If the identity is ascribed, and\nemphasized, by the larger society, it may be difficult to reduce its\nimportance in one’s own practical reasoning. But one still has\nsome choice about whether to accept or resist that emphasis. \nSecond, there can be a change in the valence of the label, as\nthere has been with the term “queer”: what was once a\nnegative label, accompanied by unjust treatment of various sorts, can\nbe transformed into a positive label and championed as a source of\nself-respect and pride for those who share in the collective identity.\nJohn Lawson discusses how special education for disabled children,\nonce seen as a major factor in the creation of a negative,\nsecond-class identity, can be transformed into “sites for the\npositive promotion of disability as a cultural identity” (Lawson\n2001: 203–21). Neither sort of change—in identification or\nvalence—can be accomplished without struggle, personal as well\nas political, but partial success is sometimes achievable. \nEven if disability is not and does not have to be a central component\nof every disabled person’s identity, this does not negate the\nsignificance of disability as an organizing principle of political\naction. But when the social and political recognition of disability\nbecomes the objective of political action, as it is in identity\npolitics, it gives rise to the “dilemma of difference”\n(Minow 1990). Consider special education for children: On the one\nhand, labeling a child “disabled” risks stigmatizing and\nisolating the child. In this sense, to be “different” is\nto be inferior. Alternatively, being labeled “disabled” is\na way for parents to secure attention to the child’s particular\nways of learning and functioning. In this sense, to be\n“different” is to be entitled to appropriate educational\nassistance. \nThe dilemma may not be insurmountable. The movement for universal\ndesign in education aims to refashion classrooms and teaching\npractices to encourage the participation of all students. To the\nextent that the movement is successful, it will minimize the need for\n“special education” (Biklen 1992; Gartner and Lipsky 2002;\nLipsky and Gartner 1996). Law and public policy must think creatively\nabout ways to solve this dilemma so that the stigma they seek to\neliminate is not in effect reinforced. Success in resolving the\ndilemma of difference may reduce the importance of disability identity\nfor justice. If disability is simply a characteristic to be taken\naccount of in social arrangements, it could become as significant or\ninsignificant as height or aptitude. \nThere are at least two other risks for an identity politics of\ndisability. One involves the danger of assuming that the members of a\nparticular marginalized group all share the same culture, be it\nAfrican-American culture or disability culture. This assumption is not\nrequired by a mature identity politics, but it may be encouraged by\nefforts to mobilize diverse individuals around a single identity. Two\nconsiderations may help to resist this tendency. First, we must\nrecognize that culture is a complex concept, and that defining it is\nno easy task. Second, we must recognize that on any plausible\ndefinition, people with the same disability (let alone different\ndisabilities) need not share a common culture. There are some examples\nof a shared disability culture: Deaf culture is perhaps the best\nknown. But many people who are deaf, particularly those who do not\nsign, do not identify as Deaf or take part in Deaf culture (Tucker\n1997[10]\n And even for those who participate, Deaf culture does not appear to\nbe the kind of “encompassing” or\n“comprehensive” culture claimed by Kymlicka, Margalit, and\nRaz to provide a “context of choice” for its\n members.[11] \nThe second, related risk involves privileging one identity over\nothers. This is especially important for people with multiple or\n“intersectional” identities. People who are\nAfrican-American and disabled, or female and disabled, or disabled and\nLGBT may sometimes feel a conflict between those identities. In one\nstudy, for example, African-American women with mobility impairments\nreported that they felt estranged from the disability-rights movement,\npartly because its leadership seemed predominantly white, and partly\nbecause some of its principal goals—to maximize\nindependence—went against their more communal values, which\nemphasized family and co-dependence (Feldman and Tegart 2003). More\ngenerally, although there has been comparatively little discussion of\nthe intersection between disability and race within philosophical work\non disability (though see Stubblefield 2009), more discussion can be\nfound in disability studies more generally (e.g., Bell 2011). Also,\nsome have noted that mainstream feminism’s focus on independence\nand self-sufficiency has tended to exclude women with disabilities,\nwho are perceived as lacking in these cardinal virtues (Crawford and\nOstrove 2003; Wendell 1996). At the same time, disabled women are\noften particularly vulnerable to the injustices that motivate the\nfeminist movement: they are frequently victims of sexual exploitation\n(Crawford and Ostrove 2003), encounter many obstacles to leaving\ndissatisfying relationships because of physical, psychological and\nfinancial dependency (Olkin 2003), and have median incomes below the\npoverty line and substantially lower than those of their male\ncounterparts (Crawford and Ostrove 2003; Olkin 1999). \nIn addition to these potential risks associated with emphasizing\nidentity politics for persons with disabilities and other stigmatized\nminorities, there have been several major challenges in mobilizing\npeople with disabilities around an affirmative group or cultural\nidentity. The first, addressed by the disability rights movement, was\ngetting people with disabilities to recognize that they have something\nin common with others who are differently impaired but also suffer\nstigma and exclusion because of their impairment. This has been\ndifficult because people who are born with disabilities or acquire\nthem in childhood come from widely dispersed socioeconomic, geographic\nand racial groups (Scotch 1988) and so are less likely to grow up with\na sense of group identity. Another obstacle has been the\noverwhelmingly negative connotation of the label\n“disabled”. Indeed, the challenge for people with visual,\nmotor, and psychiatric impairments has been to recognize that they\nshare a “disabled” identity while denying that this makes\nthem dependent, child-like, or powerless (Asch 1985; Scotch 1988);\nsuch a self-identity would quite literally disable\none’s capacity for social participation and political\naction. \nIt is instructive to compare how the medical and social models would\naddress these challenges. The medical model suggests a disability\nidentity that is both fragmented and negative. Because the medical\nmodel defines disability in terms of particular physical or mental\nimpairments, the primary commonalities it recognizes among disabled\npeople are strictly functional; it views the blind person and the deaf\nperson as having very different problems. Although it could recognize\nthe fact that such biomedically distinct conditions had similar social\nconsequences—stigmatization and exclusion—it would treat\nthose similar consequences merely as secondary effects of the two\nconditions. Even within a single impairment, a medical model\nencourages distinctions based on etiology. For example, it would\ndistinguish blindness due to Leber’s congenital amaurosis from\nblindness due to retinaopathy of prematurity, focusing on genetic\ntesting for the former and treatment for the latter, and placing less\nemphasis on the shared challenges of living with blindness. Although\nthis narrow focus may be appropriate for the purposes of clinical\nintervention, it obscures the recognition of disability as a social\nand political problem, except insofar as it raises perennial questions\nabout how to distribute scarce health-care resources (Barnartt et al.\n2001). \nIn contrast, the various social models were explicitly formulated to\nsupport a disability identity that could serve as the basis for claims\nof respect and recognition. The inclusion of people with a vast array\nof different impairments in United States and other national civil\nrights laws, and the creation of the United Nations convention on the\nrights of persons with disabilities, have helped to forge a shared\ndisability identity. The emergence of disability studies as a\nrecognized field of academic inquiry has also contributed. The\nminority group model promotes a trans-impairment identity by treating\npeople with disabilities as a “discrete and insular\nminority” making claims on a generally stigmatizing able-bodied\nmajority. Though the minority group model has proven extremely useful\nin passing anti-discrimination laws, it may do so at the expense of\nemphasizing the differences between people with disabilities\nand people without them, rather than highlighting the many ways in\nwhich identity need not be tied to the presence or absence of an\nimpairment. The human variation model tempers this emphasis, and\nresists essentialism about disability identity, by treating the group\nitself as socially constructed. It sees the category of “the\ndisabled” as resting on an artificial dichotomy imposed on a\ncontinuum of variation. The conceptualization of disability as just\none source of difference, and as a difference in kind more than\ndegree, can undercut a sense of disability as the basis for a unique\nand exclusive identity. \nThe more the redesign of the physical and social environment is guided\nby a thoroughgoing human-variation model, the less dominant disability\nidentity and identity politics may become for people with\ndisabilities. A society in which disabilities lack the social and\npractical significance they currently have may be one in which the\nequality of people with disabilities can be fully recognized without\nhaving to treat disability as a salient feature of their\nidentities. \nIt may be, though, that the physical, sensory, or psychic experience\nof a particular impairment turns out to be central and salient to how\nthose with the impairment live—even in a society deeply\ncommitted to inclusion, participation, and non-discrimination. Perhaps\ncommunicating primarily gesturally and not vocally, or moving through\nthe world with wheels and not on legs, or focusing on detail rather than context, makes the lives of people who are deaf, or\nparalyzed, or autistic sufficiently distinctive that they feel a\nstrong affinity and connection with others who have the same\nimpairment (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for a discussion of this claim.) Disability theorists who adopt\ndifferent social model approaches might profitably consider how\ndifferent views about group and individual identity apply to people\nwith disabilities. \nThe connection between different models of disability and different\nways of understanding disability identity points us in the direction\nof an important category of injustice, in addition to the distributive\nand relational conceptions already discussed. This is epistemic\ninjustice (Fricker 2007; Barnes, 2016). Epistemic injustice\nconsists in a person’s being wronged in her capacity as an\nepistemic subject. Testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nknowledge, while hermeneutical injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nunderstanding. More specifically, testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s testimony being given less credence than the evidence\nwarrants due to prejudice on the part of the hearer, while\nhermeneutical injustice consists in someone’s experiences being\nobscured from individual and collective understanding due to wrongful\nexclusion from the practices by which those understandings are\ngenerated. Both have clear implications for disability, justice, and\nidentity. \nFor example, consider the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\nto assess the prospective benefits of health care interventions. The\nstandard method of “quality adjustment” involves (i)\nassigning a value of 1 to each life-year one can reasonably expect to\nsave through a given intervention, and (ii) discounting each life-year\nthat would be lived by a person with a disability by some coefficient\n(between 0 and 1) which is thought to reflect the badness of living\nwith the disability in question. These coefficients are typically\narrived at by asking people how many years of life with the\ndisability people would be willing to exchange for each year of life\nwithout the disability. For example, suppose survey data\nindicate that people would trade 8 years of life with blindness for 4\nyears of life with sight. The method of quality-adjustment would\nassign a QALY of 0.5 to each year of life lived with blindness. The\nupshot is that saving nondisabled life-years provides more “bang\nfor your buck” in the QALY model, and as such is to be preferred\nto saving disabled life-years. \nThis implication has led some to criticize the method of\nquality-adjustment on the grounds that it produces a kind of\n“double jeopardy:” people with disabilities are\ndisadvantaged twice-over, first by having the disability itself,\nsecond by having their health care needs discounted for that very\nreason (e.g., Singer et al. 1995; Bognar 2011; John et al. 2017). But\nthere is another way of thinking about QALYs which takes issue with\nboth quality-adjustment and an assumption behind the double-jeopardy\ncriticism. When the “exchange rate” between disabled and\nnon-disabled life-years is calculated, it is primarily or exclusively\nbased the judgments of able-bodied people. This feature is\ncriticizable on two distinct grounds. One is that it disrespects the\nfirst-person authority of people with disabilities, who know\nfirst-hand what it’s like to have the disability in question\n(and, if disabled as adults, know also what it’s like\nnot to have the disability). This disrespect for first-person\nauthority is plausibly an example of testimonial injustice, at least\ninsofar as it reflects prejudicial or otherwise biased attitudes on\nthe part of the able-bodied. A second, related criticism is that this\napproach exaggerates the difference in quality between able-bodied and\ndisabled lives, relative to an approach that appropriately\nincorporated and weighed the perspectives of people with disabilities.\nAble-bodied people often overestimate how bad it would be to have a\ngiven disability, given popular stereotypes which depict life with\ndisability as tragic, occlusive of life’s major goods, and so\non. This is plausibly an example of hermeneutical injustice, insofar\nas the poor understanding of disabled people’s experiences and\nidentities results from their exclusion from the public sphere. This\nis only one example; much work remains to be done exploring the\nimplications of epistemic injustice for people with disabilities. \nThis entry began by pointing out a feature of disability that\ndistinguishes it from other characteristics which have often been seen\nas grounding legitimate claims of justice, such as race, sex, sexual\nand gender identity, and religion. Simply put, achieving full\ninclusion for people with disabilities is expensive to a\ndegree that achieving full inclusion for other minorities is not. Any\nplausible theory of inclusion implies the necessity of considerable\naccommodation and environmental reconstruction. And even if the costs\nof such measures have often been exaggerated, it is difficult to see\nhow the appropriate degree of accommodation and reconstruction would\nnot require diverting significant amounts of resources from other\nworthy goals, including some goals which are supported by\ncountervailing considerations of justice. One implication of this\nfeature of disability is that disability requires us to directly\ncompare, and perhaps trade off, values of relational justice, which\nground the demand for full inclusion as part of a society of equals,\nand values of distributive justice, which ground the demand for a fair\ndistribution of scarce resources.  \nHaving made this general point, the entry proceeded to discuss\ndifferent models of disability, which differ principally in their\nunderstanding of the relationship between impairment and limitation.\nWhereas the medical model of disability tends to attribute most of the\nlimitations associated with disability to functional aspects of the\nrelevant impairments, the social model of disability emphasizes the\nmediating role of the social environment—broadly understood to\ninclude the configuration of physical space, the availability of\nvarious forms of accommodation, social practices and norms,\netc.—in generating disability-related disadvantage. Among other\nthings, the social model highlights the relational aspects of\ndisability-related disadvantage, such as stigma, invisibility, and\nexclusion, whereas the medical model lends itself to a narrow\ndistributive interpretation of the claims of justice generated by\ndisability. \nIn subsequent sections, the entry focused on the role of disability in\ncontractualist and other distributive theories of justice. Disability\nhas often been regarded as a “limit case” for\ncontractualist theories of justice, and more specifically for the\nidealizing assumptions these theories make about the capacities of\nthose who choose and those who are governed by contractualist\nprinciples of justice. We also saw that disability has played a\ncentral role in discussions of outcome-oriented, distributive theories\nof justice, in particular luck egalitarianism. Internally, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the\n“currency” of justice, since it has often been seen as a\nparadigm example of unchosen disadvantage. Externally, disability has\nplayed a central role in relational criticisms of luck egalitarian\ntheories of justice. At best, these theories have been seen as failing\nto attribute normative significance to morally relevant differences\nbetween identical patterns of distribution which differ in the causal\ncontribution of the social environment. At worst, these theories have\nbeen criticized for expressing disrespect towards people with\ndisabilities in virtue of characterizing them as “mere”\nunfortunates or objects of pity. Although some of these criticisms may\nbe overstated, they have been taken to heart by many theorists of\ndistributive justice, especially proponents of the capabilities\napproach. Finally, the entry concluded by pointing to a topic which\nhas received far less attention in discussions of disability and\njustice: namely, the normative significance of disability as a form of\nsocial identity, and the connections between disability and epistemic\ninjustice. \nThis entry raises a number of questions which would benefit from\nfurther exploration. Clearly, one general question is how exactly to\nunderstand the distinction between distributive and relational values\nof justice. Another, related question is how to assess the comparative\nweight or importance of these values. And if, as many find plausible,\nsome form of pluralism about justice is the correct answer, then we\nwill need to work out how the relevant trade-offs, weights, and so on\napply to the special case of disability, which simultaneously raises\nboth distributive and relational concerns. A third question which\ncalls for further research is the link between disability and\nepistemic injustice. We briefly discussed two examples of testimonial\nand hermeneutical injustice concerning people with disabilities, but\nthere are—needless to say—many more. Indeed, disability\nmay be an especially powerful example of epistemic injustice precisely\nbecause the phenomenological experiences of people with disabilities,\nespecially those with sensory impairments, differ considerably\nfrom the experiences of the able-bodied majority, raising the hard\nquestion of how well we must understand others in order to treat them\nas justice requires.","contact.mail":"dtwasserm@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2013-05-23","date.changed":"2019-07-02","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disability-justice/","author1":"Daniel Putnam","author2":"David Wasserman","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"disability-justice","body.text":"\n\n\nAmong the topics in philosophy and disability, the relationship\nbetween disability and justice has received the lion’s share of\nattention. No doubt this is in part because justice, often regarded as\nthe “first virtue of social institutions” (Rawls 1971: 3),\nis central to the evaluation of social policies and public\ninstitutions. But it is also because disability has played at least\ntwo distinct roles in recent discussions of social justice. First,\ndisability has been seen by many as a paradigm example of unchosen\ndisadvantage. Hence, disability has played a central role in internal\ndiscussions of luck egalitarianism, in particular with respect to the\n“currency” question—equality of what?—and\nexternal discussions, in particular with respect to the question of\nwhether luck egalitarianism is disrespectful or stigmatizing. Second,\npeople with disabilities, particularly intellectual or cognitive\ndisabilities, have been seen by many as a “limit case” for\ncontractarian or contractualist theories of justice. Hence, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the eligibility\nconditions for being party to the contractual procedures by which\nprinciples of justice are chosen and for being subject to the\nprinciples of justice so chosen.\n\n\nDisability also presents difficult issues as a social or group\nidentity: roughly, a central part of the way an individual\nunderstands, presents, or values herself. This aspect of disability\nhas been made salient by the civil rights movement that established\ndisability as an important category in antidiscrimination law.\nTheories that assess justice in terms of the distribution of resources\nor opportunities have sometimes been criticized for failing to take\nadequate account of such identities. But the embrace of social\nidentity as a component of justice can be equally problematic.\n\n\nDisability is of special interest for justice because of the way in\nwhich it juxtaposes two basic and powerful senses of\ninjustice. These two senses of injustice are sometimes\nexpressed in terms of a distinction between the justice of\ndistributions and the justice of recognition, or\nmore recently, between distributive justice and\nrelational injustice. Very roughly, we can think of these\nlabels as denoting a distinction between the injustice of certain\noutcomes—in particular, outcomes in which there is an\ninequality of income, wealth, health, or other aspects of well-being\nresulting from morally irrelevant factors—and the injustice of\ncertain forms of treatment—in particular, the treatment\nof some people as moral, social, or political inferiors on\nthe basis of morally irrelevant characteristics. Correcting the first\nform of injustice is thought to require, fundamentally, a change in\nthe distribution of resources, broadly construed, that affect\nwell-being. Correcting the first form of injustice is thought to\nrequire, fundamentally, a change in the structure and character of\ninterpersonal relationships, which may in turn require changes to\nsocial and institutional norms and practices. Needless to say, the\nrelationship and comparative importance of these two forms of\ninjustice have been the subject of considerable discussion, and there\nis no canonical statement of the distinction (Fourie et al. 2015;\nAnderson 1999; Fraser 2001, 1996; Honneth 1992).\n\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Section 1 will discuss disability\nin terms of these two broad types of injustice. Sections 2 and 3 will\nexamine the implications of different models of disability for the\ndistinction between redistribution and recognition. Section 4 will\nthen examine the treatment of disability in contemporary theories of\ndistributive justice. It will explain how the environmental and social\ncharacter of disability has been largely overlooked by contractarian\nand egalitarian theories, not so much because of their distributive\nfocus, but because of their narrow focus on one aspect of\ndisability—functional limitation—to the neglect of\nexclusionary attitudes and practices. Section 4 will conclude by\ndiscussing recent efforts to rectify this neglect, describing several\nways in which distributive justice theorists have sought to take\naccount of environmental and social barriers and to address claims for\nrecognition. These efforts include broadening the metric for just\ndistributions to encompass respectful relationships and social\npractices; arguing that a just distribution on such broader metrics\ncan be attained more effectively and appropriately by modifying the\nphysical and social environment than by redistributing resources among\nindividuals; and adopting outcome standards that do not require strict\nequality on any metric but rather the reduction or elimination of\ndisrespectful inequalities. Section 5 will discuss a major issue in\nthe recognition of disability: the relationship of disability identity\nto various approaches to justice, where “identity” is\nunderstood as a part of an individual’s self-understanding or\nself-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that people with disabilities have long been treated as\nmoral and social inferiors, at the same time that they have suffered\ndistributive injustices of various kinds (see generally, Barclay\n2018). Routinely, people with disabilities have been denied jobs for\nwhich they are highly qualified because they have been considered\nincompetent, or because employers have not been comfortable with their\npresence in the workplace. Often, people with certain disabilities\nhave been consigned to segregated institutions and facilities because\nthey have been regarded as incapable of making decisions or caring for\nthemselves, or because others in the community did not want to\ninteract with them. \nThese forms of relational injustice are associated with very concrete\nmaterial inequalities. In 2009, almost 20 years after the passage of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the employment-population ratio\nof people with disabilities in the United States was 19.2%, compared\nto 64.5% for persons without a disability (Bureau of Labor Statistics\n2010). Based on data from 1996–1999, researchers estimate that\n47.4% of working-age adults who experienced poverty for a year or more\nhad at least one disability (Fremstad 2009). \nFacts such as these have led some to conclude that  \nin particular, internally diverse ways, people with disabilities have\nbeen on the end of a kind of pincer movement between Fraser’s\ntwo impediments to parity: “misrecognition” and\n“maldistribution” (Calder 2010: 62). \nIn these respects, people with disabilities are in a comparable\nposition to members of other “discrete and insular\nminorities” with a history of being subject to both distributive\nand relational injustice. But there is a significant difference.\nSimply put, there is no reason to think that it need be particularly\nexpensive to eliminate disrespect and misrecognition towards\nracial, ethnic, and sexual minorities. But insofar as accommodation\nand reconstruction of the built environment are necessary to eliminate\ndisrespect and misrecognition towards people with disabilities,\nrelational justice for people with disabilities may require diverting\nsignificant resources from other causes. In that sense, achieving\njustice for people with disabilities requires us to directly address\nthe relationship between relational justice and distributive justice\nto a degree that achieving justice for members of other groups\ngenerally does not.  \nTo be sure, the costs associated with accommodation and reconstruction\nof the built environment need not be understood as\ncompensation for the alleged deficits of people with\ndisabilities. Indeed, they would have to be acknowledged even if\ndisabilities were seen as intrinsically neutral physical or mental\ncharacteristics that merely differ from those of a majority of the\npopulation. In any society whose physical structures and social\npractices are designed for average or typical members, people with\ndisabilities will be disadvantaged just because of their minority\nstatus. A similar point has been made by feminist scholars, who have\npointed out the structural discrimination of workplaces and public\nsettings designed exclusively for men. The expenses of additional\nrestrooms, stalls, or pumping stations do not compensate women for\ntheir deficiencies. They simply accommodate differences ignored in a\nsociety that saw a woman’s place as in the home (Wendell 1996;\nWasserman 1998: 178–179). \nStill, the rectification of such structural discrimination may raise\nmore difficult issues for people with disabilities than for women,\nbecause there is greater uncertainty and potential for disagreement\nabout the extent of the changes that are required to treat people with\ndisabilities as social and political equals. Indeed, the range and\nvariety of physical and mental differences within a society raise\nissues of distributive justice that have no obvious analogue for other\nstigmatized groups. A “gender-neutral” environment can be\nreadily conceived, and achieved at modest cost. In contrast,\ndisability scholars and activists have not specified what it would\nmean to achieve an “ability-neutral” environment—one\nthat was no more advantageous to people with some physical and mental\ncharacteristics than others. And some argued that the ideas of an\n“ability-neutral” environment is either conceptually\nincoherent or prohibitively expensive (Barclay 2011, 2018). Moreover,\nit seems likely that questions about the extent to which justice\nrequires reconstructing or modifying the built environment would arise\nwith respect to people with disabilities even in a society with no\nhistory of invidious attitudes or practices toward such persons. By\ncontrast, it seems less likely that such questions would arise in a\nsociety with no history of sexism, for example. \nJustice for people with disabilities, then, appears to raise questions\nabout the relationship between distributive justice and relational\njustice that justice for other stigmatized groups does not. Yet the\nneed for redistribution hardly reduces the importance of recognition\nin achieving justice. Indeed, the complex, disputed relationship\nbetween the two makes disability a significant challenge for theories\nof justice. \n“Disability” is typically defined in terms of two\nelements: (i) a physical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived\nas an impairment or dysfunction, and (ii) a significant personal or\nsocial limitation associated with that characteristic. The\nrelationship between these two elements—and the role of the\nenvironment in mediating them—is a core issue in the\nconceptualization of, and social response to, disability. The\nmedical model treats disability as an individual physical or\nmental characteristic with significant personal and social\nconsequences. In particular, it sees the limitations faced by people\nwith disabilities as resulting primarily or solely from their\nimpairments. By contrast, the various social models see\ndisability as a relationship between individuals and their social\nenvironments: physical and mental characteristics are limiting only or\nprimarily in virtue of social practices that lead to the exclusion of\npeople with those characteristics. This exclusion is manifested not\nonly in deliberate segregation, but in built environments and social\npractices that restrict the participation of people regarded as having\ndisabilities (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience). \nIn their extreme forms, which treat the impairment or environment\n(respectively) as the sole cause of personal and social limitation,\nthe medical and social models have few, if any, defenders. Rather,\nthey mark the limits of possible relationships between impairment and\nlimitation. Almost all writers on disability acknowledge some role for\nboth the impairment and the environment in causing limitations; the\ndisagreement largely concerns the assessment of their comparative\ncontribution, and their interaction. Most scholars who embrace some\nversion of the social model acknowledge that\nimpairments—generally but not universally understood as\ndeviations from species-relative statistical norms—can be\nsources of discomfort and limitation even in the absence of\ndisadvantaging social practices (e.g., Shakespeare 2006, Thomas 2004).\nThese scholars would argue, however, that such adverse effects are far\nless damaging than social exclusion, are greatly magnified by hostile\nenvironments, and could be significantly reduced by more inclusive\nenvironments. The medical model is less often explicitly defended than\nunreflectively adopted—by health care professionals,\nbioethicists, and philosophers who ignore or underestimate the\ncontribution of social and other environmental factors to the\nlimitations faced by people with disabilities. Even among these\ngroups, however, there is a growing awareness of the environmental\ncontribution to disability and a partial embrace of the social model\n(Cureton and Brownlee 2009). \nTo the extent that it is held by anyone in unalloyed form, the medical\nmodel of disability would not deny that disability raises issues of\njustice. Indeed, that model might give support to the view that the\ndisadvantages perceived as inherent to disability raise some of the\nmost urgent claims of justice (Barclay 2011, 2018). But such a model\ndoes not recognize any principled rationale for preferring\nreconstruction of the social and built environment over compensation\nor correction as a means for correcting disability-related\ndisadvantage, a point made by Wolff (2009a, 2009b), among others. In\ncontrast, the social model strongly supports such a rationale, since\nit construes many aspects of disability-related disadvantage as\nessentially connected to various forms of literal and\nfigurative exclusion. Relatedly, the social model construes\nreconstruction as a public good: more accessible structures and more\ninclusive practices can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people with\nand without disabilities (Scotch and Schriner 1997). But such\nreconstruction also helps to achieve a fairer distribution of tangible\nand intangible goods, particularly social and economic\nopportunities. \nSome critics accuse social model theorists of assuming that any\ndisadvantage caused by the social environment is ipso facto\nunjust (Samaha 2007). This assumption would reflect an oversimplified\nview of the relationship between causing disadvantage and creating\ninjustice. The fact that social structures or practices cause\ndisadvantage does not imply that there is a duty of justice to correct\nor compensate for the disadvantage. That will depend on the costs of\nalleviating it, and—under any plausible theory of\njustice—some comparison with the advantages and disadvantages\nthat would result from alternative social arrangements. Thus, for\nexample, choosing to spend the bulk of a municipal arts budget on a\nconcert hall rather than an art museum may disadvantage those who\ncannot hear. But that disadvantage, although caused by a social\ndecision, is not necessarily unjust. That will depend, inter\nalia, on the availability of non-auditory forms of aesthetic\nexperience and the comparative costs of building the museum instead.\nTo take another example, placing ramps and elevators in new high-rise\nbuildings is relatively inexpensive and beneficial to most users,\nwhereas placing them in nineteenth century walk-ups is difficult and\nexpensive; holding public meetings or events in buildings with ramps\nand elevators has negligible costs, whereas moving an existing\nbusiness from a building that lacks them to one that has them may be\nvery expensive (Samaha 2007; Wasserman 2001). \nThe difficulty of inferring injustice from socially caused\ndisadvantage is clear in contexts where greater social provision\nsecures incremental advantage. In such contexts, the question of how\nmuch is just will not always have an obvious answer. For example, it\nwould at least marginally benefit wheelchair-users to have additional\nrestricted parking spaces, but we could hardly infer an injustice from\nthe fact that an institution provided N rather than N +\n1 such spaces. Intuitively, the allotment should be proportionate to\nthe number of wheelchair users in the community or at the facility,\nbut that number may be uncertain, and a range of spaces would likely\nsatisfy any proportionality\n requirement.[1]\n In deciding how many spaces are enough, we would receive no guidance\nfrom the indisputable fact that any disadvantage or advantage in this\ncontext would have social causes. \nConversely, the fact that social arrangements do not cause or\ncontribute to a disadvantage does not insulate it from claims of\njustice; the failure to alleviate that disadvantage may be unjust on\nplausible accounts of justice. Thus, although many\n“natural” disasters like Hurricanes Katrina owe much\nof their destructive impact to social arrangements, it is plausible\nthat the state’s duty to support the victims of hurricanes and\ntsunamis is not contingent on its responsibility for causing or\nexacerbating them (Wasserman\n 2001).[2]\n Indeed, as we discuss below, various forms of luck egalitarianism do\nnot distinguish between disadvantages caused versus merely not\ncorrected by society’s institutions, provided that the relevant\ndisadvantages are equally severe and equally unchosen by those\ndisadvantaged. \nNevertheless, the causal claims made by social-model theorists are\nrelevant to justice in several ways. First, as suggested above, for\nmost theories of justice, the mere fact that the social environment\ncan be modified in ways that alleviate the disadvantages associated\nwith impairment places demands for their alleviation within the scope\nof justice—as claims that a theory of justice must consider and\nweigh. Second, the fact that those disadvantages are caused by social\narrangements is relevant for those theories that regard society as\nhaving a stronger duty not to create or aggravate disadvantages than\nit has to prevent or correct them (Wasserman 2001, Schemmel 2012).\nFinally, alleviating the disadvantages attributable to prejudice or\nstigma will enjoy priority on any theory of justice that treats\ndisadvantage resulting from prejudice or stigma as a greater injustice\nthan innocently-created\n disadvantage.[3] \nBeyond a shared concern with the social causation of disability,\ndifferent versions of the social model emphasize different features of\nthe exclusionary structures and practices (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n The minority group model regards people with impairments as\na stigmatized minority group. It holds that the main reason people\nwith disabilities encounter special hardships is that they face\ndiscrimination akin to that faced by racial or ethnic minorities (Hahn\n1987, Oliver 1990). The human variation model holds that many\nof the challenges faced by disabled people do not result from\ndeliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch between their\ncharacteristics and the physical and social environment (Scotch and\nSchriner 1997). These two versions of the social model differ mainly\nin emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group model\ngenerally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with stigmatized differences. Yet the failure to\nfully accommodate people with various differences, from extreme height\nto intellectual impairment, does not necessarily arise from stigma.\nBut often, disparities in access that were initially caused by\nresource or technological limits are maintained by stigma. For\nexample, an employer’s initial purchase of communications\ntechnology inaccessible to blind or deaf employees may be explained by\nthe fact that accessible technology had not been developed at the time\nof purchase. But those historic facts would not justify the\nemployer’s refusal to include modestly priced accessibility\nfeatures when purchasing upgrades a decade later, for example. \nBoth versions of the social model require the removal of barriers and\npractices serving to exclude people with disabilities, and the\nreconstruction of the environment to more fully include them. Under a\nminority-group model, these measures are dictated primarily by a\ndemand for recognition and respect, and for the correction of past\nexpressions of disrespect found in the knowing exclusion of people\nwith disabilities from many aspects of social, political, and economic\nlife. The human variation model puts less weight on the expressive or\nsymbolic significance of past exclusion. Rather than construing people\nwith disabilities as a “discrete and insular minority”\ncreated by practices of more or less deliberate exclusion, the human\nvariation model construes people with disabilities as simply people\nwho differ in degree from the majority of statistically normal\npopulation with respect to one or more physical or mental\ncharacteristics. The purpose of reconstruction is not so much to end\nspecific exclusionary practices as to create a more inclusive physical\nand social environment. Given this difference in emphasis, it is\nnatural to understand the human variation model as appealing\nprincipally to norms of distributive fairness, ensuring equal or\nadequate access to the physical and social environment, in contrast to\nthe minority group model, which appeals more explicitly to norms of\nrespect and recognition.  \nThe demand for greater inclusiveness is less categorical than the\ndemand to eliminate discrimination. Although any environment can be\nmade more inclusive, none can be fully inclusive for everyone (Barclay\n2010, 2018). This is not necessarily because, as Barclay, following\nShakespeare (2006), claims, the inclusionary features required for one\nimpairment often conflict with those required by another. Such\nconflicts may be minor, temporary, and remediable. The problem is more\ngeneral: 1) for many characteristics, from height to mathematical\naptitude, one “size” does not fit all; 2) providing\ndifferent sizes increases fit for a wider range of variation, but at\nincreasing cost (albeit less than often assumed); and 3) it is\nfrequently impractical, and may arguably be unjust, to ensure that\neveryone is equally well-or ill-fitted; it may, for example, be too\nexpensive to ensure that left-handed or extremely tall individuals\nsuffer no inconvenience in being statistical minorities. Full\ninclusion, like universal design, is an ideal—one that cannot be\nfully achieved, and that must be compromised in the partial\nsatisfaction of other legitimate claims. \nEven if it would be impossible or unreasonable to achieve full\ninclusion through wholesale changes in the physical or social\nenvironment, modest changes could significantly increase inclusion at\nlittle cost. Some examples come from a study of environment\nmodification for autistic individuals (Owren 2013). Some people with\nautism face significant barriers to taking part in routine social\nactivities: they find such familiar stimuli as applause, light\ntouching, and deodorant as highly aversive; they must be explicitly\ninstructed about social expectations because they cannot\n“read” most facial expressions or social clues. The\nstudy’s author recognizes that the “neurotypical\nmajority” cannot be expected to give up applause, light\ntouching, or even deodorant, let alone nuance in communication: \nWhat would be lost? Large parts of what may be some of the most\ntreasured areas of communication: the art of innuendo, the double\nmeaning at the heart of much comedy, irony, the implied meaning at the\nheart of so much poetry,… flirtation and “feeling each\nother out” before committing to something that cannot be\nretracted. (2013: 23-24) \nAt the same time, the author points out that the majority could often\ngain from more modest accommodations.  \nMany neurotypicals might profit from being more explicit and from\nothers being more explicit, as can be illustrated by the extensive\nfocus in couples therapy on getting partners to state their needs and\nexpectations more explicitly, not relying on other to pick up on\n“vaguely described, implied, or unspoken behavioral\nexpectations”. (2013: 92)  \nThe author suggests (2013: 111) that it may be feasible to develop\n“best practices”: “strategies for enhancing\naccessibility and reducing sensory issues in a larger scale”\nwithout unduly burdening the majority: \nOne strategy might be to incorporate into Universal design the\npractice of providing access to low stimulation areas in mainstream\nsettings. Another might be to create more public acceptance of\nautistic behaviors like\n stimming,[4]\n which seem to help many autistic people reduce the impact of aversive\nsensory stimuli.… (2013: 111) \nSuch strategies clearly involve tradeoffs, but those tradeoffs would\ninvolve small economic and social costs for a majority to achieve\nlarge gains in inclusion for a minority. The claim that it is\nimpossible to achieve, or even understand, full inclusion for people\nwith autism does not deny that there is significant injustice in their\ncurrent state of social isolation. \nThe challenges for social models of disability for justice may seem\ngreatest for intellectual and psychiatric impairments, as well as for\ncomplex physical impairments such as fibromyalgia, multiple chemical\nsensitivity, and other conditions that radically and unpredictably\naffect energy, stamina, and functioning (Wendell 1989, 1996; Davis\n2005). First, these conditions strikingly display both aspects of\nimpairment, as markers for stigma and as sources of functional\nlimitation (see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Cognitive and psychiatric impairments evoke some of the strongest\nprejudice and all present some of the most difficult functional\nlimitations, e.g., on the capacities to engage in practical reasoning,\nto recognize the intentions and attitudes of other people, or to\nparticipate in shared activities.Second, some theorists contend that\nthese conditions pose more of a practical challenge for the social\nmodel than even the most severe physical disabilities, in part because\nthe measures required for greater inclusion are not as concrete or\ntangible, and may demand greater imagination to envision and\n implement.[5] \nAlthough significant practical work has been done in educational and\nworkplace inclusion, philosophers have been daunted by the challenge\nof social reconstruction for cognitive disabilities. Thus Jonathan\nWolff, who generally favors such reconstruction—which he calls\n“status enhancement”—as the most respectful\nintervention, asks  \nWhat would it mean to change the world so that people with cognitive\ndisabilities and other people were equally able to find a worthwhile\nplace in the world? Can we even imagine what this would be? (2009a:\n407)  \nMany rights and privileges are thought to require a certain level of\ncognitive capacity, e.g., the right to vote or contract (Wikler 1979).\nSimilarly, most jobs are structured to require regular hours,\nuninterrupted activity, undivided attention, and general\nsociability. \nHow much should a society modify these requirements or restructure\nthese activities to include people with various intellectual,\npsychiatric, and complex physical disabilities? A total relaxation of\nsuch requirements would impose large, even “unduly\nburdensome” costs. However, many modifications to promote the\ninclusion of people with significant cognitive impairments would also\nbenefit people with typical cognitive function: simplified task\nexplanations, warning labels, news copy, and jury instructions. Many\naccommodations employers are already making to increase flexibility\nand reduce stress, from individually-tailored schedules to\ntelecommuting, would ease the entry of people with these disabilities\ninto the workplace. There is a growing body of practical and policy\nwork that applies social models of disability to people with\nintellectual, psychiatric, and complex physical impairments (e.g.,\nBiklen 1992; Block 2006; Connor et al. 2008; Hehir 2002). \nAs discussed later in this Entry, there is sharp disagreement about\nwhether individuals with the most severe intellectual impairments\nqualify as subjects of justice. But even if individuals with the most\nsubstantial intellectual impairments are regarded as subjects of\njustice, what justice demands for them, and of them, may be uncertain\nor disputed. Nussbaum (2009) contends that the equal citizenship of\nthose individuals requires that they be enabled to exercise such\npolitical rights as voting and jury service through appropriate\nsurrogates. Wasserman and McMahan (2012) question whether those rights\ncould be meaningfully exercised by surrogates for individuals with the\nmost severe intellectual disabilities. \nSome philosophical intimation of a social model approach to cognitive\ndisability can be found in Dan Wikler’s 1979 essay,\n“Paternalism and the Mildly Retarded”. Wikler held that\nthe category of cognitive disability was socially constructed by the\ncompetence thresholds set for important social activities, such as\nsigning a contract or voting in an election. But although society\nchooses, in this sense, who will be cognitively impaired, it does not\nhave unlimited flexibility, since there can be significant social\ncosts in altering those thresholds. The issue, Wikler concluded, was\nultimately one of justice; of fairly distributing the burdens of\nsetting thresholds that will be too high for some or too low for\nothers. Yet Wikler questioned whether justice would require, or even\npermit, the kind of modifications necessary for significantly greater\nparticipation. Writing two decades later, Wolff cited Wikler in\nstating,  \nthe fact is that what makes much of modern life possible now relies on\nbinding and enforceable contracts that in turn assume a certain level\nof intellectual competence. To change the world so that such a bar is\nlowered would have tremendous costs. (2009a: 407) \nThis pessimism has prevailed in the years since Wikler wrote, and\nthere has been little philosophical attention to practical\npossibilities for the inclusion of people with cognitive impairments.\nAlthough there have been interesting discussions of this issue in the\ncontext of education (e.g., Howe 1996; Ladenson 2005; Veatch 1986),\nthe general issue has tended to be dealt with in summary fashion.\n(Exceptions include Kittay and Carlson 2010; Hartley 2009a; Silvers\nand Francis 2009; Wong 2007, 2009.) Thus, for cognitive disabilities,\nWolff emphasizes “targeted resource enhancement” rather\nthan status enhancement, arguing for an entitlement scheme that gives\npeople with cognitive disabilities maximum possible control over an\nindividual budget for personal assistance and social support (2009a:\n407–413). He does regard some forms of status enhancement,\nnotably antidiscrimination measures, “as essential”, but\nhe accepts Wikler’s conclusion that broader changes in social\npractice carry “intolerable costs” (2009a: 413). \nIn their influential book From Chance to Choice, Buchanan et\nal. (2000) repeat the assertion that there would be excessive social\ncosts in reconstructing society to permit the full participation of\npeople with significant cognitive impairments. They compare the\nreconstruction of society for greater inclusion with a family decision\nto play only the card games that a young child can understand. They\ncontend that just as adults will tire of a constant game of Go Fish,\nthe society will be “dumbed down” if it refashions itself\nto fully include people with cognitive impairments. \nAlthough the meaning of inclusion is debatable, and different forms of\ninclusion will have differing value for different people, the\ncard-game analogy oversimplifies the challenge. To present inclusion\nas a zero-sum allocation is to dumb down the incredibly complex task\nof rearranging society to respect and nurture all its members. The\nanalogy assumes that every activity must be done by everyone, which is\nfalse. \nA more apt analogy to organized social activity might be an assortment\nof games that can be played by different combinations of people in\ndifferent ways. Some games could be played by everyone; others could\nbe modified to include cognitively impaired people in a way that\npreserved the interest of non-disabled players; some would be beyond\nthe reach of people with certain cognitive impairments. But even the\nmost cognitively gifted individuals could not participate in all\ngames—the sheer amount of training and practice required to\nmaster some of them, and the considerable time and energy many of them\nrequire, would preclude participation in many or most. Indeed, society\nmay function better if people have varying aptitudes for, and\ninterests in, different activities. (A similar criticism of the\ncard-game analogy is offered by Wong (2007), who recounts how her\nbrother with Down enriched rather than impoverished family life.) The\nfact that a smaller set of activities may be available to people with\ncognitive impairments need not present a problem, if it does not\nresult in their social isolation or deny them intellectual challenges\n(Parens & Asch 2000: 25–26 [quoting Philip Ferguson,\npersonal correspondence]). But ensuring their participation may\nrequire society to refashion itself in significant ways. \nIt is not clear that such refashioning would impose the\n“intolerable costs” feared by Wolff. Social inclusion does\nnot require, for example, that individuals with significant cognitive\nimpairments be able to make binding contracts in every domain of law\nand business; it requires that competence standards be graduated to\nreflect the complexity of specific tasks so that those individuals are\nnot categorically excluded –a suggestion made more than two\ndecades ago by the authors of the card-game metaphor (Buchanan and\nBrock 1990). Social model theorists know full well that\nimpairments—physical as well as cognitive—differ from skin\ncolor in that they are sometimes relevant to what people can do, as\nare such other attributes as education and income. But that feature of\nimpairment hardly precludes social reconstruction. Indeed, the most\neffective rebuttal to the card-game metaphor may be found in the\npractical work that already has been done in educational and workplace\ninclusion (e.g., Biklen 1992; Block 2006; Hehir 2002; McGuire et al.\n2006). At the same time, it bears emphasis that the social model of\ndisability was originally conceptualized in terms of physical\ndisabilities. And there may be significant limitations on the extent\nto which it applies to cognitive disabilities. More generally,\nalthough it may be useful to speak of “the” social model\nof “disability”, the diversity of impairments that fall\nunder the extension of “disability” suggests that the\naptness of the social model in any given context will vary depending\non the nature of the impairments at issue. \nAs suggested in\n §1,\n the disabling impact of social arrangements may be relevant to the\ntype and scope of interventions that justice requires. In stressing\nthe impact and the malleability of the environment, social-model\ntheorists have shifted the focus from claims for correction and\ncompensation to claims for reconstruction. \nConsider a society with much greater height variation than our own.\nEven if very tall or short stature was neither stigmatized nor\nfunctionally limiting, that society would, on any plausible theory of\njustice, be obliged to construct its public spaces, buildings, and\nvehicles to accommodate them. They would be treated unjustly if the\nconstruction of the physical environment took no account of them,\nespecially if the failure to do so caused them significant\ndisadvantage. Of course, the extent to which their height differences\nneeded to be taken into account would depend on the distribution of\nheight in the society, as well as on its level of resources and\ncompeting needs. No plausible theory of justice would require that the\nbuilt environment be equally accommodating to all heights, if such a\nthing were possible, but all would condemn some environments as\nunjustly restrictive. What even this simple case suggests is that the\ndemand for a more inclusive environment need not be seen in terms of\ncompensating individuals, tall or impaired, for their internal\ndeficits, but of accommodating as wide as possible a range of human\nvariation. \nEven if environmental reconstruction should not be seen as\ncompensating for deficits, a question remains about the extent to\nwhich it should be seen as a matter of redistribution or recognition.\nThis question is raised by the legal requirement of “reasonable\naccommodation”. Under the ADA and ADAAA,\n“accommodations” include ramps, elevators, texts in\nmultiple formats, sign-language interpreters, flexible work schedules,\nand job coaches or assistance. The failure to make reasonable\naccommodation for disabled employees or users of public facilities\nconstitutes, with some notable exceptions, discrimination (ADA 1990).\nThere is no reference to that concept in the laws banning\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or age; the term was\nintroduced in cases addressing claims of religious discrimination\n(see, e.g., Karlan and Rutherglen 1996). Like practitioners of\nminority religions, but unlike women, people of color, or older\npeople, people with disabilities must be “reasonably\naccommodated”. \nFor the human variation model, reasonable accommodation requires\nchanges in the physical and social environment, from installing ramps\nto modifying work schedules and altering the location of meetings and\nclasses. Often, such changes require little more than flexibility and\nimagination. But some of these changes can be expensive; at some\npoint, the cost may make further change unreasonable. On this\napproach, the legislative understanding of such accommodation as a\nmatter of distributive justice is reflected in the qualifying use of\n“reasonable” and the exemption of accommodations that\nwould impose an “undue” burden or hardship on the entity\nrequired to make accommodations (Wasserman 1998).  But it is also possible to see reasonable accommodation as a\nrequirement of equality for people with disabilities without recourse\nto a theory of distributive justice (e.g., Crossley 2004; Karlan and\nRutherglen 1996). Accommodating religious practices may be expensive\nin various ways, but no one regards doing so either as compensating\nreligions for their deficits. Indeed, such a rationale would appear to\nviolate the state’s constitutionally-mandated neutrality among\nreligions. Rather, because the state is required to treat religions\nand their adherents with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2003), it\ndisfavors rules and practices that interfere with religious\nobservance. Somewhat similarly, a state that regards people with\ndisabilities with equal respect and concern will disfavor arrangements\nthat interfere with their participation.  With respect to both groups,\nsubstantive equality may require unequal provisions. In the case of\ndisability as well as religion, how much additional provision is\nrequired is indeterminate, not for lack of a complete theory of\njustice to specify the amount or proportion, but because the demands\nof equal respect are indeterminate. \nConsider, for example, the question of how much it is reasonable for a\nsmall business to spend on an elevator or ground-floor space to be\nable to employ a talented IT technician with emphysema. To answer that\nquestion, we might do better to decide what respect for that person\ndemands, based in part on current social practice and convention,\nrather than to consult a comprehensive but abstract theory of\ndistributive justice. In any case, it may be unreasonable to expect a\ndeterminate answer; it may be appropriate to rely on a fair procedure\nto select among a range of plausible outcomes. But by the same token,\nthe utter lack of accommodation in many workplaces and public\nfacilities is clearly unjust on any plausible theory of justice. \nThe debate over the accommodations available for a minority group may\noften reflect a complex mix of claims concerning redistribution and\nrecognition. For example, people in wheelchairs are sometimes provided\nrestaurant access only through the service entrance. The restaurant\nowners often claim that such access is quite reasonable, since the\nservice entrances already have ramps—a distributive\nconsideration. Disability advocates claim that however convenient it\nmay be for the owners, such access treats wheelchair users as\nsecond-class customers—a claim of misrecognition. In this case,\nit may seem that the recognition claims clearly trump the conflicting\ndistributional claims. But this will not always be the case. \nAgain, resolving such conflicts may involve the same kind of judgment\nemployed in debates over accommodating minority religious practices.\nIt may be that some jobs cannot be made available to people whose\nSabbath falls on Friday or Saturday, because (in light of demographic\nconsiderations) the essential functions of those jobs require working\non those days. But although the “essential function”\nstandard appears objective and determinate, it is often subject to\ndistributive considerations, e.g., about staffing requirements and\nbusiness volume. A refusal to sustain the slightest loss of revenue to\naccommodate any minority religion might be a distributive injustice; a\nwillingness to sustain greater losses to accommodate Jewish and\nAdventist employees than Muslim ones might involve misrecognition as\nwell—the failure to treat Islamic practice as having the same\nvalue as other religious practices. Similarly, the violation of the\nADA involved in refusing to display the same flexibility for disabled\nas for pregnant employees arguably constitutes both distributive\ninjustice and misrecognition. \nThe uncertainty about the distributive character of reasonable\naccommodation suggests that in the case of disability, it may often be\ndifficult to sharply distinguish claims for redistribution and\n recognition.[6]\n Recognition may require redistribution, and redistribution should aim\nat securing recognition. Asch (1989) has gone even further, arguing\nthat recognition must precede redistribution; that if people with\ndisabilities were recognized as equals, capable of significant\ncontributions to others, society would be more willing to adopt\nappropriate measures for redistribution and reconstruction. \nThe resurgence of philosophical interest in justice is often dated to\nthe publication of John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice in\n1971. Although that was only two years before the passage of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, embodying a social model of disability\n(see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience),\n it was well before the academic reconceptualization of disability as\na social phenomenon. For the 25 years after A Theory of\nJustice, many justice theorists tacitly accepted the medical\nmodel (e.g., Dworkin 1981a,b; Daniels 1985). They treated disability\nas a physical or mental limitation of the individual, the principal\ncause of disability-related disadvantage. Disability thus posed a\nproblem for justice theories based on mutual advantage, hypothetical\nagreement, or material or social equality. People with disabilities\ndid not appear to offer reciprocal advantages; they complicated the\ntask of reaching a hypothetical agreement on the basic structure of\nsociety; and they made the goal of equality seem impossibly\ndemanding. \nBy the late 1990s, some mainstream political philosophers were\nbecoming acquainted with social models of disability, and some\ndisability theorists were gaining a hearing among political\nphilosophers. Some philosophers sought to modify distributive theories\nof justice to take account of the social and environmental character\nof disability; others cited the failure of those theories to take\nappropriate account of disability as one reason to reject exclusively\ndistributive approaches. \nBefore describing these developments, it is useful to distinguish two\ntypes of distributive theories. Modern social contract theories,\nnotably Rawls’ (1971), seek to determine the fair terms of\nsocial cooperation to which individuals (generally with limited\nknowledge of their own situations) would agree; they argue that\ncertain distributive principles would be among those terms\n(Rawls’ “difference principle” may be the most\nfamiliar). Rawlsian theories are procedural in one sense: they regard\nany distribution as just if and only if it is consistent with the\ndistributive principles that would be chosen by those individuals.\nDisability-oriented criticism of these theories has focused on their\nassumptions about the individuals who are eligible to make a\nhypothetical contract or participate in the cooperative scheme it\nestablishes. Critics have argued for the eligibility of people with\ndisabilities or their representatives to participate in the\ncontract-making processes and resulting cooperative scheme more than\nabout the validity of the principles or rules yielded by that process\n(Richardson 2006; Silvers and Francis 2005; Stark 2007). The second\ntype of theory is primarily interested in outcomes; in the kind of end\nstate a just society should strive for: either equality on some\noutcome metric or the reduction of certain kinds of inequality. Here,\ndisability-informed criticism has favored outcome metrics that take\naccount of the social contribution to disability-related disadvantage,\nand standards for just distributions that are oriented toward\ndisrespectful inequalities (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006a; Wolff\n2009b). \nWithin social contract theories, a distinction is often drawn between\ncontractarian/Hobbesian and contractualist/Lockean accounts (see SEP\nentry on\n contractarianism).\n One way to characterize this distinction is in terms of the\nparties’ motivation and interaction. In the former, they are\nnarrowly self-interested and hard-bargaining; in the latter, their\nself-interest is tempered or balanced by their commitment to\njustifying themselves to others, and they proceed by deliberating\nrather than by bargaining. This distinction is often formulated in\nterms of a distinction between (merely) rational agents, and\n“reasonable” agents. \nA Rawlsian approach might seem more congenial than a Hobbesian\napproach to people with disabilities. It derives the basic structure\nof society from a hypothetical choice situation, the Original\nPosition, in which a veil of ignorance precludes reliance on the\ncontractors’ actual limitations—limitations that a\nHobbesian contractor might ruthlessly (albeit rationally, if not\nreasonably) exploit (cf.\n note 10).\n Although the parties themselves are motivated exclusively by\nconsiderations of self-interest, which Rawls understands in terms of\nthe fulfillment of two higher-order interests (see SEP Entry on\n the original position),\n the informational constraints of the Original Position compel the\nparties to motivate as if they are reasonable, at least in\nthe sense that it compels them to be impartial between the claims of\nall who will be subject to the principles they choose. \nBut even if Rawlsian contractors do not know their specific\nlimitations, they do know that they, or the individuals they\nrepresent, are not permanently disabled. Rawls stipulated that the\nidealized society whose “basic structure” was the subject\nof hypothetical agreement was restricted to members who would be\n“fully-cooperating” over the course of their adult lives.\nRawls assumed that this restriction would exclude people with severe\nand permanent physical and mental disabilities (Rawls 1993:\n18–20). He did not defend that assumption, nor provide for the\nrepresentation of those people in the process by which the basic\nstructure of society is to be determined. Instead, he consigned their\nfate to the later, legislative phase. Rawls also restricted\nparticipation in the Original Position to those with two “moral\npowers”: the capacity to form and revise one’s own\nconception of the good; and the capacity for a sense of justice, the\ncapacity to act on and apply fair terms of cooperation\n(ibid.). It is doubtful that these powers can be attributed\nto people with the most severe intellectual and psychiatric\nimpairments, although some philosophers and disability scholars have\nargued that a just society should treat all human beings as having the\npotential to develop such functioning (Wong 2007, 2009). \nDisability scholars have been particularly critical of these\neligibility conditions for the Original Position. If the deliberators\nin the Original Position do not believe that they could be\nrepresenting, or could turn out to actually be, people with\n“severe and permanent” disabilities when the veil is\nlifted, they will have no prudential reason to choose a basic\nstructure for their society that will provide for the inclusion of\nthose people. Indeed, insofar as such measures would impose costs on\npeople with non-disabilities, the parties will have prudential reasons\nnot to support such measures, since doing so would undermine\nthe interests of people whom they know they could represent (the\nable-bodied on whom the costs are imposed) for the sake of those whom\nthey explicitly know they don’t represent (the disabled for whom\nthe costs are imposed). \nSeveral philosophers sympathetic to the Rawlsian framework have\nsuggested modifications that would give people with disabilities a\ngreater and more direct role in the social contracting process. Some\nhave argued that the “full cooperation” requirement, and\nthe kind of reciprocity it involves, can be liberally interpreted so\nas not to exclude most people with significant physical disabilities\n(Hartley 2009b; Stark 2009). Henry Richardson has gone even further,\nmaintaining that “Rawls’ arguments making use of the\ndevice of the [Original Position] do not essentially depend on any\nreciprocity premise” (2006: 427). He examines modified versions\nof the Original Position that drop the assumption that no one has\nsevere and permanent disabilities. He contends that with such\nmodifications, the Original Position can yield principles more\nsensitive to disability concerns about the continuous nature of\nabilities, the stigmatization resulting from false dichotomization,\nand the exclusion of severely disabled human beings. \nIn response, Martha Nussbaum (2006b: 490–498) concedes that\nRichardson’s proposed reconstruction of Rawls would largely\navoid the exclusionary features of the OP to which disability scholars\nhave objected. But she argues that this reconstruction is a more\nradical departure from Rawls than Richardson acknowledges. She\nsuggests that the theory loses its contractual character if it\ndispenses, per Richardson, with the reciprocity requirement and the\nassumption that the contractors have roughly equal physical and mental\npowers. \nRawls’ “moral powers” condition has posed further\nproblems. Harry Brighouse (2001) observes that modifying the\ncooperation requirement still excludes those whose cognitive\nimpairments preclude their possession of the two moral powers. Sophia\nWong (2009, 2007) argues that those powers can be acquired by people\nwith severe intellectual impairments, with adequate social support.\nLeslie Francis (2009) and Anita Silvers (Silvers and Francis 2009)\ncontend that many individuals with severe cognitive impairments can\ncollaborate with others to construct individualized, authentic\nconceptions of the good. Silvers and Francis (2005) and Christie\nHartley (2009a) also maintain that people with severe intellectual\nimpairments can be represented adequately in a contracting process\nthat consists in trust-building more than hard bargaining, even if\nthey cannot participate in it personally. \nOthers have argued that exclusion from the Original Position need not\nadversely affect people with disabilities or treat them with\ndisrespect. Adam Cureton (2008) argues that the exclusion of people\nwith severe disabilities from the Original Position is just part of\nits idealization, and does not diminish the urgency or priority of\ntheir claims. Cynthia Stark (2007) proposes lifting the\nfull-cooperation requirement to include people with disabilities at\nthe second stage of Rawlsian deliberation, where the society’s\nconstitution is established and where the hypothetical decision makers\nacquire some knowledge about the resources, development level, and\nother characteristics of their society. \nThe plausibility of these responses to Rawls depends to some extent on\nwhich version of the Original Position we consider. Rawls made a\nchange in his presentation of the Original Position in his\nRestatement (2001) that is especially pertinent to people\nwith cognitive disabilities. He emphasized that the participants in\nthe Original Position are representatives of people in the future\nsociety, not people living in the future society denied knowledge of\ntheir social position. If representatives were made to take into\naccount the possibility that those they represent might be disabled,\nthis might help to ensure that the interests of the disabled were\nrepresented. It would only do so, however, if the contractors have the\nability to imagine the very different embodiments of people with a\nvariety of disabilities, an ability feminist critics of Rawls have\nquestioned with respect to men representing women (Young 1990;\nBenhabib 1992; Okin 1994). The strictly representational role of\nparticipants in the Original Position would also avoid the conflict of\ninterest faced by cognitively unimpaired individuals representing\nthemselves and cognitively impaired individuals. \nMore broadly, philosophers have varied widely in their optimism about\nthe prospects for including people with disabilities in contractarian\nor contractualist deliberations. On the one hand, Lawrence Becker\n(2005) suggests that even selfish, hard-bargaining contractarians (his\n“tough crowd”) would accept an expansive notion of\n“reciprocity”, one that would ensure adequate provision\nfor people with disabilities in the scheme of social cooperation they\nadopt. Their acceptance of reciprocity would arise from recognition of\nthe needs and vulnerabilities they and their loved ones have or will\nlikely acquire. That recognition places a premium on social provisions\nfor health.  \nEven for the tough crowd, health is now ripe for inclusion in the list\nof basic goods. And it may be that a robust social commitment to\nhealth will address questions of justice for the disabled—as\nlong as we are careful to include fundamental aspects of psychological\nhealth (i.e., those associated with active rational agency….\n(2005: 35)  \nMembers of the tough crowd may not be so careful, however. Indeed,\nsome may not even regard “active rational agency” as a\nmatter of health as they more narrowly construe it, with an emphasis\non physical survival and comfort. In contrast to Becker, Eva Kittay\n(1999) holds that even the most liberal interpretation of Rawls’\nscheme will not be sufficiently responsive to the egalitarian concerns\nthat motivate his theory. Rawls’ assumption that the\nparticipants in the original position are or represent fully\nproductive members of society neglects the fact of pervasive,\ninevitable human dependency. “[T]hose within relationships of\ndependency fall outside the conceptual perimeters of Rawls’\negalitarianism” (1999: 79). \nAnother debate within contractarian theories that has particular\nrelevance to disability concerns the scope of justice itself: Is\njustice concerned only with the distribution of social goods, or also\nwith the rectification of “natural inequalities” (Pogge\n1989: 44–47). Pogge (1995) argues that in the Original Position,\nit would be irrational for parties to ignore the contribution of\nnatural advantages to the well-being (understood in terms of the\nfulfillment of the two “higher-order interests”) of\nprospective citizens, since from that standpoint, it is just as bad to\nbe disadvantaged by uncompensated disabilities as it is to be\ndisadvantaged (to the same degree) by a small share of social primary\ngoods. But Pogge claims that attempting to eliminate those\ninequalities would go beyond the scope of justice. Some philosophers\nargue, however, that many natural inequalities are within the scope of\njustice, and that health care to mitigate them is a requirement of\njustice (Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000). \nOther philosophers and disability scholars would deny that the\ninequalities associated with impairments can be regarded as\n“natural” (Amundson 1992; Wasserman 2001). In questioning\nthe very notion of “natural inequalities”, they join a\nbroader philosophical debate about whether it is possible to draw a\ncoherent distinction between natural and artificial or social\ninequalities (see Lippert-Rasmussen 2004; Nagel 1997; Pogge 2004a,b;\nAas and Wasserman,\n 2016).[7]\n Even if such a distinction can be plausibly drawn, it may turn out\nthat many or most inequalities in abilities are artificial: as with of\nobsolete skills, those inequalities may be largely attributable to the\nphysical and social environment (Bickenbach 1993). \nOther distributive theories of justice take a less procedural approach\nthan Rawls. They are directly concerned with the kinds of outcomes a\njust society should pursue. These theories differ in the outcome\nmetrics they adopt—the “currency” of distributive\njustice (Cohen 1989). Some adopt a resource metric (Dworkin 1981b);\nstill others, a metric based on opportunities for welfare (Arneson\n1989) or access to advantage (Cohen 1989). Finally, capability\ntheories assess outcomes not only by the goods or resources that\npeople have, but also by what people are able to do with what they\nhave (Nussbaum 1990; Sen 1980). Such outcome-oriented theories may be\nmore or less demanding, depending on whether they require equality or\nmerely priority for the worst-off, and on whether they support\nequality of a sort that may not require the significant redistribution\nof goods or resources. \nThe most prominent family of outcome-oriented approaches has been\ncalled “luck egalitarianism” (see, for example, Arneson\n2000; Dworkin 2003; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015). According to the dominant\ncharacterization of that position, its central claim is that it is\nunjust when there are unfair inequalities in the distribution of\n“brute luck”—an advantage or disadvantage with\nrespect to the relevant metric that is not attributable to an\nindividual’s fault, choice, or assumption of risk. “Option\nluck”, in contrast, refers to an advantage or disadvantage an\nindividual acquires through the foreseeable consequences of his or her\nactions. The stronger versions of luck egalitarianism (e.g., Dworkin\n81b) deny that any inequality resulting from option luck generates\nclaims of justice. On those versions, only some disabilities generate\njustice claims—those that resulted from brute bad luck (e.g.,\ncongenital impairments)—whereas others, which may involve the\nsame or greater disadvantage, do not, simply because they resulted\nfrom a free choice (e.g., reckless pastimes or an unhealthy\nlifestyle). \nSome philosophers have taken these implications as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of luck egalitarianism (Anderson 1999), and they would\nno doubt be rejected by many writers on health care, who have\nquestioned the moral and policy relevance of individual responsibility\n(Cavallero 2011; Feiring 2008; Galvin 2002; Wikler 1987). The greater\nconcern for disability scholars may be with the conflation of\ndisadvantages resulting from unchosen impairments with disadvantages\nresulting from unchosen social conditions under the one heading of\n“bad brute luck”. Luck egalitarianism does not, as\nsuch, provide any principled rationale for distinguishing between\nequally severe setbacks to the well-being of people with disabilities\nthat result from the “bad luck” of being born in a society\nwith disability discrimination and the “bad luck” of being\nborn with an intrinsically disadvantageous set of physical\nabilities. Both are equally unchosen from the individual’s\nstandpoint, and it is individual responsibility, rather than some\ncombination of individual and collective responsibility, that\ndetermines whether a given disadvantage generates a valid justice\ncomplaint. This is not to deny that luck egalitarianism can be\nsupplemented to account for the intuition that the “bad\nluck” of being born in a disabling environment (Fine and Asch\n1988) differs morally from less socially mediated forms of bad luck,\nas we will see in our discussion of the capabilities approach. \nThe implications of outcome-oriented theories for disability depend on\ntwo features of those theories. The first is the metric, or\n“currency” of justice they adopt—welfare, resources,\nprimary goods, or capabilities. The second is the distributive\nstandard they impose—strict equality, priority for the worse\noff, or merely some minimum for everyone (sufficientarianism). We will\nconsider these two features in order, although they are sometimes\nintertwined. \nRawls and other social contract theorists adopted a broad outcome\nmetric for assessing the comparative advantage of the individual in a\nsociety: “social primary goods”, which include\nopportunities, basic liberties, income, and the social bases of\nself-respect. This breadth is intended to achieve neutrality between\ncompeting substantive conceptions of the good, since the social\nprimary goods are construed as “all-purpose means” that\nare valuable to have irrespective of the content of one’s\nparticular conception of the good. For many disability scholars, the\ndifficulty in this approach does not concern its neutrality, but its\nfailure to take account of the environment in which those goods must\nbe utilized, which may profoundly affect their value to those\nreceiving them. Two persons might be alike in their share of social\nprimary goods, and have similar projects, aims, commitments, and\nvalues, but nonetheless differ in the value they can derive from those\ngoods, if one person is disabled and the other is not. As we shall see\nbelow, the capabilities approach takes into account this objection,\nwhen the difference between the uses to which each person can put her\nprimary goods is construed as the result of differences in\n“internal resources”, or the rate at which the individual\ncan convert resources to “functionings”. \nA failure to take adequate account of the environment may also be\nfound in directly-egalitarian resource-based approaches. Dworkin\n(1981a,b), for example, appears to take the social environment for\ngranted in proposing a hypothetical division of resources into\nindividual bundles. Giving people with impairments equal material\nshares in a society like our own would hardly satisfy the demands of\nequality in a physical and social environment designed exclusively for\npeople with standard endowments. Dworkin is aware of the problem, but\nhis solution is to adjust individual shares to include insurance\npayouts against poor environmental fit, rather than to redesign the\nenvironment to reduce inequalities in fit. To that degree, Dworkin\nappears to tacitly assume a medical model of disability, according to\nwhich limitations resulting from impairments are solely attributable\nto the impairment itself, and, if not correctable, compensable only by\nthe redistribution of resources to people with such impairments. Such\ncompensation may ensure survival, but it does little to enhance or\nequalize participation, and may in fact hinder participation if\nAnderson (1999) is right that compensating for disabilities expresses\ndisrespect. Moreover, the size of the insurance payout for a given\ndisability is determined by the amount by which able-bodied people\nwould be willing to insure themselves against the prospect of\nincurring that disability. Insofar as the judgments of able-bodied\npeople don’t always track the intuitively relevant facts about\ndisability-related disadvantage, such an approach threatens to\n“bake in” flawed assumptions about the experience of\ndisability into its account of just entitlements for people with\ndisabilities (Bodenheimer 1997a,b). \nSeveral alternatives for assessing outcomes for purposes of political\nand social equality seem more responsive to the disabling role of the\nsocial environment. The most familiar and influential of these\nalternatives is the capabilities approach, developed in different ways\nby Martha Nussbaum (2006a) and Amartya Sen (1980). Their accounts are concerned\nnot only with the resources an individual has but also with what she\ncan do with them; with her “capability” of engaging in a\nnumber of valuable “functionings”, such as forming\nintimate relationships and having rich sensory and aesthetic\nexperiences. \nNussbaum’s earlier formulations of the capabilities placed\nconsiderable emphasis on species-typical functioning. For example, she\ninitially treated “the exercise of the five senses” as a\nnecessary constituent of human flourishing. More recent formulations\nare more congenial to social models of disability, in part because of\nNussbaum’s encounter with disability scholarship. She now makes\nroom for the social contribution to “natural” deficits\n(see Wasserman 1998; Terzi 2009), recognizing that most capabilities\nbear only a contingent, environmentally-mediated relationship to\npeople’s “natural endowment”. She abstracts from\ndifferences between people with impaired and normal limb function to\nfind a common claim to the means of moving about from place to place.\nSuch means may be architectural, vehicular, mechanical, or prosthetic;\nthey may involve making places more accessible or making the\nindividual more mobile. Similarly, a person lacking sight or hearing\ncan achieve aesthetic satisfaction by other means; a person with\nintellectual impairments can participate in activities structured to\ninclude individuals of varying cognitive skills. An individual with\nemphysema could increase his capacity for affiliation and control over\nthe material environment (two capabilities from Nussbaum’s\n2006a list) not only by\nmeasures to increase his lung capacity but also by measures to\nincrease his access to social and business venues through better\ntransit and architectural design. \nNussbaum’s broader framing enables her to recognize the\nprospects for flourishing of people with severe impairments. The\nplausibility of the capabilities approach for disability critics of\ndistributive accounts lies in the way the capabilities are\nindividuated. A basis for individuation might be found in a\ncomprehensive account of human nature and human flourishing, such as\nthe Aristotelian account that informs Nussbaum’s work. As Becker\nnotes, however, such a comprehensive account would have limited appeal\nin justifying a distributive scheme in a pluralistic society (2005:\n35). Despite its promise, considerably more work is needed to clarify\nher approach. Another feature of Nussbaum’s theory that some\ndisability theorists find congenial is her incorporation of\nrecognition and respect into her set of basic capabilities. Thus, the\ncapability for “affiliation” encompasses not only\nintimacy, but self-respect and dignity; the capability for\n“control over the environment” includes both the material\nand political environments. \nLess ambitiously than Nussbaum, Jonathan Wolff (2009b) classifies\nequality-enhancing measures for people with disabilities by the extent\nto which they address recognition as well as redistribution. Thus, the\nindividual limitations of people with disabilities can be addressed\nwith either cash compensation or “personal enhancement”,\nmedical, surgical, or rehabilitative measures to correct those\nlimitations. “Targeted resource enhancement” offers an\nintermediate option, which tries to improve the fit of the individual\nand the environment with a range of restricted resources such as\npersonal assistance and assistive technology. Finally, “status\nenhancement” alters the built environment and social practices\nto reduce the impact of individual differences in abilities on social\nequality. Wolff generally favors status enhancement as the most\nrespectful intervention, because it shapes the environment to the\nneeds of all members of society. It is also the most stable\nintervention, because it protects the social equality against sudden\nchanges in individuals’ levels of functioning. \nAlthough Wolff does not adopt the device of hypothetical decision\nmaking to justify a preference for status enhancement, that preference\ncould be underwritten by a suitably modified Original Position. As\nRichardson (2006) suggests, hypothetical decision makers who know that\nthey may represent individuals with severe impairments are more likely\nto be concerned with capabilities than with primary goods, since the\nlatter by themselves may be of limited value to those they represent.\nFurther, those decision makers would recognize that capabilities often\ncan be increased more respectfully, as well as more effectively, by\nstatus enhancements than by other measures. \nYet doubts remain about the extent to which concerns about\nrecognition, respect, and social equality can be captured in any\noutcome metric of individual well-being, however broad. Thus,\nChristian Schemmel (2012) argues that the treatment of people as\nequals must be understood in terms of respectful relationships among\nindividuals and institutions, and that the presence of such\nrelationships cannot plausibly be regarded in what Pogge (2004a,b)\ncalls “recipient-oriented” terms, as components of\nindividual well-being. The moral significance of respectful treatment\nis neither exhausted by, nor derivative of, its contribution to\nindividual well-being. As Schemmel argues (2012: 19), people may need\nsome forms of affiliation to flourish but do not necessarily require\nsocial and political equality for their own well-being. The\nplausibility of these claims depends to some extent on how narrow or\nbroad a conception of well-being one adopts. A conception that\nencompasses virtually all that a person has reason to care about will\nmore easily accommodate social equality and respectful\nrelationships. \nTwo approaches seek to moderate the ambitions of distributive justice\nin ways that may be more inclusive of people with disabilities. One\ntakes the end-state of justice not as equality or priority but\nsufficiency: it requires that every member of society reach some\nminimum in the appropriate “currency”. This approach,\nlabeled “sufficientarian” by one critic (Arneson 2006), is\nsuggested but not endorsed by Nussbaum, and it serves to make\ncapabilities a less demanding metric for distributive justice.\n(Nussbaum notes that certain capabilities must be distributed equally\nif anyone is to have a sufficient level of them, e.g., voting rights.)\nThe requirement that a just society ensure that every citizen reaches\na minimum level of each capability may be far less demanding than the\nrequirement of equal capabilities. One way of setting the minimum\nappeals to the requirements for participation in a democratic society\n(Gutmann 1987; Anderson 1999). \nAlthough sufficientarian approaches claim to make the demands of\njustice less oppressive, they have been criticized as demanding both too\nmuch and too little. They demand too much if the minimum for every\ncapability must be met in the face of recalcitrant impairments or\nenvironments. They demand too little if attaining the minimum could\nstill leave the individual with a miserable life (Arneson 2006;\nWasserman 2006; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007). Those approaches have also\nbeen criticized for lacking a mechanism for prioritizing capabilities\n(Wolff and de-Shalit 2007) and for assessing whether the minimum has\nbeen reached for any one capability (Riddle 2010). Clearly, the extent\nto which justice is achievable on such approaches for people with\nsevere disabilities will depend on where the minimum is set, how its\nsatisfaction is assessed, and how the capabilities are defined. \nA second approach would replace equality on a specific metric of\nadvantage with social equality or equality of respect (Anderson 1999;\nMiller 1999; Norman 1997, 1999). This approach would involve a more\nradical departure from luck egalitarianism than a sufficiency account,\nsince it does not lower the standard for a just distribution so much\nas propose a non-distributive standard for justice. That standard\nwould see justice in terms of recognition rather than, or as well as,\nredistribution. Although this approach may demand strict equality of a\nsort, it is a sort that does not appear to set determinate\ndistributive requirements. A society of social equals, abounding in\nmutual respect, can arguably tolerate significant disparities in\nwelfare, resources, opportunities, or capabilities. \nUnderlying this approach is the more fundamental distinction between\nrelational and distributive theories of justice. Although this\ndistinction can be drawn in different ways (see, e.g.,\nLippert-Rasmussen 2015, Fourie et al. 2015), it identifies two\ncritical dimensions of justice. One concerns how well-off individual\npeople are, both absolutely and in comparison to each other. The other\nconcerns the kinds of social relationships people stand in to one\nanother. As discussed in\n §4.3,\n it is a difficult question to what extent either dimension of justice\ncan be reduced to, or expressed in terms of, the other. \nAgainst the claim that relational justice can be understood as an\ninstance of distributive justice, one may observe that at least with\nrespect to equality, there seems to be an important\nstructural difference between two people standing in some\nrelation to some third thing (i.e., some good) to the same\ndegree and two people standing in some relation to one\nanother to the same degree (e.g., the relation of being\nrespected, recognized, and so on). Insofar as interpersonal equality\nhas a different structure when construed as relational, it is a\nmistake to think that it can be reduced to a species of distributive\nequality, for “equal” means something different in each\ncase. For example, it is one thing for any two people in society to\nhave equal respect from others; it is a different thing for\nany two people in society to have equal respect for one\nanother. This distinction is relevant to debates about disability\nin particular, because one way to understand the social model is in\nterms of the relational view—its core insight is that disability\nis not a one-place property of individuals, defined in terms of some\nwelfare deficit, but an n-place relation between individuals (n>2)\ndefined by stigmatizing or excluding attitudes, dispositions,\npractices, and forms of treatment. \nSome of these issues have taken center-stage in a recent debate over\nthe expressive significance of different measures to remediate the\ndisadvantages associated with disability. Pogge (2002) and Anderson\n(1999) have claimed that it is disrespectful to attribute a\nperson’s disadvantage to features of his or her natural\nendowment because it treats her as needy, deficient, or inferior. For\nthis reason, they argue against justifying redistributive measures to\nachieve inclusion on the grounds that they correct natural\ninequalities in skills, talents, or the ability to convert resources\ninto welfare. Instead, they contend that such measures can and should\nbe justified as redressing discrimination, and conversely, that\nfailures to achieve inclusion should be recognized as unjustly\ndiscriminatory. \nBarclay (2010, 2018) challenges the argument that a claim for\nredistribution treats the claimant as deficient or inferior. Such\nclaims need only recognize that some traits are less suited than\nothers for specific environments—a contingency that does not\nimply the intrinsic superiority or inferiority of a given endowment.\nShe thus questions those (e.g, Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000) who\nclaim that certain characteristics or traits are universally valuable,\nsuch that an individual who lacked them would be deficient in any\nenvironment. Although she tends to see the environment as fixed rather\nthan malleable, Barclay argues that the project of achieving inclusion\nis best seen in terms of maximizing individuals’ environmental\nfit. Achieving that fit may require expending more resources for some\nindividuals than others in any given environment. The demands made by\nvery tall or left-handed people for greater accommodation do not\npresuppose their inferiority, only their minority status (see\n §2,\n infra). These comparisons suggest that the demands for accommodation\nof people with such statistically atypical features differ merely in\ndegree, not kind, from those made by people with various\nimpairments. \nEven if compensation for disadvantage need bit be demeaning, however,\nspecific grounds for compensation may well be. Laws and policies that\ncompensate people simply because they are disabled, or have a specific\ndisability, may be objectionable because of the social meaning of\ndisability-compensation. Compensation that is based on the medical\nclassification of disability may reinforce the humanity-obscuring\nstereotype of “the cripple” as helpless and pitiable. This\ngrave threat to social equality should make us wary of drawing\ndistributive implications from the claim that disability is a\n“bad difference” rather than a “mere difference\n“(see entry, “Disability: Well-Being, Health, and Personal\nRelationships”). Even if disability in general, or specific\ndisabilities, were bad differences, that would hardly imply that\nindividuals who had (those) disabilities were entitled to compensation\nsimply by virtue of that fact. \nThere are many categories or groups into which people can place\nthemselves, and be placed, on the basis of their varying\ncharacteristics. The salience and appeal of these categories depend on\nsocial and historical context as well as individual preferences and\nvalues. Identity and identity politics become important as members of\nhistorically excluded groups challenge their status and work for\ninclusion. Many women gained a sense of group identity in opposing\nlaws that limited voting and other political rights to men; racial\nidentities have been forged in the fight against segregation. Although\npeople with disabilities are not always understood as sharing an\nidentity, their awareness of membership in an oppressed group has been\nshaped by exclusionary laws and customs, from “ugly laws”\nprohibiting people with physical deformities from appearing in public\nto the state-sponsored involuntary sterilization of “mental\ndefectives”. A sense of group identity has been further\nencouraged by welfare, social security and other laws that place\npeople with various disabilities in a single category, even if they\ndefine that category in different ways. \nThe importance of disability as a social category was increased by the\nmovement to establish civil rights for people with disabilities. As in\nthe case of other stigmatized groups, the characteristics used as a\nground for exclusion became a basis for mobilization and a source of\npride. The social model of disability, which informed the movement for\ndisability rights, emphasized what people with various impairments\nhave in common—their stigmatization and exclusion—and\nthereby promoted the emergence of disability as a powerful social\nidentity. \nCritics like Fraser argue that the importance of social identity\ncannot be adequately captured in any metric of individual advantage.\nAn effective social response to stigmatized identities requires both\nrecognition and transformation—changes in cultural framing and\nsocial perception that are poorly served by redistribution. An\nemphasis on redistribution is often self-defeating, exacerbating\nstigma and reinforcing the impression of the stigmatized group as\ndeficient (Fraser 1995, 1997; see Olsen 2001). Yet as we will discuss, some\nways of transforming social identity have significant dangers as\nwell. \nFor proponents of recognition, one issue is whether justice requires\nnot only respect for individual members of society, but also respect\nfor their group or cultural identities. Must a just society recognize\n“group-specific cultural identity” or merely “the\nstatus of group members as full partners in social interaction”\n(Fraser 2001: 23, 24)? Are these separate requirements, or does\nrespect for an individual entail respect for her social or cultural\nidentities? These questions have been addressed primarily with respect\nto religious, ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. Very little work\nhas been done on the question of what a disability identity would look\nlike and what sorts of recognition claims it would implicate. \nA somewhat parallel issue has been raised in distributive\njustice—must society allocate resources, broadly construed, to\nsupport the group and cultural identities of its members? That support\ncould be based on the claim that such identities are a constituent,\nperhaps an irreducible one, of the well-being of the individual\nmembers of society. This claim has been suggested by justice theorists\nwho argue for the importance of culture as a “context of\nchoice” for individuals (e.g., Kymlicka 1989, Sparrow 2005). An\nindividual deprived of a culture through which he has experienced and\ninterpreted the world will find it far more difficult to flourish. As\nwe will discuss, however, it is doubtful that disability in general,\nor particular impairments, play such a comprehensive role in the lives\nof many—let alone all—people with\n disabilities.[8] \nWe begin by describing the different characteristics of an\nindividual’s “identity”. One sense of this term is\nthat of numerical identity over time: what makes some person at time\nt1 the same person as the person at time t2? (see SEP entry on\n identity over time).\n This is, in the first instance, a metaphysical question and not our\ninterest here. A different sense of “identity” refers to\nthose characteristics that make one the particular person one is, as\njudged both by oneself and by others. This includes narrative,\nbiographical, and practical identities. It is less about criteria for\nsameness over time and more about the constitutive or defining\nfeatures of one’s self- (or social) conception. This is the\nsense of “identity” we will be concerned with. \nThe sense of individual identity most directly relevant to respect and\nrecognition is arguably that of practical identity. Following\nKorsgaard (1996, 2009), we can understand a practical identity to be a\ndescription under which a person values herself, where valuing oneself\ninvolves treating oneself as a source of reasons. For example, someone\nwho identifies as a mother in this sense values herself under the\ndescription “mother” and for that reason treats the fact\nthat she is a mother as a source of (normative practical) reasons.\nMoreover, to “drop” this identification is not like\ndropping a desire or short-term goal. It involves changing one’s\nsense of who one is as a person and what gives one’s life\nvalue. \nOn this view, a person’s practical identities should be\nnormatively significant for other people as well. For one thing, many\nof a person’s significant interests are derived from\nher practical identities. Since it is uncontroversial that respect and\nconcern require giving appropriate weight to the interests of others,\nit follows that respect and concern require giving appropriate weight\nto other people’s practical identities, at least insofar as they\ngenerate (legitimate) interests. In addition, respecting a\nperson’s practical identities plausibly falls under a more\ngeneral requirement of respect for personal autonomy. Personal\nautonomy is a foundational value of liberal democracies, whose laws\nand policies do not require individuals to organize their lives around\nany particular identity, but rather give them the latitude to make of\ntheir identities what they will (Appiah 2005; Appiah and Gutmann 1996;\nsee also the SEP entry on\n identity politics).\n This can be seen as a part of liberalism’s broader commitment\nto neutrality about conceptions of the good (e.g., Rawls 1993). \nThese issues become especially charged if we move from individual to\ngroup identities, bringing us closer to the question of disability\nidentities. As K. Anthony Appiah points out, though individual\nidentity is different from group identity, it nevertheless has a\ncollective or social dimension (Appiah 2005: 21). For example,\nPalestinians living in the West Bank have a distinct collective\nidentity. This is different from, though certainly compatible with,\nsome specific West Bank resident having as part of his individual\nidentity being a\n Palestinian.[9]\n It is important to bear this distinction between individual and\ncollective identities in mind, because the latter, to a greater extent\nthan the former, is imposed or “ascribed” by the larger\nsociety rather than chosen by the individual. \nBeing disabled, like being a member of a minority race, subjects one\nto particular treatment. But one can experience that treatment without\nfeeling compelled to regard one’s disability or minority status\nas part of one’s individual identity in the practical sense of\nbeing a description under which one values oneself. Often, having a\ndisability identity ascribed to one, like having a racial identity\nascribed, consists in part in being the object of, and provides an\nexcuse for, discriminatory, demeaning or degrading treatment of\nvarious sorts. This is so both for people whose impairments are\nimmediately observable and for those whose impairments are hidden but\nsubject to exposure and ridicule by a temporary change in appearance,\ne.g., a person with epilepsy who has a seizure in public (Schneider\nand Conrad 1985; more generally, Davis 2005). And since this social\nidentity is often part of one’s individual identity, such\ntreatment is likely to be injurious to the self-respect of the one\nwith this identity, and in that sense constitute an instance of\nmisrecognition. Ironically, the fact of being unfairly stereotyped can\nitself shape the identities of those who are treated in this way, as\nAppiah notes, even if initially they did not identify strongly with\nthe group in question. \nDesirable change with respect to social identities is possible in at\nleast two ways. First, even if some important aspects of one’s\nself are not chosen—say, the fact that one has paraplegia or\ndeafness—how central they are to one’s self-conception,\nhow much they matter to one’s interests and plans, is to some\nextent within one’s voluntary control. On some views, notably\nKorsgaard’s, reflective endorsement of an identity is a\nnecessary condition of its being normative for the agent, i.e.,\nproviding reasons for her. At the same time, the extent to which\none’s identifications are voluntary depends on the constraints\nof the social environment. One cannot simply decide to make\none’s disability a less salient feature of one’s\nbiographical identity, at least, especially if one’s disability\nis not “hidden”. If the identity is ascribed, and\nemphasized, by the larger society, it may be difficult to reduce its\nimportance in one’s own practical reasoning. But one still has\nsome choice about whether to accept or resist that emphasis. \nSecond, there can be a change in the valence of the label, as\nthere has been with the term “queer”: what was once a\nnegative label, accompanied by unjust treatment of various sorts, can\nbe transformed into a positive label and championed as a source of\nself-respect and pride for those who share in the collective identity.\nJohn Lawson discusses how special education for disabled children,\nonce seen as a major factor in the creation of a negative,\nsecond-class identity, can be transformed into “sites for the\npositive promotion of disability as a cultural identity” (Lawson\n2001: 203–21). Neither sort of change—in identification or\nvalence—can be accomplished without struggle, personal as well\nas political, but partial success is sometimes achievable. \nEven if disability is not and does not have to be a central component\nof every disabled person’s identity, this does not negate the\nsignificance of disability as an organizing principle of political\naction. But when the social and political recognition of disability\nbecomes the objective of political action, as it is in identity\npolitics, it gives rise to the “dilemma of difference”\n(Minow 1990). Consider special education for children: On the one\nhand, labeling a child “disabled” risks stigmatizing and\nisolating the child. In this sense, to be “different” is\nto be inferior. Alternatively, being labeled “disabled” is\na way for parents to secure attention to the child’s particular\nways of learning and functioning. In this sense, to be\n“different” is to be entitled to appropriate educational\nassistance. \nThe dilemma may not be insurmountable. The movement for universal\ndesign in education aims to refashion classrooms and teaching\npractices to encourage the participation of all students. To the\nextent that the movement is successful, it will minimize the need for\n“special education” (Biklen 1992; Gartner and Lipsky 2002;\nLipsky and Gartner 1996). Law and public policy must think creatively\nabout ways to solve this dilemma so that the stigma they seek to\neliminate is not in effect reinforced. Success in resolving the\ndilemma of difference may reduce the importance of disability identity\nfor justice. If disability is simply a characteristic to be taken\naccount of in social arrangements, it could become as significant or\ninsignificant as height or aptitude. \nThere are at least two other risks for an identity politics of\ndisability. One involves the danger of assuming that the members of a\nparticular marginalized group all share the same culture, be it\nAfrican-American culture or disability culture. This assumption is not\nrequired by a mature identity politics, but it may be encouraged by\nefforts to mobilize diverse individuals around a single identity. Two\nconsiderations may help to resist this tendency. First, we must\nrecognize that culture is a complex concept, and that defining it is\nno easy task. Second, we must recognize that on any plausible\ndefinition, people with the same disability (let alone different\ndisabilities) need not share a common culture. There are some examples\nof a shared disability culture: Deaf culture is perhaps the best\nknown. But many people who are deaf, particularly those who do not\nsign, do not identify as Deaf or take part in Deaf culture (Tucker\n1997[10]\n And even for those who participate, Deaf culture does not appear to\nbe the kind of “encompassing” or\n“comprehensive” culture claimed by Kymlicka, Margalit, and\nRaz to provide a “context of choice” for its\n members.[11] \nThe second, related risk involves privileging one identity over\nothers. This is especially important for people with multiple or\n“intersectional” identities. People who are\nAfrican-American and disabled, or female and disabled, or disabled and\nLGBT may sometimes feel a conflict between those identities. In one\nstudy, for example, African-American women with mobility impairments\nreported that they felt estranged from the disability-rights movement,\npartly because its leadership seemed predominantly white, and partly\nbecause some of its principal goals—to maximize\nindependence—went against their more communal values, which\nemphasized family and co-dependence (Feldman and Tegart 2003). More\ngenerally, although there has been comparatively little discussion of\nthe intersection between disability and race within philosophical work\non disability (though see Stubblefield 2009), more discussion can be\nfound in disability studies more generally (e.g., Bell 2011). Also,\nsome have noted that mainstream feminism’s focus on independence\nand self-sufficiency has tended to exclude women with disabilities,\nwho are perceived as lacking in these cardinal virtues (Crawford and\nOstrove 2003; Wendell 1996). At the same time, disabled women are\noften particularly vulnerable to the injustices that motivate the\nfeminist movement: they are frequently victims of sexual exploitation\n(Crawford and Ostrove 2003), encounter many obstacles to leaving\ndissatisfying relationships because of physical, psychological and\nfinancial dependency (Olkin 2003), and have median incomes below the\npoverty line and substantially lower than those of their male\ncounterparts (Crawford and Ostrove 2003; Olkin 1999). \nIn addition to these potential risks associated with emphasizing\nidentity politics for persons with disabilities and other stigmatized\nminorities, there have been several major challenges in mobilizing\npeople with disabilities around an affirmative group or cultural\nidentity. The first, addressed by the disability rights movement, was\ngetting people with disabilities to recognize that they have something\nin common with others who are differently impaired but also suffer\nstigma and exclusion because of their impairment. This has been\ndifficult because people who are born with disabilities or acquire\nthem in childhood come from widely dispersed socioeconomic, geographic\nand racial groups (Scotch 1988) and so are less likely to grow up with\na sense of group identity. Another obstacle has been the\noverwhelmingly negative connotation of the label\n“disabled”. Indeed, the challenge for people with visual,\nmotor, and psychiatric impairments has been to recognize that they\nshare a “disabled” identity while denying that this makes\nthem dependent, child-like, or powerless (Asch 1985; Scotch 1988);\nsuch a self-identity would quite literally disable\none’s capacity for social participation and political\naction. \nIt is instructive to compare how the medical and social models would\naddress these challenges. The medical model suggests a disability\nidentity that is both fragmented and negative. Because the medical\nmodel defines disability in terms of particular physical or mental\nimpairments, the primary commonalities it recognizes among disabled\npeople are strictly functional; it views the blind person and the deaf\nperson as having very different problems. Although it could recognize\nthe fact that such biomedically distinct conditions had similar social\nconsequences—stigmatization and exclusion—it would treat\nthose similar consequences merely as secondary effects of the two\nconditions. Even within a single impairment, a medical model\nencourages distinctions based on etiology. For example, it would\ndistinguish blindness due to Leber’s congenital amaurosis from\nblindness due to retinaopathy of prematurity, focusing on genetic\ntesting for the former and treatment for the latter, and placing less\nemphasis on the shared challenges of living with blindness. Although\nthis narrow focus may be appropriate for the purposes of clinical\nintervention, it obscures the recognition of disability as a social\nand political problem, except insofar as it raises perennial questions\nabout how to distribute scarce health-care resources (Barnartt et al.\n2001). \nIn contrast, the various social models were explicitly formulated to\nsupport a disability identity that could serve as the basis for claims\nof respect and recognition. The inclusion of people with a vast array\nof different impairments in United States and other national civil\nrights laws, and the creation of the United Nations convention on the\nrights of persons with disabilities, have helped to forge a shared\ndisability identity. The emergence of disability studies as a\nrecognized field of academic inquiry has also contributed. The\nminority group model promotes a trans-impairment identity by treating\npeople with disabilities as a “discrete and insular\nminority” making claims on a generally stigmatizing able-bodied\nmajority. Though the minority group model has proven extremely useful\nin passing anti-discrimination laws, it may do so at the expense of\nemphasizing the differences between people with disabilities\nand people without them, rather than highlighting the many ways in\nwhich identity need not be tied to the presence or absence of an\nimpairment. The human variation model tempers this emphasis, and\nresists essentialism about disability identity, by treating the group\nitself as socially constructed. It sees the category of “the\ndisabled” as resting on an artificial dichotomy imposed on a\ncontinuum of variation. The conceptualization of disability as just\none source of difference, and as a difference in kind more than\ndegree, can undercut a sense of disability as the basis for a unique\nand exclusive identity. \nThe more the redesign of the physical and social environment is guided\nby a thoroughgoing human-variation model, the less dominant disability\nidentity and identity politics may become for people with\ndisabilities. A society in which disabilities lack the social and\npractical significance they currently have may be one in which the\nequality of people with disabilities can be fully recognized without\nhaving to treat disability as a salient feature of their\nidentities. \nIt may be, though, that the physical, sensory, or psychic experience\nof a particular impairment turns out to be central and salient to how\nthose with the impairment live—even in a society deeply\ncommitted to inclusion, participation, and non-discrimination. Perhaps\ncommunicating primarily gesturally and not vocally, or moving through\nthe world with wheels and not on legs, or focusing on detail rather than context, makes the lives of people who are deaf, or\nparalyzed, or autistic sufficiently distinctive that they feel a\nstrong affinity and connection with others who have the same\nimpairment (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for a discussion of this claim.) Disability theorists who adopt\ndifferent social model approaches might profitably consider how\ndifferent views about group and individual identity apply to people\nwith disabilities. \nThe connection between different models of disability and different\nways of understanding disability identity points us in the direction\nof an important category of injustice, in addition to the distributive\nand relational conceptions already discussed. This is epistemic\ninjustice (Fricker 2007; Barnes, 2016). Epistemic injustice\nconsists in a person’s being wronged in her capacity as an\nepistemic subject. Testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nknowledge, while hermeneutical injustice consists in\nsomeone’s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nunderstanding. More specifically, testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone’s testimony being given less credence than the evidence\nwarrants due to prejudice on the part of the hearer, while\nhermeneutical injustice consists in someone’s experiences being\nobscured from individual and collective understanding due to wrongful\nexclusion from the practices by which those understandings are\ngenerated. Both have clear implications for disability, justice, and\nidentity. \nFor example, consider the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\nto assess the prospective benefits of health care interventions. The\nstandard method of “quality adjustment” involves (i)\nassigning a value of 1 to each life-year one can reasonably expect to\nsave through a given intervention, and (ii) discounting each life-year\nthat would be lived by a person with a disability by some coefficient\n(between 0 and 1) which is thought to reflect the badness of living\nwith the disability in question. These coefficients are typically\narrived at by asking people how many years of life with the\ndisability people would be willing to exchange for each year of life\nwithout the disability. For example, suppose survey data\nindicate that people would trade 8 years of life with blindness for 4\nyears of life with sight. The method of quality-adjustment would\nassign a QALY of 0.5 to each year of life lived with blindness. The\nupshot is that saving nondisabled life-years provides more “bang\nfor your buck” in the QALY model, and as such is to be preferred\nto saving disabled life-years. \nThis implication has led some to criticize the method of\nquality-adjustment on the grounds that it produces a kind of\n“double jeopardy:” people with disabilities are\ndisadvantaged twice-over, first by having the disability itself,\nsecond by having their health care needs discounted for that very\nreason (e.g., Singer et al. 1995; Bognar 2011; John et al. 2017). But\nthere is another way of thinking about QALYs which takes issue with\nboth quality-adjustment and an assumption behind the double-jeopardy\ncriticism. When the “exchange rate” between disabled and\nnon-disabled life-years is calculated, it is primarily or exclusively\nbased the judgments of able-bodied people. This feature is\ncriticizable on two distinct grounds. One is that it disrespects the\nfirst-person authority of people with disabilities, who know\nfirst-hand what it’s like to have the disability in question\n(and, if disabled as adults, know also what it’s like\nnot to have the disability). This disrespect for first-person\nauthority is plausibly an example of testimonial injustice, at least\ninsofar as it reflects prejudicial or otherwise biased attitudes on\nthe part of the able-bodied. A second, related criticism is that this\napproach exaggerates the difference in quality between able-bodied and\ndisabled lives, relative to an approach that appropriately\nincorporated and weighed the perspectives of people with disabilities.\nAble-bodied people often overestimate how bad it would be to have a\ngiven disability, given popular stereotypes which depict life with\ndisability as tragic, occlusive of life’s major goods, and so\non. This is plausibly an example of hermeneutical injustice, insofar\nas the poor understanding of disabled people’s experiences and\nidentities results from their exclusion from the public sphere. This\nis only one example; much work remains to be done exploring the\nimplications of epistemic injustice for people with disabilities. \nThis entry began by pointing out a feature of disability that\ndistinguishes it from other characteristics which have often been seen\nas grounding legitimate claims of justice, such as race, sex, sexual\nand gender identity, and religion. Simply put, achieving full\ninclusion for people with disabilities is expensive to a\ndegree that achieving full inclusion for other minorities is not. Any\nplausible theory of inclusion implies the necessity of considerable\naccommodation and environmental reconstruction. And even if the costs\nof such measures have often been exaggerated, it is difficult to see\nhow the appropriate degree of accommodation and reconstruction would\nnot require diverting significant amounts of resources from other\nworthy goals, including some goals which are supported by\ncountervailing considerations of justice. One implication of this\nfeature of disability is that disability requires us to directly\ncompare, and perhaps trade off, values of relational justice, which\nground the demand for full inclusion as part of a society of equals,\nand values of distributive justice, which ground the demand for a fair\ndistribution of scarce resources.  \nHaving made this general point, the entry proceeded to discuss\ndifferent models of disability, which differ principally in their\nunderstanding of the relationship between impairment and limitation.\nWhereas the medical model of disability tends to attribute most of the\nlimitations associated with disability to functional aspects of the\nrelevant impairments, the social model of disability emphasizes the\nmediating role of the social environment—broadly understood to\ninclude the configuration of physical space, the availability of\nvarious forms of accommodation, social practices and norms,\netc.—in generating disability-related disadvantage. Among other\nthings, the social model highlights the relational aspects of\ndisability-related disadvantage, such as stigma, invisibility, and\nexclusion, whereas the medical model lends itself to a narrow\ndistributive interpretation of the claims of justice generated by\ndisability. \nIn subsequent sections, the entry focused on the role of disability in\ncontractualist and other distributive theories of justice. Disability\nhas often been regarded as a “limit case” for\ncontractualist theories of justice, and more specifically for the\nidealizing assumptions these theories make about the capacities of\nthose who choose and those who are governed by contractualist\nprinciples of justice. We also saw that disability has played a\ncentral role in discussions of outcome-oriented, distributive theories\nof justice, in particular luck egalitarianism. Internally, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the\n“currency” of justice, since it has often been seen as a\nparadigm example of unchosen disadvantage. Externally, disability has\nplayed a central role in relational criticisms of luck egalitarian\ntheories of justice. At best, these theories have been seen as failing\nto attribute normative significance to morally relevant differences\nbetween identical patterns of distribution which differ in the causal\ncontribution of the social environment. At worst, these theories have\nbeen criticized for expressing disrespect towards people with\ndisabilities in virtue of characterizing them as “mere”\nunfortunates or objects of pity. Although some of these criticisms may\nbe overstated, they have been taken to heart by many theorists of\ndistributive justice, especially proponents of the capabilities\napproach. Finally, the entry concluded by pointing to a topic which\nhas received far less attention in discussions of disability and\njustice: namely, the normative significance of disability as a form of\nsocial identity, and the connections between disability and epistemic\ninjustice. \nThis entry raises a number of questions which would benefit from\nfurther exploration. Clearly, one general question is how exactly to\nunderstand the distinction between distributive and relational values\nof justice. Another, related question is how to assess the comparative\nweight or importance of these values. And if, as many find plausible,\nsome form of pluralism about justice is the correct answer, then we\nwill need to work out how the relevant trade-offs, weights, and so on\napply to the special case of disability, which simultaneously raises\nboth distributive and relational concerns. A third question which\ncalls for further research is the link between disability and\nepistemic injustice. We briefly discussed two examples of testimonial\nand hermeneutical injustice concerning people with disabilities, but\nthere are—needless to say—many more. Indeed, disability\nmay be an especially powerful example of epistemic injustice precisely\nbecause the phenomenological experiences of people with disabilities,\nespecially those with sensory impairments, differ considerably\nfrom the experiences of the able-bodied majority, raising the hard\nquestion of how well we must understand others in order to treat them\nas justice requires.","contact.mail":"jblustein@ccny.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"ccny.cuny.edu"}]
