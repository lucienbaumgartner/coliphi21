Since quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter\nthat is currently available, it is a legitimate question to ask\nwhether quantum theory can help us to understand consciousness.\nSeveral approaches answering this question affirmatively, proposed in\nrecent decades, will be surveyed. There are three basic types of\ncorresponding approaches: (1) consciousness is a manifestation of\nquantum processes in the brain, (2) quantum concepts are used to\nunderstand consciousness without referring to brain activity, and (3)\nmatter and consciousness are regarded as dual aspects of one\nunderlying reality. Major contemporary variants of these\nquantum-inspired approaches will be discussed. It will be pointed out\nthat they make different epistemological assumptions and use quantum\ntheory in different ways. For each of the approaches discussed, both\nproblematic and promising features will be highlighted.\n\nThe problem of how mind and matter are related to each other has many\nfacets, and it can be approached from many different starting points.\nThe historically leading disciplines in this respect are philosophy\nand psychology, which were later joined by behavioral science,\ncognitive science and neuroscience. In addition, the physics of\ncomplex systems and quantum physics have played stimulating roles in\nthe discussion from their beginnings. \nAs regards the issue of complexity, this is evident: the brain is one\nof the most complex systems we know. The study of neural networks,\ntheir relation to the operation of single neurons and other important\ntopics do and will profit a lot from complex systems approaches. As\nregards quantum physics, there can be no reasonable doubt that quantum\nevents occur and are efficacious in the brain as elsewhere in the\nmaterial world—including biological\n systems.[1]\n But it is controversial whether these events are efficacious and\nrelevant for those aspects of brain activity that are correlated with\nmental activity. \nThe original motivation in the early 20th century for relating quantum\ntheory to consciousness was essentially philosophical. It is fairly\nplausible that conscious free decisions (“free will”) are\nproblematic in a perfectly deterministic\n world,[2]\n so quantum randomness might indeed open up novel possibilities for\nfree will. (On the other hand, randomness is problematic for\ngoal-directed volition!) \nQuantum theory introduced an element of randomness standing out\nagainst the previous deterministic worldview preceding it, in which\nrandomness expresses our ignorance of a more detailed description (as\nin statistical mechanics). In sharp contrast to such epistemic\nrandomness, quantum randomness in processes such as the spontaneous\nemission of light, radioactive decay, or other examples has been\nconsidered a fundamental feature of nature, independent of our\nignorance or knowledge. To be precise, this feature refers to\nindividual quantum events, whereas the behavior of\nensembles of such events is statistically\ndetermined. The indeterminism of individual quantum events is\nconstrained by statistical laws. \nOther features of quantum theory, which became attractive in\ndiscussing issues of consciousness, were the concepts of\ncomplementarity and entanglement. Pioneers of quantum physics such as\nPlanck, Bohr, Schrödinger, Pauli (and others) emphasized the\nvarious possible roles of quantum theory in reconsidering the old\nconflict between physical determinism and conscious free will. For\ninformative overviews with different focal points see e.g., Squires\n(1990), Kane (1996), Butterfield (1998), Suarez and Adams (2013).  \nVariants of the dichotomy between mind and matter range from their\nfundamental distinction at a primordial level of description to the\nemergence of mind (consciousness) from the brain as an extremely\nsophisticated and highly developed material system. Informative\noverviews can be found in Popper and Eccles (1977), Chalmers (1996),\nand Pauen (2001). \nOne important aspect of all discussions about the relation between\nmind and matter is the distinction between descriptive and\nexplanatory approaches. For instance, correlation is\na descriptive term with empirical relevance, while causation\nis an explanatory term associated with theoretical attempts to\nunderstand correlations. Causation implies correlations between cause\nand effect, but this does not always apply the other way around:\ncorrelations between two systems can result from a common cause in\ntheir history rather than from a direct causal interaction. \nIn the fundamental sciences, one typically speaks of causal relations\nin terms of interactions. In physics, for instance, there are four\nfundamental kinds of interactions (electromagnetic, weak, strong,\ngravitational) which serve to explain the correlations that are\nobserved in physical systems. As regards the mind-matter problem, the\nsituation is more difficult. Far from a theoretical understanding in\nthis field, the existing body of knowledge essentially consists of\nempirical correlations between material and mental states. These\ncorrelations are descriptive, not explanatory; they are not causally\nconditioned. It is (for some purposes) interesting to know\nthat particular brain areas are activated during particular\nmental activities; but this does, of course, not explain why\nthey are. Thus, it would be premature to talk about mind-matter\ninteractions in the sense of causal relations. For the sake of\nterminological clarity, the neutral notion of relations between mind\nand matter will be used in this article. \nIn many discussions of material [ma] brain states and mental [me]\nstates of consciousness, the relations between them are conceived in a\ndirect way\n (A): \nThis illustrates a minimal framework to study reduction,\nsupervenience, or emergence relations (Kim 1998; Stephan 1999) which\ncan yield both monistic and dualistic pictures. For instance, there is\nthe influential stance of strong reduction, stating that all\nmental states and properties can be reduced to the material domain or\neven to physics\n (physicalism).[3]\n This point of view claims that it is both necessary and sufficient to\nexplore and understand the material domain, e.g., the brain, in order\nto understand the mental domain, e.g., consciousness. It leads to a\nmonistic picture, in which any need to discuss mental states is\neliminated right away or at least considered as epiphenomenal. While\nmind-brain correlations are still legitimate though causally\nirrelevant from an epiphenomenalist point of view, eliminative\nmaterialism renders even correlations irrelevant. \nMuch discussed counterarguments against the validity of such strong\nreductionist approaches are qualia arguments, which emphasize the\nimpossibility for physicalist accounts to properly incorporate the\nquality of the subjective experience of a mental state, the\n“what it is like to be” (Nagel 1974) in that state. This\nleads to an explanatory gap between third-person and first-person\naccounts for which Chalmers (1995) has coined the notion of the\n“hard problem of consciousness”. Another, less discussed\ncounterargument is that the physical domain itself is not causally\nclosed. Any solution of fundamental equations of motion (be it\nexperimentally, numerically, or analytically) requires to fix boundary\nconditions and initial conditions which are not given by the\nfundamental laws of nature (Primas 2002). This causal gap applies to\nclassical physics as well as quantum physics, where a basic\nindeterminacy due to collapse makes it even more challenging. A third\nclass of counterarguments refer to the difficulties to include notions\nof temporal present and nowness in a physical description (Franck\n2004, 2008; Primas 2017). \nHowever, relations between mental and material states can also be\nconceived in a non-reductive fashion, e.g. in terms of emergence\nrelations (Stephan 1999). Mental states and/or properties can be\nconsidered as emergent if the material brain is not necessary or not\nsufficient to explore and understand\n them.[4]\n This leads to a dualistic picture (less radical and more plausible\nthan Cartesian dualism) in which residua remain if one attempts to\nreduce the mental to the material. Within a dualistic scheme of\nthinking, it becomes almost inevitable to discuss the question of\ncausal influence between mental and material states. In particular,\nthe causal efficacy of mental states upon brain states\n(“downward causation”) has recently attracted growing\ninterest (Velmans, 2002; Ellis et al.\n 2011).[5]\n The most popular approaches along those lines as far as quantum\nbehavior of the brain is concerned will be discussed in\n Section 3,\n “Quantum Brain”.  \nIt has been an old idea by Bohr that central conceptual features of\nquantum theory, such as complementarity, are also of pivotal\nsignificance outside the domain of physics. In fact, Bohr became\nfamiliar with complementarity through the psychologist Edgar Rubin\nand, more indirectly, William James (Holton 1970) and immediately saw\nits potential for quantum physics. Although Bohr was also convinced of\nthe extraphysical relevance of complementarity, he never elaborated\nthis idea in concrete detail, and for a long time after him no one\nelse did so either. This situation has changed: there are now a number\nof research programs generalizing key notions of quantum theory in a\nway that makes them applicable beyond physics. \nOf particular interest for consciousness studies are approaches that\nhave been developed in order to pick up Bohr’s proposal with\nrespect to psychology and cognitive science. The first steps in this\ndirection were made by the group of Aerts in the early 1990s (Aerts\net al. 1993), using non-distributive propositional lattices\nto address quantum-like behavior in non-classical systems. Alternative\napproaches have been initiated by Khrennikov (1999), focusing on\nnon-classical probabilities, and Atmanspacher et al. (2002),\noutlining an algebraic framework with non-commuting operations. The\nrecent development of ideas within this framework of thinking is\naddressed in\n Section 4,\n “Quantum Mind”. Other lines of thinking are due to Primas\n(2007, 2017), addressing complementarity with partial Boolean\nalgebras, and Filk and von Müller (2008), indicating links\nbetween basic conceptual categories in quantum physics and\npsychology. \nAs an alternative to (A), it is possible to conceive mind-matter\nrelations indirectly\n (B),\n via a third category: \nThis third category, here denoted [mame], is often regarded as being\nneutral with respect to the distinction between [ma] and [me], i.e.,\npsychophysically neutral. In scenario (B), issues of reduction and\nemergence concern the relation between the unseparated\n“background reality” [mame] and the distinguished aspects\n[ma] and [me]. \nSuch “dual aspect” frameworks of thinking have received\nincreasing attention in contempory discussion, and they have a long\ntradition reaching back as far as to Spinoza. In the early days of\npsychophysics, Fechner (1861) and Wundt (1911) advocated related\nviews. Whitehead, the modern pioneer of process philosophy, referred\nto mental and physical poles of “actual occasions”, which\nthemselves transcend their bipolar appearances (Whitehead 1978). Many\napproaches in the tradition of Feigl (1967) and Smart (1963), called\n“identity theories”, conceive mental and material states\nas essentially identical “central states”, yet considered\nfrom different perspectives. Other variants of this idea have been\nsuggested by Jung and Pauli (1955) [see also Meier (2001)], involving\nJung’s conception of a psychophysically neutral, archetypal\norder, or by Bohm and Hiley (Bohm 1990; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Hiley\n2001), referring to an implicate order which unfolds into the\ndifferent explicate domains of the mental and the material. They will\nbe discussed in more detail in\n Section 5,\n “Brain and Mind as Dual Aspects”.  \nVelmans (2002, 2009) has developed a similar approach, backed up with\nempirical material from psychology, and Strawson (2003) has proposed a\n“real materialism” which uses a closely related scheme.\nAnother proponent of dual-aspect thinking is Chalmers (1996), who\nconsiders the possibility that the underlying, psychophysically\nneutral level of description could be best characterized in terms of\ninformation. \nBefore proceeding further, it should be emphasized that many\npresent-day approaches prefer to distinguish between first-person and\nthird-person perspectives rather than mental and material states. This\nterminology serves to highlight the discrepancy between immediate\nconscious experiences (“qualia”) and their description, be\nit behavioral, neural, or biophysical. The notion of the “hard\nproblem” of consciousness research refers to bridging the gap\nbetween first-person experience and third-person accounts of it. In\nthe present contribution, mental conscious states are implicitly\nassumed to be related to first-person experience. This does not mean,\nhowever, that the problem of how to define consciousness precisely is\nconsidered as resolved. Ultimately, it will be (at least) as difficult\nto define a mental state in rigorous terms as it is to define a\nmaterial state. \nIn this section, some popular approaches for applying quantum theory\nto brain states will be surveyed and compared, most of them\nspeculative, with varying degrees of elaboration and viability.\n Section 3.1\n addresses three different neurophysiological levels of description,\nto which particular quantum approaches refer. Subsequently, the\nindividual approaches themselves will be discussed —\n Section 3.2:\n Stapp,\n Section 3.3:\n Vitiello and Freeman,\n Section 3.4:\n Beck and Eccles,\n Section 3.5:\n Penrose and Hameroff.  \nIn the following, (some of) the better known and partly worked out\napproaches that use concepts of quantum theory for inquiries into the\nnature of consciousness will be presented and discussed. For this\npurpose, the philosophical distinctions A/B\n (Section 2)\n and the neurophysiological distinctions addressed in\n Section 3.1\n will serve as guidelines to classify the respective quantum\napproaches in a systematic way. However, some preliminary\nqualifications concerning different ways to use quantum theory are in\norder. \nThere are quite a number of accounts discussing quantum theory in\nrelation to consciousness that adopt basic ideas of quantum theory in\na purely metaphorical manner. Quantum theoretical terms such\nas entanglement, superposition, collapse, complementarity, and others\nare used without specific reference to how they are defined precisely\nand how they are applicable to specific situations. For instance,\nconscious acts are just postulated to be interpretable\nsomehow analogously to physical acts of measurement, or correlations\nin psychological systems are just postulated to be\ninterpretable somehow analogously to physical entanglement. Such\naccounts may provide fascinating science fiction, and they may even be\nimportant to inspire nuclei of ideas to be worked out in detail. But\nunless such detailed work leads beyond vague metaphors and analogies,\nthey do not yet represent scientific progress. Approaches falling into\nthis category will not be discussed in this contribution. \nA second category includes approaches that use the status quo\nof present-day quantum theory to describe neurophysiological and/or\nneuropsychological processes. Among these approaches, the one with the\nlongest history was initiated by von Neumann in the 1930s, later taken\nup by Wigner, and currently championed by Stapp. It can be roughly\ncharacterized as the proposal to consider intentional conscious acts\nas intrinsically correlated with physical state reductions. Another\nfairly early idea dating back to Ricciardi and Umezawa in the 1960s is\nto treat mental states, particularly memory states, in terms of vacuum\nstates of quantum fields. A prominent proponent of this approach at\npresent is Vitiello. Finally, there is the idea suggested by Beck and\nEccles in the 1990s, according to which quantum mechanical processes,\nrelevant for the description of exocytosis at the synaptic cleft, can\nbe influenced by mental intentions. \nThe third category refers to further developments or\ngeneralizations of present-day quantum theory. An obvious\ncandidate in this respect is the proposal by Penrose to relate\nelementary conscious acts to gravitation-induced reductions of quantum\nstates. Ultimately, this requires the framework of a future theory of\nquantum gravity which is far from having been developed. Together with\nPenrose, Hameroff has argued that microtubuli might be the right place\nto look for such state reductions.  \nA mental system can be in many different conscious, intentional,\nphenomenal mental states. In a hypothetical state space, a sequence of\nsuch states forms a trajectory representing what is often called the\nstream of consciousness. Since different subsets of the state space\nare typically associated with different stability properties, a mental\nstate can be assumed to be more or less stable, depending on its\nposition in the state space. Stable states are distinguished by a\nresidence time at that position longer than that of metastable or\nunstable states. If a mental state is stable with respect to\nperturbations, it “activates” a mental representation\nencoding a content that is consciously perceived. \nMoving from this purely psychological, or cognitive, description to\nits neurophysiological counterpart leads us to the question: What is\nthe neural correlate of a mental representation? According to standard\naccounts (cf. Noë and Thompson (2004) for discussion), mental\nrepresentations are correlated with the activity of neuronal\nassemblies, i.e., ensembles of several thousands of coupled neurons.\nThe neural correlate of a mental representation can be characterized\nby the fact that the connectivities, or couplings, among those neurons\nform an assembly confined with respect to its environment, to which\nconnectivities are weaker than within the assembly. The neural\ncorrelate of a mental representation is activated if the neurons\nforming the assembly operate more actively, e.g., produce higher\nfiring rates, than in their default mode. \nFigure 1. Balance between inhibitory and\nexcitatory connections among neurons. \nIn order to achieve a stable operation of an activated neuronal\nassembly, there must be a subtle balance between inhibitory and\nexcitatory connections among neurons (cf. Figure 1). If the transfer\nfunction of individual neurons is strictly monotonic, i.e., increasing\ninput leads to increasing output, assemblies are difficult to\nstabilize. For this reason, results establishing a non-monotonic\ntransfer function with a maximal output at intermediate input are of\nhigh significance for the modeling of neuronal assemblies (Kuhn et\nal. 2004). For instance, network models using lattices of coupled\nmaps with quadratic maximum (Kaneko and Tsuda 2000) are paradigmatic\nexamples of such behavior. These and other familiar models of neuronal\nassemblies (for an overview see Anderson and Rosenfeld 1988) are\nmostly formulated in a way not invoking well-defined elements\nof quantum theory. An explicit exception is the approach by Umezawa,\nVitiello and others (see\n Section 3.3). \nThe fact that neuronal assemblies are mostly described in terms of\nclassical behavior does not rule out that classically undescribable\nquantum effects may be significant if one focuses on individual\nconstituents of assemblies, i.e., single neurons or interfaces between\nthem. These interfaces, through which the signals between neurons\npropagate, are called synapses. There are electrical and chemical\nsynapses, depending on whether they transmit a signal electrically or\nchemically. \nAt electrical synapses, the current generated by the action potential\nat the presynaptic neuron flows directly into the postsynaptic cell,\nwhich is physically connected to the presynaptic terminal by a\nso-called gap junction. At chemical synapses, there is a cleft between\npre- and postsynaptic cell. In order to propagate a signal, a chemical\ntransmitter (glutamate) is released at the presynaptic terminal. This\nrelease process is called exocytosis. The transmitter diffuses across\nthe synaptic cleft and binds to receptors at the postsynaptic\nmembrane, thus opening an ion channel (Kandel et al. 2000,\npart III; see Fig. 2). Chemical transmission is slower than electric\ntransmission. \nFigure 2. Release of neurotransmitters\nat the synaptic cleft (exocytosis). \nA model developed by Beck and Eccles applies concrete quantum\nmechanical features to describe details of the process of exocytosis.\nTheir model proposes that quantum processes are relevant for\nexocytosis and, moreover, are tightly related to states of\nconsciousness. This will be discussed in more detail in\n Section 3.4. \nAt this point, another approach developed by Flohr (2000) should be\nmentioned, for which chemical synapses with a specific type of\nreceptors, so-called NMDA\n receptors,[6]\n are of paramount significance. Briefly, Flohr observes that the\nspecific plasticity of NMDA receptors is a necessary condition for the\nformation of extended stable neuronal assemblies correlated to\n(higher-order) mental representations which he identifies with\nconscious states. Moreover, he indicates a number of mechanisms caused\nby anaesthetic agents, which block NMDA receptors and consequently\nlead to a loss of consciousness. Flohr’s approach is\nphysicalistic and reductive, and it is entirely independent of any\nspecific quantum ideas. \nThe lowest neurophysiological level, at which quantum processes have\nbeen proposed as a correlate to consciousness, is the level at which\nthe interior of single neurons is considered: their cytoskeleton. It\nconsists of protein networks essentially made up of two kinds of\nstructures, neurofilaments and microtubuli (Fig. 3, left), which are\nessential for various transport processes within neurons (as well as\nother cells). Microtubuli are long polymers usually constructed of 13\nlongitudinal α and β-tubulin dimers arranged in a tubular\narray with an outside diameter of about 25 nm (Fig. 3, right). For\nmore details see Kandel et al. (2000), Chap. II.4. \nFigure 3. (left) microtubuli and\nneurofilaments, the width of the figure corresponds to approximately\n700nm; (right) tubulin dimers, consisting of α- and\nβ-monomers, constituting a microtubule. \nThe tubulins in microtubuli are the substrate which, in\nHameroff’s proposal, is used to embed Penrose’s\ntheoretical framework neurophysiologically. As will be discussed in\nmore detail in\n Section 3.5,\n tubulin states are assumed to depend on quantum events, so that\nquantum coherence among different tubulins is possible. Further, a\ncrucial thesis in the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff is that the\n(gravitation-induced) collapse of such coherent tubulin states\ncorresponds to elementary acts of consciousness. \nThe act of measurement is a crucial aspect in the framework of quantum\ntheory, that has been the subject of controversy for more than eight\ndecades now. In his monograph on the mathematical foundations of\nquantum mechanics, von Neumann (1955, Chap. V.1) introduced, in an\nad hoc manner, the projection postulate as a mathematical\ntool for describing measurement in terms of a discontinuous,\nnon-causal, instantaneous (irreversible) act given by (1) the\ntransition of a quantum state to an eigenstate bj\nof the measured observable B (with a certain probability).\nThis transition is often called the collapse or\nreduction of the wavefunction, as opposed to (2) the\ncontinuous, unitary (reversible) evolution of a system according to\nthe Schrödinger equation. \nIn Chapter VI, von Neumann (1955) discussed the conceptual distinction\nbetween observed and observing system. In this context, he applied (1)\nand (2) to the general situation of a measured object system (I), a\nmeasuring instrument (II), and (the brain of) a human observer (III).\nHis conclusion was that it makes no difference for the result of\nmeasurements on (I) whether the boundary between observed and\nobserving system is posited between I and (II & III) or between (I\n& II) and III. As a consequence, it is inessential whether a\ndetector or the human brain is ultimately referred to as the\n “observer”.[7] \nBy contrast to von Neumann’s fairly cautious stance, London and\nBauer (1939) went further and proposed that it is indeed human\nconsciousness which completes the quantum measurement process\n(see Jammer (1974, Sec. 11.3 or Shimony (1963) for a detailed\naccount). In this way, they attributed a crucial role to consciousness\nin understanding quantum measurement in terms of an update of the\nobserver’s knowledge. In the 1960s, Wigner (1967) radicalized\nthis\n proposal,[8]\n by suggesting an impact of consciousness on the physical state of the\nmeasured system, not only an impact on observer knowledge. In order to\ndescribe measurement as a real dynamical process generating\nirreversible facts, Wigner called for some nonlinear modification of\n(2) to replace von Neumann’s projection\n (1).[9] \nSince the 1980s, Stapp has developed his own point of view on the\nbackground of von Neumann and Wigner. In particular, he tries to\nunderstand specific features of consciousness in relation to quantum\ntheory. Inspired by von Neumann, Stapp uses the freedom to place the\ninterface between observed and observing system and locates it in the\nobserver’s brain. He does not suggest any formal modifications\nto present-day quantum theory (in particular, he stays essentially\nwithin the “orthodox” Hilbert space representation), but\nadds major interpretational extensions, in particular with respect to\na detailed ontological framework. \nIn his earlier work, Stapp (1993) started with Heisenberg’s\ndistinction between the potential and the actual (Heisenberg 1958),\nthereby taking a decisive step beyond the operational Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg’s notion\nof the actual is related to a measured event in the sense of\nthe Copenhagen interpretation, his notion of the potential,\nof a tendency, relates to the situation before\nmeasurement, which expresses the idea of a reality independent of\n measurement.[10] \nImmediately after its actualization, each event holds the tendency for\nthe impending actualization of another, subsequent actual event.\nTherefore, events are by definition ambiguous. With respect to their\nactualized aspect, Stapp’s essential move is to “attach to\neach Heisenberg actual event an experiential aspect. The latter is\ncalled the feel of this event, and it can be considered to be\nthe aspect of the actual event that gives it its status as an\nintrinsic actuality” (Stapp 1993, p. 149).  \nWith respect to their tendency aspect, it is tempting to understand\nevents in terms of\n scheme (B)\n of\n Section 2.\n This is related to Whitehead’s ontology, in which mental and\nphysical poles of so-called “actual occasions” are\nconsidered as psychological and physical aspects of reality. The\npotential antecedents of actual occasions are psychophysically neutral\nand refer to a mode of existence at which mind and matter are\nunseparated. This is expressed, for instance, by Stapp’s notion\nof a “hybrid ontology” with “both idea-like and\nmatter-like qualities” (Stapp 1999, 159). Similarities with a\ndual-aspect approach (B) (cf.\n Section 5)\n are evident. \nIn an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological\nfeatures of his approach with respect to Whitehead’s process\nthinking, where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are\nfundamental elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a\nprocessual rather than a substantial ontology (see the entry on\n process philosophy).\n Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions\nto both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated\npsychological intentional act. \nAnother significant aspect of his approach is the possibility that\n“conscious intentions of a human being can influence the\nactivities of his brain” (Stapp 1999, p. 153). Different from\nthe possibly misleading notion of a direct interaction, suggesting an\ninterpretation in terms of scheme (A) of\n Section 2,\n he describes this feature in a more subtle manner. The requirement\nthat the mental and material outcomes of an actual occasion must\nmatch, i.e. be correlated, acts as a constraint on the way in which\nthese outcomes are formed within the actual occasion (cf. Stapp 2006).\nThe notion of interaction is thus replaced by the notion of a\nconstraint set by mind-matter correlations (see also Stapp 2007). \nAt a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states\nare distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp\n(1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state\nreduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes\ncalled the neural correlate of that conscious experience”. This\npattern of activity may encode an intention and, thus, represent a\n“template for action”. An intentional decision for an\naction, preceding the action itself, is then the key for anything like\nfree will in this picture. \nStapp argues that the mental effort, i.e. attention devoted to such\nintentional acts, can protract the lifetime of the neuronal assemblies\nthat represent the templates for action due to quantum Zeno-type\neffects. Concerning the neurophysiological implementation of this\nidea, intentional mental states are assumed to correspond to\nreductions of superposition states of neuronal assemblies. Additional\ncommentary concerning the concepts of attention and intention in\nrelation to James’ idea of a holistic stream of consciousness\n(James 1950 [1890]) was given by Stapp (1999). \nFor further progress, it will be mandatory to develop a coherent\nformal framework for this approach and elaborate on concrete details.\nFor instance, it is not yet worked out precisely how quantum\nsuperpositions and their collapses are supposed to occur in neural\ncorrelates of conscious events. Some indications are outlined by\nSchwartz et al. (2005). With these desiderata for future\nwork, the overall conception is conservative insofar as the physical\nformalism remains unchanged. \nThis is why Stapp insisted for years that his approach does not change\nwhat he calls “orthodox” quantum mechanics, which is\nessentially encoded in the statistical formulation by von Neumann\n(1955). From the point of view of standard present-day quantum\nphysics, however, it is certainly unorthodox to include the mental\nstate of observers in the theory. Although it is true that quantum\nmeasurement is not yet finally understood in terms of physical theory,\nintroducing mental states as the essential missing link is highly\nspeculative from a contemporary perspective. \nThis link is a radical conceptual move. In what Stapp now denotes as a\n“semi-orthodox” approach (Stapp 2015), he proposes that\nthe blind-chance kind of randomness of individual quantum events\n(“nature’s choices”) be reconceived as “not\nactually random but positively or negatively biased by the positive or\nnegative values in the minds of the observers that are actualized by\nits (nature’s) choices” (p. 187). This hypothesis leads\ninto mental influences on quantum physical processes which are widely\nunknown territory at present.  \nIn the 1960s, Ricciardi and Umezawa (1967) suggested to utilize the\nformalism of quantum field theory to describe brain states, with\nparticular emphasis on memory. The basic idea is to conceive of memory\nstates in terms of states of many-particle systems, as inequivalent\nrepresentations of vacuum states of quantum\n fields.[11]\n This proposal has gone through several refinements (e.g., Stuart\net al. 1978, 1979; Jibu and Yasue 1995). Major recent\nprogress has been achieved by including effects of dissipation, chaos,\nfractals and quantum noise (Vitiello 1995; Pessa and Vitiello 2003;\nVitiello 2012). For readable nontechnical accounts of the approach in\nits present form, embedded in quantum field theory as of today, see\nVitiello (2001, 2002). \nQuantum field theory (see the entry on\n quantum field theory)\n deals with systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. For such\nsystems, the algebra of observables that results from imposing\ncanonical commutation relations admits of multiple Hilbert-space\nrepresentations that are not unitarily equivalent to each other. This\ndiffers from the case of standard quantum mechanics, which deals with\nsystems with finitely many degrees of freedom. For such systems, the\ncorresponding algebra of observables admits of unitarily equivalent\nHilbert-space representations. \nThe inequivalent representations of quantum field theory can be\ngenerated by spontaneous symmetry breaking (see the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking),\n occurring when the ground state (or the vacuum state) of a system is\nnot invariant under the full group of transformations providing the\nconservation laws for the system. If symmetry breaks down, collective\nmodes are generated (so-called Nambu-Goldstone boson modes), which\npropagate over the system and introduce long-range correlations in\nit. \nThese correlations are responsible for the emergence of ordered\npatterns. Unlike in standard thermal systems, a large number of bosons\ncan be condensed in an ordered state in a highly stable fashion.\nRoughly speaking, this provides a quantum field theoretical derivation\nof ordered states in many-body systems described in terms of\nstatistical physics. In the proposal by Umezawa these dynamically\nordered states represent coherent activity in neuronal assemblies. \nThe activation of a neuronal assembly is necessary to make\nthe encoded content consciously accessible. This activation is\nconsidered to be initiated by external stimuli. Unless the assembly is\nactivated, its content remains unconscious, unaccessed memory.\nAccording to Umezawa, coherent neuronal assemblies correlated to such\nmemory states are regarded as vacuum states; their activation leads to\nexcited states and enables a conscious recollection of the content\nencoded in the vacuum (ground) state. The stability of such states and\nthe role of external stimuli have been investigated in detail by\nStuart et al. (1978, 1979). \nA decisive further step in developing the approach has been achieved\nby taking dissipation into account. Dissipation is possible\nwhen the interaction of a system with its environment is considered.\nVitiello (1995) describes how the system-environment interaction\ncauses a doubling of the collective modes of the system in its\nenvironment. This yields infinitely many differently coded vacuum\nstates, offering the possibility of many memory contents without\noverprinting. Moreover, dissipation leads to finite lifetimes of the\nvacuum states, thus representing temporally limited rather than\nunlimited memory (Alfinito and Vitiello 2000; Alfinito et al.\n2001). Finally, dissipation generates a genuine arrow of time for the\nsystem, and its interaction with the environment induces entanglement.\nPessa and Vitiello (2003) have addressed additional effects of chaos\nand quantum noise. \nUmezawa’s proposal addresses the brain as a many-particle system\nas a whole, where the “particles” are more or less\nneurons. In the language of\n Section 3.1,\n this refers to the level of neuronal assemblies, which correlate\ndirectly with mental activity. Another merit of the quantum\nfield theory approach is that it avoids the restrictions of standard\nquantum mechanics in a formally sound way. Conceptually speaking, many\nof the pioneering presentations of the proposal nevertheless confused\nmental and material states (and their properties). This has been\nclarified by Freeman and Vitiello (2008): the model “describes\nthe brain, not mental states.”  \nFor a corresponding description of brain states, Freeman and Vitiello\n2006, 2008, 2010) studied neurobiologically relevant observables such\nas electric and magnetic field amplitudes and neurotransmitter\nconcentration. They found evidence for non-equilibrium analogs of\nphase transitions (Vitiello 2015) and power-law distributions of\nspectral energy densities of electrocorticograms (Freeman and Vitiello\n2010, Freeman and Quian Quiroga 2013). All these observables are\nclassical, so that neurons, glia cells, “and other physiological\nunits are not quantum objects in the many-body model of\nbrain” (Freeman and Vitiello 2008). However, Vitiello (2012)\nalso points out that the emergence of (self-similar, fractal)\npower-law distributions in general is intimately related to\ndissipative quantum coherent states (see also recent developments of\nthe Penrose-Hameroff scenario,\n Section 3.5). \nThe overall conclusion is that the application of quantum field theory\ndescribes why and how classical behavior emerges at the level of brain\nactivity considered. The relevant brain states themselves are viewed\nas classical states. Similar to a classical thermodynamical\ndescription arising from quantum statistical mechanics, the idea is to\nidentify different regimes of stable behavior (phases, attractors) and\ntransitions between them. This way, quantum field theory provides\nformal elements from which a standard classical description of brain\nactivity can be inferred, and this is its main role in large parts of\nthe model. Only in their last joint paper, Freeman and Vitiello (2016)\nenvision a way in which the mental can be explicitly included. For a\nrecent review including technical background see Sabbadini and\nVitiello (2019).  \nProbably the most concrete suggestion of how quantum mechanics in its\npresent-day appearance can play a role in brain processes is due to\nBeck and Eccles (1992), later refined by Beck (2001). It refers to\nparticular mechanisms of information transfer at the synaptic cleft.\nHowever, ways in which these quantum processes might be relevant for\nmental activity, and in which their interactions with mental states\nare conceived, remain unclarified to the present\n day.[12] \nAs presented in\n Section 3.1,\n the information flow between neurons in chemical synapses is\ninitiated by the release of transmitters in the presynaptic terminal.\nThis process is called exocytosis, and it is triggered by an arriving\nnerve impulse with some small probability. In order to describe the\ntrigger mechanism in a statistical way, thermodynamics or quantum\nmechanics can be invoked. A look at the corresponding energy regimes\nshows (Beck and Eccles 1992) that quantum processes are\ndistinguishable from thermal processes for energies higher than\n10-2 eV (at room temperature). Assuming a typical length\nscale for biological microsites of the order of several nanometers, an\neffective mass below 10 electron masses is sufficient to ensure that\nquantum processes prevail over thermal processes. \nThe upper limit of the time scale of such processes in the quantum\nregime is of the order of 10-12 sec. This is significantly\nshorter than the time scale of cellular processes, which is\n10-9 sec and longer. The sensible difference between the\ntwo time scales makes it possible to treat the corresponding processes\nas decoupled from one another. \nThe detailed trigger mechanism proposed by Beck and Eccles (1992) is\nbased on the quantum concept of quasi-particles, reflecting the\nparticle aspect of a collective mode. Skipping the details of the\npicture, the proposed trigger mechanism refers to tunneling processes\nof two-state quasi-particles, resulting in state collapses. It yields\na probability of exocytosis in the range between 0 and 0.7, in\nagreement with empirical observations. Using a theoretical framework\ndeveloped earlier (Marcus 1956; Jortner 1976), the quantum trigger can\nbe concretely understood in terms of electron transfer between\nbiomolecules. However, the question remains how the trigger may be\nrelevant for conscious mental states. There are two aspects to this\nquestion. \nThe first one refers to Eccles’ intention to utilize quantum\nprocesses in the brain as an entry point for mental causation. The\nidea, as indicated in\n Section 1,\n is that the fundamentally indeterministic nature of individual\nquantum state collapses offers room for the influence of mental powers\non brain states. In the present picture, this is conceived in such a\nway that “mental intention (volition) becomes neurally effective\nby momentarily increasing the probability of\nexocytosis” (Beck and Eccles 1992, 11360). Further\njustification of this assumption is not given. \nThe second aspect refers to the problem that processes at\nsingle synapses cannot be simply correlated to mental\nactivity, whose neural correlates are coherent assemblies of neurons.\nMost plausibly, prima facie uncorrelated random processes at\nindividual synapses would result in a stochastic network of neurons\n(Hepp 1999). Although Beck (2001) has indicated possibilities (such as\nquantum stochastic resonance) for achieving ordered patterns at the\nlevel of assemblies from fundamentally random synaptic processes, this\nremains an unsolved problem. \nWith the exception of Eccles’ idea of mental causation, the\napproach by Beck and Eccles essentially focuses on brain states and\nbrain dynamics.  In this respect, Beck (2001, 109f) states explicitly\nthat “science cannot, by its very nature, present any answer to\n[…] questions related to the mind”. Nevertheless, their\nbiophysical approach may open the door to controlled speculation about\nmind-matter relations. \nA more recent proposal targeting exocytosis processes at the synaptic\ncleft is due Fisher (2015, 2017). Similar to the quasi-particles by\nBeck and Eccles, Fisher refers to so-called Posner molecules, in\nparticular to calcium phosphate, Ca\\(_9\\)(PO\\(_4\\))\\(_6\\). The nuclear\nspins of phosphate ions serve as entangled qubits within the\nmolecules, which protect their coherent states against fast\ndecoherence (resulting in extreme decoherence times in the range of\nhours or even days). If the Posner molecules are transported into\npresynaptic glutamatergic neurons, they will stimulate further\nglutamate release and amplify postsynaptic activity. Due to nonlocal\nquantum correlations this activity may be enhanced over multiple\nneurons (which would respond to Hepp’s concern). \nThis is a sophisticated mechanism that calls for empirical tests. One\nof them would be to modify the phosphorus spin dynamics within the\nPosner molecules.  For instance, replacing Ca by different Li isotopes\nwith different nuclear spins gives rise to different decoherence\ntimes, affecting postsynaptic activity.  Corresponding evidence has\nbeen shown in animals (Sechzer et al. 1986, Krug et al. 2019). In\nfact, lithium is known to be efficacious in tempering manic phases in\npatients with bipolar disorder. \nIn the scenario developed by Penrose and neurophysiologically\naugmented by Hameroff, quantum theory is claimed to be effective for\nconsciousness, but the way this happens is quite sophisticated. It is\nargued that elementary acts of consciousness are non-algorithmic,\ni.e., non-computable, and they are neurophysiologically realized as\ngravitation-induced reductions of coherent superposition states in\nmicrotubuli. \nUnlike the approaches discussed so far, which are essentially based on\n(different features of) status quo quantum theory, the\nphysical part of the scenario, proposed by Penrose, refers to future\ndevelopments of quantum theory for a proper understanding of the\nphysical process underlying quantum state reduction. The grander\npicture is that a full-blown theory of quantum gravity is required to\nultimately understand quantum measurement (see the entry on\n quantum gravity). \nThis is a far-reaching assumption. Penrose’s rationale for\ninvoking state reduction is not that the corresponding randomness\noffers room for mental causation to become efficacious (although this\nis not excluded). His conceptual starting point, at length developed\nin two books (Penrose 1989, 1994), is that elementary conscious acts\ncannot be described algorithmically, hence cannot be computed. His\nbackground in this respect has a lot to do with the nature of\ncreativity, mathematical insight, Gödel’s incompleteness\ntheorems, and the idea of a Platonic reality beyond mind and\nmatter. \nPenrose argues that a valid formulation of quantum state reduction\nreplacing von Neumann’s projection postulate must faithfully\ndescribe an objective physical process that he calls\nobjective reduction. As such a physical process remains\nempirically unconfirmed so far, Penrose proposes that effects not\ncurrently covered by quantum theory could play a role in state\nreduction. Ideal candidates for him are gravitational effects since\ngravitation is the only fundamental interaction which is not\nintegrated into quantum theory so far. Rather than modifying elements\nof the theory of gravitation (i.e., general relativity) to achieve\nsuch an integration, Penrose discusses the reverse: that novel\nfeatures have to be incorporated in quantum theory for this purpose.\nIn this way, he arrives at the proposal of gravitation-induced\nobjective state reduction. \nWhy is such a version of state reduction non-computable? Initially one\nmight think of objective state reduction in terms of a stochastic\nprocess, as most current proposals for such mechanisms indeed do (see\nthe entry on\n collapse theories).\n This would certainly be indeterministic, but probabilistic and\nstochastic processes can be standardly implemented on a computer,\nhence they are definitely computable. Penrose (1994, Secs 7.8 and\n7.10) sketches some ideas concerning genuinely non-computable, not\nonly random, features of quantum gravity. In order for them to become\nviable candidates for explaining the non-computability of\ngravitation-induced state reduction, a long way still has to be\ngone. \nWith respect to the neurophysiological implementation of\nPenrose’s proposal, his collaboration with Hameroff has been\ninstrumental. With his background as an anaesthesiologist, Hameroff\nsuggested to consider microtubules as an option for where reductions\nof quantum states can take place in an effective way, see e.g.,\nHameroff and Penrose (1996). The respective quantum states are assumed\nto be coherent superpositions of tubulin states, ultimately extending\nover many neurons. Their simultaneous gravitation-induced collapse is\ninterpreted as an individual elementary act of consciousness. The\nproposed mechanism by which such superpositions are established\nincludes a number of involved details that remain to be confirmed or\ndisproven. \nThe idea of focusing on microtubuli is partly motivated by the\nargument that special locations are required to ensure that quantum\nstates can live long enough to become reduced by gravitational\ninfluence rather than by interactions with the warm and wet\nenvironment within the brain. Speculative remarks about how the\nnon-computable aspects of the expected new physics mentioned above\ncould be significant in this\n scenario[13]\n are given in Penrose (1994, Sec. 7.7). \nInfluential criticism of the possibility that quantum states can in\nfact survive long enough in the thermal environment of the brain has\nbeen raised by Tegmark (2000). He estimates the decoherence time of\ntubulin superpositions due to interactions in the brain to be less\nthan 10-12 sec. Compared to typical time scales of\nmicrotubular processes of the order of milliseconds and more, he\nconcludes that the lifetime of tubulin superpositions is much too\nshort to be significant for neurophysiological processes in the\nmicrotubuli. In a response to this criticism, Hagan et al.\n(2002) showed that a corrected version of Tegmark’s model\nprovides decoherence times up to 10 to 100 μsec, and it has been\nargued that this can be extended up to the neurophysiologically\nrelevant range of 10 to 100 msec under particular assumptions of the\nscenario by Penrose and Hameroff. \nMore recently, a novel idea has entered this debate. Theoretical\nstudies of interacting spins have shown that entangled states can be\nmaintained in noisy open quantum systems at high temperature and far\nfrom thermal equilibrium. In these studies the effect of decoherence\nis counterbalanced by a simple “recoherence” mechanism\n(Hartmann et al. 2006, Li and Paraoanu 2009). This indicates\nthat, under particular circumstances, entanglement may persist even in\nhot and noisy environments such as the brain. \nHowever, decoherence is just one piece in the debate about the overall\npicture suggested by Penrose and Hameroff. From another perspective,\ntheir proposal of microtubules as quantum computing devices has\nrecently received support from work of Bandyopadhyay’s lab at\nJapan, showing evidence for vibrational resonances and conductivity\nfeatures in microtubules that should be expected if they are\nmacroscopic quantum systems (Sahu et al. 2013).\nBandyopadhyay’s results initiated considerable attention and\ncommentary (see Hameroff and Penrose 2014). In a well-informed\nin-depth analysis, Pitkänen (2014) raised concerns to the effect\nthat the reported results alone may not be sufficient to confirm the\napproach proposed by Hameroff and Penrose with all its\nramifications. \nIn a different vein, Craddock et al. (2015, 2017) discussed\nin detail how microtubular processes (rather than, or in addition to,\nsynaptic processes, see Flohr 2000) may be affected by anesthetics,\nand may also be responsible for neurodegenerative memory disorders. As\nthe correlation between anesthetics and consciousness seems obvious at\nthe phenomenological level, it is interesting to know the intricate\nmechanisms by which anesthetic drugs act on the cytoskeleton of\nneuronal\n cells,[14]\n and what role quantum mechanics plays in these mechanisms. Craddock\net al. (2015, 2017) point out a number of possible quantum\neffects (including the power-law behavior addressed by Vitiello, cf.\n Section 3.3)\n which can be investigated using presently available technologies.\nRecent empirical results about quantum interactions of anesthetics are\ndue to Li et al. (2018) and Burdick et al. (2019).\n \nFrom a philosophical perspective, the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff\nhas occasionally received outspoken rejection, see e.g., Grush and\nChurchland (1995) and the reply by Penrose and Hameroff (1995).\nIndeed, their approach collects several top level mysteries, among\nthem the relation between mind and matter itself, the ultimate\nunification of all physical interactions, the origin of mathematical\ntruth, and the understanding of brain dynamics across hierarchical\nlevels. Combining such deep and fascinating issues certainly needs\nfurther work to be substantiated, and should neither be too quickly\ncelebrated nor offhandedly dismissed. After more than two decades\nsince its inception one thing can be safely asserted: the approach has\nfruitfully inspired important innovative research on quantum effects\non consciousness, both theoretical and empirical.  \nToday there is accumulating evidence in the study of consciousness\nthat quantum concepts like complementarity, entanglement, dispersive\nstates, and non-Boolean logic play significant roles in mental\nprocesses. Corresponding quantum-inspired approaches address purely\nmental (psychological) phenomena using formal features also employed\nin quantum physics, but without involving the full-fledged framework\nof quantum mechanics or quantum field theory. The term “quantum\ncognition” has been coined to refer to this new area of\nresearch. Perhaps a more appropriate characterization would be\nnon-commutative structures in cognition.  \nOn the surface, this seems to imply that the brain activity correlated\nwith those mental processes is in fact governed by quantum physics.\nThe quantum brain approaches discussed in\n Section 3\n represent attempts that have been proposed along these lines. But is\nit necessarily true that quantum features in psychology imply quantum\nphysics in the brain?  \nA formal move to incorporate quantum behavior in mental systems,\nwithout referring to quantum brain activity, is based on a state space\ndescription of mental systems. If mental states are defined on the\nbasis of cells of a neural state space partition, then this partition\nneeds to be well tailored to lead to robustly defined states. Ad hoc\nchosen partitions will generally create incompatible descriptions\n(Atmanspacher and beim Graben 2007) and states may become entangled\n(beim Graben et al. 2013).  \nThis implies that quantum brain dynamics is not the only possible\nexplanation of quantum features in mental systems. Assuming that\nmental states arise from partitions of neural states in such a way\nthat statistical neural states are co-extensive with individual mental\nstates, the nature of mental processes depends strongly on the kind of\npartition chosen. If the partition is not properly constructed, it is\nlikely that mental states and observables show features that resemble\nquantum behavior although the correlated brain activity may be\nentirely classical: quantum mind without quantum brain. \nIntuitively, it is not difficult to understand why non-commuting\noperations or non-Boolean logic should be relevant, even inevitable,\nfor mental systems that have nothing to do with quantum physics.\nSimply speaking, the non-commutativity of operations means nothing\nelse than that the sequence, in which operations are applied, matters\nfor the final result. And non-Boolean logic refers to propositions\nthat may have unsharp truth values beyond yes or no, shades of\nplausibility or credibility as it were. Both versions obviously abound\nin psychology and cognitive science (and in everyday life).\nPylkkänen (2015) has even suggested to use this intuitive\naccessibility of mental quantum features for a better conceptual grasp\nof quantum physics.  \nThe particular strength of the idea of generalizing quantum theory\nbeyond quantum physics is that it provides a formal framework which\nboth yields a transparent well-defined link to conventional quantum\nphysics and has been used to describe a number of concrete\npsychological applications with surprisingly detailed theoretical and\nempirical results. Corresponding approaches fall under the third\ncategory mentioned in\n Section 3:\n further developments or generalizations of quantum theory. \nOne rationale for the focus on psychological phenomena is that their\ndetailed study is a necessary precondition for further questions as to\ntheir neural correlates. Therefore, the investigation of mental\nquantum features resists the temptation to reduce them (within\nscenario A) all-too quickly to neural activity. There are several\nkinds of psychological phenomena which have been addressed in the\nspirit of mental quantum features so far: (i) decision processes, (ii)\norder effects, (iii) bistable perception, (iv) learning, (v) semantic\nnetworks, (vi) quantum agency,and (vii) super-quantum entanglement\ncorrelations. These topics will be outlined in some more detail in the\nfollowing\n Section 4.2. \nAn early precursor of work on decision processes is due to Aerts and\nAerts (1994). However, the first detailed account appeared in a\ncomprehensive publication by Busemeyer et al. (2006). The key\nidea is to define probabilities for decision outcomes and decision\ntimes in terms of quantum probability amplitudes. Busemeyer et\nal. found agreement of a suitable Hilbert space model (and\ndisagreement of a classical alternative) with empirical data.\nMoreover, they were able to clarify the long-standing riddle of the\nso-called conjunction and disjunction effects (Tversky and Shafir\n1992) in decision making (Pothos and Busemeyer 2009). Another\napplication refers to the asymmetry of similarity judgments (Tversky\n1977), which can be adequately understood by quantum approaches (see\nAerts et al. 2011, Pothos et al. 2013). \nOrder effects in polls, surveys, and questionnaires, recognized for a\nlong time (Schwarz and Sudman 1992), are still insufficiently\nunderstood today. Their study as contextual quantum features (Aerts\nand Aerts 1994, Busemeyer et al. 2011) offers the potential\nto unveil a lot more about such effects than the well-known fact that\nresponses can drastically alter if questions are swapped. Atmanspacher\nand Römer (2012) proposed a complete classification of possible\norder effects (including uncertainty relations, and independent of\nHilbert space representations), and Wang et al. (2014)\ndiscovered a fundamental covariance condition (called the QQ equation)\nfor a wide class of order effects. \nAn important issue for quantum mind approaches is the complexity or\nparsimony of Hilbert space models as compared to classical (Bayesian,\nMarkov, etc.) models. Atmanspacher and Römer (2012) as well as\nBusemeyer and Wang (2018) addressed this issue for order effects, with\nthe result that quantum approaches generally require less free\nvariables than competing classical models and are, thus, more\nparsimonious and more stringent than those. Busemeyer and Wang (2017)\nstudied how measuring incompatible observables sequentially induces\nuncertainties on the second measurement outcome.  \nThe perception of a stimulus is bistable if the stimulus is ambiguous,\nsuch as the Necker cube. This bistable behavior has been modeled\nanalagous to the physical quantum Zeno effect. (Note that this differs\nfrom the quantum Zeno effect as used in\n Section 3.2.)\n The resulting Necker-Zeno model predicts a quantitative relation\nbetween basic psychophysical time scales in bistable perception that\nhas been confirmed experimentally (see Atmanspacher and Filk 2013 for\nreview). \nMoreover, Atmanspacher and Filk (2010) showed that the Necker-Zeno\nmodel violates temporal Bell inqualitities for particular\ndistinguished states in bistable\n perception.[15]\n This theoretical prediction is yet to be tested experimentally and\nwould be a litmus test for quantum behavior in mental systems. Such\nstates have been denoted as temporally nonlocal in the sense\nthat they are not sharply (pointwise) localized along the time axis\nbut appear to be stretched over an extended time interval (an extended\npresent). Within this interval, relations such as\n“earlier” or “later” are illegitimate\ndesignators and, accordingly, causal connections are ill-defined. \nAnother quite obvious arena for non-commutative behavior is learning\nbehavior. In theoretical studies, Atmanspacher and Filk (2006) showed\nthat in simple supervised learning tasks small recurrent networks not\nonly learn the prescribed input-output relation but also the sequence\nin which inputs have been presented. This entails that the recognition\nof inputs is impaired if the sequence of presentation is changed. In\nvery few exceptional cases, with special characteristics that remain\nto be explored, this impairment is avoided. \nThe difficult issue of meaning in natural languages is often explored\nin terms of semantic networks. Gabora and Aerts (2002) described the\nway in which concepts are evoked, used, and combined to generate\nmeaning depending on contexts. Their ideas about concept association\nin evolution were further developed by Gabora and Aerts (2009). A\nparticularly thrilling application is due to Bruza et al.\n(2015), who challenged a long-standing dogma in linguistics by\nproposing that the meaning of concept combinations (such as\n“apple chip”) is not uniquely separable into the meanings\nof the combined concepts (“apple” and “chip”).\nBruza et al. (2015) refer to meaning relations in terms of\nentanglement-style features in quantum representations of concepts and\nreported first empirical results in this direction.  \nA quantum approach for understanding issues related to agency,\nintention, and other controversial topics in the philosophy of mind\nhas been proposed by Briegel and Müller (2015), see also\nMüller and Briegel (2018). This proposal is based on work on\nquantum algorithms for reinforcement learning in neural networks\n(“projective simulation”, Paparo et al. 2012),\nwhich can be regarded as a variant of quantum machine learning (Wittek\n2014). The gist of the idea is how agents can develop agency as a kind\nof independence from their environment and the deterministic laws\ngoverning it (Briegel 2012). The behavior of the agent itself is\nsimulated as a non-deterministic quantum random walk in its memory\nspace. \nQuantum entanglement implies correlations exceeding standard classical\ncorrelations (by violating Bell-type inequalitites) but obeying the\nso-called Tsirelson bound. However, this bound does not exhaust the\nrange by which Bell-type correlations can be violated in principle.\nPopescu and Rohrlich (1994) found such correlations for particular\nquantum measurements, and the study of such super-quantum correlations\nhas become a vivid field of contemporary research, as the review by\nPopescu (2014) shows.  \nOne problem in assessing super-quantum correlations in mental systems\nis to delineate genuine (non-causal) quantum-type correlations from\n(causal) classical correlations that can be used for signaling.\nDzhafarov and Kujala (2013) derived a compact way to do so and\nsubtract classical context effects such as priming in mental systems\nso that true quantum correlations remain. See Cervantes and Dzhafarov\n(2018) for empirical applications, and Atmanspacher and Filk (2019)\nfor further subtleties.  \nDual-aspect approaches consider mental and material domains of reality\nas aspects, or manifestations, of one underlying reality in which mind\nand matter are unseparated. In such a framework, the distinction\nbetween mind and matter results from the application of a basic tool\nfor achieving epistemic access to, i.e., gather knowledge about, both\nthe separated domains and the underlying\n reality.[16]\n Consequently, the status of the underlying, psychophysically neutral\ndomain is considered as ontic relative to the mind-matter\ndistinction. \nAs mentioned in\n Section 2,\n dual-aspect approaches have a long history, essentially starting with\nSpinoza as a most outspoken protagonist. Major directions in the 20th\ncentury have been described and compared to some detail by\nAtmanspacher (2014). An important distinction between two basic\nclasses of dual-aspect thinking is the way in which the\npsychophysically neutral domain is related to the mental and the\nphysical. For Russell and the neo-Russellians the\ncompositional arrangements of psychophysically neutral\nelements decide how they differ with respect to mental or physical\nproperties. As a consequence, the mental and the physical are\nreducible to the neutral domain. Chalmers’ (1996, Chap. 8) ideas\non “consciousness and information” fall into this class.\nTononi’s theoretical framework of “integrated information\ntheory” (see Oizumi et al. 2014, Tononi and Koch 2015)\ncan be seen as a concrete implementation of a number of features of\nChalmers’ proposal. No quantum structures are involved in this\nwork. \nThe other class of dual-aspect thinking is decompositional\nrather than compositional. Here the basic metaphysics of the\npsychophysically neutral domain is holistic, and the mental and the\nphysical (neither reducible to one another nor to the neutral) emerge\nby breaking the holistic symmetry or, in other words, by making\ndistinctions. This framework is guided by the analogy to quantum\nholism, and the predominant versions of this picture are quantum\ntheoretically inspired as, for instance, proposed by Pauli and Jung\n(Jung and Pauli 1955; Meier 2001) and by Bohm and Hiley (Bohm 1990;\nBohm and Hiley 1993; Hiley 2001). They are based on speculations that\nclearly exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory.  \nIn Bohm’s and Hiley’s approach, the notions of implicate\nand explicate order mirror the distinction between ontic and epistemic\ndomains. Mental and physical states emerge by explication, or\nunfoldment, from an ultimately undivided and psychophysically neutral\nimplicate, enfolded order. This order is called holomovement\nbecause it is not static but rather dynamic, as in Whitehead’s\nprocess philosophy. De Gosson and Hiley (2013) give a good\nintroduction of how the holomovement can be addressed from a formal\n(algebraic) point of view.  \nAt the level of the implicate order, the term active\ninformation expresses that this level is capable of\n“informing” the epistemically distinguished, explicate\ndomains of mind and matter. It should be emphasized that the usual\nnotion of information is clearly an epistemic term. Nevertheless,\nthere are quite a number of dual-aspect approaches addressing\nsomething like information at the ontic, psychophysically neutral\n level.[17]\n Using an information-like concept in a non-epistemic manner appears\ninconsistent if the common (syntactic) significance of Shannon-type\ninformation is intended, which requires distinctions in order to\nconstruct partitions, providing alternatives in the set of given\nevents. Most information-based dual-aspect approaches do not\nsufficiently clarify their notion of information, so that\nmisunderstandings easily arise. \nWhile the proposal by Bohm and Hiley essentially sketches a conceptual\nframework without further concrete details, particularly concerning\nthe mental domain, the Pauli-Jung conjecture (Atmanspacher and Fuchs\n2014) concerning dual-aspect monism offers some more material to\ndiscuss. An intuitively appealing way to represent their approach\nconsiders the distinction between epistemic and ontic domains of\nmaterial reality due to quantum theory in parallel with the\ndistinction between epistemic and ontic mental domains. \nOn the physical side, the epistemic/ontic distinction refers to the\ndistinction between a “local realism” of empirical facts\nobtained from classical measuring instruments and a “holistic\nrealism” of entangled systems (Atmanspacher and Primas 2003).\nEssentially, these domains are connected by the process of\nmeasurement, thus far conceived as independent of conscious observers.\nThe corresponding picture on the mental side refers to a distinction\nbetween conscious and unconscious\n domains.[18]\n In Jung’s depth psychological conceptions, these two domains\nare connected by the emergence of conscious mental states from the\nunconscious, analogous to physical measurement. \nIn Jung’s depth psychology it is crucial that the unconscious\nhas a collective component, unseparated between individuals\nand populated by so-called archetypes. They are regarded as\nconstituting the psychophysically neutral level comprising both the\ncollective unconscious and the holistic reality of quantum theory. At\nthe same time they operate as “ordering factors”, being\nresponsible for the arrangement of their psychical and physical\nmanifestations in the epistemically distinguished domains of mind and\nmatter. More details of this picture can be found in Jung and Pauli\n(1955), Meier (2001), Atmanspacher and Primas (2009), Atmanspacher and\nFach (2013), and Atmanspacher and Fuchs (2014). \nThis scheme is clearly related to\n scenario (B)\n of\n Sec. 2,\n combining an epistemically dualistic with an ontically monistic\napproach. Correlations between the mental and the physical are\nconceived as non-causal, thus respecting the causal closure of the\nphysical  against the mental. However, there is a causal\nrelationship (in the sense of formal rather than efficient causation)\nbetween the psychophysically neutral, monistic level and the\nepistemically distinguished mental and material domains. In\nPauli’s and Jung’s terms this kind of causation is\nexpressed by the ordering operation of archetypes in the collective\nunconscious. \nIn other words, this scenario offers the possibility that the mental\nand material manifestations may inherit mutual correlations due to the\nfact that they are jointly caused by the psychophysically neutral\nlevel. One might say that such correlations are remnants reflecting\nthe lost holism of the underlying reality. They are not the\nresult of any direct causal interaction between mental and\nmaterial domains. Thus, they are not suitable for an\nexplanation of direct efficient mental causation. Their\nexistence would require some psychophysically neutral activity\nentailing correlation effects that would be misinterpreted as mental\ncausation of physical events. Independently of quantum theory, a\nrelated move was suggested by Velmans (2002, 2009). But even without\nmental causation,\n scenario (B)\n is relevant to ubiquitous correlations between conscious mental\nstates and physical brain states. \nIn the Pauli-Jung conjecture, these correlations are called\nsynchronistic and have been extended to psychosomatic\nrelations (Meier 1975). A comprehensive typology of mind-matter\ncorrelations following from Pauli’s and Jung’s dual-aspect\nmonism was proposed by Atmanspacher and Fach (2013). They found that a\nlarge body of empirical material concerning more than 2000 cases of\nso-called “exceptional experiences” can be classified\naccording to their deviation from the conventional reality model of a\nsubject and from the conventional relations between its components\n(see Atmanspacher and Fach 2019 for more details). Synchronistic\nevents in the sense of Pauli and Jung appear as a special case of such\nrelational deviations.  \nAn essential condition required for synchronistic correlations is that\nthey are meaningful for those who experience them. It is\ntempting to interpret the use of meaning as an attempt to introduce\nsemantic information as an alternative to syntactic information as\naddressed above. (Note the parallel to active information as in the\napproach by Bohm and Hiley.) Although this entails difficult problems\nconcerning a clear-cut definition and operationalization, something\nakin to meaning, both explicitly and implicitly, might be a relevant\ninformational currency for mind-matter relations within the framework\nof decompositional dual-aspect thinking (Atmanspacher 2014). \nPrimas (2003, 2009, 2017) proposed a dual-aspect approach where the\ndistinction of mental and material domains originates from the\ndistinction between two different modes of time: tensed (mental) time,\nincluding nowness, on the one hand and tenseless (physical) time,\nviewed as an external parameter, on the other (see the entries on\n time\n and on\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n Regarding these two concepts of time as implied by a symmetry\nbreaking of a timeless level of reality that is psychophysically\nneutral, Primas conceives the tensed time of the mental domain as\nquantum-correlated with the parameter time of physics via\n“time-entanglement”. This scenario has been formulated in\na Hilbert space framework with appropriate time operators (Primas\n2009, 2017), so it offers a formally elaborated dual-aspect quantum\nframework for basic aspects of the mind-matter problem. It shows some\nconvergemce with the idea of temporally nonlocal mental states as\naddresed in\n Section 4.2. \nAs indicated in\n Section 3.2,\n the approach by Stapp contains elements of dual-aspect thinking as\nwell, although this is not much emphasized by its author. The\ndual-aspect quantum approaches discussed in the present section tend\nto focus on the issue of a generalized mind-matter\n“entanglement” more than on state reduction. The primary\npurpose here is to understand correlations between mental and material\ndomains rather than direct causally efficacious interactions between\nthem. \nA final issue of dual-aspect approaches in general refers to the\nproblem of panpsychism or panexperientialism, respectively (see the\nreview by Skrbina 2003, and the entry on\n panpsychism).\n In the limit of a universal symmetry breaking at the\npsychophysically neutral level, every system has both a\nmental and a material aspect. In such a situation it is important to\nunderstand “mentality” much more generally than\n“consciousness”. Unconscious or proto-mental acts as\nopposed to conscious mental acts are notions sometimes used to\nunderline this difference. The special case of human consciousness\nwithin the mental domain might be regarded as special as its material\ncorrelate, the brain, within the material domain. \nThe historical motivation for exploring quantum theory in trying to\nunderstand consciousness derived from the realization that\ncollapse-type quantum events introduce an element of randomness, which\nis primary (ontic) rather than due to ignorance or missing information\n(epistemic). Approaches such as those of Stapp and of Beck and Eccles\nemphasize this (in different ways), insofar as the ontic randomness of\nquantum events is regarded to provide room for mental causation, i.e.,\nthe possibility that conscious mental acts can influence brain\nbehavior. The approach by Penrose and Hameroff also focuses on state\ncollapse, but with a significant move from mental causation to the\nnon-computability of (particular) conscious acts. \nAny discussion of state collapse or state reduction (e.g. by\nmeasurement) refers, at least implicitly, to superposition states\nsince those are the states that are reduced. Insofar as entangled\nsystems remain in a quantum superposition as long as no measurement\nhas occurred, entanglement is always co-addressed when state reduction\nis discussed. By contrast, some of the dual-aspect quantum approaches\nutilize the topic of entanglement differently, and independently of\nstate reduction in the first place. Inspired by and analogous to\nentanglement-induced nonlocal correlations in quantum physics,\nmind-matter entanglement is conceived as the hypothetical origin of\nmind-matter correlations. This exhibits the highly speculative picture\nof a fundamentally holistic, psychophysically neutral level of reality\nfrom which correlated mental and material domains emerge. \nEach of the examples discussed in this overview has both promising and\nproblematic aspects. The approach by Beck and Eccles is most detailed\nand concrete with respect to the application of standard quantum\nmechanics to the process of exocytosis. However, it does not solve the\nproblem of how the activity of single synapses enters the dynamics of\nneural assemblies, and it leaves the mental causation of quantum\nprocesses as a mere claim. Stapp’s approach suggests a radically\nexpanded ontological basis for both the mental domain and status-quo\nquantum theory as a theory of matter without essentially changing the\nformalism of quantum theory. Although related to inspiring\nphilosophical and some psychological background, it still lacks\nempirical confirmation. The proposal by Penrose and Hameroff exceeds\nthe domain of present-day quantum theory by far and is the most\nspeculative example among those discussed. It is not easy to see how\nthe picture as a whole can be formally worked out and put to empirical\ntest. \nThe approach initiated by Umezawa is embedded in the framework of\nquantum field theory, more broadly applicable and formally more\nsophisticated than standard quantum mechanics. It is used to describe\nthe emergence of classical activity in neuronal assemblies on the\nbasis of symmetry breakings in a quantum field theoretical framework.\nA clear conceptual distinction between brain states and mental states\nhas often been missing. Their relation to mental states is has\nrecently been indicated in the framework of a dual-aspect\napproach. \nThe dual-aspect approaches of Pauli and Jung and of Bohm and Hiley are\nconceptually more transparent and more promising. Although there is\nnow a huge body of empirically documented mind-matter correlations\nthat supports the Pauli-Jung conjecture, it lacks a detailed formal\nbasis so far. Hiley’s work offers an algebraic framework which\nmay lead to theoretical progress. A novel dual-aspect quantum proposal\nby Primas, based on the distinction between tensed mental time and\ntenseless physical time, marks a significant step forward,\nparticularly as concerns a consistent formal framework. \nMaybe the best prognosis for future success among the examples\ndescribed in this overview, at least on foreseeable time scales, goes\nto the investigation of mental quantum features without focusing on\nassociated brain activity to begin with. A number of corresponding\napproaches have been developed which include concrete models for\nconcrete situations and have lead to successful empirical tests and\nfurther predictions. On the other hand, a coherent theory behind\nindividual models and relating the different types of approaches is\nstill to be settled in detail. With respect to scientific practice, a\nparticularly promising aspect is the visible formation of a scientific\ncommunity with conferences, mutual collaborations, and some\nperspicuous attraction for young scientists to join the field.
