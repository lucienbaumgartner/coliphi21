Anarchists also offer a positive theory of human\nflourishing, based upon an ideal of non-coercive consensus building.\nAnarchism has inspired practical efforts at establishing utopian\ncommunities, radical and revolutionary political agendas, and various\nforms of direct action. This entry primarily describes\n“philosophical anarchism”: it focuses on anarchism as a\ntheoretical idea and not as a form of political activism. While\nphilosophical anarchism describes a skeptical theory of political\nlegitimation, anarchism is also a concept that has been employed in\nphilosophical and literary theory to describe a sort of\nanti-foundationalism. Philosophical anarchism can mean either a theory\nof political life that is skeptical of attempts to justify state\nauthority or a philosophical theory that is skeptical of the attempt\nto assert firm foundations for knowledge.\n\nThere are various forms of anarchism. Uniting this variety is the\ngeneral critique of centralized, hierarchical power and authority.\nGiven that authority, centralization, and hierarchy show up in various\nways and in different discourses, institutions, and practices, it is\nnot surprising that the anarchist critique has been applied in diverse\nways. \nAnarchism is primarily understood as a skeptical theory of political\nlegitimation. The term anarchism is derived from the negation of the\nGreek term arché, which means first principle,\nfoundation, or ruling power. Anarchy is thus rule by no one or\nnon-rule. Some argue that non-ruling occurs when there is rule by\nall—with consensus or unanimity providing an optimistic goal\n(see Depuis-Déri 2010). \nPolitical anarchists focus their critique on state power, viewing\ncentralized, monopolistic coercive power as illegitimate. Anarchists\nthus criticize “the state”. Bakunin provides a paradigm\nhistorical example, saying:  \nIf there is a State, there must be domination of one class by another\nand, as a result, slavery; the State without slavery is\nunthinkable—and this is why we are the enemies of the State.\n(Bakunin 1873 [1990: 178])  \nA more recent example comes from Gerard Casey who writes,\n“states are criminal organizations. All states, not just the\nobviously totalitarian or repressive ones” (Casey 2012: 1).  \nSuch sweeping generalizations are difficult to support. Thus anarchism\nas political philosophy faces the challenge of specificity. States\nhave been organized in various ways. Political power is not\nmonolithic. Sovereignty is a complicated matter that includes\ndivisions and distributions of power (see Fiala 2015). Moreover, the\nhistorical and ideological context of a given anarchist’s\ncritique makes a difference in the content of the political\nanarchist’s critique. Bakunin was responding primarily to a\nMarxist and Hegelian view of the state, offering his critique from\nwithin the global socialist movement; Casey is writing in the\nTwenty-First Century in the era of liberalism and globalization,\noffering his critique from within the movement of contemporary\nlibertarianism. Some anarchists engage in broad generalizations,\naiming for a total critique of political power. Others will present a\nlocalized critique of a given political entity. An ongoing challenge\nfor those who would seek to understand anarchism is to realize how\nhistorically and ideologically diverse approaches fit under the\ngeneral anarchist umbrella. We look at political anarchism in detail\nbelow. \nThe anarchist critique has been extended toward the rejection of\nnon-political centralization and authority. Bakunin extended his\ncritique to include religion, arguing against both God and the State.\nBakunin rejected God as the absolute master, saying famously,\n“if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish\nhim” (Bakunin 1882 [1970: 28]).  \nThere are, however, religious versions of anarchism, which critique\npolitical authority from a standpoint that takes religion seriously.\nRapp (2012) has shown how anarchism can be found in Taoism. And\nRamnath (2011) has identified anarchist threads in Islamic Sufism, in\nHindu bhakti movements, in Sikhism’s anti-caste\nefforts, and in Buddhism. We consider anarchism in connection with\nGandhi below. But we focus here on Christian anarchism. \nChristian anarchist theology views the kingdom of God as lying beyond\nany human principle of structure or order. Christian anarchists offer\nan anti-clerical critique of ecclesiastical and political power.\nTolstoy provides an influential example. Tolstoy claims that\nChristians have a duty not to obey political power and to refuse to\nswear allegiance to political authority (see Tolstoy 1894). Tolstoy\nwas also a pacifist. Christian anarcho-pacifism views the state as\nimmoral and unsupportable because of its connection with military\npower (see Christoyannopoulos 2011). But there are also non-pacifist\nChristian anarchists. Berdyaev, for example, builds upon Tolstoy and\nin his own interpretation of Christian theology. Berdyaev concludes:\n“The Kingdom of God is anarchy” (Berdyaev 1940 [1944: 148]). \nChristian anarchists have gone so far as to found separatist\ncommunities where they live apart from the structures of the state.\nNotable examples include New England transcendentalists such as\nWilliam Garrison and Adin Ballou. These transcendentalists had an\ninfluence on Tolstoy (see Perry 1973 [1995]). \nOther notable Christians with anarchist sympathies include Peter\nMaurin and Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. In more recent\nyears, Christian anarchism has been defended by Jacques Ellul who\nlinks Christian anarchism to a broad social critique. In addition to\nbeing pacifistic, Ellul says, Christian anarchism should also be\n“antinationalist, anticapitalist, moral, and\nantidemocratic” (Ellul 1988 [1991: 13]). The Christian anarchist\nought to be committed to “a true overturning of authorities of\nall kinds” (Ellul 1988 [1991: 14]). When asked whether a\nChristian anarchist should vote, Ellul says no. He states,\n“anarchy first implies conscientious objection” (Ellul\n1988 [1991: 15]).  \nAnarchist rejection of authority has application in epistemology and\nin philosophical and literary theory. One significant usage of the\nterm shows up in American pragmatism. William James described his\npragmatist philosophical theory as a kind of anarchism: “A\nradical pragmatist is a happy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of\ncreature” (James 1907 [1981: 116]). James had anarchist\nsympathies, connected to a general critique of systematic philosophy\n(see Fiala 2013b). Pragmatism, like other anti-systematic and\npost-Hegelian philosophies, gives up on the search for an arché\nor foundation.  \nAnarchism thus shows up as a general critique of prevailing methods.\nAn influential example is found in the work of Paul Feyerabend, whose\nAgainst Method provides an example of “theoretical\nanarchism” in epistemology and philosophy of science (Feyerabend\n1975 [1993]). Feyerabend explains:  \nScience is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism\nis more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its\nlaw-and-order alternatives. (Feyerabend 1975 [1993: 9])  \nHis point is that science ought not be constrained by hierarchically\nimposed principles and strict rule following. \nPost-structuralism and trends in post-modernism and Continental\nphilosophy can also be anarchistic (see May 1994). So-called\n“post-anarchism” is a decentered and free-flowing\ndiscourse that deconstructs power, questions essentialism, and\nundermines systems of authority. Following upon the deconstructive and\ncritical work of authors such as Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and\nothers, this critique of the arché goes all the way down. If\nthere is no arché or foundation, then we are left with a\nproliferation of possibilities. Emerging trends in globalization,\ncyber-space, and post-humanism make the anarchist critique of\n“the state” more complicated, since anarchism’s\ntraditional celebration of liberty and autonomy can be critically scrutinized and\ndeconstructed (see Newman 2016). \nTraditional anarchists were primarily interested in sustained and\nfocused political activism that led toward the abolition of the state.\nThe difference between free-flowing post-anarchism and traditional\nanarchism can be seen in the realm of morality. Anarchism has\ntraditionally been critical of centralized moral authority—but\nthis critique was often based upon fundamental principles and\ntraditional values, such as autonomy or liberty. But\npost-structuralism—along with critiques articulated by some\nfeminists, critical race theorists, and critics of\nEurocentrism—calls these values and principles into question. \nThe broad critical framework provided by the anarchist critique of\nauthority provides a useful theory or methodology for social critique.\nIn more recent iterations, anarchism has been used to critique gender\nhierarchies, racial hierarchies, and the like—also including a\ncritique of human domination over nature. Thus anarchism also\nincludes, to name a few varieties: anarcha-feminism or feminist\nanarchism (see Kornegger 1975), queer anarchism or anarchist queer\ntheory (see Daring et al. 2010), green anarchism or eco-anarchism also\nassociated with anarchist social ecology (see Bookchin 1971 [1986]),\nand even anarcho-veganism or “veganarchism” (see Nocella,\nWhite, & Cudworth 2015). In the anarcho-vegan literature we find\nthe following description of a broad and inclusive anarchism: \nAnarchism is a socio-political theory which opposes all systems of\ndomination and oppression such as racism, ableism, sexism,\nanti-LGBTTQIA, ageism, sizeism, government, competition, capitalism,\ncolonialism, imperialism and punitive justice, and promotes direct\ndemocracy, collaboration, interdependence, mutual aid, diversity,\npeace, transformative justice and equity. (Nocella et al. 2015: 7) \nA thorough-going anarchism would thus offer a critique of anything and\neverything that smacks of hierarchy, domination, centralization, and\nunjustified authority.  \nAnarchists who share these various commitments often act upon their\ncritique of authority by engaging in nonconformist practices (free\nlove, nudism, gender disruption, and so on) or by forming intentional\ncommunities that live “off the grid” and outside of the\nnorms of mainstream culture. In extreme forms this becomes\nanarcho-primitivism or anti-civilizational anarchism (see Zerzan 2008,\n2010; Jensen 2006). Alternative anarchist societies have existed in\nreligious communes in post-Reformation Europe and in the early United\nStates, in Nineteenth Century American utopian communities, the hippy\ncommunes of the Twentieth Century, anarchist squats, temporary\nautonomous zones (see Bey 1985), and occasional gatherings of\nlike-minded people.  \nGiven this sort of antinomianism and non-conformism it is easy to see\nthat anarchism also often includes a radical critique of traditional\nethical norms and principles. Thus radical ethical anarchism can be\ncontrasted with what we might call bourgeois anarchism (with radical\nanarchism seeking to disrupt traditional social norms and bourgeois\nanarchism seeking freedom from the state that does not seek such\ndisruption). And although some argue that anarchists are deeply\nethical—committed to liberty and solidarity—others will\nargue that anarchists are moral nihilists who reject morality entirely\nor who at least reject the idea that there could be a single source of\nmoral authority (see essays in Franks & Wilson 2010).  \nAnarchism in political philosophy maintains that there is no\nlegitimate political or governmental authority. In political\nphilosophy anarchy is an important topic for consideration—even\nfor those who are not anarchists—as the a-political background\ncondition against which various forms of political organization are\narrayed, compared, and justified. Anarchy is often viewed by\nnon-anarchists as the unhappy or unstable condition in which there is\nno legitimate authority. Anarchism as a philosophical idea is not\nnecessarily connected to practical activism. There are political\nanarchists who take action in order to destroy what they see as\nillegitimate states. The popular imagination often views anarchists as\nbomb-throwing nihilists. But philosophical anarchism is a theoretical\nstandpoint. In order to decide who (and whether) one should act upon\nanarchist insight, we require a further theory of political action,\nobligation, and obedience grounded in further ethical reflection.\nSimmons explains that philosophical anarchists “do not take the\nillegitimacy of states to entail a strong moral imperative to oppose\nor eliminate states” (Simmons 2001: 104). Some anarchists remain\nobedient to ruling authorities; others revolt or resist in various\nways. The question of action depends upon a theory of what sort of\npolitical obligation follows from our philosophical, moral, political,\nreligious, and aesthetic commitments.  \nThere is a long history of political anarchism. In the ancient world,\nanarchism of a sort can be found in the ideas of the Epicureans and\nCynics. Kropotkin makes this point in his 1910 encyclopedia article.\nAlthough they did not employ the term anarchism, the Epicureans and\nCynics avoided political activity, advising retreat from political\nlife in pursuit of tranquility (ataraxia) and self-control\n(autarkeai). The Cynics are also known for advocating\ncosmopolitanism: living without allegiance to any particular state or\nlegal system, while associating with human beings based upon moral\nprinciple outside of traditional state structures. Diogenes the Cynic\nhad little respect for political or religious authority. One of his\nguiding ideas was to “deface the currency”. This meant not\nonly devaluing or destroying monetary currency but also a general\nrejection of the norms of civilized society (see Marshall 2010: 69).\nDiogenes often mocked political authorities and failed to offer signs\nof respect. While Diogenes actively disrespected established norms,\nEpicurus counseled retreat. He advised living unnoticed and avoiding\npolitical life (under the phrase me politeuesthai—which\ncan be understood as an anti-political admonition).  \nThe assumption that anarchy would be unhappy or unstable leads to\njustifications of political power. In Hobbes’ famous phrase, in\nthe stateless—anarchic—condition of “the state\nnature” human life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort. Hobbes’ social contract—as well as other versions\nof the social contract theory as found for example in Locke or\nRousseau—are attempts to explain how and why the political state\nemerges from out of the anarchic state of nature.  \nAnarchists respond by claiming that the state tends to produce its own\nsort of unhappiness: as oppressive, violent, corrupt, and inimical to\nliberty. Discussions about the social contract thus revolve around the\nquestion of whether the state is better than anarchy—or whether\nstates and state-like entities naturally and inevitably emerge from\nout of the original condition of anarchy. One version of this argument\nabout the inevitable emergence of states (by way of something like an\n“invisible hand”) is found in Nozick’s influential\nAnarchy, State, Utopia (1974). While Nozick and other\npolitical philosophers take anarchy seriously as a starting point,\nanarchists will argue that invisible hand arguments of this sort\nignore the historical actuality of states, which develop out of a long\nhistory of domination, inequality, and oppression. Murray Rothbard has\nargued against Nozick and social contract theory, saying, “no\nexisting state has been immaculately conceived” (Rothbard 1977:\n46). Different versions of the social contract theory, such as we find\nin John Rawls’s work, view the contract situation as a heuristic\ndevice allowing us to consider justice from under “the veil of\nignorance”. But anarchists will argue that the idea of the\noriginal position does not necessarily lead to the justification of\nthe state—especially given background knowledge about the\ntendency of states to be oppressive. Crispin Sartwell concludes:  \nEven accepting more or less all of the assumptions Rawls packs into\nthe original position, it is not clear that the contractors would not\nchoose anarchy. (Sartwell 2008: 83)  \nThe author of the present essay has described anarchism that results\nfrom a critique of the social contract tradition as “liberal social\ncontract anarchism” (Fiala 2013a).  \nAn important historical touchstone is William Godwin. Unlike Locke and\nHobbes who turned to the social contract to lead us out of the\nanarchic state of nature, Godwin argued that the resulting\ngovernmental power was not necessarily better than anarchy. Locke, of\ncourse, allows for revolution when the state becomes despotic. Godwin\nbuilds upon that insight. He explained, “we must not hastily\nconclude that the mischiefs of anarchy are worse than those which\ngovernment is qualified to produce” (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736). He claimed,  \nIt is earnestly to be desired that each man should be wise enough to\ngovern himself, without the intervention of any compulsory restraint;\nand, since government, even in its best state, is an evil, the object\nprincipally to be aimed at is that we should have as little of it as\nthe general peace of human society will permit. (Godwin 1793: bk III,\nchap. VII, p. 185–6)  \nLike Rousseau, who praised the noble savage, who was free from social\nchains until forced into society, Godwin imagined original anarchy\ndeveloping into the political state, which tended on his view to\nbecome despotic. Once the state comes into being, Godwin suggests that\ndespotism is the primary problem since “despotism is as\nperennial as anarchy is transitory” (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736). \nAnarchism is often taken to mean that individuals ought to be left\nalone without any unifying principle or governing power. In some cases\nanarchism is related to libertarianism (or what is sometimes called\n“anarcho-capitalism”). But non-rule may also occur when\nthere is unanimity or consensus—and hence no need for external\nauthority or a governing structure of command and obedience. If there\nwere unanimity among individuals, there would be no need for\n“ruling”, authority, or government. The ideas of unanimity\nand consensus are associated with the positive conception of anarchism\nas a voluntary association of autonomous human beings, which promotes\ncommunal values. One version of the anarchist ideal imagines the\ndevolution of centralized political authority, leaving us with\ncommunes whose organizational structure is open-ended and consensual.\n \nGiven this emphasis on communal organization it is not surprising that\npolitical anarchism has a close historical association with communism,\ndespite the connection mentioned above with free market capitalism.\nAuthors such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Goldman developed their\nanarchism as a response to Marx and Marxism. One of the first authors\nto explicitly affirm anarchism, Pierre Proudhon, defended a kind of\n“communism”, which he understood as being grounded in\ndecentralized associations, communes, and mutual-aid societies.\nProudhon thought that private property created despotism. He argued\nthat liberty required anarchy, concluding,  \nThe government of man by man (under whatever name it be disguised) is\noppression. Society finds its highest perfection in the union of order\nwith anarchy. (Proudhon 1840 [1876: 286])  \nFollowing Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and the other so-called\n“classical anarchists”, anarchism comes to be seen as a\nfocal point for political philosophy and activism. \nLet’s turn to a conceptual analysis of different arguments made\nin defense of anarchism. \nAnarchists often make categorical claims to the effect that no state\nis legitimate or that there can no such thing as a justifiable\npolitical state. As an absolute or a priori claim, anarchism\nholds that all states always and everywhere are illegitimate and\nunjust. The term “a priori anarchism” is found in\nSimmons 2001; but it is employed already by Kropotkin in his\ninfluential 1910 article on anarchism, where he claims that anarchists\nare not utopians who argue against the state in a priori\nfashion (Kropotkin 1927 [2002: 285]). Despite Kropotkin’s claim,\nsome anarchists do offer a priori arguments against the\nstate. This sort of claim rests upon an account of the justification\nof authority that is usually grounded in some form of deontological\nmoral claim about the importance of individual liberty and a logical\nclaim about the nature of state authority. \nOne typical and well-known example of this argument is found in the\nwork of Robert Paul Wolff. Wolff indicates that legitimate authority\nrests upon a claim about the right to command obedience (Wolff 1970).\nCorrelative to this is a duty to obey: one has a duty to obey\nlegitimate authority. As Wolff explains, by appealing to ideas found\nin Kant and Rousseau, the duty to obey is linked to notions about\nautonomy, responsibility, and rationality. But for Wolff and other\nanarchists, the problem is that the state does not have legitimate\nauthority. As Wolff says of the anarchist, “he will never view\nthe commands of the state as legitimate, as having a binding moral\nforce” (Wolff 1970: 16). The categorical nature of this claim\nindicates a version of absolute anarchism. If the state’s\ncommands are never legitimate and create no moral duty of obedience,\nthen there can never be a legitimate state. Wolff imagines that there\ncould be a legitimate state grounded in “unanimous direct\ndemocracy”—but he indicates that unanimous direct\ndemocracy would be “so restricted in its application that it\noffers no serious hope of ever being embodied in an actual\nstate” (Wolff 1970: 55). Wolff concludes: \nIf all men have a continuing obligation to achieve the highest degree\nof autonomy possible, then there would appear to be no state whose\nsubjects have a moral obligation to obey its commands. Hence, the\nconcept of a de jure legitimate state would appear to be vacuous, and\nphilosophical anarchism would seem to be the only reasonable political\nbelief for an enlightened man. (Wolff 1970: 17) \nAs Wolff puts it here, there appears to be “no state” that\nis legitimate. This claim is stated in absolute and a priori\nfashion, a point made by Reiman in his critique of Wolff (Reiman\n1972). Wolff does not deny, by the way, that there are de facto\nlegitimate states: governments often do have the approval and support\nof the people they govern. But this approval and support is merely\nconventional and not grounded in a moral duty; and approval and\nsupport are manufactured and manipulated by the coercive power and\npropaganda and ideology of the state. \nWe noted here that Wolff’s anarchism is connected to Kant. But\nKant is no anarchist: he defended the idea of enlightened republican\ngovernment in which autonomy would be preserved. Rousseau may be\ncloser to espousing anarchism in some of his remarks—although\nthese are far from systematic (see McLaughlin 2007). Some authors view\nRousseau as espousing something close to “a posteriori\nphilosophical anarchism” (see Bertram 2010 [2017])—which\nwe will define in the next section. Among classical political\nphilosophers, we might also consider Locke in connection with\n“libertarian anarchism” (see Varden 2015) or Locke as\noffering a theory “on the edge of anarchism”, as Simmons\nhas put it (Simmons 1993). But despite his strong defense of\nindividual rights, the stringent way he describes voluntary consent,\nand his advocacy of revolution, Locke believes that states can be\ndefended based upon the social contract theory.  \nLeaving the canonical authors of Western political philosophy aside,\nthe most likely place to find deontological and a priori\nanarchism is among the Christian anarchists. Of course, most\nChristians are not anarchists. But those Christians who espouse\nanarchism usually do so with the absolute, deontological, and a\npriori claims of the sort made by Tolstoy, Berdyaev, and\nEllul—as noted above. \nA less stringent form of anarchism will argue that states could be\njustified in theory—even though, in practice, no state or very\nfew states are actually legitimate. Contingent anarchism will hold\nthat states in the present configuration of things fail to live up to\nthe standards of their own justification. This is an a\nposteriori argument (see Simmons 2001) based both in a\ntheoretical account of the justification of the state (for example,\nthe social contract theory of liberal-democratic theory) and in an\nempirical account of how and why concrete states fail to be justified\nbased upon this theory. The author of the present article has offered\na version of this argument based upon the social contract theory,\nholding that the liberal-democratic social contract theory provides\nthe best theory of the justification of the state, while arguing that\nvery few states actually live up to the promise of the social contract\ntheory (Fiala 2013a). \nOne version of the contingent anarchist argument focuses on the\nquestion of the burden of proof for accounts that would justify\npolitical authority. This approach has been articulated by Noam\nChomsky, who explains: \n[This] is what I have always understood to be the essence of\nanarchism: the conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on\nauthority, and that it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be\nmet. Sometimes the burden can be met. (Chomsky 2005: 178) \nChomsky accepts legitimate authority based in ordinary experience: for example,\nwhen a grandfather prevents a child from darting out into the street.\nBut state authority is a much more complicated affair. Political\nrelationships are attenuated; there is the likelihood of corruption\nand self-interest infecting political reality; there are levels and\ndegrees of mediation, which alienate us from the source of political\nauthority; and the rational autonomy of adults is important and\nfundamental. By focusing on the burden of proof, Chomsky acknowledges\nthat there may be ways to meet the burden of proof for the\njustification of the state. But he points out that there is a prima\nfacie argument against the state—which is based in a complex\nhistorical and empirical account of the role of power, economics, and\nhistorical inertia in creating political institutions. He\nexplains: \nSuch institutions face a heavy burden of proof: it must be shown that\nunder existing conditions, perhaps because of some overriding\nconsideration of deprivation or threat, some form of authority,\nhierarchy, and domination is justified, despite the prima facie case\nagainst it—a burden that can rarely be met. (Chomsky 2005:\n174) \nChomsky does not deny that the burden of proof could be met. Rather,\nhis point is that there is a prima facie case against the state, since\nthe burden of proof for the justification of the state is rarely\nmet. \nContingent anarchism is based in consequentialist reasoning, focused\non details of historical actuality. Consequentialist anarchism will\nappeal to utilitarian considerations, arguing that states generally\nfail to deliver in terms of promoting the happiness of the greater\nnumber of people—and more strongly that state power tends to\nproduce unhappiness. The actuality of inequality, classism, elitism,\nracism, sexism, and other forms of oppression can be used to support\nan anarchist argument, holding that even though a few people benefit\nfrom state power, a larger majority suffers under it. \nThere is a significant difference between anarchism that is offered in\npursuit of utilitarianism’s greater happiness ideal and\nanarchism that is offered in defense of the minority against the\ntyranny of the majority. As we shall see in the next section,\nindividualist anarchists are primarily concerned with the tendency of\nutilitarian politics to sacrifice the rights of individuals in the\nname of the greater good. \nBefore turning to that conception of anarchism, let’s note two\nclassical authors who offer insight into utilitarian anarchism. Godwin\narticulated a form of anarchism that is connected to a utilitarian\nconcern. Godwin’s general moral thought is utilitarian in basic\nconception, even though he also argues based upon fundamental\nprinciples such as the importance of liberty. But Godwin’s\narguments are a posteriori, based upon generalizations from\nhistory and with an eye toward the future development of happiness and\nliberty. He writes: \nAbove all we should not forget, that government is an evil, an\nusurpation upon the private judgment and individual conscience of\nmankind; and that, however we may be obliged to admit it as a\nnecessary evil for the present. (Godwin 1793: bk V, ch. I, p. 380) \nThis claim is similar to Chomsky’s insofar as it recognizes the\ncomplicated nature of the historical dialectic. The goal of political\ndevelopment should be in a direction that goes beyond the state (and\ntoward the development of individual reason and morality). But in our\npresent condition, some form of government may be “a necessary\nevil”, which we ought to strive to overcome. The point here is\nthat our judgments about the justification of the state are\ncontingent: they depend upon present circumstances and our current\nform of development. And while states may be necessary features of the\ncurrent human world, as human beings develop further, it is possible\nthat the state might outlive its usefulness. \nWe should note that utilitarian arguments are often used to support\nstate structures in the name of the greater good. Utilitarian\nanarchists will argue that states fail to do this. But utilitarian\nconclusions are not usually based upon a fundamental appeal to moral\nprinciples such as liberty or the rights of the individual. Thus Bentham\ndescribed claims about human rights as “anarchical\nfallacies” because they tended to lead toward anarchy, which he\nrejected. Bentham described the difference between a moderate\nutilitarian effort at reform and the anarchist’s revolutionary\ndoctrine of human rights, saying that  \nthe anarchist setting up his will and fancy for a law before which all\nmankind are called upon to bow down at the first word—the\nanarchist, trampling on truth and decency, denies the validity of the\nlaw in question,—denies the existence of it in the character of\na law, and calls upon all mankind to rise up in a mass, and resist the\nexecution of it. (Bentham 1843: 498) \nMore principled deontological anarchism will maintain that states\nviolate fundamental rights and so are not justified. But utilitarian\nanarchism will not primarily be worried about the violation of a few\npeople’s rights (although that is obviously a relevant\nconsideration). Rather, the complaint for a utilitarian anarchist is\nthat state structures tend to produce disadvantages for the greater\nnumber of people. Furthermore what Oren Ben-Dor calls\n“utilitarian-based anarchism” is based upon the idea that\nthere is no a priori justification of the state (Ben-Dor\n2000: 101–2). For the utilitarian, this all depends upon the\ncircumstances and conditions. Ben-Dor calls this anarchism because it\nrejects any a priori notion of state justification. In other\nwords, the utilitarian anarchist does not presume that states are\njustifiable; rather a utilitarian anarchist will hold that the burden\nof proof rests upon the defender of states to show that state\nauthority is justifiable on utilitarian grounds, by bringing in\nhistorical and empirical data about human nature, human flourishing,\nand successful social organization. \nForms of anarchism also differ in terms of the content of the theory,\nthe focal point of the anarchist critique, and the imagined practical\nimpact of anarchism. Socialist forms of anarchism include communist\nanarchism associated with Kropotkin and communitarian anarchism (see\nClark 2013). The\nsocialist approach focuses on the development of social and communal\ngroups, which are supposed to thrive outside of hierarchical and\ncentralized political structures. Individualist forms of anarchism\ninclude some forms of libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism as well as\negoistically oriented antinomianism and non-conformism. The\nindividualistic focus rejects group identity and ideas about\nsocial/communal good, while remaining firmly rooted in moral claims\nabout the autonomy of the individual (see Casey 2012).  \nIndividualistic anarchism is historically associated with ideas found\nin Stirner who said, “every state is a despotism” (Stirner\n1844 [1995: 175]). He argued that there was no duty to obey the state\nand the law because the law and the state impair self-development and\nself-will. The state seeks to tame our desires and along with the\nchurch it undermines self-enjoyment and the development of unique\nindividuality. Stirner is even critical of social organizations and\npolitical parties. While not denying that an individual could\naffiliate with such organizations, he maintains that the individual\nretains rights and identity against the party or social organization:\nhe embraces the party; but he ought not allow himself to be\n“embraced and taken up by the party” (Stirner 1844 [1995:\n211]). Individualist anarchism has often been attributed to a variety\nof thinkers including Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker, and Thoreau.\n \nIndividualist anarchism also seems to have something in common with\negoism of the sort associated with Ayn Rand. But Rand dismissed\nanarchism as “a naïve floating abstraction” that\ncould not exist in reality; and she argued that governments properly\nexisted to defend people’s rights (Rand 1964). A more robust\nsort of pro-capitalist anarchism has been defended by Murray Rothbard,\nwho rejects “left-wing anarchism” of the sort he\nassociates with communism, while applauding the individualist\nanarchism of Tucker (Rothbard 2008). Rothbard continues to explain\nthat since anarchism has usually been considered as being primarily a\nleft-wing communist phenomenon, libertarianism should be distinguished\nfrom anarchism by calling it “non-archism” (Rothbard\n2008). A related term has been employed in the literature,\n“min-archism”, which has been used to describe the minimal\nstate that libertarians allow (see Machan 2002). Libertarians are\nstill individualists, who emphasize the importance of individual\nliberty, even though they disagree with full-blown anarchists about\nthe degree to which state power can be justified.  \nIn some cases, individualistic anarchism is merely a matter of\n“lifestyle” (criticized in Bookchin 1995), which focuses\non dress, behavior, and other individualistic choices and preferences.\nBookchin and other critics of lifestyle individualism will argue that\nmere non-conformism does very little to change the status quo and\noverturn structures of domination and authority. But defenders of\nlifestyle non-conformism will argue that there is value in opting out\nof cultural norms and demonstrating contempt for conformity through\nindividual lifestyle choices. \nA more robust form of individualist anarchism will focus on key values\nsuch as autonomy and self-determination, asserting the primacy of the\nindividual over and against social groups. Individualist anarchists\ncan admit that collective action is important and that voluntary\ncooperation among individuals can result in beneficial and autonomy\npreserving community. Remaining disputes will consider whether what\nresults from individual cooperation is a form of capitalism or a form\nof social sharing or communism. Libertarian anarchists or\nanarcho-capitalists will defend free market ideas based upon\nindividual choices in trading and producing goods for market. \nOn the other hand, socialist or communistically oriented\nanarchism will focus more on a sharing economy. This could be a\nlarge form of mutualism or something local and concrete like the\nsharing of family life or the traditional potlatch. But these ideas\nremain anarchist to the extent that they want to avoid centralized\ncontrol and the development of hierarchical structures of domination.\nUnlike state-centered communism of the sort developed by Marxists,\nanarchist communism advocates decentralization. The motto of this\napproach comes from Kropotkin: “all for all”. In The\nConquest of Bread (1892) Kropotkin criticizes monopolistic\ncentralization that prevents people from gaining access to socially\n\ngenerated wealth. The solution is “all for all”:\n\n“What we proclaim is the Right to Well-Being: Well-Being for\nAll!” (Kropotkin 1892 [1995: 20]). The communist idea that all\nhumans should enjoy the fruits of the collective human product shares\nsomething with the Marxist idea of “to each according to his\nneed” (Marx 1875). But Kropotkin argues for the need to evolve beyond\ncentralized communist control—what he criticizes as mere\n“collectivism”—and toward anarchist communism:  \nAnarchy leads to communism, and communism to anarchy, both alike being\nexpressions of the predominant tendency in modern societies, the\npursuit of equality. (Kropotkin 1892 [1995: 31]) \nKropotkin argues that the communal impulse already exists and that the\nadvances in social wealth made possible by the development of\nindividualistic capitalism make it likely that we will develop in the\ndirection of communal sharing. He argues that the tendency of history\nis away from centralized power and toward equality and\nliberty—and toward the abolition of the state. Kropotkin’s\ncommunist anarchism is based upon some historical and empirical\nclaims: about whether things can actually be arranged more\nsatisfactorily without state intervention; and about whether states\nreally do personify injustice and oppression. Libertarianism and\nanarcho-capitalism also think that the free market will work to\nadequately maximize human well-being and help individuals to realize\ntheir own autonomy. But for the socialist and communist anarchists,\nthe question of individual self-realization is less important than the\nidea of social development. Kropotkin’s “all for\nall” indicates a moral and ontological focus that is different\nfrom what we find among the individualists. \nSocialist and communally focused forms of anarchism emphasize the\nimportance of social groups. For example, families can be viewed as\nanarchic structures of social cooperation and solidarity. A social\nanarchist would be critical of hierarchical and domineering forms of\nfamily organization (for example, patriarchal family structure). But\nsocial anarchists will emphasize the point that human identity and\nflourishing occur within extended social structures—so long as\nit remains a free and self-determining community.  \nThe tension between individualist and socialist anarchism comes to a\nhead when considering the question of the degree to which an\nindividual ought to be subordinated to the community. One problem for\nso-called “communitarian” theories of social and political\nlife is that they can result in the submergence of individuals into\nthe communal identity. Individualists will want to struggle against\nthis assault upon autonomy and individual identity. Communalists may\nrespond, as Clark does, by claiming that the ideal of a genuine\ncommunity of autonomous individuals remains a hoped for dream of an\n“impossible community” (Clark 2013). On the other hand communally\nfocused theorists will point out that individual human beings cannot\nexist outside of communal structures: we are social animals who\nflourish and survive in communities. Thus radical individualism also\nremains a dream—and as more politically oriented anarchists will\npoint out, individualism undermines the possibility of organized\npolitical action, which implies that individualist anarchists will be\nunable to successfully resist political structures of domination. \nAnarchism forces us to re-evaluate political activity. Ancient Greek\nphilosophers such as Aristotle and Plato held that human beings\nflourished within just political communities and that there was a\nvirtue in serving the polis. Modern political philosophy tended to\nhold, as well, that political action—including obedience to the\nlaw and the ideal of a rule of law—was noble and enlightened. In\nHegelian political philosophy, these ideas combine in a way that\ncelebrates citizenship and service to the state. And in contemporary\nliberal political philosophy, it is often presumed that obedience\nto the law is required as a prima facie duty (see Reiman\n1972; Gans 1992). Anarchists, of course, call this all into question.\n \nThe crucial question for anarchists is thus whether one ought to\ndisengage from political life, whether one ought to submit to\npolitical authority and obey the law, or whether one ought to engage\nin active efforts to actively abolish the state. Those who opt to work\nactively for the abolition of the state often understand this as a\nform of “direct action” or “propaganda of the\ndeed”. The idea of direct action is often viewed as\ntypical of anarchists, who believe that something ought to be done to\nactively abolish the state including: graffiti, street theater,\norganized occupations, boycotts, and even violence. There are disputes\namong anarchists about what ought to be done, with an important\ndividing line occurring with regard to the question of violence and\ncriminal behavior.  \nBefore turning to that discussion, let’s note one further\nimportant theoretical distinction with regard to the question of\ntaking action, connected to the typology offered above: whether action\nshould be justified in consequentialist or non-consequentialist terms.\nFranks has argued that anarchist direct action ought to exemplify a\nunity of means and ends (Franks 2003). On this view, if liberation and\nautonomy are what anarchists are pursuing, then the methods used to\nobtain these goods must be liberationist and celebrate\nautonomy—and embody this within direct action. Franks argues\nthat the idea that “the end justifies the means” is more\ntypical of state-centered movements, such as Bolshevism—and of\nright-wing movements. While some may think that anarchists are willing\nto engage in action “by any means necessary”, that\nphraseology and the crass consequentialism underlying it is more\ntypical of radical movements which are not anarchist. Coercive\nimposition of the anarchist ideal re-inscribes the problem of\ndomination, hierarchy, centralization, and monopolistic power that the\nanarchist was originally opposed to. \nOne significant philosophical and ethical problem for politically\nengaged anarchists is the question of how to avoid ongoing cycles of\npower and violence that are likely to erupt in the absence of\ncentralized political power. One suggestion, mentioned above, is that\nanarchists will often want to emphasize the unity of means and ends.\nThis idea shows why there is some substantial overlap and conjunction\nbetween anarchism and pacifism. Pacifist typically emphasize the unity\nof means and ends. But not all pacifists are anarchists. However, we\nmentioned above that there is a connection between anarchism and\nChristian pacifism, as found in Tolstoy, for example. Gandhi was\ninfluenced by Tolstoy and the anarchists. Although Gandhi is better\nknown as an anti-colonial activist, Marshall includes Gandhi among the\nanarchists (Marshall 2010: chapter 26). It is possible to reconstruct\nanti-colonial movements and arguments about self-determination and\nhome rule as a kind of anarchism (aimed at destroying colonial power\nand imperial states). Gandhi noted that there were many anarchists\nworking in India in his time. In saying this, Gandhi uses the term\nanarchism to characterize bomb-throwing advocates of violence. He\nsays: “I myself am an anarchist, but of another type”\n(Gandhi 1916 [1956: 134]). Gandhian anarchism, if there is such a\nthing, embraces nonviolence. In general nonviolent resistance as\ndeveloped in the Tolstoy-Gandhi-King tradition fits with an approach\nthat turns away from political power and views the state as a purveyor\nof war and an impediment to equality and human development. \nObjecting to this anarcho-pacifist approach are more militant\nactivists who advocate direct action that can include sabotage and\nother forms of political violence including terrorism. Emma Goldman\nexplains, for example, that anti-capitalist sabotage undermines the\nidea of private possession. While the legal system considers this to\nbe criminal, Goldman contends it is not. She explains,  \nit is ethical in the best sense, since it helps society to get rid of\nits worst foe, the most detrimental factor of social life. Sabotage is\nmainly concerned with obstructing, by every possible method, the\nregular process of production, thereby demonstrating the determination\nof the workers to give according to what they receive, and no more.\n(Goldman 1913 [1998: 94]) \nGoldman struggled with the question of violence through the course of\nher career. Early on she was a more vocal proponent of revolutionary\nviolence. She began to rethink this later. Nonetheless,\nlike other anarchists of her generation, she attributed violence to\nthe state, which she opposed. She writes: \nI believe that Anarchism is the only philosophy of peace, the only\ntheory of the social relationship that values human life above\neverything else. I know that some Anarchists have committed acts of\nviolence, but it is the terrible economic inequality and great\npolitical injustice that prompt such acts, not Anarchism. Every\ninstitution today rests on violence; our very atmosphere is saturated\nwith it. (Goldman 1913 [1998: 59]) \nGoldman views anarchist violence as merely reactive. In response to\nstate violence, the anarchists often argued that they were merely\nusing violence in self-defense. Another defender of violence is\nMalatesta who wrote that the revolution against the violence of the\nruling class must be violent. He explained:  \nI think that a regime which is born of violence and which continues to\nexist by violence cannot be overthrown except by a corresponding and\nproportionate violence. (Malatesta 1925 [2015: 48]) \nLike Goldman, Malatesta warned against violence becoming an end in\nitself and giving way to brutality and ferocity for its own sake. He\nalso described anarchists as preachers of love and advocates of peace.\nHe said,  \nwhat distinguishes the anarchists from all others is in fact their\nhorror of violence, their desire and intention to eliminate physical\nviolence from human relations. (Malatesta 1924 [2015: 46])  \nBut despite this rejection of violence, Malatesta advocates violence\nas a necessary evil. \nAnarchist violence appears as the violence of an individual against\nthe state. It is easy to see why such violence would be characterized\nas terroristic and criminal. For an individual to declare war against\nthe state and take action to disrupt the state is criminal. And thus\nanarchists have also been interested in a critique of crime and\ncriminality—arguing that it is the law and the legal system that\ncreates and produces crime and criminality. This critique was advanced\nby Kropotkin as early as the 1870s, when he called prisons\n“schools for crime”. Similar ideas are found in Foucault\nand in more recent criticisms of mass incarceration. Contemporary\nanarchists will argue that mass incarceration is an example of state\npower run amok.  \nThe question of violence leads us to a further issue: the question of\nobedience, disobedience, resistance, and political obligation. Much\ncould be said here about the nature of political obligation and\nobedience: including whether obedience is merely pragmatic and\nstrategic or based upon notions about loyalty and claims about\nidentification with the nation and its laws. But it is clear that\nanarchists have no principled reason for political obedience. If the\nanarchist views the state as illegitimate, then obedience and\nparticipation are merely a matter of choice, preference, and\npragmatism—and not a matter of loyalty or duty. \nChristian anarchists will look, for example, to the case of Jesus and\nhis idea of rendering unto Caesar what is due to Caesar (Matthew\n22:15–22). The anarchist interpretation of this passage claims\nthat this is an indication both of Jesus’s disaffection with the\nstate and with his grudging acquiescence to political authority.\nChristoyannopoulos argues, “Jesus’ political subversion is\ncarried out through submission rather than revolt”\n(Christoyannopoulos 2010: 156). The crucifixion, on this interpretation,\nis a subversive event, which “unmasks” political power as\n“demonic” and illegitimate. Jesus does not recognize the\nultimate moral and religious authority of Caesar or Pilate. But he\ngoes along with the political regime. Thus some anarchists may simply\nbe compliant and submissive. \nBut politically motivated anarchists encourage resistance to state\npower, including strategic and principled disobedience. Such\ndisobedience could involve symbolic actions—graffiti and the\nlike—or acts of civil resistance, protests, tax resistance and\nso on—up to, and possibly including, sabotage, property crime, and\noutright violence. Again, there is overlap with the discussion of\nviolence here, but let’s set that question aside and focus on\nthe notion of civil disobedience.  \nOne important example is found in Thoreau, who famously explained his\nact of disobedience by tax resistance as follows:  \nIn fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion,\nthough I will still make what use and get what advantage of her I can,\nas is usual in such cases. (Thoreau 1849 [1937: 687])  \nThoreau’s disobedience is principled. He recognizes that a\ndeclaration of war against the state is a criminal act. He willingly\ngoes to jail. But he also admits that he will cooperate with the state\nin other cases—since there is something advantageous about\ncooperation. This indicates the complexity of the question of\ncooperation, protest, and disobedience. Thoreau’s essay,\n“Civil Disobedience” (1849), is often viewed as an\nanarchist manifesto. Kropotkin discussed him as an anarchist\n(Kropotkin 1927 [2002]). And Tolstoy admired his act of civil\ndisobedience—as did Gandhi.  \nAnarchists continue to discuss strategies and tactics of disobedience.\nOne problem throughout this discussion is the degree to which\ndisobedience is effective. If there were to be successful anarchist\ncampaigns of disobedience they would have to be organized and\nwidespread. Whether such campaigns would actually work to disassemble\nthe state apparatus remains an open question.  \nUntil their dreamed-of revolution comes, anarchist must consider the\ndegree to which cooperation with the state involves “selling\nout” to the political status quo. Perhaps there are reforms and\nshort-term gains that can be obtained through traditional political\nmeans: voting, lobbying legislators, etc. But anarchists have often\nheld to an all-or-nothing kind of approach to political participation.\nWe noted above that the Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul has said\nthat he does not vote because anarchy implies conscientious objection.\nBut herein lies a strategic conundrum. If progressively minded\nanarchists opt out of the political system, this means that less\nenlightened policies will prevail. By not voting or otherwise engaging\nin ordinary politics, the anarchist ends up with a system that he or\nshe will be even less happy with than if he or she had actively\nparticipated in the system.  \nThis is, really, a problem of revolution versus reform. The\nrevolutionary wants revolution now, believing that it will occur by\nway of direct action of various sorts. Perhaps the revolutionary is\nalso thinking that the psychological, cultural, and spiritual\nevolution toward revolutionary consciousness can only occur when\ndirect action is taken: in order for anarchism to emerge, the\nanarchist may think, one ought to behave and think like an anarchist.\nBut without a concerted and nation-wide revolution, revolutionary\naction begins to look like mere selfishness, Epicurean opting out, or\nwhat Bookchin criticized as “lifestyle anarchism”.\nMeanwhile those reform-minded folks who work within the system of\npolitical power and legality can end up supporting a system that they\nhave doubts about. This philosophical problem of reform vs. revolution\nexists for all radical political agendas. But the problem is\nespecially acute for anarchists, since anarchism is often an\nall-or-none proposition: if the state is justified then gradualism and\nreformism make sense; but if no state can be justified, then what is\nsometimes called “reformist anarchism” is a non-starter\n(see L. Davis 2012). \nMany anarchists are revolutionaries who want change to be created\nthrough direct action. But given our preceding discussion of violence,\ndisobedience, and the potential for success of revolutionary activity,\nthe question arises about opting-out of political life. The Epicureans\nand Cynics pointed in this direction. The history of anarchism is\nreplete with efforts to construct anarchist communes that are\nindependent and separated from the rest of state centered political\nlife.  \nWe might pick up the history here with the Christian anarchists and\npacifists of the Reformation: the Mennonites, for example; or the\nQuakers who refused to doff their hats for political authorities and\nwho sought a refuge in Pennsylvania. Indeed, there is an anarchist\nthread to the colonization of North America, as those who were\ndisgruntled with European political and religious hierarchy left for\nthe “new world” or were forced out by the European\nauthorities. In the Seventeenth Century, Anne Hutchinson was cast out\nof the Massachusetts Bay Colony and forced to found a new community,\nwhen she concluded that the idea of government was flawed. Hutchinson\nis considered as one of the first anarchists of North America (see\nStringham 2007). Separatist communities were founded by the New\nEngland abolitionists and transcendentalists, by Josiah Warren, and by\nothers.  \nAnarchist communes were formed in Europe during the Nineteenth Century\nand in Spain during the 1930s. There have been ongoing movements and\norganizations of indigenous peoples and others who inhabit the margins\nof mainstream political life. In the 1960s and 70s, anarchist\nseparatism was reiterated in the Hippy communes and attempts to live\noff the grid and get back to nature. Alternative communes, squats, and spontaneous gatherings continue to occur.  \nSeparatist communities have to consider: the degree to which they give\nup on anarchist direct action against dominant political forces, the\nextent to which they have to accommodate themselves to political\nreality, and the risk that customary hierarchies will be reinstated\nwithin the commune. For the revolutionary anarchist, separatism is a\nstrategy of avoidance that impedes political action. Separatist\ncommunes must often obey the rules of the dominant political\norganization in order to trade and get connected to the rest of the\nworld. Finally, a complaint made about separatist communes is that\nthey can end up being structured by sexist, classist, and other\nhierarchical organizing principles. One might argue that until the\ndominant culture is revolutionized, separatism will only be a pale\nreflection of the anarchist ideal. And yet, on the other hand,\nadvocates of separatism will argue that the best way for anarchist\nideals to take hold is to demonstrate that they work and to provide an\ninspiration and experimental proving ground for anarchism.  \nIf revolutionary activity is taken off the table, then anarchists are\nleft with various forms of gradualism and reformism. One way this\nmight occur is through the creation of “temporary autonomous\nzones” such as those described by Bey. Along these lines David\nGraeber provides a description of the cultural and spiritual work that\nwould be required in order to prepare the way for anarchist\nrevolution. Graeber says that this would require “liberation in\nthe imaginary”, by which he means that through activism, utopian\ncommunities, and the like there can be a gradual change in the way\npolitical power is imagined and understood (Graeber 2004).\nRevolutionary anarchists will respond to this by arguing that\nliberation in the imaginary is simply imaginary liberation: without\nactual change in the status quo, oppression and inequality continue to\nbe a problem. \nLet’s conclude by considering some standard objections to\nanarchism and typical replies.  \nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\nmerely another name for chaos and for a rejection of order. This\nobjection holds that anarchists are violent and destructive and that\nthey are intent on destroying everything, including morality itself.\n \nReply: This objection does not seem to recognize that\nanarchists come in many varieties. Many anarchists are also\npacifists—and so do not advocate violent revolution. Many other\nanarchists are firmly committed to moral principles such as autonomy,\nliberty, solidarity, and equality. Some anarchists do take their\ncritique of arché in a nihilistic direction that denies ethical\nprinciples. But one can be committed to anarchism, while advocating\nfor caring communities. Indeed, many of the main authors in the\nanarchist tradition believed that the state and the other hierarchical\nand authoritarian structures of contemporary society prevented human\nflourishing. \nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\ninherently unstable. Hobbes and other early modern social contract\ntheories maintain that the state emerges as a necessary response to\nnatural anarchy which keeps order and protects our interests. A\ndifferent theory comes from Nozick, who argues that the\n“night-watchman state” would emerge out of anarchy by an\ninvisible hand process: as people will exercise their liberty and\npurchase protection from a protection agency, which would eventually\nevolve into something like a minimal state. \nReply: Anarchists may argue that the state of nature\nis simply not a state of war and so that Hobbes’s description is\nfalse. Some anarcho-primitivists will argue that things were much\nbetter for human beings in the original state of nature in small\ncommunities living close to the land. Other anarchists might argue\nthat the disadvantages of state organizations—the creation of\nhierarchies, monopolies, inequalities, and the like—simply\noutweigh the benefits of state structures; and that rational agents\nwould choose to remain in anarchy rather than allow the state to\nevolve. Some anarchists may argue that each time a state emerges, it\nwould have to be destroyed. But others will argue that education and\nhuman development (including technological development) would prevent\nthe reemergence of the state. \nObjection: This objection holds that there simply is\nno way to destroy or deconstruct the state. So exercises in anarchist\npolitical theory are fruitless. It would be better, from this point of\nview to focus on critiques of hierarchy, inequality, and threats to\nliberty from within liberal or libertarian political theory—and\nto engage in reforms that occur within the status quo and mainstream\npolitical organization. \nReply: Ideal theory is always in opposition to\nnon-ideal theory. But utopian speculation can be useful for clarifying\nvalues. Thus philosophical anarchism may be a useful exercise that\nhelps us understand our values and commitment, even though political\nanarchism has no hope of succeeding. Furthermore, there are examples\nof successful anarchist communities on a small local scale (for\nexample, in the separatist communities discussed above). These\nconcrete examples can be viewed as experiments in anarchist theory and\npractice.  \nObjection: This objection holds that a political\ntheory that abolishes political structures makes no sense. A related\nconcern arises when anarchism is taken to be a critique of authority in\nevery case and in all senses. If anarchists deny then that there can\nbe any arché whatsoever, then the claim contradicts itself: we\nwould have a ruling theory that states that there is no ruling theory.\nThis sort of criticism is related to standard criticisms of relativism\nand nihilism. Related to this is a more concrete and mundane objection\nthat holds that there can be no anarchist movement or collective\naction, since anarchism is constitutionally opposed to the idea of a\nmovement or collective (since under anarchism there can be no\nauthoritative ruler or set of rules). \nReply: This objection only holds if anarchism is\ntaken to be an all-or-nothing theory of the absolutist variety.\nPolitical anarchists do not necessarily agree with the skeptical\npost-foundationalist critique which holds that there can be no ruling\nprinciple or authority whatsoever. Rather, political anarchists hold\nthat there are legitimate authorities but that political power quickly\nloses its authoritativeness and legitimacy. Furthermore, anarchists\ntend to advocate for a principle and procedure for organization based\nupon voluntarism and mutual aid, as well as unanimity and/or\nconsensus. From this point of view anarchist communities can work very\nwell, provided that they avoid coercive authority. To support this\npoint anarchists will point to historical examples of successful\nanarchist communes. They will also point to ordinary human\nrelations—in families and civil society relationship—which\noperate quite well apart form coercive and hierarchical political\nauthority \nObjection: One objection to philosophical anarchism of the sort\ndiscussed throughout this essay is that it remains merely theoretical.\nSome political anarchists have little patience for abstract discourses\nthat do not engage in direct action. One worry about philosophical\nanarchism is that in failing to act—and in failing to take\nresponsibility for the actions that ought to follow from\nthought—philosophical anarchism remains a bourgeois convenience\nthat actually serves the status quo. Thus when philosophical\nanarchists remain uncommitted in terms of the concrete questions\nraised by anarchism—whether they should obey the law, whether\nthey should vote, and so on—they tend to support the interests\nof defenders of the status quo. \nReply: In response to this objection, one might defend the importance\nof philosophical reflection. It is important to be clear about\nprinciples and ideas before taking action. And with anarchism the\nstakes are quite high. The puzzles created by philosophical anarchism\nare profound. They lead us to question traditional notions of\nsovereignty, political obligation, and so on. They lead us to wonder\nabout cultural and ethical conventions, including also our first\nprinciples regarding the theory and organization of social life. Given\nthe difficulty of resolving many of these questions, the philosophical\nanarchist may hold that caution is in order. Moreover, the\nphilosophical anarchist might also defend the importance of wonder.\nThe anarchist critique gives us reason to wonder about much that we\ntake for granted. Wonder may not change the world in immediate ways or\nlead to direct action. But wonder is an important step in the\ndirection of thoughtful, ethical action.","contact.mail":"afiala@csufresno.edu","contact.domain":"csufresno.edu"}]
