Firstly, in a period when the role of philosophy was\nbeing diminished and trivialized, he persisted with a traditional\nstyle of philosophizing.  Although it remained unfashionable\nthroughout most of his active years, he held to the classic program of\nWestern philosophy: to explain and defend our capacity to attain\nknowledge (so far as that reaches), in the light of that to present a\nwell-reasoned account of the most general and fundamental features of\nReality, and on that basis to propose a wise scheme for the good\nlife. His unswerving allegiance to this project, keeping it alive in\ndark days, has had its reward. At least in Anglophone circles, these\nclassic metaphysical, epistemic and ethical issues are once more\nfirmly on the agenda.\n\n\n\nWilliams’ own contributions belong to the epistemic and\nmetaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side\n(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately “pure\npostulate” (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our\nworld he proposed an empirically informed materialistic\nnaturalism. Among its distinctive features, he champions a\n4-dimensional space-time which accords equal status to Past, Present,\nand Future.\n\n\n\nThirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful\ntheory of the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are\nthemselves particulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it\nhas come to be known, following Williams’ own usage, has become\none of the standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.\n\n\n\nAnd in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism\non this topic, he developed an original and boldly positive\njustification of inductive inference.\n\n\n\nDonald Williams was born on 28 May 1899 in Crows Landing,\nCalifornia, at that time a strongly rural district, and died in\nFallbrook, also in his beloved California, and also at that time far\nfrom cities, on 16 January 1983. His father was Joseph Cary\nWilliams, who seems to have been a jack of all countrymen’s\ntrades; his mother Lula Crow, a local farmer’s daughter. Donald\nwas the first in his family to pursue an academic education. After\nstudies in English Literature at Occidental College (BA 1923), he went\nto Harvard for his Masters, this time in Philosophy (AM 1925). He\nthen undertook further graduate study in philosophy, first at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (1925–27), then at Harvard, where\nhe took his PhD in 1928. \n\nAlso in 1928 he married Katherine Pressly Adams, from Lamar,\nColorado, whom he had met at Berkeley, where she was something of a\npioneer—a woman graduate student in psychology. In time,\nthere were two sons to the marriage. The couple spent a year in Europe\nin 1928–29 (“immersing himself in Husserl’s Phenomenology\nto the point of immunization”, Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246).\nThen Donald began his life’s work as a Professor of Philosophy,\nfirst spending ten years at the University of California, Los Angeles,\nand then from 1939 until his retirement in 1967, at Harvard. \n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career in philosophy he retained\na down-to-earth realism and naturalism in metaphysics, and a\nconservative outlook on moral and political issues, characteristic of\nhis origins. A stocky, genial, and cheerful man, he found neither the\ncontent nor the validation of ethics to be problematic. Although\noriginally a student of literature, whose first publication was a book\nof poetry, he had not the slightest tincture of literary or academic\nbohemianism. He was among the very least alienated academics of\nhis generation; which is not surprising, as his career was indeed one\nversion of The American Dream. \n\nThe traditional ambition of philosophy, in epistemology and\nmetaphysics, is to provide a systematic account of the extent and\nreliability of our knowledge, and on that basis, to provide a synoptic\nand well-based account of the main features of Reality. When\nWilliams was in his prime, this ambition was largely repudiated as\ninappropriate or unattainable, and a much more modest role for\nphilosophy was proposed. In setting forth his own position, in the\npreface to the collection of his selected essays (1966, p.viii), he\nlists some of these fashionable philosophies from the mid-twentieth\ncentury:  …logical positivism, logical behaviorism,\noperationalism, instrumentalism, the miscellaneous American\nlinguisticisms, the English varieties of Wittgensteinism, the\nExistentialisms, and Zen Buddhism…\n \nEach of these is, in\nits own way, a gospel of relaxation. They all propose that, in place of\nthe struggle to uncover how things are, careful descriptions of how\nthings appear will suffice. None is ambitious enough to set about\nconstructing a positive and systematic epistemology and\nmetaphysics. \n\nUndeterred by this spirit of the age, Williams continued to insist\nthat philosophical issues, including those of traditional metaphysics, are real questions with genuine\nanswers (Fisher 2017). Conceptual analysis, concentration on phenomenological\ndescription, or exploration of the vagaries of language, may have their\n(subordinate) place, but to elevate them to a central position is an\nevasion of philosophy’s main task. \n\nStill worse was the suggestion that philosophical questions are mere\nsurface expressions of a philosopher’s underlying\npsycho-pathology. The claim of Morris Lazerowitz to that effect,\nsuggesting that Bradley’s Absolute Idealism was no more than an\nintellectual’s poorly expressed death wish, or that\nMcTaggart’s argument against the reality of time a panic fear of\nchange, he met with a stern rebuke (1959, pp 133–56). \n\nHe set forth a Realist philosophy on traditional empiricist\nprinciples: “He thought that practically everything was right out\nthere where it belonged” (Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246). He\nmaintained that while all knowledge of fact rests on perceptual\nexperience, it is not limited to the perceptually given, but can be\nextended beyond that by legitimate inference (1934a). In this way his\nRealism can develop the breadth and depth required to do justice to all\nthe scientific techniques which so far surpass mere perception. \n\nWilliams’s empiricism extended to philosophy itself. He\nchallenged the prevailing orthodoxy that philosophy is a purely a\npriori discipline. He emphasized the provisional character of much\nphilosophizing, and the striking absence of knock-down arguments in\nphilosophic controversy (“Having Ideas In The Head” 1966,\n189–211). \n\nFollowing his own prescription for an affirmative and constructive\nphilosophy, Williams worked steadily towards the development of his own\ndistinctive position in metaphysics. He introduced the useful division\nof the subject into Speculative Cosmology, which deals with the basic\nelements making up the world we live in, such as matter, mind, and\nforce, together with the relations between them, and Analytic Ontology,\nwhich explores the fundamental categories, such as Substance and\nProperty, and how they relate to one another. Speculative\nCosmology, in particular, needs to be open to developments in the\nfundamental sciences, and so needs to be seen as always provisional and\na posteriori. Analytic Ontology, the exploration of the\ncategories of being, is a more purely reflective and a priori discipline aiming to\nelucidate the range of different elements in any universe. \n\nTo begin with Speculative Cosmology, Williams’s position has\nthree main features. \nIt is Naturalistic.  The natural world of space, time, and matter,\nwith all its constituents, is a Reality in its own right.  Contrary to\nall Idealist metaphysics, this world, except for the finite minds that\nare to found within it, is independent of any knowing mind.  Moreover,\nit is the only world. There are no divinities or supernatural powers\nbeyond the realm of Nature (“Naturalism and the Nature of\nThings” 1966, pp 212–238). Even mathematical realities\nbelong in the natural world: numbers—at least natural\nones—as abstractions from clusters, and geometrical objects as\nabstractions from space. The philosophy of mathematics was an aspect\nof his position that was never fully worked through. \n\nSecond, his position is not only Naturalist but also Materialist.\nThis Materialism is not of the rather crude kind that supposes that\nevery reality is composed of a solid, crunchy substance, the stuff that\nmakes up the atoms of Greek speculation. Any spatio-temporal\nreality, whether an ‘insubstantial’ property, such as a\ncolor, or something as abstract as a relation, such as\nfarther-away-than, or faster-than, so long as it takes its place as a\nspatio-temporal element at home in the world of physics, is accepted as\npart of this one great spatio-temporal world. Williams’s\nMaterialism is thus one which can accept whatever physical theory\nposits as the most plausible foundation for the natural sciences,\nprovided that it specifies a world which develops according to natural\nlaw, without any teleological (final) causes. \n\nThe Mental is accommodated in the same way. Although Mind is\nunquestionably real, mental facts are as spatio-temporally located as\nany others (“The Existence of Consciousness”, “Mind\nas a Matter of Fact” 1966, pp 23–40, 239–261). The Mental is not\nan independent realm parallel to and equal to the Material, but rather\na tiny, rather insignificant fragment of Being, dependent upon, even if\nnot reducible to, the physical or biological nature of living beings.\nWilliams has a capacious conception of the Material—his\nposition could perhaps be better described as Spatio-Temporal\nNaturalism. \n\nThirdly, Williams’s metaphysics is 4-dimensional. Or,\nmore precisely, given the development of multi-dimensional string\ntheories since his time, it takes Time to be a dimension in the same\nway that Space has dimensions. The first step is to insist, against\nAristotle and his followers, that statements about the future, no less\nthan those concerning the present and the past, are timelessly true or\nfalse. They need not await the event they refer to, in order to gain a\ntruth value (“The Sea Fight Tomorrow” 1966, pp 262–288.)\nThis encourages the further view that the facts that underpin truths\nabout the future are (timelessly) Real. All points in time are\n(timelessly) Real, as are all points on any dimension of our familiar\nSpace. Whatever account is to be given of Change, it does not consist\nin items gaining or losing Reality. This stance receives powerful\nsupport from physical theory. Williams embraced and argued for\nthe conception of Time as a fourth dimension introduced by\nMinkowski’s ‘Block Universe’ interpretation of\nEinstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. A consequence of this is\nthat the experience of the flow or passage of Time must be some sort of\nillusion. Williams embraced that consequence, and argued for it\nin a celebrated paper (‘The Myth of Passage’, 1951). \n\nApart from his Materialistic or Spatio-Temporal Naturalism,\nWilliams’s major contributions to metaphysics lie in the realm of\nontology, and concern the fundamental constituents of Being. His\nkey proposal is that properties are indeed real—in fact Reality\nconsists in nothing but properties—but that these properties are not\nUniversals, as commonly supposed, but particulars with unique\nspatio-temporal locations. The structure of Reality comprises a\nsingle fundamental category, Abstract Particulars, or\n“tropes”. Tropes are particular cases of general\ncharacteristics. A general characteristic, or Universal, such as\nredness or roundness, can occur in any one of indefinitely many\ninstances. Williams’ focus was on the particular case of\nred which occurs as the color, for example, of a particular rose at a\nspecific location in space and time, or the particular case of\ncircularity presented by some particular coin in my hand on a single,\nparticular occasion. These tropes are as particular, and as\ngrounded in place and time, as the more familiar objects, the rose and\nthe coin, to which they belong. \n\nThese tropes are the building blocks of the world. In his analogy,\nthey provide ‘the Alphabet of Being’ from which the\nentities belonging to more complex categories—objects,\nproperties, relations, events—can be constructed, just as\nwords and sentences can be built using the letters of the\nalphabet. Familiar objects such as shoes and ships\nand lumps of sealing wax, and their parts as revealed by empirical\nscientific investigation, such as crystals, molecules and atoms, are\nconcrete particulars or things. In Williams’s scheme,\neach of these consists in a compresent cluster of\ntropes—the particular thing’s particular shape, size,\ntemperature, and consistency, its translucency, or acidity, or positive\ncharge, and so on. All the multitude of different tropes that\ncomprise some single complex particular do so by virtue of their\nsharing one and the same place, or sequence of places, in\nSpace-Time. That is what ‘compresent’ means. There is\nno inner substratum or individuator to hold all the tropes\ntogether. The tropes are individuals in their own right, and do\nnot inhere in any thing-like particular. So Williams’s view\nis a No-Substance theory, or, otherwise described, a theory in which\neach trope is itself a simple Humean substance, capable of independent\nexistence. \n\nUniversal properties and quantities such as acidity and velocity,\nwhich are common to many objects, are not beings in their own right,\nbut resemblance classes of individual tropes. If two\nobjects match in color, both being red, for example, the tropes of\ncolor belonging to each are separate tropes, both being members of the\nclass of similar color tropes which constitutes Redness. \n\nRelations are treated along the same lines. If London is Larger-than\nEdinburgh, and Dublin Larger-than Belfast, we have two instances of the\nLarger-than relation, two relational tropes. And they, along with\ncountless other cases, all belong to the resemblance class whose\nmembers are all and only the cases of Larger-than. This account denies\nthat, literally speaking, there is any single entity which is\nsimultaneously fully present in two different cases of the same color,\nor temperature, or whatever. So it is a No-Universals view, and\noften described as a version of Nominalism. This is\nunderstandable, but it is better to confine the term\n‘Nominalism’ to the denial of the reality of properties at\nall. So far from denying properties, on Williams’s theory the\nentire world consists in nothing but tropes, which are properties\nconstrued as particulars. So his position is better described not as\nNominalist but as Particularist. \n\nTropes provide an elegant and economical base for an ontology.\nUnlike almost all competing ontologies, that of Williams rests on just one basic\ncategory, which can be used in the construction not just of things and\ntheir properties and relations, but of further categories, such as\nevents and processes. Events are replacements of the tropes that are to be\nfound in a given location.\nProcesses are sequences of such changes. Trope theory is well placed to\nfurnish an attractive analysis of causality, as involving power tropes\nthat govern and drive the transformations to be found in events and\nprocesses. \n\nIt can also be of use in other areas of philosophy, for example in\nvaluation theory, where the existence of many tropes, rather than one\nsingle unitary reality, can explain our sometimes divided attitudes\ntoward what, on a Substance ontology, we would regard as the same\nthing. Something can be good in some respects (tropes), but not in\nothers. To view the manifest world as comprising, for the most\npart, clusters of compresent tropes makes explicit the complexity of\nthe realities with which we are ordinarily in contact. Many philosophers have admitted tropes into their scheme of\nthings: Aristotle, Locke, Spinoza and Leibniz, for example. What\nis distinctive in Williams is not that tropes are admitted as a\ncategory, but as the only fundamental category, a trope-based\nform of what Schaffer calls “property primitivism.”\n(Schaffer 2003, 125). All else is constructed out of tropes, including\nconcrete particulars and general properties, whereas tropes themselves\nare not constructed out of anything else, for example, out of a\nsubstance, a universal and the relation of exemplification. Not\nsurprisingly, various aspects of Williams’ trope primitivism have\nbeen subjected to serious philosophical challenges either directly or\nindirectly. Some philosophers reject all forms of property primitivism,\nincluding that of Williams, on the grounds that properties cannot serve\nas the only independent elements of being. They lack the\nrequisite independence, the capacity of existing in any combination\nwith “wholly distinct existences.” There are two ways\nfor this objection to go. (1) Armstrong takes the ostensive fact that\nproperties must be had by objects to establish the dependence of\nproperties on non-property particulars, substrata, and, thus, the\nfalsity of property primitivism (Armstrong 1989, 115). (2)\nAlternately, one can take the apparent fact that there can be no\nproperties that are not clustered with other properties to show that\nproperties cannot play this role. In response to (1), one can challenge the assumption that\nif properties must be had by objects, then they are not capable of\nindependent existence. Ross Cameron, for example, suggests that\nproperties might both be capable of independent existence—including\nexisting without substrata—and not be capable of existing without\nbeing the property of something. (2006, 104). The dependence of\nproperties on objects is compatible with property primitivism if one\nadopts a bundle theory of concrete particulars. In that case,\nproperties are always had by objects since they are always found in\nbundles, even if only a bundle of one, but exist without substrata.\n As for (2), some philosophers reject the requirement that\nif properties are the only ultimate constituents of reality, then they\nmust be capable of existing in isolation from all other wholly distinct\nproperties (Simons 1994; Denkel 1997). Properties can be both the only\nultimate constituents of reality and inter-dependent. This\nresponse requires the rejection of the Humean principle that the basic\nindependent units of being can exist in any combination,\nincluding unaccompanied (Schaffer 2003, 126). A very different\nresponse to (2) rejects the necessity of trope clustering altogether\n(Williams 1966, 97; Campbell 1981, 479; Schaffer 2003). \nPlausible\nthough it be, however, that a color or a shape cannot exist by itself,\nI think we have to reject the notion of a standard of concreteness.\n… (Williams 1966, 97) \n \nAt best, it is a contingent\nmatter that there are no tropes that are not compresent with any other\ntropes—for example, a mass trope on its own. (Campbell goes so\nfar as to suggest that there is reason to think that there are actual\ncases of free-floating tropes (1981, 479)). Even if the trope primitivist can get around these quite\ngeneral objections, there remains the most serious objection to\nWilliams’ brand of trope primitivism, an objection that is\nspecific to Williams’ conception of tropes, depending on more\nthan the assumption that tropes are properties. The charge is that a\nWilliamsonian trope is not genuinely simple, but complex embracing, at\nleast, an element that furnishes the nature or content of the trope,\nand an element providing its particularity (Hochberg 1988; Armstrong\n2005; Moreland 1985; Ehring 2011). In short, Williamsonian tropes\nare constructed out of something else, making them incompatible with\ntrope primitivism. This objection is based on two assumptions. First,\nunder Williams’ conception, the nature of a trope is a\nnon-reducible, intrinsic matter that is not determined by relations to\nanything else, including resemblance relations to other tropes or\nmemberships in various natural classes of tropes. And, second, anything\nthat stands in more than one arbitrarily different relation, each of\nwhich is grounded intrinsically in that entity, must be complex since\nthat entity will have intrinsic “aspects” that are not identical to\neach other. The two relevant relations are numerical difference\nfrom other tropes and resemblance to other tropes, each of which is\ngrounded intrinsically in the trope relata under the Williams\nconception. Hence, there are “intrinsic aspects” of\neach trope that are not identical to each other, a\nparticularity-generating component and a nature-generating\ncomponent. In response to this “complexity” objection,\nCampbell claims that the distinction between a trope’s nature and\nits particularity is merely a “formal” distinction, a\nproduct of different levels of abstraction, and not a real distinction\nbetween different components of a trope. One should no more\ndistinguish a particularity-component from a nature-component of a\ntrope than distinguish components of warmth and orangeness in an orange\ntrope:  To recognize the case of orange as warm is not to find a\nnew feature in it, but to treat it more abstractly, less specifically,\nthan in recognising it as a case of orange. (Campbell 1990, 56–7; further in Maurin 2005) Alternately, Ehring suggests that we grant this objection,\nbut preserve trope simplicity by switching to a non-Williamsonian\nconception of tropes, according to which a trope’s nature is\ndetermined by its memberships in various natural classes of tropes\nrather than intrinsically, thereby sidestepping one of the assumptions\noperative in the objection (2011; discussion in Hakkarainen and Keinänen 2017). Coming under criticism as well is Williams’\nresemblance-based account of general characteristics and property\nagreement. According to Williams, a fully determinate general\ncolor characteristic—say, the shade of red that characterizes this\nshirt and this chair—-is just the set of all tropes that exactly\nresemble the red trope of this shirt. Different objects of that\n“same” shade of red each possess a different trope from\nthis set of exactly similar red tropes. But this analysis seems to\ngenerate an infinite regress. If trope t1 is related to\ntrope t2 by resemblance trope r1, t2\nis related to trope t3 by resemblance trope r2,\nand t3 is related to t1 by resemblance trope\nr3, then these resemblance tropes will also resemble each\nother, giving rise to further resemblance tropes, and so on. To stop\nthis vicious regress, the objection continues, resemblance must be\ntaken to be a universal (Daly 1997, 150). One response to this objection tries to stop the regress\nbefore it starts by denying that there are any resemblance\ntrope-relations holding between tropes. In particular, the trope\ntheorist might follow Oliver’s advise  \nto avoid saying that\nwhen two tropes are exactly similar …, there exists a\nrelation-trope of exact similarity … holding between the two\ntropes. (1996, 37) \n There are no resemblance-tropes\ncorresponding to these resemblance predicates. Another response\ndenies that resemblance relations mark an addition to our ontology and,\nhence, there can be no regress of resemblance relations. Campbell, for\nexample, argues that the successive resemblance relations in the\nregress are nothing over and above the non-relational tropes that\nultimately ground these relations. Since resemblance is an\ninternal relation, it supervenes on these ground-level non-resemblance\ntropes, but supervenient “additions” are not real additions\nto one’s ontology (Campbell 1990, 37). There is also a whole host of objections in the literature\nto Williams’ trope bundle theory. According to Williams, concrete\nparticulars are not substrata instantiating various properties.\nThey are wholly constructed out of tropes, forming bundles of tropes,\nthe trope constituents of which are pairwise tied together by a\ncompresence relation. Compresence, in turn, is collocation for\nWilliams, “the unique congress in the same volume.”\n(In order to allow for non-spatial objects, Williams grants the\npossibility of “locations” in systems analogous to space\n(1966, 79).) One immediate worry, raised by Campbell, is the\npossibility that there may be cases of overlapping objects\ndemonstrating that collocation is not sufficient for compresence (1990,\nfootnote 5, 175). In response, the trope bundle theorist can opt\nfor the view that compresence is non-reducible. However, even with this\nrevision there remain significant objections concerning the possibility\nof accidental properties, the possibility of change, and an apparent\nvicious regress of compresence relations. Bundle theory has been charged with ruling out the\npossibility of accidental properties in concrete particulars.\nBundles of properties have all of their constituent properties\nessentially. Objects generally do not. This chair could have been\nblue instead of red, but the bundle of properties that characterize the\nchair could not have failed to include that red property. One way\naround this objection is proposed by O’Leary-Hawthorne and Cover:\ncombine bundle theory (although for them properties are universals)\nwith a specific account of modality, a counterpart semantics for\nstatements about ordinary particulars (1998). What makes it true\nthat a particular object o could have had different properties is that\na non-identical counterpart to o, n, in another possible world has\ndifferent properties than does o. As long as there is a possible\nworld in which there is a object-bundle, n, that is non-identical\ncounterpart to o and differs from o with respect to its properties,\nthen o could have differed in just that way. Simons suggests a very different approach. He\nproposes to replace unstructured bundles with “nucleus\ntheory.” An object consists of an inner core of essential tropes\nand an outer band of accidental tropes, but no non-property substratum\n(1994). In like manner, bundle theory has been charged with ruling\nout the possibility of change in objects. The same bundle complex\ncannot be composed of one set of property at one time, but a different\nset at a different time. Concrete objects, on the other hand, can\nand do change. In response, it has been suggested that this objection\nloses its force if bundle theory is combined with a\nfour-dimensionalist account of object persistence (Casullo 1988; see\nalso Ehring 2011). For example, if ordinary objects are spacetime worms\nmade up of appropriately related instantaneous temporal parts that are\nthemselves complete bundles of compresent tropes, then change can be\nread as a matter of having different temporal parts that differ in\ntheir constitutive properties. Another response to the\nchange-is-impossible objection is to adopt Simons’ “nucleus\ntheory” in place of traditional bundle theory. Nucleus\ntheory seems to allow for change in the outer band of accidental\nproperties (Simons 1994). Trope bundle theory has also been accused of giving rise to\nBradley-style vicious regress. According to trope bundle theory,\nfor an object o to exist, its tropes must be mutually compresent.\nHowever, it would seem, for trope t1 to be compresent with\ntrope t2, they must be linked by a compresence trope, say,\nc1. But, the existence of t1,\nt2, and c1 is insufficient to make it the case\nthat t1 and t2 are compresent since these tropes\ncould each be parts of different, non-overlapping bundles. So for\nt1 and t2 to be linked by compresence trope\nc1, c1 must be compresent with t1 by\nway of a further compresence relation, say c2 (and with\nt2 by, say, c3) and so on, giving rise to either\na vicious, or at least, uneconomical regress (Maurin 2010, 315).\nIn response, one can try to break the link between the relevant\npredicates and tropes. Oliver suggests that the trope theorist\nshould reject the assumption that there are any relation-tropes\ncorresponding to the predicate “….is compresent\nwith…” even though that predicate has some true\napplications (1996, 37). This response might be indirectly supported by\nreference to Lewis’s claim that it is an impossible task to give\nan analysis of all predications since any analysis will bring into play\na new predication, itself requiring analysis (Lewis 1983,\n353). A second, quite different response is modeled on\nArmstrong’s view that “instantiation” is a\n“tie,” not a relation (since “the thisness and nature are\nincapable of existing apart”), and, hence, it is not subject to a\nrelation regress. (1978, 109). The idea is that the union of compresent\ntropes is too intimate to speak of a relation between them since the\ntropes of the same object could not have existed apart from each\nother. This response, however, requires more than generic\ndependencies—for example, that this specific mass trope requires the\nexistence of some solidity trope or other—since generic dependencies\nwould not guarantee that the specific mass and solidity tropes, say, in\nthis particular bundle could not have existed without being\ncompresent. Maurin provides an alternative response that grants the\nexistence of compresence relation-tropes, but denies the regress on the\ngrounds that relation-tropes, including compresence relations,\nnecessitate the existence of that which they relate. There is no\nneed for further compresence relations holding between a\ncompresence-relation and its terms (2002, 164). A fourth response, from\nEhring, suggests that this regress can be stopped once it is recognized\nthat compresence is a self-relating relation, a relation that can take\nitself as a relatum. The supposed infinite regress for the bundle\ntheorist involves an unending series of compresence tropes,\nc1, c2, …, and cn, but\nthe series, c1, c2, …, and cn\nis taken to be infinite because it is assumed that each “additional”\ncompresence trope is not identical to the immediate preceding\ncompresence trope in the series. However, if compresence is a\n“self-relating” relation, this assumption may be false\n(2011). Finally, there is an objection to the very notion of a\ntrope and, hence, to the foundations of trope primitivism (and,\nperhaps, to any ontology that includes tropes). The idea is that\nif properties are tropes, then exactly similar properties can be\nswapped across objects, but there is no such\npossibility. If the redness of this rose is exactly similar to but\nnumerically distinct from the redness of that rose, then the redness of\nthis rose could have been the redness of that rose and vice\nversa. But this is not really a possibility and, thus, properties\nare not tropes. (Armstrong 1989, 131–132) \n\nA similar argument is based on the possibility of tropes swapping\npositions in space (Campbell 1990, 71). “Property\nswapping,” it is claimed, is an unreal possibility since property\nswapping would make no difference to the world. (Note that the\ncross-object version of this objection cannot get off the ground if\ntropes are not transferable between objects, a view that is found in\n(Martin 1980), although Martin rejects trope primitivism since he\nposits substrata in addition to tropes). \n\n One response to the no-swapping\nobjection, given by Campbell and Labossiere, rejects the assumption\nthat trope swaps would make no difference to the world. For\nexample, although the effects of “swapped” situations would\nbe exactly similar in nature, those effects would differ in their\ncauses (Campbell 1990, 72; Labossiere 1993, 262). Schaffer, on\nthe other hand, denies that the trope theory is automatically committed\nto the possibility of trope swapping (2001). If tropes are\nindividuated by times/locations and a counterpart theory of modality is\nright, then trope swapping is ruled out:  \nThe redness which would be\nhere has exactly the same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations\nas the redness which actually is here, and the same distance relations,\nand hence it is a better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere. (Schaffer 2001, 253). \nWhat is clear is that Williams’ trope ontology remains at the\ncenter of a vibrant and ongoing debate, counting as a serious option\namong a small field of contenders. His brand of trope primitivism\nis certainly of more than merely historical interest. \nWilliams has also left a wider, if less plainly manifest legacy as a \nmetaphysician.  For a discussion of his influence on David Lewis, and \nthrough him on later thinkers, see Fisher 2015. \n\nThe Problem of Induction is the problem of vindicating as rational\nour unavoidable need to generalize beyond our current evidence to\ncomparable cases that we have not yet observed, or that never will be\nobserved. Without inductive inferences of this kind, not only all\nscience but all meaningful conduct of everyday life is paralyzed.\nIndeed, Williams prefaced his philosophical treatment with a\ndeclaration of the evils of inductive skepticism in eroding rational\nstandards in general, even in politics:  \nIn the political sphere,\nthe haphazard echoes of inductive skepticism which reach the\nliberal’s ear deprive him of any rational right to champion\nliberalism, and account already as much as anything for the flabbiness\nof liberal resistance to dogmatic encroachments from the left or the\nright. (Williams 1947, pp 15–20) \n David Hume, in the\neighteenth century, had shown that all such inferences must involve\nrisk: no matter how certain our premises, no inductively reached\nconclusion can have the same degree of certainty. Hume went\nfurther, and held that inductive reasoning provides no rational support\nwhatever for its conclusions. This is Hume’s famous inductive\nscepticism. \n\nWilliams was almost alone in his time in holding not only that the\nproblem does admit of a solution, but in presenting a novel solution of\nhis own. To do this, he needed to argue against Hume, and Hume’s\ntwentieth century successors Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, who had\ndeclared the problem insoluble, and also against contemporaries such as\nP. F. Strawson and Paul Edwards, who had claimed that there was no real\nproblem at all (Russell 1912, Chapter 6; Popper 1959; Edwards 1949, pp\n141–163; Strawson 1952, pp 248–263). Williams tackled the\nproblem head-on. In The Ground of Induction (1947) he makes\noriginal use of results already established in probability theory,\nwhose significance for the problem of induction he was the first to\nappreciate. He treats inductive inference as a special case of the\nproblem of validating sampling techniques. Among any population, that\nis, any class of similar items, there will be a definite proportion\nhaving any possible characteristic. For example, among the population\nof penguins, 100% will be birds, about 50% will be female, some 10%,\nperhaps, will be Emperor penguins, some 35%, perhaps, will be more than\nseven years old, and so on. This is the complexion of the\npopulation, with regard to femaleness, or whatever. \n\nNow in the pure mathematics of the relations between samples and\npopulations, Jacob Bernoulli had in the 18th century established the\nremarkable fact that, for populations of any large size whatever (say\nabove 2500), the vast majority of samples of 2500 or more closely match\nin complexion the population from which they are drawn. In the case of\nour penguins, for example, if the population contains 35% aged 7 years\nor more, well over nine tenths of samples of 2500 penguins will contain\nbetween 33% and 37% aged 7 years or more. This is a necessary, purely\nmathematical, fact. In the language of statistics, the vast\nmajority of reasonably sized samples are representative of\ntheir population, that is, closely resemble it in complexion. \n\nBernoulli’s result enables us to infer from the complexion of\na population to the complexion of most reasonably-sized samples taken\nfrom it, since the complexion of most samples closely resembles the\ncomplexion of the population. Williams’s originality was this: he\nnoticed that resemblance is symmetrical. If we can\nprove, as Bernoulli did, that most samples resemble the population from\nwhich they are drawn, then conversely the population’s complexion\nresembles the complexion of most of the samples. \n\nThis brings us to the problem of induction. What our observations of\nthe natural world provide us with can be regarded as samples from\nlarger populations. For example the penguins we have observed up to\nthis point provide us with a sample of the wider population of all\npenguins, at all times, whether observed or not. What can we infer\nabout this wider population from the sample we have? That, in all\nprobability, the population’s complexion is close to that of the\nsample. We may of course, have an atypical sample before us.\nBut with samples of more than 2500, well over 90% represent the\npopulation fairly closely, so the odds are against it. \n\nThus Williams assimilates the problem of induction to an application\nof the statistical syllogism (also called direct inference or the\nproportional syllogism). A standard syllogism concerns complexions of\n100%, and has a determinate conclusion: if all S are P, and\nthis present item is an S, then it must be P. A\nstatistical syllogism deals with complexions of less than 100%, and its\nconclusion is not definite but only probable: for example, if 95%\nof S are P, this present S is probably P. Some\nlogicians claim that the probability in question is exactly 0.95, but\nWilliams does not need to rely on that additional claim. It is enough\nthat the probability be high. Applying the statistical syllogism to\nWilliams’ reversal of the Bernoulli result, we have: 95% of\nreasonably-sized samples are closely representative of their\npopulation, so the sample we have, provided there are no grounds to\nthink otherwise, is probably one of them. On that basis, we are\nrationally entitled to infer that the population probably closely\nmatches the sample, whose complexion is known to us. The inference is\nonly probable. Induction cannot deliver certainty. In any given case,\nit is abstractly possible that our sample may be a misleading,\nunrepresentative one. But to expect an inference from the observed to\nthe unobserved to yield certainty is to expect the impossible. \n\nWilliams’ treatment of induction created quite a stir when it\nappeared, but attracted criticisms of varying power from commentators\nwedded to more defeatist attitudes, and was eclipsed by the Popperian\nstrategy of replacing an epistemology of confirmation with one that\nfocused on refutation. It thus exercised less influence than it\ndeserves. It is a closely reasoned, deductively argued defense of\nthe rationality of inductive inference, well meriting continued\nattention. \n\nIts reliance on a priori reasoning (as opposed to any contingent\nprinciples such as the “uniformity of nature” or the action\nof laws of nature) means that it should hold in all possible worlds.\nWilliams’ argument would thus be easily defeated by the\nexhibition of a possible world in which inductive reasoning did not\nwork (in the sense of mostly yielding false conclusions). However,\ncritics of Williams have not offered such a possible non-inductive\nworld. Chaotic worlds are not non-inductive (as the induction from\nchaos to more chaos is correct in them), while a world with an\nanti-inductive demon, who falsifies, say, most of the inductive\ninferences I make, is not clearly non-inductive either (since although\nmost of my inductions have false conclusions, it does not\nfollow that most inductions in general have false conclusions). \n\nMarc Lange (2011) does however propose a counterexample, arising from\nthe “purely formal” nature of Williams’\nargument. Should it not apply equally to “grue” as to\n“green”? Objects are grue if they are green up to some\nfuture point in time, and blue thereafter. The problem is to show that\nour sample, to date, of green things is not a sample of things\nactually grue. (Williams’s own views on the grue problem are\ngiven in his “How Reality is Reasonable” in (2018)). \n\nStove (1986, 131–144) argued that his more specific version of\nWilliams’s argument (see below) was not subject to the objection, and\nthat the failure of induction in the case of ‘grue’ showed\nthat inductive logic was not purely formal—but then neither was\ndeductive logic. \n\nOther criticisms arise from the suggestion that the proportional\nsyllogism in general is not a justified form of inference without some\nassumption of randomness. Any proportional syllogism (with exact\nnumbers) is of the form (Or, if we let B be the proposition that the proportion\nof Fs that are G is r, and we\nlet p(h | e) be the conditional\nprobability of hypothesis h on evidence e, then we\ncan express the above proportional syllogism in the language of\nprobability as follows: p(Ga | Fa\n& B) = r.) \n\nDo we not need to assume that a is chosen\n“randomly”, in the sense that all Fs have an\nequal chance of being chosen? Otherwise, how do we know that\na is not chosen with some bias, which would make its\nprobability of being G different from r? \n\nDefenders of the proportional syllogism (McGrew 2003; Campbell and\nFranklin 2004) argue that no assumption of randomness is needed. Any\ninformation about bias would indeed change the probability, but that is\na trivial fact about any argument. An argument infers from given\npremises to a given conclusion; a different argument, with a different\nforce, moves from some other (additional) premises to that conclusion.\nGiven just that the vast majority of airline flights land safely, I can\nhave rational confidence that my flight will land safely, even though\nthere are any number of other possible premises (such as that I have\njust seen the wheels fall off) that would change the probability if I\nadded them to the argument. The fact that the probability of the\nconclusion on other evidence would be different is no reason\nto change the probability assessment on the given evidence. \n\nSimilar reasoning applies to any other property that a may\nhave (or, in the case of the Williams argument, that the sample may\nhave), such as having been observed or being in the past. If there is\nsome positive reason to think that property relevant to the conclusion\n(that a is G), that reason needs to be explained; if\nnot, there is no reason to believe it affects the argument and the\noriginal probability given by the proportional syllogism stands. \n\nSerious criticisms specific to Williams’s argument have been\nbased on claims that the proportional syllogism, though correct in\ngeneral, has been misapplied by Williams. Any proportional\nsyllogism, \nis subject to the objection that, in the case at hand, there is\nactually further information about the Fs that is relevant to\nthe conclusion Ga. For example, in \n\nit is arguable that information is hidden in the proper names that\nis favorably relevant to the younger Smith’s chance of success.\nThe question then is whether the same could happen with the\nproportional syllogism in Williams’ argument for induction. Maher\n(1996) argues that there is such a problem. In this version of\nWilliams’ argument: \n\nis there, typically, any further information about the sample S that\nis relevant to whether it matches the population? The potentially\nrelevant information one has is the proportion in S of the attribute to\nbe predicted (blue, or whatever it might be). Can that be relevant to\nmatching? \n\nIt certainly can be relevant. For example, if the proportion of blue\nitems in the sample is 100%, it suggests that the population proportion\nis close to 100%; that is positively relevant to matching since samples\nof near-homogeneous populations are more likely to match. (For example,\nif the population proportion is 100%, all samples match the\npopulation.) Conversely, fewer samples match the population when the\npopulation proportion is near one half. \n\nDavid Stove (1986), in defending Williams’ argument, proposed\nto avoid this problem by taking a more particular case of the argument\nwhich would not be subject to the objection. Stove proposed: \nIf F is the class of ravens, G the class of black things,\nS a sample of 3020 ravens, r = 0.95, and\n‘match’ means having proportion within 3% of the\npopulation proportion, then it is evident that ‘The proportion\nof Fs that are Gs is\nx’ is not substantially unfavorable to matching (for all x). \nFor even in the worst case, when the proportion of black things is\none half, it is still true that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation (Stove 1986, 66–75). \n\nStove’s reply emphasizes how strong the mathematical truth about\nmatching of samples is: it is not merely that, for any population size\nand proportion, one can find a sample size and degree of match such\nthat samples of that size mostly match; it is the much stronger result\nthat one can fix the sample size and degree of match beforehand,\nwithout needing knowledge of the population size and proportion. For\nexample, the vast majority of 3020-size samples match to within\n3%—irrespective of the population size (provided of course that\nit is larger than 3020) and the proportion of objects with the\ncharacteristic under investigation.. \n\nMaher also objects that the attribute itself, such as\n“blue”, might be a priori relevant to its\nproportion in the sample and hence to matching. For example, if\n“blue” is one of a large range of possible colors,\nthen a priori it is unlikely that an individual is blue and\nunlikely that a sample will have many blue items. As with any Bayesian\nreasoning, a prior probability close to zero (or one) requires a lot\nof evidence to overcome; in this case, we would conclude that a sample\nwith a high proportion of blue items was most likely a coincidence,\nand the posterior probability of the sample matching the population\nwould still not be high. \n\nScott Campbell (2001), in reply to Maher, argues that priors do not\ndominate observations in the way Maher suggests. By analogy, suppose\nthat, while blindfolded, I throw a dart at a dartboard. I am told that\n99 of the 100 spots on the board are the same color, and that there are\n145 choices of color for the spots. After throwing, I observe just the\nspot I have hit and find it is blue. Then (in the absence of further\ninformation), the chance is very high that almost all the other spots\nare blue. The prior improbability of blue does not prevent that. In the\nsame way, the fact that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation gives good reason to suppose that the observed sample does\ntoo, irrespective of any prior information of the kind Maher\nadvances. \n\nWilliams’ defense of induction thus has resources to supply\nanswers to the criticisms that have been made of it. It remains the\nmost objectivist and ambitious justification of induction.","contact.mail":"ccbooks@bigpond.com","contact.domain":"bigpond.com"},{"date.published":"2013-01-28","date.changed":"2019-06-24","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/","author1":"Keith Campbell","author2":"James Franklin","entry":"williams-dc","body.text":"\n\n The published work of Donald Williams (1899–1983) ranges\nacross a broad spectrum in philosophy, but his importance as a\nphilosopher rests in large measure on four major\nachievements. Firstly, in a period when the role of philosophy was\nbeing diminished and trivialized, he persisted with a traditional\nstyle of philosophizing.  Although it remained unfashionable\nthroughout most of his active years, he held to the classic program of\nWestern philosophy: to explain and defend our capacity to attain\nknowledge (so far as that reaches), in the light of that to present a\nwell-reasoned account of the most general and fundamental features of\nReality, and on that basis to propose a wise scheme for the good\nlife. His unswerving allegiance to this project, keeping it alive in\ndark days, has had its reward. At least in Anglophone circles, these\nclassic metaphysical, epistemic and ethical issues are once more\nfirmly on the agenda.\n\n\n\nWilliams’ own contributions belong to the epistemic and\nmetaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side\n(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately “pure\npostulate” (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our\nworld he proposed an empirically informed materialistic\nnaturalism. Among its distinctive features, he champions a\n4-dimensional space-time which accords equal status to Past, Present,\nand Future.\n\n\n\nThirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful\ntheory of the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are\nthemselves particulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it\nhas come to be known, following Williams’ own usage, has become\none of the standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.\n\n\n\nAnd in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism\non this topic, he developed an original and boldly positive\njustification of inductive inference.\n\n\n\nDonald Williams was born on 28 May 1899 in Crows Landing,\nCalifornia, at that time a strongly rural district, and died in\nFallbrook, also in his beloved California, and also at that time far\nfrom cities, on 16 January 1983. His father was Joseph Cary\nWilliams, who seems to have been a jack of all countrymen’s\ntrades; his mother Lula Crow, a local farmer’s daughter. Donald\nwas the first in his family to pursue an academic education. After\nstudies in English Literature at Occidental College (BA 1923), he went\nto Harvard for his Masters, this time in Philosophy (AM 1925). He\nthen undertook further graduate study in philosophy, first at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (1925–27), then at Harvard, where\nhe took his PhD in 1928. \n\nAlso in 1928 he married Katherine Pressly Adams, from Lamar,\nColorado, whom he had met at Berkeley, where she was something of a\npioneer—a woman graduate student in psychology. In time,\nthere were two sons to the marriage. The couple spent a year in Europe\nin 1928–29 (“immersing himself in Husserl’s Phenomenology\nto the point of immunization”, Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246).\nThen Donald began his life’s work as a Professor of Philosophy,\nfirst spending ten years at the University of California, Los Angeles,\nand then from 1939 until his retirement in 1967, at Harvard. \n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career in philosophy he retained\na down-to-earth realism and naturalism in metaphysics, and a\nconservative outlook on moral and political issues, characteristic of\nhis origins. A stocky, genial, and cheerful man, he found neither the\ncontent nor the validation of ethics to be problematic. Although\noriginally a student of literature, whose first publication was a book\nof poetry, he had not the slightest tincture of literary or academic\nbohemianism. He was among the very least alienated academics of\nhis generation; which is not surprising, as his career was indeed one\nversion of The American Dream. \n\nThe traditional ambition of philosophy, in epistemology and\nmetaphysics, is to provide a systematic account of the extent and\nreliability of our knowledge, and on that basis, to provide a synoptic\nand well-based account of the main features of Reality. When\nWilliams was in his prime, this ambition was largely repudiated as\ninappropriate or unattainable, and a much more modest role for\nphilosophy was proposed. In setting forth his own position, in the\npreface to the collection of his selected essays (1966, p.viii), he\nlists some of these fashionable philosophies from the mid-twentieth\ncentury:  …logical positivism, logical behaviorism,\noperationalism, instrumentalism, the miscellaneous American\nlinguisticisms, the English varieties of Wittgensteinism, the\nExistentialisms, and Zen Buddhism…\n \nEach of these is, in\nits own way, a gospel of relaxation. They all propose that, in place of\nthe struggle to uncover how things are, careful descriptions of how\nthings appear will suffice. None is ambitious enough to set about\nconstructing a positive and systematic epistemology and\nmetaphysics. \n\nUndeterred by this spirit of the age, Williams continued to insist\nthat philosophical issues, including those of traditional metaphysics, are real questions with genuine\nanswers (Fisher 2017). Conceptual analysis, concentration on phenomenological\ndescription, or exploration of the vagaries of language, may have their\n(subordinate) place, but to elevate them to a central position is an\nevasion of philosophy’s main task. \n\nStill worse was the suggestion that philosophical questions are mere\nsurface expressions of a philosopher’s underlying\npsycho-pathology. The claim of Morris Lazerowitz to that effect,\nsuggesting that Bradley’s Absolute Idealism was no more than an\nintellectual’s poorly expressed death wish, or that\nMcTaggart’s argument against the reality of time a panic fear of\nchange, he met with a stern rebuke (1959, pp 133–56). \n\nHe set forth a Realist philosophy on traditional empiricist\nprinciples: “He thought that practically everything was right out\nthere where it belonged” (Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246). He\nmaintained that while all knowledge of fact rests on perceptual\nexperience, it is not limited to the perceptually given, but can be\nextended beyond that by legitimate inference (1934a). In this way his\nRealism can develop the breadth and depth required to do justice to all\nthe scientific techniques which so far surpass mere perception. \n\nWilliams’s empiricism extended to philosophy itself. He\nchallenged the prevailing orthodoxy that philosophy is a purely a\npriori discipline. He emphasized the provisional character of much\nphilosophizing, and the striking absence of knock-down arguments in\nphilosophic controversy (“Having Ideas In The Head” 1966,\n189–211). \n\nFollowing his own prescription for an affirmative and constructive\nphilosophy, Williams worked steadily towards the development of his own\ndistinctive position in metaphysics. He introduced the useful division\nof the subject into Speculative Cosmology, which deals with the basic\nelements making up the world we live in, such as matter, mind, and\nforce, together with the relations between them, and Analytic Ontology,\nwhich explores the fundamental categories, such as Substance and\nProperty, and how they relate to one another. Speculative\nCosmology, in particular, needs to be open to developments in the\nfundamental sciences, and so needs to be seen as always provisional and\na posteriori. Analytic Ontology, the exploration of the\ncategories of being, is a more purely reflective and a priori discipline aiming to\nelucidate the range of different elements in any universe. \n\nTo begin with Speculative Cosmology, Williams’s position has\nthree main features. \nIt is Naturalistic.  The natural world of space, time, and matter,\nwith all its constituents, is a Reality in its own right.  Contrary to\nall Idealist metaphysics, this world, except for the finite minds that\nare to found within it, is independent of any knowing mind.  Moreover,\nit is the only world. There are no divinities or supernatural powers\nbeyond the realm of Nature (“Naturalism and the Nature of\nThings” 1966, pp 212–238). Even mathematical realities\nbelong in the natural world: numbers—at least natural\nones—as abstractions from clusters, and geometrical objects as\nabstractions from space. The philosophy of mathematics was an aspect\nof his position that was never fully worked through. \n\nSecond, his position is not only Naturalist but also Materialist.\nThis Materialism is not of the rather crude kind that supposes that\nevery reality is composed of a solid, crunchy substance, the stuff that\nmakes up the atoms of Greek speculation. Any spatio-temporal\nreality, whether an ‘insubstantial’ property, such as a\ncolor, or something as abstract as a relation, such as\nfarther-away-than, or faster-than, so long as it takes its place as a\nspatio-temporal element at home in the world of physics, is accepted as\npart of this one great spatio-temporal world. Williams’s\nMaterialism is thus one which can accept whatever physical theory\nposits as the most plausible foundation for the natural sciences,\nprovided that it specifies a world which develops according to natural\nlaw, without any teleological (final) causes. \n\nThe Mental is accommodated in the same way. Although Mind is\nunquestionably real, mental facts are as spatio-temporally located as\nany others (“The Existence of Consciousness”, “Mind\nas a Matter of Fact” 1966, pp 23–40, 239–261). The Mental is not\nan independent realm parallel to and equal to the Material, but rather\na tiny, rather insignificant fragment of Being, dependent upon, even if\nnot reducible to, the physical or biological nature of living beings.\nWilliams has a capacious conception of the Material—his\nposition could perhaps be better described as Spatio-Temporal\nNaturalism. \n\nThirdly, Williams’s metaphysics is 4-dimensional. Or,\nmore precisely, given the development of multi-dimensional string\ntheories since his time, it takes Time to be a dimension in the same\nway that Space has dimensions. The first step is to insist, against\nAristotle and his followers, that statements about the future, no less\nthan those concerning the present and the past, are timelessly true or\nfalse. They need not await the event they refer to, in order to gain a\ntruth value (“The Sea Fight Tomorrow” 1966, pp 262–288.)\nThis encourages the further view that the facts that underpin truths\nabout the future are (timelessly) Real. All points in time are\n(timelessly) Real, as are all points on any dimension of our familiar\nSpace. Whatever account is to be given of Change, it does not consist\nin items gaining or losing Reality. This stance receives powerful\nsupport from physical theory. Williams embraced and argued for\nthe conception of Time as a fourth dimension introduced by\nMinkowski’s ‘Block Universe’ interpretation of\nEinstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. A consequence of this is\nthat the experience of the flow or passage of Time must be some sort of\nillusion. Williams embraced that consequence, and argued for it\nin a celebrated paper (‘The Myth of Passage’, 1951). \n\nApart from his Materialistic or Spatio-Temporal Naturalism,\nWilliams’s major contributions to metaphysics lie in the realm of\nontology, and concern the fundamental constituents of Being. His\nkey proposal is that properties are indeed real—in fact Reality\nconsists in nothing but properties—but that these properties are not\nUniversals, as commonly supposed, but particulars with unique\nspatio-temporal locations. The structure of Reality comprises a\nsingle fundamental category, Abstract Particulars, or\n“tropes”. Tropes are particular cases of general\ncharacteristics. A general characteristic, or Universal, such as\nredness or roundness, can occur in any one of indefinitely many\ninstances. Williams’ focus was on the particular case of\nred which occurs as the color, for example, of a particular rose at a\nspecific location in space and time, or the particular case of\ncircularity presented by some particular coin in my hand on a single,\nparticular occasion. These tropes are as particular, and as\ngrounded in place and time, as the more familiar objects, the rose and\nthe coin, to which they belong. \n\nThese tropes are the building blocks of the world. In his analogy,\nthey provide ‘the Alphabet of Being’ from which the\nentities belonging to more complex categories—objects,\nproperties, relations, events—can be constructed, just as\nwords and sentences can be built using the letters of the\nalphabet. Familiar objects such as shoes and ships\nand lumps of sealing wax, and their parts as revealed by empirical\nscientific investigation, such as crystals, molecules and atoms, are\nconcrete particulars or things. In Williams’s scheme,\neach of these consists in a compresent cluster of\ntropes—the particular thing’s particular shape, size,\ntemperature, and consistency, its translucency, or acidity, or positive\ncharge, and so on. All the multitude of different tropes that\ncomprise some single complex particular do so by virtue of their\nsharing one and the same place, or sequence of places, in\nSpace-Time. That is what ‘compresent’ means. There is\nno inner substratum or individuator to hold all the tropes\ntogether. The tropes are individuals in their own right, and do\nnot inhere in any thing-like particular. So Williams’s view\nis a No-Substance theory, or, otherwise described, a theory in which\neach trope is itself a simple Humean substance, capable of independent\nexistence. \n\nUniversal properties and quantities such as acidity and velocity,\nwhich are common to many objects, are not beings in their own right,\nbut resemblance classes of individual tropes. If two\nobjects match in color, both being red, for example, the tropes of\ncolor belonging to each are separate tropes, both being members of the\nclass of similar color tropes which constitutes Redness. \n\nRelations are treated along the same lines. If London is Larger-than\nEdinburgh, and Dublin Larger-than Belfast, we have two instances of the\nLarger-than relation, two relational tropes. And they, along with\ncountless other cases, all belong to the resemblance class whose\nmembers are all and only the cases of Larger-than. This account denies\nthat, literally speaking, there is any single entity which is\nsimultaneously fully present in two different cases of the same color,\nor temperature, or whatever. So it is a No-Universals view, and\noften described as a version of Nominalism. This is\nunderstandable, but it is better to confine the term\n‘Nominalism’ to the denial of the reality of properties at\nall. So far from denying properties, on Williams’s theory the\nentire world consists in nothing but tropes, which are properties\nconstrued as particulars. So his position is better described not as\nNominalist but as Particularist. \n\nTropes provide an elegant and economical base for an ontology.\nUnlike almost all competing ontologies, that of Williams rests on just one basic\ncategory, which can be used in the construction not just of things and\ntheir properties and relations, but of further categories, such as\nevents and processes. Events are replacements of the tropes that are to be\nfound in a given location.\nProcesses are sequences of such changes. Trope theory is well placed to\nfurnish an attractive analysis of causality, as involving power tropes\nthat govern and drive the transformations to be found in events and\nprocesses. \n\nIt can also be of use in other areas of philosophy, for example in\nvaluation theory, where the existence of many tropes, rather than one\nsingle unitary reality, can explain our sometimes divided attitudes\ntoward what, on a Substance ontology, we would regard as the same\nthing. Something can be good in some respects (tropes), but not in\nothers. To view the manifest world as comprising, for the most\npart, clusters of compresent tropes makes explicit the complexity of\nthe realities with which we are ordinarily in contact. Many philosophers have admitted tropes into their scheme of\nthings: Aristotle, Locke, Spinoza and Leibniz, for example. What\nis distinctive in Williams is not that tropes are admitted as a\ncategory, but as the only fundamental category, a trope-based\nform of what Schaffer calls “property primitivism.”\n(Schaffer 2003, 125). All else is constructed out of tropes, including\nconcrete particulars and general properties, whereas tropes themselves\nare not constructed out of anything else, for example, out of a\nsubstance, a universal and the relation of exemplification. Not\nsurprisingly, various aspects of Williams’ trope primitivism have\nbeen subjected to serious philosophical challenges either directly or\nindirectly. Some philosophers reject all forms of property primitivism,\nincluding that of Williams, on the grounds that properties cannot serve\nas the only independent elements of being. They lack the\nrequisite independence, the capacity of existing in any combination\nwith “wholly distinct existences.” There are two ways\nfor this objection to go. (1) Armstrong takes the ostensive fact that\nproperties must be had by objects to establish the dependence of\nproperties on non-property particulars, substrata, and, thus, the\nfalsity of property primitivism (Armstrong 1989, 115). (2)\nAlternately, one can take the apparent fact that there can be no\nproperties that are not clustered with other properties to show that\nproperties cannot play this role. In response to (1), one can challenge the assumption that\nif properties must be had by objects, then they are not capable of\nindependent existence. Ross Cameron, for example, suggests that\nproperties might both be capable of independent existence—including\nexisting without substrata—and not be capable of existing without\nbeing the property of something. (2006, 104). The dependence of\nproperties on objects is compatible with property primitivism if one\nadopts a bundle theory of concrete particulars. In that case,\nproperties are always had by objects since they are always found in\nbundles, even if only a bundle of one, but exist without substrata.\n As for (2), some philosophers reject the requirement that\nif properties are the only ultimate constituents of reality, then they\nmust be capable of existing in isolation from all other wholly distinct\nproperties (Simons 1994; Denkel 1997). Properties can be both the only\nultimate constituents of reality and inter-dependent. This\nresponse requires the rejection of the Humean principle that the basic\nindependent units of being can exist in any combination,\nincluding unaccompanied (Schaffer 2003, 126). A very different\nresponse to (2) rejects the necessity of trope clustering altogether\n(Williams 1966, 97; Campbell 1981, 479; Schaffer 2003). \nPlausible\nthough it be, however, that a color or a shape cannot exist by itself,\nI think we have to reject the notion of a standard of concreteness.\n… (Williams 1966, 97) \n \nAt best, it is a contingent\nmatter that there are no tropes that are not compresent with any other\ntropes—for example, a mass trope on its own. (Campbell goes so\nfar as to suggest that there is reason to think that there are actual\ncases of free-floating tropes (1981, 479)). Even if the trope primitivist can get around these quite\ngeneral objections, there remains the most serious objection to\nWilliams’ brand of trope primitivism, an objection that is\nspecific to Williams’ conception of tropes, depending on more\nthan the assumption that tropes are properties. The charge is that a\nWilliamsonian trope is not genuinely simple, but complex embracing, at\nleast, an element that furnishes the nature or content of the trope,\nand an element providing its particularity (Hochberg 1988; Armstrong\n2005; Moreland 1985; Ehring 2011). In short, Williamsonian tropes\nare constructed out of something else, making them incompatible with\ntrope primitivism. This objection is based on two assumptions. First,\nunder Williams’ conception, the nature of a trope is a\nnon-reducible, intrinsic matter that is not determined by relations to\nanything else, including resemblance relations to other tropes or\nmemberships in various natural classes of tropes. And, second, anything\nthat stands in more than one arbitrarily different relation, each of\nwhich is grounded intrinsically in that entity, must be complex since\nthat entity will have intrinsic “aspects” that are not identical to\neach other. The two relevant relations are numerical difference\nfrom other tropes and resemblance to other tropes, each of which is\ngrounded intrinsically in the trope relata under the Williams\nconception. Hence, there are “intrinsic aspects” of\neach trope that are not identical to each other, a\nparticularity-generating component and a nature-generating\ncomponent. In response to this “complexity” objection,\nCampbell claims that the distinction between a trope’s nature and\nits particularity is merely a “formal” distinction, a\nproduct of different levels of abstraction, and not a real distinction\nbetween different components of a trope. One should no more\ndistinguish a particularity-component from a nature-component of a\ntrope than distinguish components of warmth and orangeness in an orange\ntrope:  To recognize the case of orange as warm is not to find a\nnew feature in it, but to treat it more abstractly, less specifically,\nthan in recognising it as a case of orange. (Campbell 1990, 56–7; further in Maurin 2005) Alternately, Ehring suggests that we grant this objection,\nbut preserve trope simplicity by switching to a non-Williamsonian\nconception of tropes, according to which a trope’s nature is\ndetermined by its memberships in various natural classes of tropes\nrather than intrinsically, thereby sidestepping one of the assumptions\noperative in the objection (2011; discussion in Hakkarainen and Keinänen 2017). Coming under criticism as well is Williams’\nresemblance-based account of general characteristics and property\nagreement. According to Williams, a fully determinate general\ncolor characteristic—say, the shade of red that characterizes this\nshirt and this chair—-is just the set of all tropes that exactly\nresemble the red trope of this shirt. Different objects of that\n“same” shade of red each possess a different trope from\nthis set of exactly similar red tropes. But this analysis seems to\ngenerate an infinite regress. If trope t1 is related to\ntrope t2 by resemblance trope r1, t2\nis related to trope t3 by resemblance trope r2,\nand t3 is related to t1 by resemblance trope\nr3, then these resemblance tropes will also resemble each\nother, giving rise to further resemblance tropes, and so on. To stop\nthis vicious regress, the objection continues, resemblance must be\ntaken to be a universal (Daly 1997, 150). One response to this objection tries to stop the regress\nbefore it starts by denying that there are any resemblance\ntrope-relations holding between tropes. In particular, the trope\ntheorist might follow Oliver’s advise  \nto avoid saying that\nwhen two tropes are exactly similar …, there exists a\nrelation-trope of exact similarity … holding between the two\ntropes. (1996, 37) \n There are no resemblance-tropes\ncorresponding to these resemblance predicates. Another response\ndenies that resemblance relations mark an addition to our ontology and,\nhence, there can be no regress of resemblance relations. Campbell, for\nexample, argues that the successive resemblance relations in the\nregress are nothing over and above the non-relational tropes that\nultimately ground these relations. Since resemblance is an\ninternal relation, it supervenes on these ground-level non-resemblance\ntropes, but supervenient “additions” are not real additions\nto one’s ontology (Campbell 1990, 37). There is also a whole host of objections in the literature\nto Williams’ trope bundle theory. According to Williams, concrete\nparticulars are not substrata instantiating various properties.\nThey are wholly constructed out of tropes, forming bundles of tropes,\nthe trope constituents of which are pairwise tied together by a\ncompresence relation. Compresence, in turn, is collocation for\nWilliams, “the unique congress in the same volume.”\n(In order to allow for non-spatial objects, Williams grants the\npossibility of “locations” in systems analogous to space\n(1966, 79).) One immediate worry, raised by Campbell, is the\npossibility that there may be cases of overlapping objects\ndemonstrating that collocation is not sufficient for compresence (1990,\nfootnote 5, 175). In response, the trope bundle theorist can opt\nfor the view that compresence is non-reducible. However, even with this\nrevision there remain significant objections concerning the possibility\nof accidental properties, the possibility of change, and an apparent\nvicious regress of compresence relations. Bundle theory has been charged with ruling out the\npossibility of accidental properties in concrete particulars.\nBundles of properties have all of their constituent properties\nessentially. Objects generally do not. This chair could have been\nblue instead of red, but the bundle of properties that characterize the\nchair could not have failed to include that red property. One way\naround this objection is proposed by O’Leary-Hawthorne and Cover:\ncombine bundle theory (although for them properties are universals)\nwith a specific account of modality, a counterpart semantics for\nstatements about ordinary particulars (1998). What makes it true\nthat a particular object o could have had different properties is that\na non-identical counterpart to o, n, in another possible world has\ndifferent properties than does o. As long as there is a possible\nworld in which there is a object-bundle, n, that is non-identical\ncounterpart to o and differs from o with respect to its properties,\nthen o could have differed in just that way. Simons suggests a very different approach. He\nproposes to replace unstructured bundles with “nucleus\ntheory.” An object consists of an inner core of essential tropes\nand an outer band of accidental tropes, but no non-property substratum\n(1994). In like manner, bundle theory has been charged with ruling\nout the possibility of change in objects. The same bundle complex\ncannot be composed of one set of property at one time, but a different\nset at a different time. Concrete objects, on the other hand, can\nand do change. In response, it has been suggested that this objection\nloses its force if bundle theory is combined with a\nfour-dimensionalist account of object persistence (Casullo 1988; see\nalso Ehring 2011). For example, if ordinary objects are spacetime worms\nmade up of appropriately related instantaneous temporal parts that are\nthemselves complete bundles of compresent tropes, then change can be\nread as a matter of having different temporal parts that differ in\ntheir constitutive properties. Another response to the\nchange-is-impossible objection is to adopt Simons’ “nucleus\ntheory” in place of traditional bundle theory. Nucleus\ntheory seems to allow for change in the outer band of accidental\nproperties (Simons 1994). Trope bundle theory has also been accused of giving rise to\nBradley-style vicious regress. According to trope bundle theory,\nfor an object o to exist, its tropes must be mutually compresent.\nHowever, it would seem, for trope t1 to be compresent with\ntrope t2, they must be linked by a compresence trope, say,\nc1. But, the existence of t1,\nt2, and c1 is insufficient to make it the case\nthat t1 and t2 are compresent since these tropes\ncould each be parts of different, non-overlapping bundles. So for\nt1 and t2 to be linked by compresence trope\nc1, c1 must be compresent with t1 by\nway of a further compresence relation, say c2 (and with\nt2 by, say, c3) and so on, giving rise to either\na vicious, or at least, uneconomical regress (Maurin 2010, 315).\nIn response, one can try to break the link between the relevant\npredicates and tropes. Oliver suggests that the trope theorist\nshould reject the assumption that there are any relation-tropes\ncorresponding to the predicate “….is compresent\nwith…” even though that predicate has some true\napplications (1996, 37). This response might be indirectly supported by\nreference to Lewis’s claim that it is an impossible task to give\nan analysis of all predications since any analysis will bring into play\na new predication, itself requiring analysis (Lewis 1983,\n353). A second, quite different response is modeled on\nArmstrong’s view that “instantiation” is a\n“tie,” not a relation (since “the thisness and nature are\nincapable of existing apart”), and, hence, it is not subject to a\nrelation regress. (1978, 109). The idea is that the union of compresent\ntropes is too intimate to speak of a relation between them since the\ntropes of the same object could not have existed apart from each\nother. This response, however, requires more than generic\ndependencies—for example, that this specific mass trope requires the\nexistence of some solidity trope or other—since generic dependencies\nwould not guarantee that the specific mass and solidity tropes, say, in\nthis particular bundle could not have existed without being\ncompresent. Maurin provides an alternative response that grants the\nexistence of compresence relation-tropes, but denies the regress on the\ngrounds that relation-tropes, including compresence relations,\nnecessitate the existence of that which they relate. There is no\nneed for further compresence relations holding between a\ncompresence-relation and its terms (2002, 164). A fourth response, from\nEhring, suggests that this regress can be stopped once it is recognized\nthat compresence is a self-relating relation, a relation that can take\nitself as a relatum. The supposed infinite regress for the bundle\ntheorist involves an unending series of compresence tropes,\nc1, c2, …, and cn, but\nthe series, c1, c2, …, and cn\nis taken to be infinite because it is assumed that each “additional”\ncompresence trope is not identical to the immediate preceding\ncompresence trope in the series. However, if compresence is a\n“self-relating” relation, this assumption may be false\n(2011). Finally, there is an objection to the very notion of a\ntrope and, hence, to the foundations of trope primitivism (and,\nperhaps, to any ontology that includes tropes). The idea is that\nif properties are tropes, then exactly similar properties can be\nswapped across objects, but there is no such\npossibility. If the redness of this rose is exactly similar to but\nnumerically distinct from the redness of that rose, then the redness of\nthis rose could have been the redness of that rose and vice\nversa. But this is not really a possibility and, thus, properties\nare not tropes. (Armstrong 1989, 131–132) \n\nA similar argument is based on the possibility of tropes swapping\npositions in space (Campbell 1990, 71). “Property\nswapping,” it is claimed, is an unreal possibility since property\nswapping would make no difference to the world. (Note that the\ncross-object version of this objection cannot get off the ground if\ntropes are not transferable between objects, a view that is found in\n(Martin 1980), although Martin rejects trope primitivism since he\nposits substrata in addition to tropes). \n\n One response to the no-swapping\nobjection, given by Campbell and Labossiere, rejects the assumption\nthat trope swaps would make no difference to the world. For\nexample, although the effects of “swapped” situations would\nbe exactly similar in nature, those effects would differ in their\ncauses (Campbell 1990, 72; Labossiere 1993, 262). Schaffer, on\nthe other hand, denies that the trope theory is automatically committed\nto the possibility of trope swapping (2001). If tropes are\nindividuated by times/locations and a counterpart theory of modality is\nright, then trope swapping is ruled out:  \nThe redness which would be\nhere has exactly the same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations\nas the redness which actually is here, and the same distance relations,\nand hence it is a better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere. (Schaffer 2001, 253). \nWhat is clear is that Williams’ trope ontology remains at the\ncenter of a vibrant and ongoing debate, counting as a serious option\namong a small field of contenders. His brand of trope primitivism\nis certainly of more than merely historical interest. \nWilliams has also left a wider, if less plainly manifest legacy as a \nmetaphysician.  For a discussion of his influence on David Lewis, and \nthrough him on later thinkers, see Fisher 2015. \n\nThe Problem of Induction is the problem of vindicating as rational\nour unavoidable need to generalize beyond our current evidence to\ncomparable cases that we have not yet observed, or that never will be\nobserved. Without inductive inferences of this kind, not only all\nscience but all meaningful conduct of everyday life is paralyzed.\nIndeed, Williams prefaced his philosophical treatment with a\ndeclaration of the evils of inductive skepticism in eroding rational\nstandards in general, even in politics:  \nIn the political sphere,\nthe haphazard echoes of inductive skepticism which reach the\nliberal’s ear deprive him of any rational right to champion\nliberalism, and account already as much as anything for the flabbiness\nof liberal resistance to dogmatic encroachments from the left or the\nright. (Williams 1947, pp 15–20) \n David Hume, in the\neighteenth century, had shown that all such inferences must involve\nrisk: no matter how certain our premises, no inductively reached\nconclusion can have the same degree of certainty. Hume went\nfurther, and held that inductive reasoning provides no rational support\nwhatever for its conclusions. This is Hume’s famous inductive\nscepticism. \n\nWilliams was almost alone in his time in holding not only that the\nproblem does admit of a solution, but in presenting a novel solution of\nhis own. To do this, he needed to argue against Hume, and Hume’s\ntwentieth century successors Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, who had\ndeclared the problem insoluble, and also against contemporaries such as\nP. F. Strawson and Paul Edwards, who had claimed that there was no real\nproblem at all (Russell 1912, Chapter 6; Popper 1959; Edwards 1949, pp\n141–163; Strawson 1952, pp 248–263). Williams tackled the\nproblem head-on. In The Ground of Induction (1947) he makes\noriginal use of results already established in probability theory,\nwhose significance for the problem of induction he was the first to\nappreciate. He treats inductive inference as a special case of the\nproblem of validating sampling techniques. Among any population, that\nis, any class of similar items, there will be a definite proportion\nhaving any possible characteristic. For example, among the population\nof penguins, 100% will be birds, about 50% will be female, some 10%,\nperhaps, will be Emperor penguins, some 35%, perhaps, will be more than\nseven years old, and so on. This is the complexion of the\npopulation, with regard to femaleness, or whatever. \n\nNow in the pure mathematics of the relations between samples and\npopulations, Jacob Bernoulli had in the 18th century established the\nremarkable fact that, for populations of any large size whatever (say\nabove 2500), the vast majority of samples of 2500 or more closely match\nin complexion the population from which they are drawn. In the case of\nour penguins, for example, if the population contains 35% aged 7 years\nor more, well over nine tenths of samples of 2500 penguins will contain\nbetween 33% and 37% aged 7 years or more. This is a necessary, purely\nmathematical, fact. In the language of statistics, the vast\nmajority of reasonably sized samples are representative of\ntheir population, that is, closely resemble it in complexion. \n\nBernoulli’s result enables us to infer from the complexion of\na population to the complexion of most reasonably-sized samples taken\nfrom it, since the complexion of most samples closely resembles the\ncomplexion of the population. Williams’s originality was this: he\nnoticed that resemblance is symmetrical. If we can\nprove, as Bernoulli did, that most samples resemble the population from\nwhich they are drawn, then conversely the population’s complexion\nresembles the complexion of most of the samples. \n\nThis brings us to the problem of induction. What our observations of\nthe natural world provide us with can be regarded as samples from\nlarger populations. For example the penguins we have observed up to\nthis point provide us with a sample of the wider population of all\npenguins, at all times, whether observed or not. What can we infer\nabout this wider population from the sample we have? That, in all\nprobability, the population’s complexion is close to that of the\nsample. We may of course, have an atypical sample before us.\nBut with samples of more than 2500, well over 90% represent the\npopulation fairly closely, so the odds are against it. \n\nThus Williams assimilates the problem of induction to an application\nof the statistical syllogism (also called direct inference or the\nproportional syllogism). A standard syllogism concerns complexions of\n100%, and has a determinate conclusion: if all S are P, and\nthis present item is an S, then it must be P. A\nstatistical syllogism deals with complexions of less than 100%, and its\nconclusion is not definite but only probable: for example, if 95%\nof S are P, this present S is probably P. Some\nlogicians claim that the probability in question is exactly 0.95, but\nWilliams does not need to rely on that additional claim. It is enough\nthat the probability be high. Applying the statistical syllogism to\nWilliams’ reversal of the Bernoulli result, we have: 95% of\nreasonably-sized samples are closely representative of their\npopulation, so the sample we have, provided there are no grounds to\nthink otherwise, is probably one of them. On that basis, we are\nrationally entitled to infer that the population probably closely\nmatches the sample, whose complexion is known to us. The inference is\nonly probable. Induction cannot deliver certainty. In any given case,\nit is abstractly possible that our sample may be a misleading,\nunrepresentative one. But to expect an inference from the observed to\nthe unobserved to yield certainty is to expect the impossible. \n\nWilliams’ treatment of induction created quite a stir when it\nappeared, but attracted criticisms of varying power from commentators\nwedded to more defeatist attitudes, and was eclipsed by the Popperian\nstrategy of replacing an epistemology of confirmation with one that\nfocused on refutation. It thus exercised less influence than it\ndeserves. It is a closely reasoned, deductively argued defense of\nthe rationality of inductive inference, well meriting continued\nattention. \n\nIts reliance on a priori reasoning (as opposed to any contingent\nprinciples such as the “uniformity of nature” or the action\nof laws of nature) means that it should hold in all possible worlds.\nWilliams’ argument would thus be easily defeated by the\nexhibition of a possible world in which inductive reasoning did not\nwork (in the sense of mostly yielding false conclusions). However,\ncritics of Williams have not offered such a possible non-inductive\nworld. Chaotic worlds are not non-inductive (as the induction from\nchaos to more chaos is correct in them), while a world with an\nanti-inductive demon, who falsifies, say, most of the inductive\ninferences I make, is not clearly non-inductive either (since although\nmost of my inductions have false conclusions, it does not\nfollow that most inductions in general have false conclusions). \n\nMarc Lange (2011) does however propose a counterexample, arising from\nthe “purely formal” nature of Williams’\nargument. Should it not apply equally to “grue” as to\n“green”? Objects are grue if they are green up to some\nfuture point in time, and blue thereafter. The problem is to show that\nour sample, to date, of green things is not a sample of things\nactually grue. (Williams’s own views on the grue problem are\ngiven in his “How Reality is Reasonable” in (2018)). \n\nStove (1986, 131–144) argued that his more specific version of\nWilliams’s argument (see below) was not subject to the objection, and\nthat the failure of induction in the case of ‘grue’ showed\nthat inductive logic was not purely formal—but then neither was\ndeductive logic. \n\nOther criticisms arise from the suggestion that the proportional\nsyllogism in general is not a justified form of inference without some\nassumption of randomness. Any proportional syllogism (with exact\nnumbers) is of the form (Or, if we let B be the proposition that the proportion\nof Fs that are G is r, and we\nlet p(h | e) be the conditional\nprobability of hypothesis h on evidence e, then we\ncan express the above proportional syllogism in the language of\nprobability as follows: p(Ga | Fa\n& B) = r.) \n\nDo we not need to assume that a is chosen\n“randomly”, in the sense that all Fs have an\nequal chance of being chosen? Otherwise, how do we know that\na is not chosen with some bias, which would make its\nprobability of being G different from r? \n\nDefenders of the proportional syllogism (McGrew 2003; Campbell and\nFranklin 2004) argue that no assumption of randomness is needed. Any\ninformation about bias would indeed change the probability, but that is\na trivial fact about any argument. An argument infers from given\npremises to a given conclusion; a different argument, with a different\nforce, moves from some other (additional) premises to that conclusion.\nGiven just that the vast majority of airline flights land safely, I can\nhave rational confidence that my flight will land safely, even though\nthere are any number of other possible premises (such as that I have\njust seen the wheels fall off) that would change the probability if I\nadded them to the argument. The fact that the probability of the\nconclusion on other evidence would be different is no reason\nto change the probability assessment on the given evidence. \n\nSimilar reasoning applies to any other property that a may\nhave (or, in the case of the Williams argument, that the sample may\nhave), such as having been observed or being in the past. If there is\nsome positive reason to think that property relevant to the conclusion\n(that a is G), that reason needs to be explained; if\nnot, there is no reason to believe it affects the argument and the\noriginal probability given by the proportional syllogism stands. \n\nSerious criticisms specific to Williams’s argument have been\nbased on claims that the proportional syllogism, though correct in\ngeneral, has been misapplied by Williams. Any proportional\nsyllogism, \nis subject to the objection that, in the case at hand, there is\nactually further information about the Fs that is relevant to\nthe conclusion Ga. For example, in \n\nit is arguable that information is hidden in the proper names that\nis favorably relevant to the younger Smith’s chance of success.\nThe question then is whether the same could happen with the\nproportional syllogism in Williams’ argument for induction. Maher\n(1996) argues that there is such a problem. In this version of\nWilliams’ argument: \n\nis there, typically, any further information about the sample S that\nis relevant to whether it matches the population? The potentially\nrelevant information one has is the proportion in S of the attribute to\nbe predicted (blue, or whatever it might be). Can that be relevant to\nmatching? \n\nIt certainly can be relevant. For example, if the proportion of blue\nitems in the sample is 100%, it suggests that the population proportion\nis close to 100%; that is positively relevant to matching since samples\nof near-homogeneous populations are more likely to match. (For example,\nif the population proportion is 100%, all samples match the\npopulation.) Conversely, fewer samples match the population when the\npopulation proportion is near one half. \n\nDavid Stove (1986), in defending Williams’ argument, proposed\nto avoid this problem by taking a more particular case of the argument\nwhich would not be subject to the objection. Stove proposed: \nIf F is the class of ravens, G the class of black things,\nS a sample of 3020 ravens, r = 0.95, and\n‘match’ means having proportion within 3% of the\npopulation proportion, then it is evident that ‘The proportion\nof Fs that are Gs is\nx’ is not substantially unfavorable to matching (for all x). \nFor even in the worst case, when the proportion of black things is\none half, it is still true that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation (Stove 1986, 66–75). \n\nStove’s reply emphasizes how strong the mathematical truth about\nmatching of samples is: it is not merely that, for any population size\nand proportion, one can find a sample size and degree of match such\nthat samples of that size mostly match; it is the much stronger result\nthat one can fix the sample size and degree of match beforehand,\nwithout needing knowledge of the population size and proportion. For\nexample, the vast majority of 3020-size samples match to within\n3%—irrespective of the population size (provided of course that\nit is larger than 3020) and the proportion of objects with the\ncharacteristic under investigation.. \n\nMaher also objects that the attribute itself, such as\n“blue”, might be a priori relevant to its\nproportion in the sample and hence to matching. For example, if\n“blue” is one of a large range of possible colors,\nthen a priori it is unlikely that an individual is blue and\nunlikely that a sample will have many blue items. As with any Bayesian\nreasoning, a prior probability close to zero (or one) requires a lot\nof evidence to overcome; in this case, we would conclude that a sample\nwith a high proportion of blue items was most likely a coincidence,\nand the posterior probability of the sample matching the population\nwould still not be high. \n\nScott Campbell (2001), in reply to Maher, argues that priors do not\ndominate observations in the way Maher suggests. By analogy, suppose\nthat, while blindfolded, I throw a dart at a dartboard. I am told that\n99 of the 100 spots on the board are the same color, and that there are\n145 choices of color for the spots. After throwing, I observe just the\nspot I have hit and find it is blue. Then (in the absence of further\ninformation), the chance is very high that almost all the other spots\nare blue. The prior improbability of blue does not prevent that. In the\nsame way, the fact that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation gives good reason to suppose that the observed sample does\ntoo, irrespective of any prior information of the kind Maher\nadvances. \n\nWilliams’ defense of induction thus has resources to supply\nanswers to the criticisms that have been made of it. It remains the\nmost objectivist and ambitious justification of induction.","contact.mail":"j.franklin@unsw.edu.au","contact.domain":"unsw.edu.au"},{"date.published":"2013-01-28","date.changed":"2019-06-24","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/","author1":"Keith Campbell","author2":"James Franklin","entry":"williams-dc","body.text":"\n\n The published work of Donald Williams (1899–1983) ranges\nacross a broad spectrum in philosophy, but his importance as a\nphilosopher rests in large measure on four major\nachievements. Firstly, in a period when the role of philosophy was\nbeing diminished and trivialized, he persisted with a traditional\nstyle of philosophizing.  Although it remained unfashionable\nthroughout most of his active years, he held to the classic program of\nWestern philosophy: to explain and defend our capacity to attain\nknowledge (so far as that reaches), in the light of that to present a\nwell-reasoned account of the most general and fundamental features of\nReality, and on that basis to propose a wise scheme for the good\nlife. His unswerving allegiance to this project, keeping it alive in\ndark days, has had its reward. At least in Anglophone circles, these\nclassic metaphysical, epistemic and ethical issues are once more\nfirmly on the agenda.\n\n\n\nWilliams’ own contributions belong to the epistemic and\nmetaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side\n(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately “pure\npostulate” (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our\nworld he proposed an empirically informed materialistic\nnaturalism. Among its distinctive features, he champions a\n4-dimensional space-time which accords equal status to Past, Present,\nand Future.\n\n\n\nThirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful\ntheory of the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are\nthemselves particulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it\nhas come to be known, following Williams’ own usage, has become\none of the standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.\n\n\n\nAnd in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism\non this topic, he developed an original and boldly positive\njustification of inductive inference.\n\n\n\nDonald Williams was born on 28 May 1899 in Crows Landing,\nCalifornia, at that time a strongly rural district, and died in\nFallbrook, also in his beloved California, and also at that time far\nfrom cities, on 16 January 1983. His father was Joseph Cary\nWilliams, who seems to have been a jack of all countrymen’s\ntrades; his mother Lula Crow, a local farmer’s daughter. Donald\nwas the first in his family to pursue an academic education. After\nstudies in English Literature at Occidental College (BA 1923), he went\nto Harvard for his Masters, this time in Philosophy (AM 1925). He\nthen undertook further graduate study in philosophy, first at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (1925–27), then at Harvard, where\nhe took his PhD in 1928. \n\nAlso in 1928 he married Katherine Pressly Adams, from Lamar,\nColorado, whom he had met at Berkeley, where she was something of a\npioneer—a woman graduate student in psychology. In time,\nthere were two sons to the marriage. The couple spent a year in Europe\nin 1928–29 (“immersing himself in Husserl’s Phenomenology\nto the point of immunization”, Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246).\nThen Donald began his life’s work as a Professor of Philosophy,\nfirst spending ten years at the University of California, Los Angeles,\nand then from 1939 until his retirement in 1967, at Harvard. \n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career in philosophy he retained\na down-to-earth realism and naturalism in metaphysics, and a\nconservative outlook on moral and political issues, characteristic of\nhis origins. A stocky, genial, and cheerful man, he found neither the\ncontent nor the validation of ethics to be problematic. Although\noriginally a student of literature, whose first publication was a book\nof poetry, he had not the slightest tincture of literary or academic\nbohemianism. He was among the very least alienated academics of\nhis generation; which is not surprising, as his career was indeed one\nversion of The American Dream. \n\nThe traditional ambition of philosophy, in epistemology and\nmetaphysics, is to provide a systematic account of the extent and\nreliability of our knowledge, and on that basis, to provide a synoptic\nand well-based account of the main features of Reality. When\nWilliams was in his prime, this ambition was largely repudiated as\ninappropriate or unattainable, and a much more modest role for\nphilosophy was proposed. In setting forth his own position, in the\npreface to the collection of his selected essays (1966, p.viii), he\nlists some of these fashionable philosophies from the mid-twentieth\ncentury:  …logical positivism, logical behaviorism,\noperationalism, instrumentalism, the miscellaneous American\nlinguisticisms, the English varieties of Wittgensteinism, the\nExistentialisms, and Zen Buddhism…\n \nEach of these is, in\nits own way, a gospel of relaxation. They all propose that, in place of\nthe struggle to uncover how things are, careful descriptions of how\nthings appear will suffice. None is ambitious enough to set about\nconstructing a positive and systematic epistemology and\nmetaphysics. \n\nUndeterred by this spirit of the age, Williams continued to insist\nthat philosophical issues, including those of traditional metaphysics, are real questions with genuine\nanswers (Fisher 2017). Conceptual analysis, concentration on phenomenological\ndescription, or exploration of the vagaries of language, may have their\n(subordinate) place, but to elevate them to a central position is an\nevasion of philosophy’s main task. \n\nStill worse was the suggestion that philosophical questions are mere\nsurface expressions of a philosopher’s underlying\npsycho-pathology. The claim of Morris Lazerowitz to that effect,\nsuggesting that Bradley’s Absolute Idealism was no more than an\nintellectual’s poorly expressed death wish, or that\nMcTaggart’s argument against the reality of time a panic fear of\nchange, he met with a stern rebuke (1959, pp 133–56). \n\nHe set forth a Realist philosophy on traditional empiricist\nprinciples: “He thought that practically everything was right out\nthere where it belonged” (Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p 246). He\nmaintained that while all knowledge of fact rests on perceptual\nexperience, it is not limited to the perceptually given, but can be\nextended beyond that by legitimate inference (1934a). In this way his\nRealism can develop the breadth and depth required to do justice to all\nthe scientific techniques which so far surpass mere perception. \n\nWilliams’s empiricism extended to philosophy itself. He\nchallenged the prevailing orthodoxy that philosophy is a purely a\npriori discipline. He emphasized the provisional character of much\nphilosophizing, and the striking absence of knock-down arguments in\nphilosophic controversy (“Having Ideas In The Head” 1966,\n189–211). \n\nFollowing his own prescription for an affirmative and constructive\nphilosophy, Williams worked steadily towards the development of his own\ndistinctive position in metaphysics. He introduced the useful division\nof the subject into Speculative Cosmology, which deals with the basic\nelements making up the world we live in, such as matter, mind, and\nforce, together with the relations between them, and Analytic Ontology,\nwhich explores the fundamental categories, such as Substance and\nProperty, and how they relate to one another. Speculative\nCosmology, in particular, needs to be open to developments in the\nfundamental sciences, and so needs to be seen as always provisional and\na posteriori. Analytic Ontology, the exploration of the\ncategories of being, is a more purely reflective and a priori discipline aiming to\nelucidate the range of different elements in any universe. \n\nTo begin with Speculative Cosmology, Williams’s position has\nthree main features. \nIt is Naturalistic.  The natural world of space, time, and matter,\nwith all its constituents, is a Reality in its own right.  Contrary to\nall Idealist metaphysics, this world, except for the finite minds that\nare to found within it, is independent of any knowing mind.  Moreover,\nit is the only world. There are no divinities or supernatural powers\nbeyond the realm of Nature (“Naturalism and the Nature of\nThings” 1966, pp 212–238). Even mathematical realities\nbelong in the natural world: numbers—at least natural\nones—as abstractions from clusters, and geometrical objects as\nabstractions from space. The philosophy of mathematics was an aspect\nof his position that was never fully worked through. \n\nSecond, his position is not only Naturalist but also Materialist.\nThis Materialism is not of the rather crude kind that supposes that\nevery reality is composed of a solid, crunchy substance, the stuff that\nmakes up the atoms of Greek speculation. Any spatio-temporal\nreality, whether an ‘insubstantial’ property, such as a\ncolor, or something as abstract as a relation, such as\nfarther-away-than, or faster-than, so long as it takes its place as a\nspatio-temporal element at home in the world of physics, is accepted as\npart of this one great spatio-temporal world. Williams’s\nMaterialism is thus one which can accept whatever physical theory\nposits as the most plausible foundation for the natural sciences,\nprovided that it specifies a world which develops according to natural\nlaw, without any teleological (final) causes. \n\nThe Mental is accommodated in the same way. Although Mind is\nunquestionably real, mental facts are as spatio-temporally located as\nany others (“The Existence of Consciousness”, “Mind\nas a Matter of Fact” 1966, pp 23–40, 239–261). The Mental is not\nan independent realm parallel to and equal to the Material, but rather\na tiny, rather insignificant fragment of Being, dependent upon, even if\nnot reducible to, the physical or biological nature of living beings.\nWilliams has a capacious conception of the Material—his\nposition could perhaps be better described as Spatio-Temporal\nNaturalism. \n\nThirdly, Williams’s metaphysics is 4-dimensional. Or,\nmore precisely, given the development of multi-dimensional string\ntheories since his time, it takes Time to be a dimension in the same\nway that Space has dimensions. The first step is to insist, against\nAristotle and his followers, that statements about the future, no less\nthan those concerning the present and the past, are timelessly true or\nfalse. They need not await the event they refer to, in order to gain a\ntruth value (“The Sea Fight Tomorrow” 1966, pp 262–288.)\nThis encourages the further view that the facts that underpin truths\nabout the future are (timelessly) Real. All points in time are\n(timelessly) Real, as are all points on any dimension of our familiar\nSpace. Whatever account is to be given of Change, it does not consist\nin items gaining or losing Reality. This stance receives powerful\nsupport from physical theory. Williams embraced and argued for\nthe conception of Time as a fourth dimension introduced by\nMinkowski’s ‘Block Universe’ interpretation of\nEinstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. A consequence of this is\nthat the experience of the flow or passage of Time must be some sort of\nillusion. Williams embraced that consequence, and argued for it\nin a celebrated paper (‘The Myth of Passage’, 1951). \n\nApart from his Materialistic or Spatio-Temporal Naturalism,\nWilliams’s major contributions to metaphysics lie in the realm of\nontology, and concern the fundamental constituents of Being. His\nkey proposal is that properties are indeed real—in fact Reality\nconsists in nothing but properties—but that these properties are not\nUniversals, as commonly supposed, but particulars with unique\nspatio-temporal locations. The structure of Reality comprises a\nsingle fundamental category, Abstract Particulars, or\n“tropes”. Tropes are particular cases of general\ncharacteristics. A general characteristic, or Universal, such as\nredness or roundness, can occur in any one of indefinitely many\ninstances. Williams’ focus was on the particular case of\nred which occurs as the color, for example, of a particular rose at a\nspecific location in space and time, or the particular case of\ncircularity presented by some particular coin in my hand on a single,\nparticular occasion. These tropes are as particular, and as\ngrounded in place and time, as the more familiar objects, the rose and\nthe coin, to which they belong. \n\nThese tropes are the building blocks of the world. In his analogy,\nthey provide ‘the Alphabet of Being’ from which the\nentities belonging to more complex categories—objects,\nproperties, relations, events—can be constructed, just as\nwords and sentences can be built using the letters of the\nalphabet. Familiar objects such as shoes and ships\nand lumps of sealing wax, and their parts as revealed by empirical\nscientific investigation, such as crystals, molecules and atoms, are\nconcrete particulars or things. In Williams’s scheme,\neach of these consists in a compresent cluster of\ntropes—the particular thing’s particular shape, size,\ntemperature, and consistency, its translucency, or acidity, or positive\ncharge, and so on. All the multitude of different tropes that\ncomprise some single complex particular do so by virtue of their\nsharing one and the same place, or sequence of places, in\nSpace-Time. That is what ‘compresent’ means. There is\nno inner substratum or individuator to hold all the tropes\ntogether. The tropes are individuals in their own right, and do\nnot inhere in any thing-like particular. So Williams’s view\nis a No-Substance theory, or, otherwise described, a theory in which\neach trope is itself a simple Humean substance, capable of independent\nexistence. \n\nUniversal properties and quantities such as acidity and velocity,\nwhich are common to many objects, are not beings in their own right,\nbut resemblance classes of individual tropes. If two\nobjects match in color, both being red, for example, the tropes of\ncolor belonging to each are separate tropes, both being members of the\nclass of similar color tropes which constitutes Redness. \n\nRelations are treated along the same lines. If London is Larger-than\nEdinburgh, and Dublin Larger-than Belfast, we have two instances of the\nLarger-than relation, two relational tropes. And they, along with\ncountless other cases, all belong to the resemblance class whose\nmembers are all and only the cases of Larger-than. This account denies\nthat, literally speaking, there is any single entity which is\nsimultaneously fully present in two different cases of the same color,\nor temperature, or whatever. So it is a No-Universals view, and\noften described as a version of Nominalism. This is\nunderstandable, but it is better to confine the term\n‘Nominalism’ to the denial of the reality of properties at\nall. So far from denying properties, on Williams’s theory the\nentire world consists in nothing but tropes, which are properties\nconstrued as particulars. So his position is better described not as\nNominalist but as Particularist. \n\nTropes provide an elegant and economical base for an ontology.\nUnlike almost all competing ontologies, that of Williams rests on just one basic\ncategory, which can be used in the construction not just of things and\ntheir properties and relations, but of further categories, such as\nevents and processes. Events are replacements of the tropes that are to be\nfound in a given location.\nProcesses are sequences of such changes. Trope theory is well placed to\nfurnish an attractive analysis of causality, as involving power tropes\nthat govern and drive the transformations to be found in events and\nprocesses. \n\nIt can also be of use in other areas of philosophy, for example in\nvaluation theory, where the existence of many tropes, rather than one\nsingle unitary reality, can explain our sometimes divided attitudes\ntoward what, on a Substance ontology, we would regard as the same\nthing. Something can be good in some respects (tropes), but not in\nothers. To view the manifest world as comprising, for the most\npart, clusters of compresent tropes makes explicit the complexity of\nthe realities with which we are ordinarily in contact. Many philosophers have admitted tropes into their scheme of\nthings: Aristotle, Locke, Spinoza and Leibniz, for example. What\nis distinctive in Williams is not that tropes are admitted as a\ncategory, but as the only fundamental category, a trope-based\nform of what Schaffer calls “property primitivism.”\n(Schaffer 2003, 125). All else is constructed out of tropes, including\nconcrete particulars and general properties, whereas tropes themselves\nare not constructed out of anything else, for example, out of a\nsubstance, a universal and the relation of exemplification. Not\nsurprisingly, various aspects of Williams’ trope primitivism have\nbeen subjected to serious philosophical challenges either directly or\nindirectly. Some philosophers reject all forms of property primitivism,\nincluding that of Williams, on the grounds that properties cannot serve\nas the only independent elements of being. They lack the\nrequisite independence, the capacity of existing in any combination\nwith “wholly distinct existences.” There are two ways\nfor this objection to go. (1) Armstrong takes the ostensive fact that\nproperties must be had by objects to establish the dependence of\nproperties on non-property particulars, substrata, and, thus, the\nfalsity of property primitivism (Armstrong 1989, 115). (2)\nAlternately, one can take the apparent fact that there can be no\nproperties that are not clustered with other properties to show that\nproperties cannot play this role. In response to (1), one can challenge the assumption that\nif properties must be had by objects, then they are not capable of\nindependent existence. Ross Cameron, for example, suggests that\nproperties might both be capable of independent existence—including\nexisting without substrata—and not be capable of existing without\nbeing the property of something. (2006, 104). The dependence of\nproperties on objects is compatible with property primitivism if one\nadopts a bundle theory of concrete particulars. In that case,\nproperties are always had by objects since they are always found in\nbundles, even if only a bundle of one, but exist without substrata.\n As for (2), some philosophers reject the requirement that\nif properties are the only ultimate constituents of reality, then they\nmust be capable of existing in isolation from all other wholly distinct\nproperties (Simons 1994; Denkel 1997). Properties can be both the only\nultimate constituents of reality and inter-dependent. This\nresponse requires the rejection of the Humean principle that the basic\nindependent units of being can exist in any combination,\nincluding unaccompanied (Schaffer 2003, 126). A very different\nresponse to (2) rejects the necessity of trope clustering altogether\n(Williams 1966, 97; Campbell 1981, 479; Schaffer 2003). \nPlausible\nthough it be, however, that a color or a shape cannot exist by itself,\nI think we have to reject the notion of a standard of concreteness.\n… (Williams 1966, 97) \n \nAt best, it is a contingent\nmatter that there are no tropes that are not compresent with any other\ntropes—for example, a mass trope on its own. (Campbell goes so\nfar as to suggest that there is reason to think that there are actual\ncases of free-floating tropes (1981, 479)). Even if the trope primitivist can get around these quite\ngeneral objections, there remains the most serious objection to\nWilliams’ brand of trope primitivism, an objection that is\nspecific to Williams’ conception of tropes, depending on more\nthan the assumption that tropes are properties. The charge is that a\nWilliamsonian trope is not genuinely simple, but complex embracing, at\nleast, an element that furnishes the nature or content of the trope,\nand an element providing its particularity (Hochberg 1988; Armstrong\n2005; Moreland 1985; Ehring 2011). In short, Williamsonian tropes\nare constructed out of something else, making them incompatible with\ntrope primitivism. This objection is based on two assumptions. First,\nunder Williams’ conception, the nature of a trope is a\nnon-reducible, intrinsic matter that is not determined by relations to\nanything else, including resemblance relations to other tropes or\nmemberships in various natural classes of tropes. And, second, anything\nthat stands in more than one arbitrarily different relation, each of\nwhich is grounded intrinsically in that entity, must be complex since\nthat entity will have intrinsic “aspects” that are not identical to\neach other. The two relevant relations are numerical difference\nfrom other tropes and resemblance to other tropes, each of which is\ngrounded intrinsically in the trope relata under the Williams\nconception. Hence, there are “intrinsic aspects” of\neach trope that are not identical to each other, a\nparticularity-generating component and a nature-generating\ncomponent. In response to this “complexity” objection,\nCampbell claims that the distinction between a trope’s nature and\nits particularity is merely a “formal” distinction, a\nproduct of different levels of abstraction, and not a real distinction\nbetween different components of a trope. One should no more\ndistinguish a particularity-component from a nature-component of a\ntrope than distinguish components of warmth and orangeness in an orange\ntrope:  To recognize the case of orange as warm is not to find a\nnew feature in it, but to treat it more abstractly, less specifically,\nthan in recognising it as a case of orange. (Campbell 1990, 56–7; further in Maurin 2005) Alternately, Ehring suggests that we grant this objection,\nbut preserve trope simplicity by switching to a non-Williamsonian\nconception of tropes, according to which a trope’s nature is\ndetermined by its memberships in various natural classes of tropes\nrather than intrinsically, thereby sidestepping one of the assumptions\noperative in the objection (2011; discussion in Hakkarainen and Keinänen 2017). Coming under criticism as well is Williams’\nresemblance-based account of general characteristics and property\nagreement. According to Williams, a fully determinate general\ncolor characteristic—say, the shade of red that characterizes this\nshirt and this chair—-is just the set of all tropes that exactly\nresemble the red trope of this shirt. Different objects of that\n“same” shade of red each possess a different trope from\nthis set of exactly similar red tropes. But this analysis seems to\ngenerate an infinite regress. If trope t1 is related to\ntrope t2 by resemblance trope r1, t2\nis related to trope t3 by resemblance trope r2,\nand t3 is related to t1 by resemblance trope\nr3, then these resemblance tropes will also resemble each\nother, giving rise to further resemblance tropes, and so on. To stop\nthis vicious regress, the objection continues, resemblance must be\ntaken to be a universal (Daly 1997, 150). One response to this objection tries to stop the regress\nbefore it starts by denying that there are any resemblance\ntrope-relations holding between tropes. In particular, the trope\ntheorist might follow Oliver’s advise  \nto avoid saying that\nwhen two tropes are exactly similar …, there exists a\nrelation-trope of exact similarity … holding between the two\ntropes. (1996, 37) \n There are no resemblance-tropes\ncorresponding to these resemblance predicates. Another response\ndenies that resemblance relations mark an addition to our ontology and,\nhence, there can be no regress of resemblance relations. Campbell, for\nexample, argues that the successive resemblance relations in the\nregress are nothing over and above the non-relational tropes that\nultimately ground these relations. Since resemblance is an\ninternal relation, it supervenes on these ground-level non-resemblance\ntropes, but supervenient “additions” are not real additions\nto one’s ontology (Campbell 1990, 37). There is also a whole host of objections in the literature\nto Williams’ trope bundle theory. According to Williams, concrete\nparticulars are not substrata instantiating various properties.\nThey are wholly constructed out of tropes, forming bundles of tropes,\nthe trope constituents of which are pairwise tied together by a\ncompresence relation. Compresence, in turn, is collocation for\nWilliams, “the unique congress in the same volume.”\n(In order to allow for non-spatial objects, Williams grants the\npossibility of “locations” in systems analogous to space\n(1966, 79).) One immediate worry, raised by Campbell, is the\npossibility that there may be cases of overlapping objects\ndemonstrating that collocation is not sufficient for compresence (1990,\nfootnote 5, 175). In response, the trope bundle theorist can opt\nfor the view that compresence is non-reducible. However, even with this\nrevision there remain significant objections concerning the possibility\nof accidental properties, the possibility of change, and an apparent\nvicious regress of compresence relations. Bundle theory has been charged with ruling out the\npossibility of accidental properties in concrete particulars.\nBundles of properties have all of their constituent properties\nessentially. Objects generally do not. This chair could have been\nblue instead of red, but the bundle of properties that characterize the\nchair could not have failed to include that red property. One way\naround this objection is proposed by O’Leary-Hawthorne and Cover:\ncombine bundle theory (although for them properties are universals)\nwith a specific account of modality, a counterpart semantics for\nstatements about ordinary particulars (1998). What makes it true\nthat a particular object o could have had different properties is that\na non-identical counterpart to o, n, in another possible world has\ndifferent properties than does o. As long as there is a possible\nworld in which there is a object-bundle, n, that is non-identical\ncounterpart to o and differs from o with respect to its properties,\nthen o could have differed in just that way. Simons suggests a very different approach. He\nproposes to replace unstructured bundles with “nucleus\ntheory.” An object consists of an inner core of essential tropes\nand an outer band of accidental tropes, but no non-property substratum\n(1994). In like manner, bundle theory has been charged with ruling\nout the possibility of change in objects. The same bundle complex\ncannot be composed of one set of property at one time, but a different\nset at a different time. Concrete objects, on the other hand, can\nand do change. In response, it has been suggested that this objection\nloses its force if bundle theory is combined with a\nfour-dimensionalist account of object persistence (Casullo 1988; see\nalso Ehring 2011). For example, if ordinary objects are spacetime worms\nmade up of appropriately related instantaneous temporal parts that are\nthemselves complete bundles of compresent tropes, then change can be\nread as a matter of having different temporal parts that differ in\ntheir constitutive properties. Another response to the\nchange-is-impossible objection is to adopt Simons’ “nucleus\ntheory” in place of traditional bundle theory. Nucleus\ntheory seems to allow for change in the outer band of accidental\nproperties (Simons 1994). Trope bundle theory has also been accused of giving rise to\nBradley-style vicious regress. According to trope bundle theory,\nfor an object o to exist, its tropes must be mutually compresent.\nHowever, it would seem, for trope t1 to be compresent with\ntrope t2, they must be linked by a compresence trope, say,\nc1. But, the existence of t1,\nt2, and c1 is insufficient to make it the case\nthat t1 and t2 are compresent since these tropes\ncould each be parts of different, non-overlapping bundles. So for\nt1 and t2 to be linked by compresence trope\nc1, c1 must be compresent with t1 by\nway of a further compresence relation, say c2 (and with\nt2 by, say, c3) and so on, giving rise to either\na vicious, or at least, uneconomical regress (Maurin 2010, 315).\nIn response, one can try to break the link between the relevant\npredicates and tropes. Oliver suggests that the trope theorist\nshould reject the assumption that there are any relation-tropes\ncorresponding to the predicate “….is compresent\nwith…” even though that predicate has some true\napplications (1996, 37). This response might be indirectly supported by\nreference to Lewis’s claim that it is an impossible task to give\nan analysis of all predications since any analysis will bring into play\na new predication, itself requiring analysis (Lewis 1983,\n353). A second, quite different response is modeled on\nArmstrong’s view that “instantiation” is a\n“tie,” not a relation (since “the thisness and nature are\nincapable of existing apart”), and, hence, it is not subject to a\nrelation regress. (1978, 109). The idea is that the union of compresent\ntropes is too intimate to speak of a relation between them since the\ntropes of the same object could not have existed apart from each\nother. This response, however, requires more than generic\ndependencies—for example, that this specific mass trope requires the\nexistence of some solidity trope or other—since generic dependencies\nwould not guarantee that the specific mass and solidity tropes, say, in\nthis particular bundle could not have existed without being\ncompresent. Maurin provides an alternative response that grants the\nexistence of compresence relation-tropes, but denies the regress on the\ngrounds that relation-tropes, including compresence relations,\nnecessitate the existence of that which they relate. There is no\nneed for further compresence relations holding between a\ncompresence-relation and its terms (2002, 164). A fourth response, from\nEhring, suggests that this regress can be stopped once it is recognized\nthat compresence is a self-relating relation, a relation that can take\nitself as a relatum. The supposed infinite regress for the bundle\ntheorist involves an unending series of compresence tropes,\nc1, c2, …, and cn, but\nthe series, c1, c2, …, and cn\nis taken to be infinite because it is assumed that each “additional”\ncompresence trope is not identical to the immediate preceding\ncompresence trope in the series. However, if compresence is a\n“self-relating” relation, this assumption may be false\n(2011). Finally, there is an objection to the very notion of a\ntrope and, hence, to the foundations of trope primitivism (and,\nperhaps, to any ontology that includes tropes). The idea is that\nif properties are tropes, then exactly similar properties can be\nswapped across objects, but there is no such\npossibility. If the redness of this rose is exactly similar to but\nnumerically distinct from the redness of that rose, then the redness of\nthis rose could have been the redness of that rose and vice\nversa. But this is not really a possibility and, thus, properties\nare not tropes. (Armstrong 1989, 131–132) \n\nA similar argument is based on the possibility of tropes swapping\npositions in space (Campbell 1990, 71). “Property\nswapping,” it is claimed, is an unreal possibility since property\nswapping would make no difference to the world. (Note that the\ncross-object version of this objection cannot get off the ground if\ntropes are not transferable between objects, a view that is found in\n(Martin 1980), although Martin rejects trope primitivism since he\nposits substrata in addition to tropes). \n\n One response to the no-swapping\nobjection, given by Campbell and Labossiere, rejects the assumption\nthat trope swaps would make no difference to the world. For\nexample, although the effects of “swapped” situations would\nbe exactly similar in nature, those effects would differ in their\ncauses (Campbell 1990, 72; Labossiere 1993, 262). Schaffer, on\nthe other hand, denies that the trope theory is automatically committed\nto the possibility of trope swapping (2001). If tropes are\nindividuated by times/locations and a counterpart theory of modality is\nright, then trope swapping is ruled out:  \nThe redness which would be\nhere has exactly the same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations\nas the redness which actually is here, and the same distance relations,\nand hence it is a better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere. (Schaffer 2001, 253). \nWhat is clear is that Williams’ trope ontology remains at the\ncenter of a vibrant and ongoing debate, counting as a serious option\namong a small field of contenders. His brand of trope primitivism\nis certainly of more than merely historical interest. \nWilliams has also left a wider, if less plainly manifest legacy as a \nmetaphysician.  For a discussion of his influence on David Lewis, and \nthrough him on later thinkers, see Fisher 2015. \n\nThe Problem of Induction is the problem of vindicating as rational\nour unavoidable need to generalize beyond our current evidence to\ncomparable cases that we have not yet observed, or that never will be\nobserved. Without inductive inferences of this kind, not only all\nscience but all meaningful conduct of everyday life is paralyzed.\nIndeed, Williams prefaced his philosophical treatment with a\ndeclaration of the evils of inductive skepticism in eroding rational\nstandards in general, even in politics:  \nIn the political sphere,\nthe haphazard echoes of inductive skepticism which reach the\nliberal’s ear deprive him of any rational right to champion\nliberalism, and account already as much as anything for the flabbiness\nof liberal resistance to dogmatic encroachments from the left or the\nright. (Williams 1947, pp 15–20) \n David Hume, in the\neighteenth century, had shown that all such inferences must involve\nrisk: no matter how certain our premises, no inductively reached\nconclusion can have the same degree of certainty. Hume went\nfurther, and held that inductive reasoning provides no rational support\nwhatever for its conclusions. This is Hume’s famous inductive\nscepticism. \n\nWilliams was almost alone in his time in holding not only that the\nproblem does admit of a solution, but in presenting a novel solution of\nhis own. To do this, he needed to argue against Hume, and Hume’s\ntwentieth century successors Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, who had\ndeclared the problem insoluble, and also against contemporaries such as\nP. F. Strawson and Paul Edwards, who had claimed that there was no real\nproblem at all (Russell 1912, Chapter 6; Popper 1959; Edwards 1949, pp\n141–163; Strawson 1952, pp 248–263). Williams tackled the\nproblem head-on. In The Ground of Induction (1947) he makes\noriginal use of results already established in probability theory,\nwhose significance for the problem of induction he was the first to\nappreciate. He treats inductive inference as a special case of the\nproblem of validating sampling techniques. Among any population, that\nis, any class of similar items, there will be a definite proportion\nhaving any possible characteristic. For example, among the population\nof penguins, 100% will be birds, about 50% will be female, some 10%,\nperhaps, will be Emperor penguins, some 35%, perhaps, will be more than\nseven years old, and so on. This is the complexion of the\npopulation, with regard to femaleness, or whatever. \n\nNow in the pure mathematics of the relations between samples and\npopulations, Jacob Bernoulli had in the 18th century established the\nremarkable fact that, for populations of any large size whatever (say\nabove 2500), the vast majority of samples of 2500 or more closely match\nin complexion the population from which they are drawn. In the case of\nour penguins, for example, if the population contains 35% aged 7 years\nor more, well over nine tenths of samples of 2500 penguins will contain\nbetween 33% and 37% aged 7 years or more. This is a necessary, purely\nmathematical, fact. In the language of statistics, the vast\nmajority of reasonably sized samples are representative of\ntheir population, that is, closely resemble it in complexion. \n\nBernoulli’s result enables us to infer from the complexion of\na population to the complexion of most reasonably-sized samples taken\nfrom it, since the complexion of most samples closely resembles the\ncomplexion of the population. Williams’s originality was this: he\nnoticed that resemblance is symmetrical. If we can\nprove, as Bernoulli did, that most samples resemble the population from\nwhich they are drawn, then conversely the population’s complexion\nresembles the complexion of most of the samples. \n\nThis brings us to the problem of induction. What our observations of\nthe natural world provide us with can be regarded as samples from\nlarger populations. For example the penguins we have observed up to\nthis point provide us with a sample of the wider population of all\npenguins, at all times, whether observed or not. What can we infer\nabout this wider population from the sample we have? That, in all\nprobability, the population’s complexion is close to that of the\nsample. We may of course, have an atypical sample before us.\nBut with samples of more than 2500, well over 90% represent the\npopulation fairly closely, so the odds are against it. \n\nThus Williams assimilates the problem of induction to an application\nof the statistical syllogism (also called direct inference or the\nproportional syllogism). A standard syllogism concerns complexions of\n100%, and has a determinate conclusion: if all S are P, and\nthis present item is an S, then it must be P. A\nstatistical syllogism deals with complexions of less than 100%, and its\nconclusion is not definite but only probable: for example, if 95%\nof S are P, this present S is probably P. Some\nlogicians claim that the probability in question is exactly 0.95, but\nWilliams does not need to rely on that additional claim. It is enough\nthat the probability be high. Applying the statistical syllogism to\nWilliams’ reversal of the Bernoulli result, we have: 95% of\nreasonably-sized samples are closely representative of their\npopulation, so the sample we have, provided there are no grounds to\nthink otherwise, is probably one of them. On that basis, we are\nrationally entitled to infer that the population probably closely\nmatches the sample, whose complexion is known to us. The inference is\nonly probable. Induction cannot deliver certainty. In any given case,\nit is abstractly possible that our sample may be a misleading,\nunrepresentative one. But to expect an inference from the observed to\nthe unobserved to yield certainty is to expect the impossible. \n\nWilliams’ treatment of induction created quite a stir when it\nappeared, but attracted criticisms of varying power from commentators\nwedded to more defeatist attitudes, and was eclipsed by the Popperian\nstrategy of replacing an epistemology of confirmation with one that\nfocused on refutation. It thus exercised less influence than it\ndeserves. It is a closely reasoned, deductively argued defense of\nthe rationality of inductive inference, well meriting continued\nattention. \n\nIts reliance on a priori reasoning (as opposed to any contingent\nprinciples such as the “uniformity of nature” or the action\nof laws of nature) means that it should hold in all possible worlds.\nWilliams’ argument would thus be easily defeated by the\nexhibition of a possible world in which inductive reasoning did not\nwork (in the sense of mostly yielding false conclusions). However,\ncritics of Williams have not offered such a possible non-inductive\nworld. Chaotic worlds are not non-inductive (as the induction from\nchaos to more chaos is correct in them), while a world with an\nanti-inductive demon, who falsifies, say, most of the inductive\ninferences I make, is not clearly non-inductive either (since although\nmost of my inductions have false conclusions, it does not\nfollow that most inductions in general have false conclusions). \n\nMarc Lange (2011) does however propose a counterexample, arising from\nthe “purely formal” nature of Williams’\nargument. Should it not apply equally to “grue” as to\n“green”? Objects are grue if they are green up to some\nfuture point in time, and blue thereafter. The problem is to show that\nour sample, to date, of green things is not a sample of things\nactually grue. (Williams’s own views on the grue problem are\ngiven in his “How Reality is Reasonable” in (2018)). \n\nStove (1986, 131–144) argued that his more specific version of\nWilliams’s argument (see below) was not subject to the objection, and\nthat the failure of induction in the case of ‘grue’ showed\nthat inductive logic was not purely formal—but then neither was\ndeductive logic. \n\nOther criticisms arise from the suggestion that the proportional\nsyllogism in general is not a justified form of inference without some\nassumption of randomness. Any proportional syllogism (with exact\nnumbers) is of the form (Or, if we let B be the proposition that the proportion\nof Fs that are G is r, and we\nlet p(h | e) be the conditional\nprobability of hypothesis h on evidence e, then we\ncan express the above proportional syllogism in the language of\nprobability as follows: p(Ga | Fa\n& B) = r.) \n\nDo we not need to assume that a is chosen\n“randomly”, in the sense that all Fs have an\nequal chance of being chosen? Otherwise, how do we know that\na is not chosen with some bias, which would make its\nprobability of being G different from r? \n\nDefenders of the proportional syllogism (McGrew 2003; Campbell and\nFranklin 2004) argue that no assumption of randomness is needed. Any\ninformation about bias would indeed change the probability, but that is\na trivial fact about any argument. An argument infers from given\npremises to a given conclusion; a different argument, with a different\nforce, moves from some other (additional) premises to that conclusion.\nGiven just that the vast majority of airline flights land safely, I can\nhave rational confidence that my flight will land safely, even though\nthere are any number of other possible premises (such as that I have\njust seen the wheels fall off) that would change the probability if I\nadded them to the argument. The fact that the probability of the\nconclusion on other evidence would be different is no reason\nto change the probability assessment on the given evidence. \n\nSimilar reasoning applies to any other property that a may\nhave (or, in the case of the Williams argument, that the sample may\nhave), such as having been observed or being in the past. If there is\nsome positive reason to think that property relevant to the conclusion\n(that a is G), that reason needs to be explained; if\nnot, there is no reason to believe it affects the argument and the\noriginal probability given by the proportional syllogism stands. \n\nSerious criticisms specific to Williams’s argument have been\nbased on claims that the proportional syllogism, though correct in\ngeneral, has been misapplied by Williams. Any proportional\nsyllogism, \nis subject to the objection that, in the case at hand, there is\nactually further information about the Fs that is relevant to\nthe conclusion Ga. For example, in \n\nit is arguable that information is hidden in the proper names that\nis favorably relevant to the younger Smith’s chance of success.\nThe question then is whether the same could happen with the\nproportional syllogism in Williams’ argument for induction. Maher\n(1996) argues that there is such a problem. In this version of\nWilliams’ argument: \n\nis there, typically, any further information about the sample S that\nis relevant to whether it matches the population? The potentially\nrelevant information one has is the proportion in S of the attribute to\nbe predicted (blue, or whatever it might be). Can that be relevant to\nmatching? \n\nIt certainly can be relevant. For example, if the proportion of blue\nitems in the sample is 100%, it suggests that the population proportion\nis close to 100%; that is positively relevant to matching since samples\nof near-homogeneous populations are more likely to match. (For example,\nif the population proportion is 100%, all samples match the\npopulation.) Conversely, fewer samples match the population when the\npopulation proportion is near one half. \n\nDavid Stove (1986), in defending Williams’ argument, proposed\nto avoid this problem by taking a more particular case of the argument\nwhich would not be subject to the objection. Stove proposed: \nIf F is the class of ravens, G the class of black things,\nS a sample of 3020 ravens, r = 0.95, and\n‘match’ means having proportion within 3% of the\npopulation proportion, then it is evident that ‘The proportion\nof Fs that are Gs is\nx’ is not substantially unfavorable to matching (for all x). \nFor even in the worst case, when the proportion of black things is\none half, it is still true that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation (Stove 1986, 66–75). \n\nStove’s reply emphasizes how strong the mathematical truth about\nmatching of samples is: it is not merely that, for any population size\nand proportion, one can find a sample size and degree of match such\nthat samples of that size mostly match; it is the much stronger result\nthat one can fix the sample size and degree of match beforehand,\nwithout needing knowledge of the population size and proportion. For\nexample, the vast majority of 3020-size samples match to within\n3%—irrespective of the population size (provided of course that\nit is larger than 3020) and the proportion of objects with the\ncharacteristic under investigation.. \n\nMaher also objects that the attribute itself, such as\n“blue”, might be a priori relevant to its\nproportion in the sample and hence to matching. For example, if\n“blue” is one of a large range of possible colors,\nthen a priori it is unlikely that an individual is blue and\nunlikely that a sample will have many blue items. As with any Bayesian\nreasoning, a prior probability close to zero (or one) requires a lot\nof evidence to overcome; in this case, we would conclude that a sample\nwith a high proportion of blue items was most likely a coincidence,\nand the posterior probability of the sample matching the population\nwould still not be high. \n\nScott Campbell (2001), in reply to Maher, argues that priors do not\ndominate observations in the way Maher suggests. By analogy, suppose\nthat, while blindfolded, I throw a dart at a dartboard. I am told that\n99 of the 100 spots on the board are the same color, and that there are\n145 choices of color for the spots. After throwing, I observe just the\nspot I have hit and find it is blue. Then (in the absence of further\ninformation), the chance is very high that almost all the other spots\nare blue. The prior improbability of blue does not prevent that. In the\nsame way, the fact that the vast majority of samples match the\npopulation gives good reason to suppose that the observed sample does\ntoo, irrespective of any prior information of the kind Maher\nadvances. \n\nWilliams’ defense of induction thus has resources to supply\nanswers to the criticisms that have been made of it. It remains the\nmost objectivist and ambitious justification of induction.","contact.mail":"dehring@smu.edu","contact.domain":"smu.edu"}]
