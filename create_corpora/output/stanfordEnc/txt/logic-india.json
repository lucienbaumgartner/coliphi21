Preoccupation with the nature of reason and\nargument occurs in the earliest philosophical texts, where their\ntreatment is intimately connected with questions of ontology,\nepistemology and dialectics. These questions continued to be at the\ncenter of philosophical discussion through the classical and medieval\nperiod of Indian philosophy. This article will chronicle the answers\nIndian philosophers gave to these questions during the preclassical\nand classical period.\n\nHumans reason: that is, taking some things to be true, they conclude\ntherefrom that other things are also true. If this is done in thought,\none performs an inference; and if this is done in speech, one makes an\nargument. Indeed, inference and argument are but two sides of the same\ncoin: an argument can be thought, and hence become an inference; an\ninference can be expressed, and hence become an argument. \nLogic, at least as traditionally conceived, seeks to distinguish good\nreasoning from bad. More particularly, it seeks to identify the\ngeneral conditions under which what one concludes is true, having\ntaken other things to be true. These conditions can be sought in the\nnature of things. One asks, then, under what conditions do certain\nfacts require some other fact. This perspective on reasoning is an\nontic perspective. Next, insofar as facts are grasped in thought, one\ncan also ask under what conditions does knowledge of some facts permit\nknowledge of another fact. Such conditions, once identified, would\ndistinguish good inferences from bad inferences. This perspective on\nreasoning is an epistemic one. A third perspective is a dialectic one.\nHere one asks under what conditions does the acceptance by someone of\nsome stated facts require him or her to accept some other stated fact.\nSuch conditions distinguish good arguments from bad arguments.\nFinally, since an argument is an expression of an inference, and to\nthat extent, expressed in a language, it is natural to use the forms\nof linguistic expressions to identify forms of inferences and\narguments, thereby distinguishing forms of good inferences and\narguments from forms of bad inferences and arguments. This perspective\nis a linguistic one. The study of reasoning in India has been from the\nontic, epistemic and dialectic perspective, and not from the\nlinguistic perspective, the perspective best known to modern\nthinkers. \nThe fact that humans reason is no guarantee that those who do reflect\non which reasoning is good and which is bad. Clearly, the activity of\nreasoning, on the one hand, and the activity of reflecting on which\nreasoning is good and which is not, on the other, are distinct, though\nnaturally they are intimately related. The exposition here, while\nreporting primarily on what is explicit, will also report on what is\nimplicit. In looking at the origins of reasoning in India, it is\nnatural to begin with the practices in which reasoning played a role\nand which, as a result, were likely candidates for reflection. The\nobvious starting points for such practices are all forms of rational\ninquiry. \nRational inquiry comprises the search for reasons for publicly\naccepted facts, subject to public and rational scrutiny. This activity\ninvolves people both severally and collectively. It involves people\nseverally insofar as people, individually, are the locus of inference.\nIt involves people collectively insofar as arguments, the public\nmanifestation of inferences, are sharpened by the scrutiny of\nothers. \nThough the origins in India of public debate (pariṣad),\none form of rational inquiry, are not clear, we know that public\ndebates were common in preclassical India, for they are frequently\nalluded to in various Upaniṣads and in the early\nBuddhist literature. Public debate is not the only form of public\ndeliberations in preclassical India. Assemblies\n(pariṣad or sabh&amacr;) of various sorts,\ncomprising relevant experts, were regularly convened to deliberate on\na variety of matters, including administrative, legal and religious\nmatters. As reported by Solomon (1976 ch. 3), much of the legal\nvocabulary for such deliberations includes the well-known terms of\ndebate and argument found in the philosophical literature. (See also\nPreisendanz 2009.) \nBy the fifth century bce, rational inquiry\ninto a wide range of topics was under way, including agriculture,\narchitecture, astronomy, grammar, law, logic, mathematics, medicine,\nphonology and statecraft. Aside from the world’s earliest extant\ngrammar, P&amacr;ṇini’s\nAṣṭ&amacr;dhy&amacr;y&imath;̄, however, no\nworks devoted to these topics actually date from this preclassical\nperiod. Nonetheless, scholars agree that incipient versions of the\nfirst extant texts on these topics were being formulated and early\nversions of them were redacted by the beginning of the common era.\nThey include such texts as\nKṛṣi-&sacute;&amacr;stra (Treatise on\nagriculture), &Sacute;ilpa-&sacute;&amacr;stra\n(Treatise on architecture),\nJyotiṣa-&sacute;&amacr;stra (Treatise on\nastronomy), Dharma-&sacute;&amacr;stra (Treatise on\nlaw), Caraka-saṃhit&amacr; (Caraka’s\ncollection), a treatise on medicine, and\nArtha-&sacute;&amacr;stra (Treatise on wealth), a\ntreatise on politics. \nTwo texts from this period which are especially noteworthy for the\nstudy of the history of reasoning in India are\nKath&amacr;-vatthu (Points of controversy),\nattributed to Moggaliputta Tissa, and Milinda-pañha\n(Questions of King Milinda). These texts date from around the\nthird century bce. The latter text comprises a\ndialogue between the Greek Bactrian king Menander (Pali: Milinda),\nand the Buddhist monk N&amacr;gasena. In it, King Milinda puts\nquestions to N&amacr;gasena concerning various aspects of Buddhist\ndoctrine. The answers typically employ analogies, some very elaborate.\nIn some cases, the king adduces pairs of statements of Buddhist\ndoctrine which, he says, contradict each other. The monk typically\nreplies by trying to show the alleged contradictions to be merely\napparent. In a few cases, one or the other party makes an argument,\ntypically an analogical one. \nIn contrast, Kath&amacr;-vatthu is filled with arguments\ndesigned to show the inconsistency of some two hundred propositions\nwhich are at odds with the views of the Sthavirav&amacr;dins, a school\nof Buddhist thought. For example, in the passage below, the\nSthavirav&amacr;din questions his opponent, here a Pudgalav&amacr;din,\nabout whether or not the soul is known truly and ultimately. \nOne easily abstracts from this the following form, \nIndeed, this form is repeatedly instantiated throughout Book 1,\nChapter 1. \nThree features of this text are important to note from the point of\nview of the history of logic. First, as the schema above shows,\narguments are put into a canonical form. While we have no record that\nsemantic ascent had taken place, there is no doubt from the arguments\nare intended to satisfy a certain form. Second, the sentences of the\nargument are logically related. The author takes for granted that the\nsentences assented to are inconsistent, corresponding to an instance\nof the following inconsistent propositional schemata of \\(\\alpha\\),\n\\(\\neg \\beta\\), \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\). He also takes it for\ngranted that it is wrong to hold inconsistent propositions. And he\nfinally presupposes that, if a sentence corresponding to propositional\nschema \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\) is true, then the sentence\ncorresponding to the propositional schema \\(\\neg \\beta \\rightarrow\n\\neg \\alpha\\) is also true; that is, he presupposes the natural\nlanguage counterpart to one direction of the equivalence of a\nconditional and its contrapositive. (See Ganeri 2001 for the most\nrecent attempt to explicate the dialectic implicit in the text.) \nThe first five hundred years of the common era also saw the redaction\nof philosophical treatises in which proponents of diverse\nphilosophical and religious traditions put forth systematic versions\nof their world views. These latter works bear witness, in a number of\ndifferent ways, to the intense interest in argumentation during this\nperiod. Among the diverse forms of argument from this period, one\nemerges as a canonical one. In this section, we first review the texts\nrelevant to the development of logic from the end this preclassical\nperiod. We then turn our attention to surveying the emergence of a\ncanonical argument form. Finally, we conclude with a very brief\noverview of the treatment of fallacies in arguments and of missteps in\ndebate. \nThe texts relevant to the study of the development of logic during\nthis period may be divided into three kinds: those which have\narguments but which do not mention or discuss either argument or\ninference as such, those which mention or discuss inference as such\nbut do not mention or discuss arguments as such, and those which\nmention or discuss arguments and possibly also mention or discuss\ninference, and may even provide illustrations of either. \nDuring this period polemical texts, which consist almost entirely of\narguments, start to appear. The earliest among these are texts\nattributed to N&amacr;g&amacr;rjuna (2nd century ce).\nThey include\nM&umacr;la-madhyamaka-k&amacr;rik&amacr; (Basic verses on\nthe middle way), Vigraha-vy&amacr;vartan&imath;̄\n(Exclusion of disputes) and Vaidalya-prakaraṇa\n(Tract on pulverization). Then comes a text extant only in\nChinese, Bǎi lùn (百論), a\ntranslation of the Sanskrit text entitled\n&Sacute;ataka-&sacute;&amacr;stra (Treatise in one\nhundred verses) by &Amacr;ryadeva (c. 3rd century ce),\na student of N&amacr;g&amacr;rjuna. Many of the\narguments in these texts are arguments by analogy; those which are not\nare often enthymemes whose omitted premisses are patently false. \nThe simpler arguments by analogy are of two kinds: ones based on\nsimilarity (s&amacr;dharmya; s&amacr;r&umacr;pya)\nand others based on dissimilarity (vaidharmya;\nvair&umacr;pya). Such simple arguments involve two things,\ncall them p and d, and two properties, call them H and S. An argument\nby analogy based on similarity is one where, if p and d are similar\nwith respect to property H and d has property S, then p has property\nS. This gives rise to this argument schema: \n(The names for the statements have been added for ease of comparison\nwith later developments to be discussed below.) Notice that, if p and\nd are not distinct, the argument is circular. \nAn argument by analogy based on dissimilarity is one where, if p and d\nare dissimilar with respect to property H and d has property S, then p\ndoes not have property S. Here is its argument schema: \nHere the ontic version of the law of non-contradiction guarantees that\np and d are distinct. \nThe terms similarity and dissimilarity become\ntechnical terms in Indian logic. It is useful to bear in mind some\nsyntactic and semantic features shared by both the Sanskrit terms and\ntheir English translations. These words express a three place\nrelation, namely the relation of a thing similar to, or dissimilar\nfrom, another thing in some respect. When these terms are used either\nin English or in Sanskrit, the complement referring to the respect in\nwhich things are similar or dissimilar may be left unexpressed. It is\nthis omissibility which accounts for the fact that the following two\nsentences are not contradictory: Devadatta is similar to\nYajñadatta and Devadatta is dissimilar to\nYajñadatta. After all, two people might be similar to one\nanother, say, in temperament, but dissimilar to one another, say, in\nappearance. When the respect of similarity or dissimilarity is not\nexpressed in a sentence, it must be gathered from the context. \nA pair of related terms with the same syntactic and semantic features,\nwhich also become technical terms in Indian logic, are the terms\nsubject-like (sa-pakṣa), or similar to the\nsubject, and subject-unlike (vi-pakṣa),\nor dissimilar to the subject. The Sanskrit prefixes,\nsa- and vi-, and the English adjectives,\nlike and unlike, which are also English\nprepositions, express the relation of similarity and dissimilarity\nrespectively. \nTwo early texts which discuss inference (anum&amacr;na), but\nnot argument (s&amacr;dhana), are\nṢaṣṭi-tantra (Sixty doctrines),\nattributed V&amacr;rṣagaṇya (4th century ce),\nand Vai&sacute;eṣika-s&umacr;tra\n(Aphorisms on individuation), a treatise of speculative\nontology attributed to Kaṇ&amacr;da (c. 1st century ce). \nṢaṣṭi-tantra, which survives only in\nfragments, first collected by Frauwallner (1958), later expanded by\nSteinkellner (2017 Appendix 1), defines inference\n(anum&amacr;na) as follows: To infer is to establish\nsomething in the remainder, on the basis of a relation and something\nperceptible . One of the text’s fragments lists six relations as\nones which underpin an acceptable inference: the master servant\nrelation (sva-sv&amacr;mi-bh&amacr;va-sambandha), the matter\nalteration relation (prakṛti-vik&amacr;ra-sambandha),\nthe part whole relation\n(k&amacr;rya-k&amacr;raṇa-sambandha), the cause effect\nrelation (nimitta-naimittika-sambandha), the source product\nrelation (m&amacr;tr&amacr;-m&amacr;trika-sambandha), the\nassociation relation (sahac&amacr;ri-sambandha) and the\nincompatibility relation (vadhya-gh&amacr;taka-sambandha).\nThough each of the relations is illustrated, no example of an\ninference using them is found. \nVai&sacute;eṣika-s&umacr;tra (Aphorisms on\nindividuation) also has passages which allude to inferences\nwhereby one thing is inferred on the basis of something observable\nwhich bears one of five relations to the thing inferred (VS 9.18;\nJambuvijaya (ed) 1961 p. 69; cp. VS 3.1.8), though no examples are\ngiven. Nonetheless, in the case of both texts, it is clear from the\ndescription that the inferences would have the following form: \nThe best known text from this period is the Brahmanical treatise\nNy&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (Aphorisms on logic) by\nGautama, also known as Akṣap&amacr;da (c. 2nd ce),\nthe actual redaction of which is thought by\nsome to date to the third century ce. This\nwork, which comprises five books, each with two chapters, addresses\nprimarily questions pertaining to epistemology and debate, though it\nalso touches on other topics. A few aphorisms found in the first\nchapter of the first and second books speak of inference, but much\nmore attention is devoted to debate, essentially all of both chapters\nof Book 5, the entirety of the second chapter of Book 1, and several\naphorisms in the first chapter of Book 1. Unfortunately, the laconic\nstyle of the aphorisms make it hard to get a clear idea of what is\nintended. \nSome light is shed on this work by a contemporaneous Buddhist work,\nthe Vaidalya-prakaraṇa (Tract on\npulverization), attributed to N&amacr;g&amacr;rjuna. It is\norganized around the key terms listed in the first aphorism of the\nNy&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (NS 1.1.1). However, it does not\nexplain the terms nor does it illustrate them. Instead, it sets out\nfor each term arguments intended to show its incoherence. It is\ntherefore rich in arguments, most of which are analogical. The author\nalso judges a number of counter arguments as fallacious, pointing out\neither that they are circular or that they lead to an infinite\nregress. \nNot all Buddhist texts from this period are hostile to argumentation.\nTwo works contain short passages with lists and classificatory\ndefinitions of terms pertaining to debate. One is the\nSaṃdhi-nirmocana-s&umacr;tra (Aphorisms on release\nfrom bondage), of unknown authorship, whose original Sanskrit has\nbeen lost, but whose translations into Tibetan and Chinese have been\npreserved. (See Yoshimizu 2010.) The other is the\nAbhidharma-samuccaya (Compendium of the higher\nteachings), a text usually attributed to the Buddhist thinker,\nAsaṅga (4th century ce), whose fifth\nchapter has a section, its seventh, often referred to as\nV&amacr;da-vini&sacute;caya (Settling on what debate\nis), also devoted to debate. \nIn contrast, five other texts from this period not only mention and\nsometimes discuss terms pertinent to inference and debate but also\nprovide illustrations of the terms. The earliest texts are two\npassages in the earliest medical work, the\nCaraka-saṃhit&amacr;, conjectured by some to have been\nredacted in its current form at the beginning of first century \nce.\nAnother important passage occurs in the\nYog&amacr;c&amacr;ra-bh&umacr;mi-&sacute;&amacr;stra\n(Treatise on the stages of the practice of yoga), a work\ntraditionally attributed to Asaṅga, but now generally thought to\nbe by a number of authors. The passage, usually referred to as\nHetu-vidy&amacr; (Science of reasons), provides some\nfifty examples of simple common sense inferences, all of which are\neasily recast in the form of the inferential syllogism given above.\nThe inferences are divided into five categories. While relation words\nare used for each category, the logical force of these relations is\nnot made clear. The inferences provided include ones such as the\ninference of fire from smoke, of the presence of a lion from its roar,\nof being sick from unusual eating practices, as well as inferences\nmore closely connected with Buddhist doctrine. \nThe first work devoted entirely to argument and inference is the\nF&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n lùn\n(方便心論), or Treatise on the heart of\nmeans, translated into Chinese in 472 ce\nwithout attribution, though it later came to be attributed to\nN&amacr;g&amacr;rjuna. This text, translated into Sanskrit by G. Tucci\n(1929), is commonly known by scholars by the translation of its title\nby Tucci as Up&amacr;ya-hṛdaya. \nShortly after Asaṅga, Vasubandhu (c. 5th century ce),\nanother Buddhist idealist, thought to be the\nyounger brother of the Asaṅga, wrote at least three works on\ndebate: V&amacr;da-hṛdaya (Heart of debate),\nV&amacr;da-vidh&amacr;na (Precepts of debate) and\nV&amacr;da-vidhi (Rules of debate). These texts have\nbeen lost, though fragments of the latter two, some in Sanskrit, many\nin Tibetan, have been collected (Frauwallner 1933, 1957; Ono 2020).\nAnother work, ascribed to Vasubandhu, which survives only in Chinese,\nis the Rúsh&imath;́ lùn\n(如實論), Treatise on truth. G. Tucci\n(1929), translating it back into Sanskrit, gave it the Sanskrit title\nTarka-&sacute;&amacr;stra, by which it is now generally\nknown. However, as has been shown recently by Ono Motoi (Ono 2020\n§1), this rendition is not correct. \nThere are two other works which have passages pertinent to the study\nof the history of reasoning in India, both works attributed to\nAsaṅga. The first is the Xiǎn chàng shèng\njiào lùn\n(顯揚聖教論), or Treatise which\nreveals and disseminates the wise teachings, which is a condensed\nversion of the\nYog&amacr;c&amacr;ra-bh&umacr;mi-&sacute;&amacr;stra, and the\nShùn zh&omacr;ng lùn\n(順中論), or Treatise on following the middle\nway, which seems to be a commentary on the introductory verse of\nN&amacr;g&amacr;rjuna’s\nM&umacr;la-madhyamaka-k&amacr;rik&amacr; (Katsura 1985 p.\n166). \nHaving surveyed the texts from the late preclassical period pertinent\nto the study of the development of logic, we now turn to the emergence\nof a canonical Indian syllogism. \nThe earliest known example of the canonical Indian syllogism is found\nin the Caraka-saṃhit&amacr;. The argument is clearly an\nanalogical one. The earliest known deductive version of the syllogism\nis found in the F&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n\nlùn, or Up&amacr;ya-hṛdaya; and the\nearliest known discussion of a deductive version of the syllogism is\nfound in the Rúsh&imath;́ lùn, usually\nreferred to as the Tarka-&sacute;&amacr;stra. A concise\nversion of the the deductive version is found in Vasubandhu’s\nV&amacr;da-vidhi. \nThe Caraka-saṃhit&amacr; (CS 3.8.31), like the\nNy&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (NS 1.1.32), takes the syllogism to\nhave five parts, the names for four of the five parts being identical;\nhowever, unlike the Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra, the\nCaraka-saṃhit&amacr; provides an illustration. \nObserve that the first three statements in the syllogism have the form\nof the analogical syllogism using similarity discussed above: p, the\nsoul, has S, the property of being eternal, because p, the soul, has\nH, the property of being unproduced; as d, or space, has H, the\nproperty of being unproduced, and d, space, has S, the property of\nbeing eternal. However, the argument here adds two more statements:\nthe first spells out the analogy between the subject of the\nproposition and the example, using the correlative expression\nas (yath&amacr;) \\(\\ldots\\) so\n(tath&amacr;) \\(\\ldots\\); the second restates the\nargument’s proposition. \nWhile Caraka-saṃhit&amacr; provides only one\nillustration of its canonical syllogism, the earliest extant\ncommentary on the Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra, called the\nNy&amacr;ya-bh&amacr;ṣya (Commentary on\nlogic), has passages in its commentary on NS 1.1.33–39,\nwhich permit the reconstruction of two analogical syllogisms,\ncorresponding to those using similarity and using dissimilarity\ndiscussed above. The commentary, attributed to V&amacr;tsy&amacr;yana\n(fifth ce), also known as\nPakṣilasv&amacr;min, explicitly distinguishes the syllogisms as\none based on similarity (s&amacr;dharmya) and the other based\non dissimilarity (vaidharmya) discussed earlier. (For\ndetails, see Gillon 2020.) The analogical syllogism based on\nsimilarity differs but slightly from the syllogism found in the\nCaraka-saṃhit&amacr;. \nThe F&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n lùn, or\nUp&amacr;ya-hṛdaya, purports to be a primer on argument\nand reasoning, listing and defining many terms. It also contains many\narguments, several of which are analogical arguments both through\nsimilarity and through dissimilarity. The author of the text neither\nstates what an argument is nor what its parts are. Yet, in the first\nchapter, he speaks of excessive and deficient statements and says that\nthere are three kinds: deficiency of reason, deficiency of proposition\nand deficiency of example. (T1632 24.3.14–18; Gillon and Katsura\n2017 p. 215). Arguments which are not deficient in any of these ways\nis said to be complete. From the illustrations, it is clear that a\nnondeficient argument has the form: p has S, because of having H, like\nd, where d is assumed to have both H and S. In other words, a complete\nargument could be spelled out in the form whose explicit counterpart\nwould be that of an analogical syllogism using similarity of the kind\nfound in the polemical texts discussed earlier. \nThe only argument to appear in a form with five parts is given in the\nfourth, or last, chapter (T1632 28.1.4–6). Here is the argument\nas it occurs with the labels for the parts supplied for ease\ncomparison. Though the Chinese equivalent of proposition,\nreason and example appear in the text, the\nequivalents of application and conclusion do\nnot. \nNote that example statement comprises two sentences: the first\nrestates what is expressed in the proposition and reason statements,\nthe second affirms a universal proposition, everything which is\nnot perceptible by senses is eternal. The example statement\ncomprises a deductively valid argument, as does the second sentence\ntogether with the reason and proposition statements. Surprisingly, the\nauthor rejects the syllogism as a bad one. The rejection is justified\nby an argument by analogy through dissimilarity. \nWhen we turn to the Rúsh&imath;́ lùn,\ncustomarily referred to as the Tarka-&sacute;&amacr;stra, we\nfind the logical situation has changed. A deductive syllogism similar\nto the one just set out is endorsed. Moreover, analogical syllogisms\nare explicitly rejected. For example, the text rejects the following\nanalogical syllogism (T1633 30.3.2–4). \nThat the syllogism is analogical is made clear by the formulation of\nthe example and application statements. \nWhat the text’s author advocates instead are syllogisms which\nare in fact deductively valid, similar to the syllogism cited and\nrejected in the F&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n\nlùn. Here is one example (T1633 30.3.7–10). \nThis argument, like the one rejected in F&amacr;ng biàn\nx&imath;̄n lùn, is deductively valid. The example\nstatement also comprises two sentences: the first, however, affirms a\nuniversal proposition, If a thing is eternal, (then) it does not\narise due to an effort, and the second states an instance of the\nuniversal proposition, which is distinct from the subject of the\nargument. The proposition and reason statements, together with the\nfirst sentence of the example statement, comprise a deductively valid\nargument. \nMoreover, we know that the author is fully aware of the\nsyllogism’s logical force, for he states the three conditions,\nor three forms (tri-r&umacr;pa), which a reason must satisfy\nfor the argument in which it occurs to be sound. \nthree forms  (T1633 30.3.18–26):\n\nThe reason you set forth is not definite because eternality and\nnon-eternality appear throughout it. The reason I set forth has the\nthree marks. (1) The (reason) is a property of the subject, (2) it is\nincluded in things similar and (3) it is excluded from things\ndissimilar. Therefore, the reason I set forth succeeds in not\ndeviating, your reason does not. Therefore, your objection is\nconfused. If the reason you set forth were like my reason (in this\nrespect), your objection would succeed in being a proper\nobjection. \nAs noted by H. Ui 1929 (reported in Katsura 1985 p. 166), the earliest\nmention of the three forms appears in a brief passage in a non-logical\ntext, Shùn zh&omacr;ng lùn (T1565 42a12,22ff).\nHowever, the author of this text, said to be Asaṅga, rejects the\ncriterion, a criterion thought to be of a non-Buddhist origin. \nFinally we come to Vasubandhu’s V&amacr;da-vidhi. Here\nthe endorsed argument retains the proposition and the reason, abandons\nthe application and the conclusion and simplifies the example, so that\nthe resulting syllogism has this form: \nIt harks back to the form of the inferential syllogism mentioned\nearlier in our discussion of the\nṢaṣṭi-tantra and the\nVai&sacute;eṣika-s&umacr;tra. However, there is one\ncrucial difference: Vasubandhu is absolutely clear that the example\nstatement expresses an indispensibility relation\n(a-vin&amacr;-bh&amacr;va: lit. not existing\nwithout, or sine qua non). As is clear, instances of\nthis schema are deductively valid arguments. \nThe obverse side of identifying a proper argument is identifying\nfallacious arguments. Fallacious arguments include, on the one hand,\nsyllogisms whose reasons have been identified as specious and, on the\nother hand, counter arguments, or rejoinders, identified as\ndefective. \nThe Caraka-saṁhit&amacr; (CS 3.8.57) identifies\nand illustrates three kinds of arguments as defective. The first\nchapter of the fifth book of the Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (NS\n5.1) lists and briefly describes 24 arguments, which it designates as\nfallacious rejoinders (j&amacr;ti). The fourth chapter of the\nF&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n lùn lists and\ndescribes twenty such arguments, which are either the same as, or\nsimilar to, the arguments identified as fallacious rejoinders in the\nchapter of the Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra just mentioned.\nSurprisingly, the F&amacr;ng biàn x&imath;̄n\nlùn treats these arguments as good rejoinders, as noted by\nKajiyama (1989 p. 108). The most interesting treatments of fallacious\nrejoinders are those found in the Rúsh&imath;́\nlùn and in the V&amacr;da-vidhi, where many of\nfallacious rejoinders have names which are the same as those\nexemplified in the\nNy&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (Ono 2020 §3.2 and §3.5).\n(See also Randle 1930 ch. 6.2 and Solomon 1976 ch. 5.) \nThe Vai&sacute;eṣika-s&umacr;tra (VS 3.1.10–11)\nand the Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (NS 1.2.4–9) name kinds\nof specious reasons (hetv&amacr;bh&amacr;sa), but give\nneither examples nor explanations of what they are. Three kinds are\nlisted, and even briefly discussed, in the\nCaraka-saṃhit&amacr; (CS 3.8.57). The F&amacr;ng\nbiàn x&imath;̄n lùn merely lists eight kinds.\nThree kinds are exemplified and briefly discussed both in the\nV&amacr;da-vidhi and in the Rúsh&imath;́\nlùn. (See Randle 1930 ch. 3.5 and Solomon 1976 ch. 7.) \nBesides identifying fallacious syllogisms and rejoinders, some of\nthese texts also have either extended passages or entire chapters\ndevoted to the identification of behavior in debates which, when\ndisplayed by someone, warrants his being deemed to have lost. These\nmissteps, known as grounds for defeat\n(nigraha-sth&amacr;na), range from making fallacious\narguments to infringing the rules of debate procedure. The second\nchapter of the fifth book Ny&amacr;ya-s&umacr;tra (NS 5.2)\nsets out 22 cases, as does the third chapter of the\nRúsh&imath;́ lùn. An extended passage of\nthe Caraka-saṁh&imath;̄ta (CS 3.8.50–65)\nlists 14 cases. Asanga’s Hetu-vidy&amacr; has an\nextended passage which classifies them into three kinds and provides\ncases of each. (See Randle 1930 ch. 6.3 and Solomon 1976 ch. 6.) \nThe Buddhist thinker, Dign&amacr;ga (c. 5th – 6th century ce),\nconsolidates the insights into the canonical\ndeductively valid syllogism of his predecessors, and in particular\nthose of his teacher, Vasubandhu, as well as deepens them. He is, in\nfact, a pivotal figure in the history of Indian logic. This section is\ndivided into two parts: the first devoted to Dign&amacr;ga’s\ncontributions to Indian logic, especially the canonical syllogism, the\nsecond part summarizing other contributions from his contemporaries\nand successors, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. \nDign&amacr;ga wrote three works pertaining to reasoning and argument.\nUnfortunately, in each case, the original Sanskrit text is not\navailable. One, the Ny&amacr;ya-mukha (Introduction to\nlogic), is extant in Chinese translation and a Sanskrit\nmanuscript is known to exist in Tibet. The remaining two are extant\nonly in Tibetan translation: Hetu-cakra-ḍamaru (The\ndrum wheel of reason) and his magnum opus,\nPram&amacr;ṇa-samuccaya (Compendium on epistemic\nmeans of cognition), four of whose six chapters are devoted to\ninference or argument. \nOne idea which is particularly clear in Dign&amacr;ga’s work is\nhis explicit recognition that arguments which are expressed as\nsyllogisms are expressions of inferences. This is reflected in his\nterms inference for oneself\n(sv&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na), which refers to the cognitive\nprocess expressible as a syllogism, and inference for another\n(par&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na), which refers to the verbal\nexpression of the syllogistic inference. These terms are also the\ntitles of the second and third chapters of his\nPram&amacr;ṇa-samuccaya. \nDign&amacr;ga apparently enlarges the form of Vasubandhu’s\ncanonical syllogism. Even though the texts just mentioned are not\nextant in Sanskrit, some of their commentaries are and some of these\ntexts’ passages are found cited in existing Sanskrit works.\nAvailing himself of these works, S. Katsura (2004a p. 143) has\nidentified the following as an argument instantiating what\nDign&amacr;ga considers the canonical form of a good syllogism. \nBefore discussing the syllogism, we must take notice of the word\npakṣa (thesis), which Dign&amacr;ga uses\ninstead of pratijñ&amacr; (proposition). The\nword is used both for the statement, previously called a proposition\nand now called a thesis, as well as for the factual situation it\nexpresses. It is also used to refer to the grammatical subject of the\nthesis statement as well as to the thing denoted by the grammatical\nsubject. (See Staal 1973 for a lucid exposition of this and other\nambiguities in the technical terms of classical Indian logic.) \nDign&amacr;ga’s canonical syllogism, like that of Vasubandhu,\nhas neither an application statement nor a conclusion statement.\nHowever, unlike that of Vasubandhu, it has two example statements.\nEach example statement comprises a universal statement and a phrase\nnaming something. In the case of the statement of similarity example,\nthe universal statement asserts that whatever has the property adduced\nas a reason (hetu) has the property to be established\n(s&amacr;dhya-dharma), which is mentioned in the\nsyllogism’s thesis, while the phrase names something, distinct\nfrom the subject (pakṣa), yet similar to it with\nrespect to the property to be established\n(s&amacr;dhya-dharma), and has the property adduced as the\nreason. The example named is said to be subject-like\n(sa-pakṣa). In the case of the statement of\ndissimilarity example, the universal statement asserts that whatever\ndoes not have the property to be established\n(s&amacr;dhya-dharma) does not have the property adduced as a\nreason (hetu) and the phrase names something dissimilar to\nsubject with respect to the property to be established and not having\nthe property adduced as the reason. The example named here is said to\nbe subject-unlike (vi-pakṣa). Finally, Dign&amacr;ga\nseems to have added a word to the formulation of the universal\nstatement, namely, the word observed\n(dṛṣṭa), the past passive participle of the\nverb to see (dṛ&sacute;), which means not only\nto see but also to observe, to notice and even to know. Hereafter, we\nshall refer to a syllogism’s reason statement as its minor\npremiss and the universal statement in its example statement as its\nmajor premiss. \nPerhaps most original in Dign&amacr;ga’s work on argument and\ninference is what he called the wheel of reasons\n(hetu-cakra), an equivalent alternative to the three forms of\nreason (tri-r&umacr;pa-hetu). It comprises a three by three\nmatrix, which distinguishes a proper from an improper reason. It\nspecifies, on the one hand, the three cases of the reason\n(hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of subject-like things\n(sa-pakṣa), and, on the other, the three cases of the\nreason (hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of\nsubject-unlike things (vi-pakṣa). Letting H be the\nreason, S the subject-like things and \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) the\nsubject-unlike things, we obtain the following table. \nDign&amacr;ga identified the syllogisms corresponding to the top and\nbottom cases of the middle column as good syllogisms and those\ncorresponding to the other cases as bad. \nThese developments have led to a rather lively debate among scholars\nof the development of logic in early classical India. A very succinct,\nbut somewhat misleading, way to put the question at the center of the\ndebate is whether or not Dign&amacr;ga’s canonical syllogism is\ninductive or deductive. A more cumbersome, but more precise, way to\nput the question is this: Is there a choice of a subject, of a\nproperty adduced as a reason, and of a property to be established\nwhich Dign&amacr;ga would accept as constituting a good syllogism but\nwhich fails to satisfy the form corresponding to the canonical\nsyllogism given above? \nLet us now consider those aspects of Dign&amacr;ga’s treatment\nof the syllogism which are at the center of this debate. One reason to\nthink that Dign&amacr;ga would accept as a good syllogism one failing\nto be deductively valid might be his inclusion of the word\nobserved (dṛṣṭa) in the example\nstatement. In other words, one might think that Dign&amacr;ga would\naccept as a good syllogism one in which, even though it is not the\ncase that whatever has H has S, it is the case that whatever is\nobserved to have H has S: that is to say, the major premiss pertains\nonly to observed cases of H, and not for every case of H. However, no\nsuch syllogisms are accepted by Dign&amacr;ga. Indeed, the addition of\nthe word observed (dṛṣṭa) does not\npermit attributing such an idea to Dign&amacr;ga, for the word is\nadded, not to the major premiss’s subordinate, relative clause,\nbut to its main clause. Thus, what the major premiss says is not that\nevery observed instance of the reason (H) is an instance of the\nproperty to be established (S), but rather that every instance of the\nreason (H) is observed to be an instance of the property to be\nestablished (S). Moreover, if the word observed\n(dṛṣṭa) has a factive sense, that is, a\nsense which presupposes the truth of the clause into which the word is\ninserted, as do several of its English translations, for example,\nnoticed, known, then the word in the statement\nleaves the truth conditions of major premiss unaffected. \nA further reason which has prompted scholars to think that included\namong the syllogisms Dign&amacr;ga would accept as good ones are ones\nwhich might not be deductively valid is the fact that he has retained\nan example phrase in example statements, for such phrases have no\nbearing on the deductive validity of Dign&amacr;ga’s canonical\nsyllogism. This doubt is re-enforced by the fact that example\nstatements, stripped of their example phrases, are contrapositives of\none another. Thus, one being logically equivalent to the other is also\nlogically superfluous with respect to it. Yet, Dign&amacr;ga seems to\nbe aware of the equivalence, for he acknowledges in his commentarial\ndiscussion of the three forms (PS 2.5) that the second and third forms\nare equivalent (Katsura 2000 p. 245; Katsura 2004b pp. 121–124),\nfrom which it follows that any two statements, one of which satisfies\nthe second form and the other of which satisfies the third form are\nequivalent. \nHowever, it is perfectly reasonable to exclude some deductively valid\nsyllogisms as good syllogisms. Consider, for example, a syllogism\nwhose conclusion is identical with one of its premisses. It is a\ndeductively valid syllogism, though it is utterly unpersuasive.\nDign&amacr;ga, like any rational thinker, would not, and did not,\naccept as a good syllogism any syllogism in which the reason (H) and\nthe property to be established (S) are the same property, even if such\nsyllogisms have the same form as the canonical syllogism above.\nExcluding such circular syllogisms is fully consistent with the view\nthat the syllogisms accepted by Dign&amacr;ga are only deductively\nvalid ones. (For extensive scholarly discussion of the role of\nexamples in Buddhist arguments, see the collection of articles in\nKatsura and Steinkellner (eds) 2004.) \nA good reason for Dign&amacr;ga to retain an example phrase in the\nexample statements of his canonical syllogism would be to exclude\nsyllogisms which are patently unpersuasive, even though, like circular\nsyllogisms, they are deductively valid. Consider the following\nargument: \nThis syllogism, rejected as a bad syllogism by Dign&amacr;ga, was put\nforth by a school of Brahmanical thinkers who held, for doctrinal\nreasons, that sound is eternal. To maintain this claim in the face of\nobservation to the contrary, these thinkers maintained instead that\nwhat is transitory is the revelation of sound, not sound itself.\nAccording to them, in other words, sound is constantly present, but we\nhear it only when its presence is revealed. \nTheir syllogism as stated above, though deductively valid, is utterly\nunpersuasive. The reason is that the instances of audibility (H), are\ncoextensive with sound (p). Thus, there is no independent empirical\nevidence to support the universal statement that whatever is audible\nis eternal. Requiring that there be at least some thing different from\nsound which is both audible and eternal is an obvious and plausible\nway to eliminate such patently unpersuasive syllogisms. Dign&amacr;ga,\ntherefore, rules out the syllogism as a bad syllogism, rather than, as\nwe would, accept it as a valid syllogism with an unpersuasive premiss.\n(See also Tillemans 1990.) \nBut this cannot be the entire explanation of why Dign&amacr;ga appears\nto insist on example phrases in example statements, for nowhere does\nhe rule out as a good syllogism one which, though valid, is\nunpersuasive for want of some subject-unlike thing. \nBecause of the doubts just discussed, some scholars think that\nDign&amacr;ga was not striving to work out a deductive form of\nreasoning and argument. Rather, according to some, such as Hayes\n(1980; 1988 ch. 4.2), Dign&amacr;ga was seeking to develop an\ninductive form of reasoning and argument. According to others, such as\nOetke (1994; 1996), Dign&amacr;ga and some of his predecessors and\ncontemporaries were striving to spell out a defeasible form of\nreasoning and argument. (See Taber 2004 for a critical assessment of\nOetke’s view.) \nA final contribution by Dign&amacr;ga is found in the sixth and final\nchapter of his Pram&amacr;ṇa-samuccaya, where he\naddresses fourteen fallacious rejoinders (j&amacr;ti), each\nbearing the same name as one of the fourteen treated in\nVasubandhu’s V&amacr;da-vidhi, though sometimes the\nargument associated with a particular name in the\nPram&amacr;ṇa-samuccaya is different from the one\nassociated with the name in the V&amacr;da-vidhi. His\ntreatment is often different from, and critical of, the treatment\nfound in this earlier work. \nHowever much scholars may disagree about Dign&amacr;ga’s aim in\nthe formulation of the canonical syllogism, all agree that his works\nset the framework within which subsequent Buddhist thinkers addressed\nphilosophical issues pertaining to inference and debate. Thus,\n&Sacute;aṇkarasv&amacr;min (c. 6th century ce),\na pupil of Dign&amacr;ga (Frauwallner 1961,\n140), wrote a brief manual of inference for Buddhists, called the\nNy&amacr;ya-prave&sacute;a (Beginning logic), based\ndirectly on Dign&amacr;ga’s work. Not long thereafter,\nDharmak&imath;̄rti (c. 7th century ce),\nthe great Buddhist metaphysician, also elaborated his views on\ninference and debate within the framework found in Dign&amacr;ga. \nThe canonical syllogism, treated as an inference, is that whereby one\nwho knows the truth of its premisses may also come to know the truth\nof its conclusion. While the truth of a particular statement is\nthought to be known either through perception or through inference,\nhow is the truth of a universal statement, such as the major premiss\nof a canonical syllogism, known? To know its truth would seem to\nrequire that one know of each thing which has H, whether or not it\nalso has S. Yet if one knew that, one would already know by perception\nthe canonical syllogism’s conclusion. As a result, inference\nwould be a superfluous means of knowledge. \nThe earliest classical Indian philosopher thought to have recognized\nthe problem of how one comes to know the truth of a universal\nstatement seems to have been &Imacr;&sacute;varasena (Steinkellner\n1997 p. 638). He appears to have thought that knowledge of the major\npremiss is grounded in non-perception (anupalabdhi). That is,\naccording to &Imacr;&sacute;varasena, knowledge that whatever has H\nhas S comes from the simple failure to perceive something which has H\nbut which does not have S. (See Steinkellner 1993, where he draws on\nSteinkellner 1966.) \nHowever, this suggestion does not solve the problem, for reasons laid\nout in detail by Dharmak&imath;̄rti (c. 7th century ce).\nHis extensive writing on epistemology in\ngeneral and on reason and argument in particular formed a watershed in\nclassical India philosophy. Besides his magnum opus,\nPram&amacr;ṇa-v&amacr;rttika (Gloss on the means of\nepistemic cognition), one of whose four chapters is devoted to\ninference (sv&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na), comprising 340\nverses and a commentary by him to it, and another devoted to argument\n(par&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na), which comprises 285 verses,\nhe wrote several smaller works, including\nPram&amacr;ṇa-vini&sacute;caya (Settling on what\nthe epistemic means of cognition are), Ny&amacr;ya-bindu\n(Drop of logic), Hetu-bindu (Drop of\nreason) and V&amacr;da-ny&amacr;ya (Logic of\ndebate). As he makes abundantly clear in verses 13–25 and\nhis commentary thereto of the chapter on inference\n(sv&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na) of his\nPram&amacr;ṇa-v&amacr;rttika, the simple failure to\nperceive something which has H but which does not have S is no\nguarantee that whatever has H has S; after all, while one has never\nencountered something which has H and does not have S, what guarantee\nis there that something which has H and does not have S is not among\nthe things which one has yet to encounter?\nDharmak&imath;̄rti’s answer was that the truth of the first\npremiss is guaranteed by either of two relations obtaining between\nproperties: the causation relation (tadutpatti) and the\nidentity relation (t&amacr;d&amacr;tmya). Unfortunately, as\none might suspect, Dharmak&imath;̄rti’s solution does not\nwork. (See Gillon 1991; see Steinkellner 2015 for a dissenting\nview.) \nStarting with Dign&amacr;ga, those interested in logic started to add\nthe particle eva to the various clauses of the three forms of\nreason (tri-r&umacr;pa-hetu) (Katsura 1986).\nDign&amacr;ga’s formulation of the three forms came in for\ncriticism at the hands of the Ny&amacr;ya thinker, Uddyotakara (c.\nlate 6th century ce), which was, in turn,\naddressed by Dharmak&imath;̄rti, who uses the particle to express\neach of the three conditions (NB 2.5). \nUnfortunately, the precision hoped for is undermined by the ambiguity\nin the meaning of the particle eva. The particle eva\nhas two principal uses: one emphatic, the other restrictive. What it\nemphasizes or restricts depends on the word after which it is placed.\nThe particle in the statement of the first form applies to the\nabstract noun existence and, in its emphatic use, is well\ntranslated by definite or actual. The particle in\nthe statement of the third form applies to the negative abstract noun\nnon-existence and, in its emphatic use with negation, is best\ntranslated by utter or at all. (Some scholars\ntranslate the particle in these statements as necessary.\nThere is, however, no philological justification for such a\ntranslation.) The particle in the second form applies to a concrete\nnoun. Though here the particle could have either an emphatic or a\nrestrictive use, only the restrictive use fits the context. A problem\narises from the word subject-like (sa-pakṣa).\nIt can be construed in two ways: either as including or as excluding\nthe subject. If subject-like is construed as inclusive and\nthe particle eva is taken as restrictive, then the second and\nthird forms are logically equivalent; but the statement of the three\nforms has the rhetorical blemish of containing a logically superfluous\nform. If subject-like is taken as exclusive and the particle\nis taken as restrictive, then the three forms are inconsistent, for in\nthat case the second form entails the contradictory of the first form.\n(For details, see Gillon 1999.) \nIdeas on the nature of reasoning and argumentation very similar to\nthose of Dign&amacr;ga’s are found in the\nPad&amacr;rtha-dharma-saṃgraha (Summary of\ncategories and properties), a work better known as\nPra&sacute;astap&amacr;da-bh&amacr;ṣya\n(Pra&sacute;astap&amacr;da’s commentary, customarily\nregarded as a commentary on the\nVai&sacute;eṣika-s&umacr;tra). Its author,\nPra&sacute;astap&amacr;da (c. 6th century ce),\nis a near contemporary of Dign&amacr;ga. Like Dign&amacr;ga,\nPra&sacute;astap&amacr;da uses the expression inference for\nanother (par&amacr;rtha-anum&amacr;na) to refer to\narguments cast in a syllogistic form, thereby making clear his\nrecognition that inferences, or cognitive processes, and arguments, or\nverbal expressions, are two sides of the same coin. Also like\nDign&amacr;ga, Pra&sacute;astap&amacr;da adopts as a canonical\nsyllogism an argument whose core is the same deductively valid\nargument as Dign&amacr;ga’s. However, unlike Dign&amacr;ga, he\nretains the five members for the syllogism, in keeping with the five\nmembers of the analogical syllogism set out by V&amacr;tsy&amacr;yana,\nthough some of the names for the members are different. The following\nsyllogism is reassembled from Pra&sacute;astap&amacr;da’s\ntreatment of inference. (See Randle 1930 p. 176.) \n(The numbers above in square brackets refer to the paragraph numbers\nof the passages containing the relevant sentences in Bronkhorst and\nRamseier (eds) 1994.) Again, like Dign&amacr;ga,\nPra&sacute;astap&amacr;da appeals to the same three conditions to\ndefine a proper reason as those used in the three forms of a reason.\nAnd finally, he identifies and classifies specious reasons in terms of\nthe failure of a reason to satisfy one or other of the three\nforms. \nThe question of whether the deductively valid canonical syllogism\nspread from Dign&amacr;ga to Pra&sacute;astap&amacr;da, or from\nPra&sacute;astap&amacr;da to Dign&amacr;ga, or from some other person\nto the two of them both has yet to be decided. Whatever the answer is\nto this question, it is clear that a deductively valid version of the\ncanonical syllogism came to be adopted virtually by every classical\nIndian thinker and that it made its way to China, Korea and Japan\nthrough the spread of Buddhism. \nIt was not long before the ideas pertaining to the canonical syllogism\nbecame generally accepted not only by other non-Brahmanical thinkers,\nsuch as the Jains, but also by Brahmanical thinkers. For example, the\nJain thinker, Jinabhadra (6th ce), a junior\ncontemporary of Dign&amacr;ga, wrote a commentary on the Jain thinker\nBhadrab&amacr;hu where he took claims in the latter’s work and\nrecast them in the form of the canonical argument as found in\nDign&amacr;ga’s work (Uno 2009). In addition, one finds that the\nM&imath;̄m&amacr;ṁs&amacr; thinker Kum&amacr;rila\nBhaṭṭa (c. early 7th century ce)\nadopted, without special comment, a deductively valid version of the\ncanonical syllogism. His thoughts on the matter are developed at\nlength in the one hundred eighty-eight verses of his\n&Sacute;loka-v&amacr;rttika’s (Gloss in\nverses) Anum&amacr;na-pariccheda (Section on\ninference). At the same time, though the Ny&amacr;ya thinker\nUddyotakara argued vigorously against many of Dign&amacr;ga’s\nviews, he nonetheless advocated a version of the canonical syllogism\nwhich is deductively valid. \nIn spite of the metaphysical differences which distinguished the\nvarious schools of thought, both Buddhist and Brahmanical, all\nthinkers came to use a naive realist’s ontology to specify the\nstates of affairs in connection with the canonical syllogism.\nAccording to this view, the world consists of individual substances,\nor things (dravya), universals (s&amacr;m&amacr;nya)\nand relations between them. The fundamental relation is the one of\noccurrence (vṛtti). The relata of this relation are\nknown as substratum (dharmin) and superstratum\n(dharma) respectively. The relation has two forms: contact\n(saṃyoga) and inherence (samav&amacr;ya). So,\nfor example, one individual substance, a pot, may occur on another,\nsay the reason, by the relation of contact. In this case, the pot is\nthe superstratum and the reason is the substratum. Or, a universal,\nsay treeness, may occur in an individual substance, say an individual\ntree, by the relation of inherence. Here, treeness, the superstratum,\ninheres in the individual tree, the substratum. The converse of the\nrelation of occurrence is the relation of possession. In addition, the\nrelation of pervasion (vy&amacr;pti), or what had also been\nreferred to as the relation of indispensibility\n(a-vin&amacr;-bh&amacr;va), can also be defined in terms of\nthe occurrence relation: one superstratum pervades another just in\ncase wherever the second occurs the first occurs. The converse of the\npervasion relation is the concomitance relation (anvaya) and\nits contrapositive is exclusion (vyatireka). As a result of\nthese relations, the world embodies a structure: if one superstratum,\ndesignated as H, is concomitant with another superstratum, designated\nas S, and if a particular substratum, say p, possesses the former\nsuperstratum, then it possesses the second. This structure is the one\nwhich underlies the classical Indian canonical syllogism. \nThough the canonical syllogism is central to the development of\nreflection on argument and reasoning in preclassical and classical\nIndia, other forms of argument were also recognized as good. One form,\nas mentioned above, is reductio ad absurdum\n(prasaṅga). Others include suppositional reasoning\n(tarka) (Bagchi 1953) and a form of reasoning akin to what\ncontemporaries would call disjunctive syllogism\n(arth&amacr;patti) (Keating (ed) 2020). At the same time,\nthere are forms of argument, different from the fallacious rejoinders\nand specious reasons, which were also regarded as bad. They include\narguments which lead to an infinite regress\n(anavasth&amacr;), mentioned above, as well as various forms\nof circularity. Finally, there are two important forms of argument:\none peculiar to Buddhists, known as the tetralemma\n(catuṣkoṭi), and the other peculiar to the Jains\n(sy&amacr;dv&amacr;da).","contact.mail":"brendan.gillon@mcgill.ca","contact.domain":"mcgill.ca"}]
