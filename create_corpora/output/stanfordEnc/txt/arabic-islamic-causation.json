Among the theologians\n(mutakallimūn), dispute about the distribution of agency\nand causal power played a role in the interpretation of revealed\naccounts of God and his relationship to the world. By contrast, the\nphilosophers (falāsifah) saw themselves as developing a\nrationalist science begun by Aristotle. In this tradition, to know a\nthing is to know its causes. Discovery of the nature of causation is\nregarded as fundamental to science.\n\n\nIn the classical period, at least, theology and philosophy developed\nseparately. Indeed, philosophy’s independence from theology in\nthis period is striking as compared to its subordinate status as the\nhandmaid of theology in the Medieval Latin West. Nevertheless, debate\nacross theology and philosophy contributed to the development of both\ntraditions.\n\nGenerally speaking, Islamic theologians in the Classical period saw\nthe created world as comprised of atoms and their\naccidents (Dhanani 1994; Frank 1999). They held that\nGod produced this world at an initial moment, and that He\nreproduces it at every subsequent moment in which it exists. They\nalso identified God as the immediate cause of every change in the\ncreated world. For example, according to their view, God\ncreated the atoms that comprise my skin, and the accidents of\npaleness that belongs to those atoms, at the initial moment of\ntheir existence, and he recreates them at all subsequent moments in\nwhich they exist. If my skin retains its paleness over a period\nof time, this is due to God’s continuous recreation of its\npaleness. Likewise, if my skin reddens when exposed to\nsunlight, this is due to God’s ceasing to recreate its paleness,\nand creating in it redness instead. (This would involve His creating a\nseries of accidents of deepening shades of red.) \nEighth-century Muʿtazilite theologians made an important\nexception to this general account: they claimed that human\nbeings have the power to produce their own actions, whether these\nare thoughts, volitions or bodily movements. They saw this position as\nrequired by divine justice (Wolfson 1976; Frank 1982, 1983, 1985;\nVasalou 2008). Suppose, for example, that I intentionally strike you\nand that, as a result, you fall into a coma. According to\nthe ontology just described, this event involves the coming into\nbeing of several accidents, including my choice\n(ikhtiyār) to strike you, my bodily motion of striking,\nand your falling into a coma. According to the Muʿtazilites,\nI must be the source of these accidents; if I were\nnot, divine reward or punishment of me on the basis of my\nactions would be unjust. \nFor Muʿtazilite theologians, then, the circle of agents\nincludes both God and humanity, since human beings cause certain\naccidents. Some of these accidents are directly produced by human\nagents; for example, my choice to strike you and my bodily motion of\nstriking. Others are produced by “generation”\n(tawallud); for example, your falling into a coma. A human\nagent produces an accident by generation when she produces\nthe cause (sabab) of the accident, but not the accident\nitself. (The accident itself is brought into being by God,\nunless impeded by another accident.) The production of accidents\nby generation was not supposed to involve shared responsibility\nbetween God and human beings, since the point of identifying a\nhuman being as the source of such accidents was to attribute\nresponsibility for their production to that human being.  \nThis approach to agency engendered debate among Muʿtazilites\nabout the scope of human responsibility. One topic of concern\nwas the relationship between motivation and action. Given that\nmotivation is determined by antecedent causes, were an agent’s\nmotivation the sufficient cause of her action, responsibility for the\naction would seem to lie with the source of the motivation, which\nmay be external to the agent. According to ʿAbd al-Jabbār\n(935–1025), motivation is not the sufficient cause of action,\nwhich requires choice as well (Frank 1982). This response links human\nagency and responsibility to choice. \nIn the ninth century, many mutakallimūn were persuaded\nby al-Ashʿarī (874–936) that Muʿtazilite accounts\nof human action incorrectly limit divine power. According to\nal-Ashʿarī, the doctrine of divine power requires that God\nbe in complete control of the production of all atoms and accidents.\nFor this reason, he rejected the Muʿtazilite view that human\nagents create or generate certain accidents.\nAl-Ashʿarī developed a rival position on human\naction, whose core doctrine is divine creation of the powers by which\nhuman beings perform their actions (Frank 1966). Suppose, again,\nthat I intentionally strike you and that, as a result, you fall into a\ncoma. As al-Ashʿarī sees it, this occurs by God creating in\nme a power through which I generate your falling into a coma. This\npower is a power for a specific action, namely, my striking you in a\nparticular way at a particular time. It is an accident that\nbelongs to me only temporarily. Though the power is in me, God is in\ncomplete control of what happens, since he elects to create the power.\nAl-Ashʿarī and his followers used the term kasb\n(acquisition) to designate this type of power. In his treatise On\nPower, al-Ghazālī (1056–1111) explains the\ndoctrine of acquisition as a middle position between that of the\ndeterminists, who deny that created things have power, and that of the\nMuʿtazilites, who hold that humanity produces certain accidents.\nAl-Ghazālī rejects the determinist position on the\nground that it cannot account for the difference between a deliberate\nhuman action and an involuntary one, such as a bodily tremor. And\nhe also rejects the Muʿtazilite position; central to his\nargument against them is an appeal to the pervasiveness of divine\npower. On the basis of his analysis of these rival positions,\nal-Ghazālī draws two conclusions. First, it must be possible\nfor two possessors of power, a human being and God, to be related to\nthe same object of power. Second, the power possessed by the human\nbeing cannot be causally related to the object of power because this\nwould conflict with the pervasiveness of divine power. He links these\nconclusions to the doctrine of acquisition. As he sees it, this\ndoctrine attributes created power to humanity, but it also maintains\nthat the relationship between this created power and its object is\nnon-causal (al-Ghazālī AIFI; McGinnis and Reisman 2007:\n254–265; Marmura 1994). This account of acquisition\nsuggests that God alone has causal power. \nIn sum, whereas Muʿtazilite theologians appealed to divine\njustice to show that the circle of agents includes God and humanity,\nal-Ashʿarī and his followers appealed to divine omnipotence\nto limit agency to God alone. Broadly speaking, Ashʿarite\ntheologians seem to endorse occasionalism, the view that God is the\nonly true cause. Some interpreters, however, consider\nal-Ashʿarī’s claim that human beings are the subjects\nof temporary powers for specific actions to indicate that his position\nfalls short of full-blown occasionalism (Frank 1966). \nAshʿarite theologians also attacked Aristotelian views of\ncausation. Some of their arguments were addressed by\nArabic falāsifah. Relayed by\nal-Ghazālī, Ashʿarite accounts\nof causation contributed to the development of occasionalist\ndoctrines in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (Nadler 1996;\nPerler and Rudolph 2000). See the entry on\n occasionalism. \nThe Arabic word falsafah is taken from the Greek\nphilosophia. Falsafah is understood by our authors\nas an intellectual practice developed in Ancient Greece, which\nemphasizes the use of rational understanding and demonstration in the\npursuit of knowledge (ʿilm). For them, the most\nimportant and influential of the Ancient Greek philosophers is\nAristotle, whom they deem “the First Teacher”. Other\ninfluences include Neoplatonic thinkers, especially Proclus and\nPlotinus, as well as Ancient Greek commentators on Aristotle, such as\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. See the entry on\n Greek sources in Arabic and Islamic philosophy. \nJust as Aristotle is “the First Teacher” for the\nphilosophers, so his doctrine of the four causes is the starting point\nfor their accounts of causation. In Physics, Aristotle\nintroduces this doctrine as ancillary to the study of natural change:\nWe must proceed to consider the character and number of causes, he\nsays, because to know a thing is to grasp the “why” of it,\nand this is to grasp its primary cause. He then posits four types of\ncauses to explain natural change (whether substantial, i.e., coming to\nbe and passing away, or accidental, i.e., change of quantity, quality\nor place). In works of natural philosophy and metaphysics, Arabic\nauthors defend Aristotle’s view that we must posit four (and\nonly four) types of causes: material, formal, efficient and final.\nGenerally speaking, they maintain that each type of cause contributes\nto the goal of explanation and that the four causes together are\nsufficient for explanation. \nMaterial and formal causes are considered as intrinsic to or immanent\nin their effects, efficient and final causes as extrinsic to their\neffects (Wisnovsky 2003b). While the philosophers examine each type of\ncause, they appear to devote greater attention to the latter pair, the\nefficient and final causes. Their accounts of these have therefore\nreceived more scholarly notice. Still, certain aspects of their\naccounts of Aristotle’s material and formal causes have been\nstudied (Bertolacci 2002). Perhaps the most important of these is the\ndoctrine of “corporeal form” (ṣūrah jismiyyah),\nwhich was developed to explain a defining feature of body: its\nreceptivity to the three dimensions of length, breadth and depth\n(Hyman 1965; Stone 2001; Shihadeh 2014). However, their discussions of\ncorporeal form contribute primarily to their accounts of substance,\nnot causation. Their contributions to the philosophy of causation\nemerge from their discussions of the efficient and final\ncauses. \nIn Physics 2.3, Aristotle says that the causes include the\nprimary principle of motion and coming to rest. In Arabic\nphilosophical works, the terms “agent”\n(al-fāʿil), “active”\n(al-faʿʿāl) and “efficient”\n(al-fāʿilah) refer to this type of cause. Generally\nspeaking, the philosophers consider the circle of agents to encompass\nnatural bodies, created intellects and God. They regard God as a\ncreative agent in the sense that his activity presupposes nothing\noutside of him, not even matter. Most of the philosophers see creation\nas an eternal act, not a temporal one. Al-Kindī (800–870)\nis exceptional in defending creation in time. Ibn Rushd\n(1126–1198), known to English speakers by his Latinized name,\nAverroes, is also exceptional: in his mature works, he rejects\ncreation as incompatible with Aristotelian texts and principles. In\nhis Long Commentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics, Book\nLam, for example, he interprets Aristotle’s God as an\nultimate final cause of motion, not a creative agent (Genequand 1984).\nArabic philosophical accounts of God as a creative agent are partly\nderived from Neoplatonic texts (Wisnovsky 2002; Kukkonen 2010). No\ndoubt these accounts are also influenced by a cultural context in\nwhich the term “agent” is associated with God and with the\ndivine power to create. Still, it is important to note that the\nphilosophers attempt to demonstrate their accounts of God as a\ncreative agent, often in novel ways. So, they cannot be said merely to\nfollow tradition or culture on this issue. \nThe philosophers’ expansive view of the scope of agency presents\na challenge with respect to defining the efficient cause: it demands\nan overarching account, which encompasses natural and creative\nagents. \nEarly attempts to provide an overarching account of the efficient\ncause are found in writings by al-Kindī. These include The\nExplanation of the Proximate Efficient Cause for Generation and\nCorruption (al-Kindī RAKAF: 214–37; McGinnis and\nReisman 2007: 1–16). In this text, al-Kindī illustrates the\nefficient cause by means of an example drawn from the realm of art:\nthe making of a golden coin. In this example, the efficient cause is\nthe craftsman who makes the form of “coin” become one with\nsome gold. Divine efficient causality is also construed in terms of\nart, though its art is said to be very superior to ours: the\ncraftsmanship in a bed or chair is as nothing in comparison to the\nharmonious product of God’s most perfect command. \nIn this text, al-Kindī also employs a distinction between\nproximate and remote efficient causes to show how created efficient\ncausality depends on divine causality: \nThe remote efficient cause is like someone who shoots an arrow at an\nanimal and kills it. The one who shoots the arrow is the remote cause\nof killing the animal, whereas the arrow is the proximate cause of its\nbeing killed; for the one who shoots with the intention of killing the\nanimal produces the piercing action of the arrow, but the arrow\nproduces the killing of the living thing by wounding it (McGinnis and\nReisman 2007: 4). \nThe example emphasizes the instrumental nature of the causality of a\nproximate efficient cause. That the arrow acquires the force needed\nfor its piercing action, and that it pierces an animal, rather than a\ntree, depends on the hunter’s shooting it with the intention to\nkill the animal. \nAl-Kindī applies his distinction between proximate and remote\nefficient causes to explain generation and corruption as follows.\nCreated things are the proximate efficient causes of generation and\ncorruption, but God is their remote efficient cause. God’s\ncontribution to generation and corruption has to do with the\nharmonious order of his creation. This order is seen in the\nrelationships between created things, especially their causal\nrelationships. \nIn sum, al-Kindī suggests in this text that both created and\ndivine efficient causes can be understood in terms of craftsmanship.\nThe craftsman model serves as the overarching account of the efficient\ncause. On the other hand, al-Kindī identifies two major\ndifferences between created and divine agency. First, divine\ncraftsmanship is far superior to that of created things. Second, the\nefficient causality of created things depends on divine efficient\ncausality. The actions of the former depend on the harmonious order of\nGod’s creation. \nIn a second text, The One True and Complete Agent and the\nIncomplete Metaphorical Agent, al-Kindī may seem to\nattribute genuine agency to God alone (al-Kindī OPK:\n169–171; McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 22–23). In this text,\nal-Kindī defines a true agent as one that acts without being\nacted upon in any way. God is said to be the sole true agent. He\nlikewise defines a metaphorical agent as one who acts as a result of\nhaving been acted upon, i.e., one that is both an agent and a patient.\nEvery created agent is said to be a metaphorical agent. Al-Kindī\nthen argues that God is truly the First Cause of everything acted upon\nbecause he is an agent not acted upon in any way. As he sees its, God\nis the immediate cause of a first thing acted upon and a cause through\nmediation of the effects of the first thing acted upon and so on\n(Adamson 2007: 57–62). Al-Kindī’s account of\n“true” agency is rather different from that of an\noccasionalist. While the occasionalist holds that causal efficacy\nbelongs to God alone, al-Kindī attributes causal efficacy to God\nand to created things. The latter differ from God in that they are\nboth agents and patients. Generally speaking, the doctrine of\noccasionalism is rejected by the philosophers. \nThe most extensive treatment of Aristotelian efficient causation, and\nthe most influential, is given by Ibn Sīnā (987–1037),\nknown to English speakers by his Latinized name, Avicenna. Avicenna\ntreats the efficient cause in numerous works, including\nKitāb al-Najāt (Book of\nSalvation) and Kitāb al-Ishārāt\nwa-l-tanbīhāt (Book of Remarks and Admonitons), but his\nmost developed accounts of the efficient cause appear in the\nPhysics and Metaphysics of his magnum opus,\nKitāb al-Shifāʾ (Book of\nHealing) (McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 209–211; Inati\n2014: Fourth Class; Avicenna PH: I.10–15; Avicenna MH: IV.1–2,\nVI.1–3). \nIn the Physics of the Book of Healing, Avicenna\ndefines the efficient cause or agent as follows: \nIn natural things, agent is often said of the principle of\nanother’s motion insofar as it is other. By motion, we\nmean here whatever passes from potency to act in a given matter.\n(Avicenna PH: 64) \nThis definition accords with the subject of the science of\nphysics, namely, body insofar as it moves and comes to rest, and it\nis sufficient for the purposes of doing natural\nphilosophy (Lammer 2018: ch. 2–3). However, with\nrespect to science in general, this “physical” definition is\nprovisional: \nWhen the efficient principle is considered not with respect to natural\nthings, but rather with respect to existence itself, there will be a\nmore general concept. (Avicenna PH: 65) \nThe task of developing this more general conception of the efficient\ncause falls to the metaphysician, whose investigations transcend the\nconcerns of any of the particular sciences, e.g., natural\nphilosophy. \nIn the Metaphysics of the Book of Healing, Avicenna\ndefines each of the four causes in relation to the subject studied in\nmetaphysics, the existent qua existent. He defines the\nefficient cause or agent as that which bestows existence to another\n(Avicenna MH: 194). He distinguishes his metaphysical definition of\nthe efficient cause from that of the natural philosopher as\nfollows: \nMetaphysical philosophers do not mean by “agent” only the\nprinciple of motion, as the natural philosophers mean, but the\nprinciple and giver of existence, as in the case of God with respect\nto the world. As for the natural efficient cause, it does not bestow\nany existence other than motion in one of the forms of motion. Thus,\nin the natural sciences, that which bestows existence is a principle\nof motion. (Avicenna MH: 195, trans. modified) \nIn this passage, Avicenna states that natural efficient causes do not\n“bestow any existence other than motion in one of the forms of\nmotion” and that “in the natural sciences, that which\nbestows existence is a principle of motion”. These statements\nsuggest that natural efficient causes do bestow existence, albeit in\nan inferior way. So, Avicenna considers his definition of the\nefficient cause as a giver of being to another to encompass both\nnatural agents and creative agents. \nAvicenna proceeds to elaborate his “metaphysical”\nconception of the efficient cause in a series of arguments, which aim\nto correct common errors about this type of cause. One such error\nis the claim that every agent is first inactive and then active,\nand the related claim that every agent is also a recipient of action\n(Avicenna MH: 200). These claims accord with familiar examples\nof agency. Suppose I rise from my chair upon hearing\nthe doorbell. I am first inactive and then active. And my activity\n(rising) is partly due to my being the recipient of action\n(hearing the sound made by the bell). Avicenna maintains that,\nthough agency often or mostly occurs in this way, it need\nnot: being first inactive and then active, and being the\nrecipient of action, are not essential characteristics of\nagency. Indeed, because inactivity and being affected are opposed\nto activity and action, he reasons, the former do not belong to the\naccount of agency, strictly speaking. In correcting this error about\nthe efficient cause, Avicenna aims to make conceptual room for divine\nagency. One feature of divine agency, which we have already seen in\nal-Kindī, is that God acts without his being affected in any way.\nHowever, Avicenna does not appeal to accepted features of divine\nagency to defend his view. Rather, he attempts to rebut the common\naccount of agency on  independent grounds. \nAs we have seen (in\n §2.2.1),\n al-Kindī, in one text, draws a distinction between a\n“true” agent, one that acts without being acted upon, and\na “metaphorical” agent, one that is both an agent and a\npatient. Avicenna likewise distinguishes the agent that acts without\nbeing acted upon from the agent that is both an agent and a patient.\nWhile he does not deem the latter a “metaphorical” agent,\nhe does elaborate a hierarchical conception of agency. \nAvicenna explains the superiority of a highest type of efficient cause\nas follows: Where something is such that, whenever it exists, it\nproduces the existence of something else by virtue of its own essence,\nand where its effect exists after absolute nonexistence and is\npermanent, then that thing has a higher claim to causality than other\nthings. For such an efficient cause entirely prevents the nonexistence\nof its effect; it gives complete existence to the effect (Avicenna MH:\n203; Marmura 1984). \nAvicenna explains the inferiority of the lowest type of efficient\ncause as follows: This type gives being to an effect that does not\nexist after absolute nonexistence but after a specific privation in\nmatter. Of this type of agent, he says that its power to give being to\nanother is weak, of short duration, and intermittent (Avicenna MH:\n204). Sublunary substances such as plants and animals are efficient\ncauses of this lowest type. \nAvicenna also recognizes an intermediate type of efficient cause: This\nthird type gives being to an effect that does not exist after absolute\nnonexistence or after a specific privation in matter; rather the\nexistence of this effect is preceded by the existence of something\nelse, which is non-material. Avicenna mentions that there is dispute\nabout whether an agent of this third type should be called a\n“creator”. He says that while some wish to reserve that\nterm for the efficient causality of the first cause (God), he favors\nthe opposite view: “creation” is properly said of every\nagent which gives being to an effect whose existence is not preceded\nby privation in matter. This intermediate type of efficient cause\nplays a role in Avicenna’s emanationist account of creation. On\nthis account, creation occurs in a stepwise way beginning with the\noriginal creative act of God, whose immediate effect is an intellect.\nThe first created intellect then creates three things: (i) the body of\nthe outermost sphere, (ii) the soul which moves the outermost sphere\nand (iii) a second intellect. The second intellect likewise creates\nthree things and so on. The lowest of the created\nintellects—namely, the Agent Intellect—creates the form\nand matter of the sublunary world, as well as the rational souls of\nindividual human beings. Avicenna adapts his account of emanation from\nal-Fārābī (870–950), known among the philosophers\nas the “Second Teacher”, though his version of emanation\ndiffers from that of al-Fārābī in several ways\n(Davidson 1992). \nAvicenna’s hierarchical account of agency acknowledges the\nsuperiority of divine causation and identifies the differences between\ncreative and non-creative efficient causes. Still, it supports his\nearlier suggestion that he means to offer a unified account of the\nefficient cause, which encompasses both natural and creative agents.\nFor each member of the hierarchy is construed as that which gives\nbeing to another. So, in his Metaphysics, Avicenna provides\nan overarching account of the efficient cause as that which gives\nbeing to another. \nThis unified account may seem incompatible with Avicenna’s\nuse of a distinction between “true” and\n“auxiliary” efficient causes. On his account of this\ndistinction, however, the term “auxiliary” merely\ndescribes a true efficient cause insofar as its action aids that of\nanother true efficient cause (Richardson 2013). This account emerges\nfrom his defense of the view that the efficient cause is simultaneous\nwith its effect. He sees the opposite view—that the efficient\ncause is temporally prior to its effect—as another common error,\nwhich arises from consideration of ordinary events and processes, such\nas construction and reproduction: the builder building is temporally\nprior to the existence of the house; the father inseminating is\ntemporally prior to the existence of the child. Avicenna argues that\nthis account misreports the proper effects of ordinary efficient\ncauses. The proper effect of the builder is building, not the\nexistence of the house, and the proper effect of the father is\ninsemination, not the existence of the child. Builders and fathers are\ntrue efficient causes of building and insemination, but they are only\nauxiliary efficient causes of the existence of buildings and children.\nSo, builders and fathers are simultaneous with, not temporally prior\nto, their proper effects. Still, their actions make some contribution\nto the existence of buildings and children. This contribution is\nacknowledged through their designation as auxiliary efficient causes\nof the existence of buildings and children. The claim that builders\nand fathers are only auxiliary efficient causes of the existence of\nbuildings and children invites us to investigate the true causes of\ntheir existence. According to Avicenna, the proximate efficient cause\nof the existence of sublunary substance is the Agent Intellect, while\nits ultimate efficient cause is God. \nAvicenna’s account of the efficient cause was influential in the\nMedieval Latin West in part because it offers an explanation of divine\nagency within an Aristotelian philosophical framework (Gilson 1958,\n1962). It appears to have influenced discussion of divine agency by\nScholastic theologians, including Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus\n(Druart 2002; Acar 2005). While Avicenna also had many adherents\nwithin his own culture, his positions on numerous issues, including\nthe scope of efficient causation, were criticized not only by Islamic\ntheologians but also by his fellow philosophers. \nAs mentioned earlier (in\n §1.2),\n Ashʿarite theologians tend to hold that God alone has causal\npower. They primarily support this view by appeal to the doctrine of\ndivine omnipotence. Still, discussion of the nature of agency also\nplays a role in some of their arguments. For example, in The\nIncoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghazālī maintains\nthat “agent” (al-fāʿil) \nrefers to that from whom the act proceeds; this is one who acts by\nwill and choice and has knowledge (al-ʿilm) of what is\nwilled. (al-Ghazālī IP: 57). \nThis argument suggests that we should restrict the scope of agency to\nintelligent beings on conceptual grounds. Al-Ghazālī makes a\nsimilar argument in his treatise On Power\n(al-Ghazālī AIFI; McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 254–265;\nMarmura 1994). The conclusion of the conceptual argument allows for\nagency in any intelligent being and so allows for human agency.\nWhether al-Ghazālī accepts this implication of his\nconceptual argument is unclear (Druart 2006). \nAverroes undertakes to defend positions closer to Aristotle against\n“innovations” by later Aristotelians. These innovations\ninclude al-Fārābī’s and Avicenna’s\nemanationist accounts of creation. While Averroes accepts emanation in\nhis early writings, he denounces it with vigor in his mature works\n(Averroes MTE; Genequand 1984; Davidson 1992). He argues that\nGod’s existence can be satisfactorily shown only via a proof\nfrom motion (Davidson 1987: 311–335; Twetten 1995; Kukkonen\n2002). He also argues that, strictly speaking, God is not a creator:\nhis causality is that of an ultimate final cause of motion. This is\nsuggested in the Incoherence of the Incoherence, where he\nclaims that God is an agent by way of final causality (Averroes ITI:\n138). It is perhaps mostly plainly stated in his Long Commentary\non Aristotle’s Metaphysics, Book Lam (Genequand\n1984). From this position, it follows that certain aspects of\nAvicenna’s accounts of the efficient cause are otiose: there is\nno need to revise Aristotle’s account of the efficient cause to\nencompass creative agents. \nAverroes’ account of divine causality reflects his position that\ntruth is to be found through correct interpretation of Aristotle,\ntogether with correct application of the principles and methods of\nphilosophy. According to Averroes, the methods of philosophy are\nuniquely suited to establish truth (Taylor 2000). The role of religion\nis to transmit that truth to the masses via narrative and metaphor.\nGenerally speaking, this position on the relationship between\nphilosophy and religion is shared by other Aristotelians in the Arabic\ntradition, including al-Fārābī and Avicenna. The latter\ndiffer from Averroes in that they are less concerned than he is to\ninterpret Aristotle correctly. Rather, they adopt Aristotle’s\nphilosophical framework, but feel free to modify it in light of their\nown discoveries. \nIn Physics 2.3, Aristotle says that “the end or\nthat for the sake of which the thing is done” is also considered\na type of cause. In Arabic philosophical works, the terms “final\ncause” (al-ʿillah al-ghāʾiyyah) and\n“end” (al-ghāyah) designate this type of\ncause. The philosophers hold both natural motion and divine\naction to occur for the sake of an end, though they consider the\nlatter to differ from the former in an important way. Natural bodies\nare said to act for the sake of something distinct from themselves,\nwhich they lack. For example, an animal builds for the sake of\nshelter. By contrast, God’s end is not distinct from God itself,\nrather God acts for the sake of itself. This idea is implicit in\nal-Kindī’s account of the final cause in The\nExplanation of the Proximate Efficient Cause for Generation and\nCorruption, which states that the end is either something\nexternal to the efficient cause, which compels it to act, or it is not\nsomething external to the efficient cause; in the latter case, the\nefficient cause acts “only because of itself” (McGinnis\nand Reisman 2007: 4). Presumably, the latter case describes divine\naction. Avicenna attempts to explain the idea that God cannot act for\nthe sake of something distinct from itself as follows. He argues that\nan agent’s desire for an end distinct from itself implies the\nagent’s imperfection, since the object of the agent’s\ndesire must be superior to the agent. In support of the latter claim,\nhe reasons that the object of an agent’s desire must be\nsomething that perfects or benefits the agent (Avicenna MH: 321). So,\nan absolutely perfect agent as is God cannot act from desire for an\nend distinct from itself. Avicenna also argues that an agent’s\nintending something distinct from itself implies the agent’s\nmultiplicity, since it involves multiple acts of knowledge, e.g.,\nknowledge of the intention, of the reason for the intention and of the\nbenefit to the agent to be derived from the intention (Avicenna MH:\n326; McGinnis 2010: 206–208). So, an absolutely simple agent as\nis God cannot act by intending for the sake of something other than\nitself. \nArabic philosophical discussions of final causality also aim to meet\nvarious objections to Aristotelian teleology. Avicenna takes up this\nchallenge with great energy. Again, the most developed arguments are\nfound in the Physics and Metaphysics of the Book\nof Healing. In Physics I 13–14, Avicenna attempts\nto meet to objections derived from Aristotle’s discussion of\nAncient materialists, such as Democritus and Empedocles. In\nMetaphysics VI 5, he treats additional objections. Perhaps\nthese are of greatest interest. \nOne objection asserts as obvious that certain human actions are\ntrivial or purposeless (ʿabath); the example given is\nplaying with one’s beard (Avicenna MH: 220–225). This\nobjection challenges the idea that every natural motion has an end or\ngoal. The objection is probably derived from Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho claims in On Fate that twiddling with toothpicks and\ntouching and pulling one’s hair do not have a cause in the sense\nof an end (Sharples 1983: 44). Against this objection, Avicenna\nmaintains that apparently trivial human actions are motivated by\nunconscious desire for pleasure, the good of the animal soul\n(Richardson 2015). This argument derives support from Avicenna’s\noriginal and influential account of the internal senses, which\nexplains the cognitive bases of such actions (Avicenna ASAN:\n43–45, 58–61, 163–69; Black 2000, 2013a). \nAvicenna also devotes considerable attention to this objection:\n“Why is the end considered a prior cause when in fact it is an\neffect of the other causes?”(Avicenna MH: 220, trans. modified).\nThis objection asserts that it is inappropriate to include the end\namong the types of causes on the ground that causes are ontologically\nprior to effects. Avicenna’s reply involves a distinction\nbetween (i) the “thingness” (shayʾiyyah) or\nessence (māhiyyah) of the end and (ii) the existence of\nthe end: while the existence of the end in concrete particulars is\nposterior to and, thus, an effect of the other causes, the thingness\n(or essence) of the end exists prior to action and causes the\ncausality of the other causes (Avicenna MH: 228; Wisnovsky 2000,\n2003a). He also makes a further point, which is historically\nsignificant: the thingness (or essence) of the end “is not a\ncause unless it occurs as an image in the soul, or as something\nanalogous to that” (Avicenna MH: 228, trans. modified). \nAvicenna’s account of the priority of the final cause was\ninfluential in the Latin West, where it was taken by some to support\nthe view that the scope of final causation be restricted to agents\nwith cognitive powers (Maier 1955). This interpretation also appears\nin the Arabic tradition. Roughly speaking, Avicenna was taken to have\nshown that (i) the claim that the end is a cause of motion depends on\nthe claim that it is prior to and a cause of the causality of the\nother causes and (ii) the claim that the end is prior to and a cause\nof the causality of the other causes is true only in cases where it\nexists in the mind or soul of the efficient cause. \nWith respect to this interpretation of Avicenna, it is important to\nemphasize that, in his account of the priority of the final cause, he\nmentions that the thingness (or essence) of the end may exist prior to\nmotion as an image in the soul “or as something analogous to\nthat” (Avicenna MH: 228, trans. modified). In this passage, he\nsuggests that the thingness or essence of the end may exist prior to\nmotion either as an object of cognition, or in another way, which is\ndifferent from, but analogous to, existing as an object of cognition.\nFurthermore, Avicenna’s various discussions of the final cause\ngive every indication that he considers the motion of natural bodies\nwithout cognitive powers to occur for the sake of an end, which is\nprior to and a cause of that motion. Still, it seems especially\ndifficult to prove that that the end of natural motion is prior to and\na cause of that motion. \nThis issue was widely discussed by Arabic philosophers and\ntheologians. In his commentary on Avicenna’s Pointers and\nReminders, al-Ṭūsī attempts to resolve this\nproblem by suggesting that we can attribute a sort of prior awareness\n(shuʿūr) to the nature of a body (Avicenna and\nṬūsī PR: part IV, 7, 18). Ṭūsī makes\nthese remarks in reply to Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī’s\ncomplaint that Avicenna’s conception of the final cause applies\nonly to cognitive agents. By contrast, al-Ghazālī maintains\nthat the inanimate is called “a seeker and a willer” only\nfiguratively: \nFor it is said the stone falls because it wills [to move to] the\ncenter and seeks it, when seeking and willing in reality are only\nconceivable in conjunction with the knowledge (al-ʿilm)\nof what is willed and sought after and are [thus] conceivable only of\nanimals. (al-Ghazālī IP: 57) \nAvicenna may be able to meet this objection by appeal to his account\nof natural inclination (Richardson 2015). \nOne striking feature of Arabic and Islamic accounts of causation is\nthe use of the modal terms “necessary” and\n“possible” to analyze the causal relation. This practice\nis especially prominent in Avicenna’s discussions of causality,\nwhich emphasize his necessitation thesis: “with the existence of\nits cause, the existence an effect is necessary”. Although\nAvicenna does not employ this thesis to restrict the scope of causal\npower to God, his necessitation thesis appears to have played a role\nin the history of occasionalism insofar as it is a target of\nal-Ghazālī’s “no necessary connection”\nargument, which is discussed below (in\n §3.2). \nIn the Metaphysics of the Book of Healing, Avicenna\ndefends the necessitation thesis in order to support his coexistence\nthesis, which states that cause and effect coexist in time. In other\nwords, Avicenna considers the necessitation thesis to entail that the\npriority of cause to effect is ontological, not temporal (Marmura\n1981a). \nIn the central part of the argument for the necessitation thesis,\nAvicenna attempts to show that the causal relation cannot be fully\nunderstood in terms of possibility: \n[What happens] has the possibility of happening and the possibility of\nnot happening. It is not insofar as its happening is possible that it\nexists. And it is not only insofar as something else has the\npossibility of making it happen that it exists from another. Having\nthe possibility of making a thing happen is not sufficient for making\nit happen. Given the mere possibility of making a thing happen, which\nis not sufficient, the thing would sometimes exist when it exists and\nsometimes not exist when it exists. […] But something that has\nthe very same relationship to a thing’s existing from it as to\nits not existing from it has no greater claim to be the thing’s\ncause than not to be its cause. Indeed, sound reason demands that\nthere be a state that differentiates between the thing’s\nexisting from it and its not existing from it. (Avicenna MH:\n126–7, trans. modified) \nIn this argument, Avicenna analyzes an event as follows: considered in\nitself, the event may exist or not exist; and, considered in relation\nto what has the mere possibility of making it happen, the event may\nexist or not exist. So, considered in either of these ways, the event\nmay or may not exist: its existence or nonexistence hangs in the\nbalance. He then asserts that the existence or nonexistence of one\nthing from another requires a difference-maker, which destroys this\nequilibrium. To support this conclusion, he appeals to a version of\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason, which states that, for everything\nthat exists from another, there is a sufficient reason why it exists\nfrom that other rather than does not exist from that other. He then\nlinks the Principle of Sufficient Reason to the notion of\n“cause”: by “cause” we mean not what has the\nmere possibility of making something happen, but rather what is\nsufficient to make it happen (Richardson 2014). On the basis of this\nargument, Avicenna ultimately concludes that, with the existence of\nits cause, the existence of the effect is not merely possible, it is\nnecessary. \nAvicenna considers this account of “cause” to apply to all\ninstances of the causal relation. Still, he recognizes important\ndifferences across the various things which function as causes. Most\nimportant are the differences between God and sublunary substance.\nAccording to Avicenna, with God’s existence, the existence of\nhis sole immediate effect, the first intelligence, is necessary. His\nreasoning involves the following ideas. First, God needs nothing\noutside himself to produce the first intelligence. Second, God is\nimmutable. Avicenna considers God’s immutability to entail that\nhis knowledge and volition are also immutable. God’s knowledge\nand volition are the principles by which he acts. So, whenever God\nexists, he possesses the knowledge and volition by which he produces\nthe first intelligence. So, with God’s existence, the existence\nof the first intelligence is necessary. \nBy contrast, with the existence of a sublunary substance, the\nexistence of its effect is typically not necessary, but merely\npossible. A sublunary substance is a subject of causality\n(mawḍūʿ al-ʿillīyah). Whenever a\nsubject of causality is in a state that differentiates between a\nthing’s existing from it and its not existing from it, \n[t]he effect would then proceed from it necessarily, regardless of\nwhether [the differentiating state] is an act of will, appetite, or\nanger, or something originated, natural or otherwise, or some external\nthing. (Avicenna MH: 127, trans. modified) \nThus, a subject of causality is a substance that functions as a cause\nwhen it is in a certain state. For example, fire functions as a cause\nfor the burning of cotton when its power to burn is actualized in the\ncotton. This state occurs only when contact between agent (fire) and\npatient (cotton) is unimpeded and when the patient (cotton) is itself\nin a suitable state, e.g., the cotton is not wet. \nIn the Incoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghazālī\nprovides the most celebrated critique of Arabic Aristotelian accounts\nof causation. Al-Ghazālī’s first and most influential\nargument against his philosopher opponents appears to target\nAvicenna’s necessitation thesis (Lizzini 2013). He\nwrites, \nThe connection between what is habitually believed to be a cause and\nwhat is habitually believed to be an effect is not necessary,\naccording to us. But [with] any two things, where “this”\nis not “that” and “that” is not\n“this” and where neither the affirmation of the one\nentails the affirmation of the other nor the negation of the one\nentails negation of the other, it is not a necessity of the existence\nof the one that the other should exist, and it is not a necessity of\nthe nonexistence of the one that the other should not exist—for\nexample, the quenching of thirst and drinking, satiety and eating,\nburning and contact with fire, light and the appearance of the sun,\ndeath and decapitation […] and so on to [include] all [that is]\nobservable among connected things in medicine, astronomy, arts, and\ncrafts. Their connection is due to the prior decree of God, who\ncreates them side by side, not to its being necessary in itself,\nincapable of separation. (al-Ghazālī IP: 166) \nAl-Ghazālī denies that natural events involve necessary\nconnections, using as his main example the burning of cotton when in\ncontact with fire: \nFor we allow the possibility of the occurrence of the contact without\nthe burning, and we allow as possible the occurrence of the\ncotton’s transformation into burnt ashes without contact with\nthe fire. [The philosophers], however, deny the possibility of this.\n(al-Ghazālī 2000: 166–7) \nAl-Ghazālī appears to attribute to his Aristotelian\nopponents two main claims: \nHe also contends that (i) and (ii) imply a third claim: \nAl-Ghazālī suggests that, because (iii) is false, his\nopponents’ account of causation in nature is mistaken. One\nquestion raised by the argument is whether his opponents really accept\n(ii); another is whether they consider (i) and (ii) to imply\n(iii). \nIn the Incoherence of the Incoherence, Averroes challenges\nGhazālī’s portrayal of the philosophers’ account\nof causal necessity as follows: \n[A]re the acts which proceed from all things absolutely necessary for\nthose in whose nature it lies to perform them, or are they only\nperformed in most cases or in half the cases? This is a question which\nmust be investigated, since one single action-and-passivity between\ntwo existent things occurs only through one relation out of an\ninfinite number, and it happens often that one relation hinders\nanother. Therefore it is not absolutely certain that fire acts when it\nis brought near a sensitive body, for surely it is not improbable that\nthere should be something which stands in such a relation to the\nsensitive thing as to hinder the action of the fire, as is asserted of\ntalc and other things. But one need not therefore deny fire its\nburning power so long as fire keeps its name and definition. (Averroes\nITI: 318–19) \nAverroes affirms that natural substances, such as fire, are causes.\nYet, he claims that, given fire’s nearness to cotton, it is not\n“absolutely necessary”, nor “absolutely\ncertain” that the cotton burns. In this sentence, he seems to\ndeny that causal connections are necessary connections. On the other\nhand, the reason he denies that fire’s nearness to cotton\nnecessitates the burning of the cotton is that there may be an\nimpediment: the cotton could be covered in talc, which hinders the\naction of the fire. And he suggests that, absent this impediment, the\nburning would certainly take place. So, while he initially seems to\ndeny that causal connections are necessary connections, his overall\nargument suggests that he affirms this claim. Furthermore, his account\nof causal necessity involves a more nuanced version of\nal-Ghazālī’s claim (iii) above (that the affirmation\nof contact between fire and cotton entails the affirmation of the\nburning of the cotton). According to Averroes’ account of causal\nnecessity, the affirmation of contact between fire and cotton, and the\naffirmation that there are no impediments, together entail the\naffirmation of the burning of the cotton. \nIn sum, Averroes responds to al-Ghazālī’s “no\nnecessary connection” argument as follows. He claims that\nal-Ghazālī misreports the philosophers’ account of\ncausal necessity in nature. Furthermore, he suggests that his revised\nversion of their account is true. So, the philosophers’ account\nof causal necessity in nature, properly understood, is not\nmistaken. \nIt is worth noting that Averroes’ own account of causal\nnecessity in nature is roughly in accord with Avicenna’s. As\ndiscussed above (in\n §3.1),\n Avicenna holds that “with the existence of its cause, the\nexistence of the effect is necessary”. He also holds, however,\nthat the existence of a sublunary substance, which functions as a\ncause, is, typically, not sufficient for the exercise of its causality\nand, thus, typically, not sufficient for the existence of the effect\nof its causality. For example, fire functions as a cause of the\nburning of cotton only when its power to burn is actualized in the\ncotton. This not only requires that contact between agent (fire) and\npatient (cotton) be unimpeded but also that the patient (cotton) is\nitself in a suitable state, e.g., the cotton is not wet. \nAccording to Averroes, al-Ghazālī misreports the\nphilosophers’ account of causal necessity in nature. Averroes\nalso suggests that his own revised version of their account is true.\nWhile al-Ghazālī might accept the former claim, he would not\naccept the latter. This has to do with his understanding of the\nmodalities. On his account of “necessary”, a connection\nbetween two things is not necessary if it is conceivable that it be\nsevered (Kukkonen 2000; Dutton 2001). So, if it is conceivable that\nthe cotton not burn, even though its contact with fire is unimpeded\nand it is dry, then it is not necessary that it burn, even when these\nconditions obtain. As we have seen, al-Ghazālī considers it\nconceivable that the cotton not burn, even when these conditions\nobtain. For he says that the connection between burning and contact\nwith fire \nis due to the prior decree of God, who creates them side by side, not\nto its being necessary in itself, incapable of separation.\n(al-Ghazālī IP: 166) \nSo, according to al-Ghazālī, it is conceivable that the\ncotton not burn, even though its contact with fire is unimpeded and it\nis dry, so it is not necessary that it burn, even when these\nconditions obtain. On this view, even Averroes’ revised version\nof the philosophers’ account of causal necessity in nature is\nmistaken. On the other hand, the philosophers do not accept\nal-Ghazālī’s account of “necessary”. More\ngenerally, they do not characterize the modalities in terms of\nconceivability. This suggests that the disagreement between\nal-Ghazālī and the philosophers about causal necessity in\nnature has partly to do with their differing accounts of the\nmodalities (Kukkonen 2000; Dutton 2001). However, the fundamental\nsource of their disagreement is  theological. \nAl-Ghazālī attacks the philosophers’ view of causal\nnecessity in nature in order to safeguard the Muslim belief in\nmiracles and divine omnipotence (al-Ghazālī IP: 165). These\ntenets of faith are incompatible with Avicenna’s account of God.\nAs mentioned earlier (in\n §3.1),\n Avicenna considers God’s immutability to entail that his\nknowledge, volition and action are immutable. He also denies that\nGod knows particular things, except in a universal way (Avicenna MH:\n288; Marmura 1962; Adamson 2005). So, according to Avicenna, God\ncannot act otherwise than he does; furthermore, he cannot plan or\nexecute any particular event. So, God cannot cause a miracle by\naltering his action so as to interrupt the course of nature.\nFurthermore, God cannot cause a miracle by planning and executing a\ngrand series of particular events, which includes a deviation from the\ncourse of nature. On the contrary, God serves as the ultimate\nexplanation of order and stability in the universe, including in the\nrealm of nature. Likewise, Averroes’ mature view, which describes\nGod as an ultimate final cause of motion, who is\nneither a creator, nor an efficient cause of earthly events,\nis obviously incompatible with the view that God can cause\nmiracles. \nOf course, Avicenna and Averroes do not always state in plain terms\nthat their accounts of God are incompatible with Muslim doctrine. They\noften take a conciliatory approach to religious tenets that are in\ntension with truths established by philosophy. This approach is\nrelated to their view that the role of religion is to transmit truth\nto the masses via narrative and metaphor, as discussed above (in\n §2.2.3). \nAristotelian natural philosophy relies in part on sensory observation\nin its attribution of causal powers to natural bodies. So, it is not\nsurprising that Arabic and Islamic thinkers raise objections to\nAristotelian science, which anticipate later philosophical accounts of\nthe problem of induction. Some of these emerge from within\nAristotelianism. Avicenna provides a sustained critique of induction\n(istiqrāʾ) in his treatise On\nDemonstration (al-Burhān), the logical part of the\nBook of Healing. As he sees it, part of the problem is that\ninduction may be supposed to lead to absolute, universal, and certain\npremises, while in reality it leads to merely probable belief. On the\nother hand, he holds that sensory observation together with a\n“hidden syllogism” gives rise to certitude. Avicenna\nelaborates this cognitive process under the heading of\n“experience” (tajribah). Tajribah is the\nArabic translation of the Greek empeiria. Avicenna’s\naccount of experience is derived in part from remarks by Aristotle and\nal-Fārābī on empeiria/tajribah,\nthough it goes beyond these sources (al-Fārābī AMIF:\n24–25; McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 66–67; McGinnis 2003;\nJanssens 2004; Black 2006). \nAs Avicenna describes it, experience involves repeated sensation of\nsome phenomenon that is preserved in memory, e.g., that purging of\nbile follows ingestion of scammony. It also involves a\n“hidden” or implicit process of reasoning. We infer that\nthe repeated connection involves an essential relation between two\nthings: e.g., it is not accidental that the purging of bile follows\nthe ingestion of scammony, for regularities cannot be due to chance.\nThis implicit process of reasoning removes doubt. So, experience gives\nrise to certitude. Avicenna defines certitude in terms of second-order\nbelief: one is certain when one knows that what one has assented to\ncannot be otherwise (Black 2013b: 122). Certitude is not wholly\nsubjective, since knowledge of a proposition requires its truth (Black\n2013b: 125). On the other hand, though experience gives rise to\ncertitude, it does not yield knowledge in the strict sense. For\nknowledge in the strict sense is both necessary and\nexplanatory. From experience we derive our certitude that\nmembers of a certain species cause something; but experience does not\nshow why (McGinnis 2003: 320–1). \nAvicenna also addresses the objection that experience may lead to\nfalse generalizations. He uses the following example. Suppose we had\nseen only black humans and had observed without exception that\nprocreation issues in black children. By experience, we would conclude\nthat all humans are black, i.e., that blackness is essential to\nhumanity. In response to this objection, Avicenna says that knowledge\nderived from experience is conditional, \nwhich is to say that the character of this thing that is repeatedly\nperceived is necessarily joined to something that holds always in the\ndomain in which the thing is repeatedly perceived, unless there is an\nobstacle. (McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 150) \nThis point is applied to the example of the Sudanese as follows: \nwhen procreation is taken to be procreation by black people, or people\nof one such country, then experience will be valid. If procreation is\ntaken to be that of any given people, then experience will not end\nwith the aforementioned particular instances; for that experience\nconcerned a black people, but people absolutely speaking are not\nlimited to black people. (McGinnis and Reisman 2007: 150; McGinnis\n2003: 322–325) \nSo, in response to the objection that experience could lead to false\ngeneralizations, Avicenna advises that proper use of experience would\ninclude careful attention to the domain of a species, which was\nsubject to repeated observation. \nThe problem of induction also plays a role in Ashʿarite attacks\non Aristotelian accounts of causation in nature. As we have seen,\nAristotelian natural philosophy relies in part on repeated observation\nin its attribution of causal powers to natural bodies. Ashʿarite\ntheologians attack this aspect of Aristotelian natural philosophy on\nthe ground that repeated observation of concomitance is not evidence\nof causation. A version of this argument appears in\nal-Ghazālī’s Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers. \nAl-Ghazālī distinguishes a few different positions held by\nhis philosopher opponents. One position considers changes in nature to\nbe brought about by natural bodies alone, without any contribution by\nGod. Applied to the example of the burning of the cotton, this\nposition holds that \nthe agent of the burning is the fire alone, it being an agent by\nnature [and] not by choice—hence, incapable of refraining from\n[acting according to] what is in its nature after contacting a\nsubstratum receptive of it. (al-Ghazālī IP: 167) \nAgainst this position, al-Ghazālī maintains that \n[t]he one who enacts the burning by creating blackness in the cotton,\n[causing] separation in its parts, and making it cinder or ashes is\nGod, either through the mediation of His angels or without mediation.\n(al-Ghazālī IP: 167) \nIn support of this view, he argues as follows: \nAs for fire, which is inanimate, it has no action. For what proof is\nthere that it is the agent [of the burning of cotton]? They have no\nproof other than observing the occurrence of the burning at the\n[juncture of] contact with the fire. (al-Ghazālī IP:\n167) \nAl-Ghazālī appeals to a point also made by his\nAshʿarite predecessors: we observe not that fire burns cotton but\nrather that cotton burns when in contact with fire. So, the evidence\nof repeated observation, even when unvarying, does not show that fire\nis the agent of the change. Furthermore, this evidence is consistent\nwith God’s being the agent of the change. \nIn response to the skeptical argument, Averroes appeals to the fact of\nnatural science: We do have (some) knowledge of the natural world.\nFurthermore, knowledge of the natural world just is knowledge of the\nnatural causes of change (Averroes ITI: 318–19). Such knowledge\nmust be derived, at least in part, from repeated observation of\nbodies. He also suggests that none of us sincerely doubts that this is\nso: he claims that his occasionalist opponent “denies with his\ntongue what is present in his mind” (Averroes ITI: 318). So, as\nAverroes sees it, the fact of natural science is sufficient reason to\nreject the skeptical argument. Still, he acknowledges that we lack\ncomplete knowledge of nature, that much remains to be investigated and\nthat this endeavor faces various obstacles. \nWhile Averroes’ argument from natural science may succeed\nagainst some versions of the skeptical argument, it is not clear that\nit succeeds against its immediate target, al-Ghazālī’s\nskeptical argument. The latter argument may leave open the possibility\nthat natural bodies, such as fire, are causes (McGinnis 2006). For\nal-Ghazālī does not conclude his skeptical argument by\ndenying that fire is a cause of the burning tout court;\nrather, he denies that it has action on the ground that it is\ninanimate and he denies that the fire alone is the agent of burning.\nSo, al-Ghazālī may hold that the fire is a (non-active)\ncause of the burning, while God is its active cause. \nOn this interpretation, al-Ghazālī’s skeptical\nargument merely denies that the evidence of repeated observation shows\nthat natural bodies are the sole causes of change. So, that argument\nis compatible with the claim that the evidence of repeated observation\nindicates that natural bodies are among the causes of change.\nAverroes, however, suggests that al-Ghazālī denies the\nlatter claim. So, his argument from natural science does not succeed\nagainst al-Ghazālī’s skeptical argument. On the other\nhand, to allow that natural bodies are among the causes of change may\nnot be sufficient to avoid a problem raised by Averroes’\nargument from natural science. Averroes’ argument involves the\nidea that repeated observation of bodies gives us insight into their\nnatures. By “nature” is meant an intrinsic principle of\nmotion and coming to rest. So, the argument demands more than the\nconcession that natural bodies make some causal contribution to\nchange. It demands that the causality of natural bodies is rooted in\nand explained by their natures. \nAl-Ghazālī’s Ash’arite predecessors tend to deny\nthe existence of Aristotelian natures because these would impose\nrestrictions on God’s action. If a body has an Aristotelian\nnature, it has an internal principle, which restricts the sorts of\nchanges it can undergo from one moment to the next. For example, the\ndead cannot be raised and a staff cannot become a snake. According to\nIslamic theology, however, God can raise the dead and turn a staff\ninto a snake. Thus, bodies do not have Aristotelian natures, since the\nexistence of such natures would conflict with the doctrine of divine\nomnipotence. \nAl-Ghazālī appears to reject this more traditional\nAsh’arite view when he argues that the existence of bodily\nnatures is compatible with the occurrence of miracles. This argument\nmay reflect a concern to reconcile theology with natural science. It\nproposes that, even if we suppose that bodies have natures as\nconstrued by the philosophers, God could still cause miracles in two\nmain ways. On the one hand, he could impede the operation of natural\ncausal powers. For example, God could prevent the burning of Abraham\nin the fiery furnace by causing the fire’s heat to be contained\nwithin the fire or by causing Abraham to be covered in talc. On the\nother hand, God could cause a miracle by causing a series of natural\nchanges to occur with astonishing speed. For example, God could change\nthe staff in a serpent by causing matter to take on successive forms\nat an accelerated rate: \nThus, earth and the rest of the elements change into plants,\nplants-when eaten by animals-into blood, blood then changing into\nsperm. Sperm is then poured into the womb and develops in stages as an\nanimal; this, in accordance with habit, takes place in a lengthy\nperiod of time. Why, then, should the opponent deem it impossible that\nit lies within God’s power to cycle matter through these stages\nin a time shorter than has been known? (al-Ghazālī IP:\n172) \nSo, the affirmation of bodily natures is compatible with the belief\nmiracles. \nWhether this argument shows al-Ghazālī to hold that it is\npossible that bodies have natures is a matter or dispute (Marmura\n1981b; Frank 1992; Griffel 2009). Averroes takes the argument to\nconcede the philosophers’ view that bodies have natures by which\nthey function as causes of change (Averroes ITI: 330). Still, there\nremains a crucial difference between al-Ghazālī’s view\nand that of the philosophers. Even if al-Ghazālī allows that\nbodies may have natures, he also considers divine choice and action to\ngovern particular events in the sublunary world. God can plan and\nexecute particular events, which deviate from or accelerate the course\nof nature. The latter aspect of his view is incompatible with the\nphilosophers’ accounts of God, as discussed above in\n §3.3.","contact.mail":"kricha03@syr.edu","contact.domain":"syr.edu"}]
