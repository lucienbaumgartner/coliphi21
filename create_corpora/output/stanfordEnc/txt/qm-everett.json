Everett intended to recapture the\npredictions of the standard collapse theory by explaining why\nobservers nevertheless get determinate measurement records that\nsatisfy the standard quantum statistics. There has been considerable\ndisagreement over the precise content of his theory and how it was\nsuppose to work. Here we will consider how Everett himself presented\nthe theory, then briefly compare his presentation to the many-worlds\ninterpretation and other no-collapse options.\n\nEverett developed his relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics\nwhile a graduate student in physics at Princeton University. His\ndoctoral thesis (1957a) was accepted in March 1957 and a paper (1957b)\ncovering essentially the same material was published in July of the\nsame year. DeWitt and Graham (1973) later published Everett’s\nlonger, more detailed description of the theory (1956) in a collection\nof papers on the topic. The published version was revised from a\nlonger draft thesis that Everett had given John Wheeler, his Ph.D.\nadviser, in January 1956 under the title “Wave Mechanics Without\nProbability”. While Everett always favored the description of\nthe theory as presented in the longer thesis, Wheeler, in part because\nof Bohr’s disapproval of Everett’s critical approach,\ninsisted on the revisions that led to the much shorter thesis that\nEverett ultimately defended. \nEverett took a job outside academics as a defense analyst in the\nspring of 1956. While subsequent notes and letters indicate that he\ncontinued to be interested in the conceptual problems of quantum\nmechanics and, in particular, in the reception and interpretation of\nhis formulation of the theory, he did not take an active role in the\ndebates surrounding either. Consequently, the long version of his\nthesis (1956) is the most complete description of his theory. Everett\ndied in 1982. See (Byrne 2010) for further biographical details and\n(Barrett and Byrne 2012) for an annotated collection of Everett’s\npapers, notes, and letters regarding quantum mechanics. See also\n(Osnaghi, Freitas, Freire 2009) for an excellent introduction to the\nhistory of Everett’s formulation of quantum mechanics. \nEverett’s no-collapse formulation of quantum mechanics was a\ndirect reaction to the measurement problem that arises in the standard\nvon Neumann-Dirac collapse formulation of the theory. Everett\nunderstood this problem in the context of a version of the\nWigner’s Friend story. Everett’s solution to the problem\nwas to drop the collapse postulate from the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics then deduce the empirical predictions of the\nstandard collapse theory as the subjective experiences of observers\nwho were themselves modeled as physical systems in the theory. The\nresult was his relative-state interpretation of pure wave mechanics.\n \nThere have been many mutually incompatible presentations of\nEverett’s theory. Indeed, it is fair to say that most\nno-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics have at one time or\nanother either been directly attributed to Everett or suggested as\ncharitable reconstructions. The most popular of these, the many worlds\ninterpretation, is often simply attributed to Everett directly and\nwithout comment even when Everett himself never characterized his\ntheory in terms of many worlds.  \nIn order to understand Everett’s proposal for solving the\nquantum measurement problem, one must first clearly understand what he\ntook the quantum measurement problem to be. We will start with this,\nthen consider Everett’s presentation of his relative-state\nformulation of pure wave mechanics quantum mechanics and the sense in\nwhich he took it to solve the quantum measurement problem. We will\nthen contrast Everett’s views the many-worlds interpretation and\na number of other alternatives.  \nEverett presented his relative-state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics as a way of avoiding conceptual problems encountered by the\nstandard von Neumann-Dirac collapse formulation of quantum mechanics.\nThe main problem, according to Everett, was that the standard collapse\nformulation of quantum mechanics, like the Copenhagen interpretation,\nrequired observers always to be treated as external to the\nsystem described by the theory. One consequence of this was that\nneither the standard collapse theory nor the Copenhagen interpretation\ncan be used to describe the physical universe as a whole. He took the\nvon Neumann-Dirac collapse theory to be inconsistent and the\nCopenhagen interpretation to be essentially incomplete. We will follow\nthe main argument of Everett’s thesis and focus here on the\nmeasurement problem as encountered by the standard collapse theory.\n \nIn order to understand what Everett was worried about, one must first\nunderstand how the standard collapse formulation of quantum mechanics\nworks. The theory involves the following principles (von Neumann,\n1955):  \nEverett referred to the standard von Neumann-Dirac theory the\n“external observation formulation of quantum mechanics”\nand discussed it beginning (1956, 73) and (1957, 175) in the long and\nshort versions of his thesis respectively. While he took the standard\ncollapse theory to encounter a serious conceptual problem, he also\nused it as the starting point for his presentation of pure wave\nmechanics, which he described as the standard collapse theory but\nwithout the collapse dynamics (rule 4b). We will briefly describe the\nproblem with the standard theory, then turn to Everett’s\ndiscussion of the Wigner’s Friend story and his proposal for\nreplacing the standard theory with pure wave mechanics.  \nAccording to the eigenvalue-eigenstate link (rule 3) a system would\ntypically neither determinately have nor determinately not have a\nparticular given property. In order to determinately have a particular\nproperty the vector representing the state of a system must be in the\nray (or subspace) in state space representing the property, and in\norder to determinately not have the property the state of a system\nmust be in the subspace orthogonal to it, and most state vectors will\nbe neither parallel nor orthogonal to a given ray. \nThe deterministic dynamics (rule 4a) typically does nothing to\nguarantee that a system will either determinately have or\ndeterminately not have a particular property when one observes the\nsystem to see whether the system has that property. This is why the\ncollapse dynamics (rule 4b) is needed in the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics. It is the collapse dynamics that guarantees that a\nsystem will either determinately have or determinately not have a\nparticular property (by the lights of rule 3) whenever one observes\nthe system to see whether or not it has the property. But the linear\ndynamics (rule 4a) is also needed to account for quantum mechanical\ninterference effects. So the standard theory has two dynamical laws:\nthe deterministic, continuous, linear rule 4a describes how a system\nevolves when it is not being measured, and the random, discontinuous,\nnonlinear rule 4b describes how a system evolves when it is\nmeasured. \nBut the standard formulation of quantum mechanics does not say what it\ntakes for an interaction to count as a measurement. Without specifying\nthis, the theory is at best incomplete since it does not indicate when\neach dynamical law obtains. Moreover, if one supposes that observers\nand their measuring devices are constructed from simpler systems that\neach obey the deterministic dynamics, as Everett did, then the\ncomposite systems, the observers and their measuring devices, must\nevolve in a continuous deterministic way, and nothing like the random,\ndiscontinuous evolution described by rule 4b can ever occur. That is,\nif observers and their measuring devices are understood as being\nconstructed of simpler systems each behaving as quantum mechanics\nrequires, each obeying rule 4a, then the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics is logically inconsistent since it says that the two\nsystems together must obey rule 4b. This is the quantum measurement\nproblem in the context of the standard collapse formulation of quantum\nmechanics. See the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory. \nThe problem with the theory, Everett argued, was that it was logically\ninconsistent and hence untenable. In particular, one could not provide\na consistent account of nested measurement in the theory. Everett\nillustrated the problem of the consistency of the standard collapse\ntheory in the context of an “amusing, but extremely\nhypothetical drama” (1956, 74–8), a story that was a\nfew years later famously retold by Eugene Wigner.  \nEverett’s version of the Wigner’s Friend story involved an\nobserver \\(A\\) who knows the state function of some system\n\\(S\\), and knows that it is not an eigenstate of the measurement\nhe is about to perform on it, and an observer \\(B\\) who is in\npossession of the state function of the composite system \\(A{+}S\\).\nObserver \\(A\\) believes that the outcome of his measurement on\n\\(S\\) will be randomly determined by the collapse rule 4b, hence\n\\(A\\) attributes to \\(A{+}S\\) a state describing \\(A\\) as\nhaving a determinate measurement result and \\(S\\) as having\ncollapsed to the corresponding state. Observer \\(B\\), however,\nattributes the state function of the room after \\(A\\)’s\nmeasurement according to the deterministic rule 4a, hence \\(B\\)\nattributes to \\(A{+}S\\) an entangled state where, according to rule\n3, neither \\(A\\) nor \\(S\\) even has a determinate\nquantum-mechanical state of its own. Everett argued that since\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) make incompatible state attributions to\n\\(A{+}S\\), the standard collapse theory yields a straightforward\ncontradiction.  \nIt would be extraordinarily difficult in practice for \\(B\\) to\nmake a Wigner’s Friend interference measurement that would\ndetermine the state of a composite system like \\(A{+}S\\), hence the\n“extremely hypothetical” nature of the drama. Everett was\ncareful, however, to explain why this was entirely irrelevant to the\nconceptual problem at hand. Indeed, he explicitly rejected that one\nmight simply “deny the possibility that \\(B\\) could ever be\nin possession of the state function of \\(A{+}S\\).” Rather, he\nargued, that “no matter what the state of \\(A{+}S\\) is, there\nis in principle a complete set of commuting operators for which it is\nan eigenstate, so that, at least, the determination of these\nquantities will not affect the state nor in any way disrupt the\noperation of \\(A\\),” nor, he added, are there\n“fundamental restrictions in the usual theory about the\nknowability of any state functions.” And he concluded\nthat “it is not particularly relevant whether or not \\(B\\)\nactually knows the precise state function of \\(A{+}S\\). If\nhe merely believes that the system is described by a state\nfunction, which he does not presume to know, then the difficulty still\nexists. He must then believe that this state function changed\ndeterministically, and hence that there was nothing probabilistic in\n\\(A\\)’s determination” (1956, 76). And, Everett\nargued, \\(B\\) is right in so believing. \nThat Everett took the Wigner’s Friend story, which involves an\nexperiment that, on the basis of decoherence considerations, would be\nvirtually impossible to perform, to pose the central conceptual\nproblem for quantum mechanics is essential to understanding how he\nthought of the measurement problem and what it would take to solve it.\nIn particular, Everett held that one only has a satisfactory solution\nto the quantum measurement problem if one can provide a consistent\naccount of nested measurement. And concretely, this meant that one\nmust be able to tell the Wigner’s Friend story consistently.\n \nBeing able to consistently tell the Wigner’s Friend story then\nwas, for Everett, a necessary condition for any satisfactory\nresolution of the quantum measurement problem. \nIn order to solve the measurement problem Everett proposed dropping\nthe collapse dynamics (rule 4b) from the standard collapse theory and\ntaking the resulting physical theory to provide a complete and\naccurate description of all physical systems in the context of all\npossible physical interactions. Everett called the theory pure wave\nmechanics. He believed that he could deduce the standard statistical\npredictions of quantum mechanics (the predictions that depend on rule\n4b in the standard collapse formulation of quantum mechanics) in terms\nof the subjective experiences of observers who are themselves treated\nas ordinary physical systems within pure wave mechanics.  \nEverett described the proposed deduction in the long thesis as\nfollows: \nEverett’s goal, then, was to show that the memory records of an\nobserver as described by quantum mechanics without the collapse\ndynamics would agree with those predicted by the standard formulation\nwith the collapse dynamics. More specifically, he wanted to show that\nobservers, modeled as servomechanisms within pure wave mechanics,\nwould have fully determinate relative measurement records and the\nprobabilistic assertions of the standard theory will correspond to\nstatistical properties of typical sequences of such relative\nrecords. \nIn his version of the Wigner’s Friend story, Everett insisted on\nthree things simultaneously: (1) there are no collapses of the\nquantum-mechanical state, hence \\(B\\) is correct in attributing\nto \\(A{+}S\\) a state where \\(A\\) is in an entangled\nsuperposition of having recorded mutually incompatible results, (2)\nthere is a sense in which \\(A\\) nevertheless got a fully\ndeterminate measurement result, and (3) such determinate results\nsatisfy the standard quantum statistics.  \nThe main problem in understanding what Everett had in mind is in\nfiguring out precisely how the correspondence between the predictions\nof the standard collapse theory and the pure wave mechanics was\nsupposed to work. Part of the problem is that the former theory is\nstochastic with fundamentally chance events and the latter\ndeterministic with no mention of probabilities whatsoever, but there\nis also a problem even accounting for determinate measurement records\nin pure wave mechanics. In order to see why, we will consider how\nEverett’s no-collapse proposal plays out in a simple interaction\nlike \\(A\\)’s measurement in the Wigner’s Friend\nstory.  \nConsider measuring the \\(x\\)-spin of a spin-½ system. Such a\nsystem will be found to be either “\\(x\\)-spin up” or\n“\\(x\\)-spin down”. Suppose that \\(J\\) is a good\nobserver. For Everett, being a good \\(x\\)-spin observer meant\nthat \\(J\\) has the following two dispositions (the arrows below\nrepresent the time-evolution of the composite system as described by\nthe deterministic dynamics of rule 4a):  \nIf \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately \\(x\\)-spin\nup, then \\(J\\) will determinately record “\\(x\\)-spin\nup”; and if \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately\n\\(x\\)-spin down, then \\(J\\) will determinately record\n“\\(x\\)-spin down” (and we assume, for simplicity,\nthat the spin of the object system \\(S\\) is undisturbed by the\ninteraction).  \nNow consider what happens when \\(J\\) observes the \\(x\\)-spin\nof a system that begins in a superposition of \\(x\\)-spin\neigenstates:  \nThe initial state of the composite system then is:  \nHere \\(J\\) is determinately ready to make an \\(x\\)-spin\nmeasurement, but the object system\\( S\\), according to rule 3,\nhas no determinate \\(x\\)-spin. Given \\(J\\)’s two\ndispositions and the fact that the deterministic dynamics is linear,\nthe state of the composite system after \\(J\\)’s\n\\(x\\)-spin measurement will be:  \nOn the standard collapse formulation of quantum mechanics, somehow\nduring the measurement interaction the state would collapse to either\nthe first term of this expression (with probability equal to\n\\(a\\) squared) or to the second term of this expression (with\nprobability equal to \\(b\\) squared). In the former case,\n\\(J\\) ends up with the determinate measurement record “spin\nup”, and in the later case \\(J\\) ends up with the\ndeterminate measurement record “spin down”. But on\nEverett’s proposal no collapse occurs. Rather, the\npost-measurement state is simply this entangled superposition of\n\\(J\\) recording the result “spin up” and \\(S\\)\nbeing \\(x\\)-spin up and \\(J\\) recording “spin\ndown” and \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin down. Call this state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\).  \nOn the standard eigenvalue-eigenstate link (rule 3) \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\)\nis not a state where \\(J\\) determinately records “spin\nup”, neither is it a state where \\(J\\) determinately\nrecords “spin down”. So Everett’s interpretational\nproblem is to explain the sense in which \\(J\\)’s entangled\nsuperposition of mutually incompatible records represents a\ndeterminate measurement outcome that agrees with the empirical\nprediction made by the standard collapse formulation of quantum\nmechanics when the standard theory predicts that \\(J\\) either\nends up with the fully determinate measurement record “spin\nup” or the fully determinate record “spin down”,\nwith probabilities equal to \\(a\\)-squared and \\(b\\)-squared\nrespectively. More specifically, here the standard collapse theory\npredicts that on measurement the quantum-mechanical state of the\ncomposite system will collapse to precisely one of the following two\nstates:  \nand that there is thus a single, simple matter of fact about which\nmeasurement result \\(J\\) recorded.  \nEverett, then, faced two closely related problems. The\ndeterminate-record problem requires him to explain how a measurement\ninteraction like that just described might yield a determinate record\nin the context of pure wave mechanics. And the probability problem\nrequires him to somehow recover the standard quantum statistics for\nsuch determinate records.  \nEverett took the key to the solution of both problems to be the\nprinciple of the fundamental relativity of states:  \nOne might understand Everett as adding the fundamental principle of\nrelativity of states to pure wave mechanics to allow for a richer\ninterpretation of states than that provided by just the\neigenvalue-eigenstate link (rule 3). The resulting theory is the\nrelative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics. Central to this\ntheory is the distinction between absolute and relative states. This\ndistinction played an essential explanatory role for Everett. \nWhile the absolute state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is one where\n\\(J\\) has no determinate measurement record and \\(S\\) has no\ndeterminate \\(x\\)-spin, each of these systems also has relative\nstates by dint of the correlation between \\(J\\) recording\nvariable and \\(S\\)’s \\(x\\)-spin. In particular, in\nstate \\(\\boldsymbol{E}, J\\) recorded\n“\\(x\\)-spin up” relative to \\(S\\) being\nin the \\(x\\)-spin up state and that \\(J\\) recorded\n“\\(x\\)-spin down” relative to \\(S\\)\nbeing in the \\(x\\)-spin down state. \nSo while \\(J\\) has no absolute determinate record in state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\), in each of these relative states,\n\\(J\\) has a determinate relative record. It is these relative\nrecords that Everett’s takes to solve the determinate record\nproblem:  \nAbsolute states, then, provide absolute properties for complete\ncomposite systems by way of the standard eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\nand relative states provide relative properties for subsystems of a\ncomposite system. And on Everett’s account of the empirical\nfaithfulness of pure wave mechanics, he identifies an observer’s\ndeterminate measurement records with the modeled observer’s\nrelative memory states.  \nIn particular, it is that each relative memory state describes a\nrelative observer with a determinate measurement result that explains\ndeterminate measurement records on Everett’s view. Why this was\nenough to fully explain our experience of determinate measurement\nrecords ultimately rests on his understanding what it means for a\nphysical theory to be empirically faithful.  \nWhile the physicist Bryce DeWitt would later argue for his own\nparticular reconstruction of Everett’s theory (see below), when\nDeWitt first read Everett’s description of pure wave mechanics,\nhe objected because its surplus structure made the theory too rich to\nrepresent the world we experience. In his 7 May 1957 letter to\nEverett’s adviser John Wheeler, DeWitt wrote  \nThe thought was that the richness of pure wave mechanics indicated an\nempirical flaw in the theory because we do not notice other branches.\nAs DeWitt put it:  \nWheeler showed Everett the letter and told him to reply. In his 31 May\n1957 letter to DeWitt, Everett began by summarizing his understanding\nof the proper cognitive status of physical theories.  \nIn the final long version of his thesis, Everett further explained in\na footnote that “[t]he word homomorphism would be\ntechnically more correct, since there may not be a one-one\ncorrespondence between the model and the external world” (1956,\n169). The map is a homomorphism because (1) there may be elements of\nthe theory that do not directly correspond to experience and because\n(2) a particular theory may not seek to explain all of experience. It\nis case (1) that is particularly important here: Everett considered\nthe surplus experiential structure represented in the various branches\nof the absolute state to be explanatorily harmless. \nIn his letter to DeWitt, Everett described how he understood the aim\nof physical inquiry: “There can be no question of which theory\nis ‘true’ or ‘real’ — the best that one\ncan do is reject those theories which are not isomorphic to\nsense experience” (Barrett and Byrne 2012, 253). The task\nthen was to find our experience in an appropriate way in the\nrelative-state model of pure wave mechanics. \nSo, for Everett, a theory was empirically faithful and hence\nempirically acceptable if there was a homomorphism between its model\nand the world as experienced. What this amounted to here was that pure\nwave mechanics is empirically faithful if one can find\nobservers’ experiences appropriately associated with modeled\nobservers in the model of the theory. In short, Everett took pure wave\nmechanics to be empirically faithful because one could find quantum\nmechanical experience in the model as relative memory records\nassociated with relative modeled observers. \nWhile he left significant room in precisely how one might interpret\nthe theory, the core of Everett’s interpretation involved four\nclosely related arguments.  \nTogether the following four arguments indicate the sense in which\nEverett took pure wave mechanics to be empirically faithful and,\nhence, to recapture the empirical predictions of the standard collapse\ntheory.  \nAs suggested earlier, Everett held that one can find our actual\nexperience in the model of pure wave mechanics as relative measurement\nrecords associated with modeled observers. In the state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\), for example, since \\(J\\) has a different\nrelative measurement record in each term of the superposition written\nin the determinate record basis and since these relative records span\nthe space of quantum-mechanically possible outcomes of this\nmeasurement, regardless of what result the actual observer gets, we\nwill be able to find his experience represented as a relative record\nof the modeled observer in the interaction as described by pure wave\nmechanics.  \nMore generally, if one performs a sequence of measurements, it follows\nfrom the linearity of the dynamics and Everett’s model of an\nideal observer that every quantum-mechanically possible sequence of\ndeterminate measurement results will be represented in the entangled\npost-measurement state as relative sequence of determinate measurement\nrecords. This is also true in the theory if one only relatively,\nrather than absolutely, makes the sequence of observations. In this\nprecise sense, then, it is possible to find our experience as\nsequences of relative records  in the model of pure wave\nmechanics.  \nEverett took such relative records to be sufficient to explain the\nsubjective appearances of observers because in an ideal measurement,\nevery relative state will be one where the observer in fact has, and,\nas we will see in the next section, would report that she has, a fully\ndeterminate, repeatable measurement record that agrees with the\nrecords of other ideal observers. As Everett put it, the system states\nobserved by a relative observer are eigenstates of the observable\nbeing measured (1957, 188). For further details of Everett’s\ndiscussion of this point see (1956, 129–30), (1955, 67), (1956\n121–3 and 130–3), and (1957, 186–8 and 194–5).\n \nNote that Everett did not require a physically preferred basis to\nsolve the determinate record problem to show that pure wave mechanics\nwas empirically faithful. The principle of the fundamental relatively\nof states explicitly allows for arbitrarily specified decompositions\nof the absolute universal state into relative states. Given his\nunderstanding of empirical faithfulness, all Everett needed to explain\na particular actual record was to show that is that there is some\ndecomposition of the state that represents the modeled observer with\nthe corresponding relative record. And he clearly has that in pure\nwave mechanics under relatively weak assumptions regarding the nature\nof the actual absolute quantum mechanical state.  \nIt was important to Everett to explain why one would not ordinarily\nnotice the surplus structure of pure wave mechanics. In his reply to\nDeWitt, Everett claimed that pure wave mechanics “is in full\naccord with our experience (at least insofar as ordinary quantum\nmechanics is) ... just because it \\(is\\) possible to show that no\nobserver would ever be aware of any ‘branching,’ which is\nalien to our experience as you point out” Barrett and Byrne\n(eds) (2012, 254). \nThere are two distinct arguments that Everett seems to have had in\nmind.  \nFirst, one would only notice macroscopic splitting if one had access\nto records of macroscopic splitting events, but records of such events\nwill be rare precisely insofar as measurements that would show that\nthere are branches where macroscopic measurement apparata have\ndifferent macroscopic measurement records for the same measurement\nwould require one to perform something akin to a Wigner’s Friend\nmeasurement on a macroscopic system, which, as Everett indicated in\nhis characterization of his version of the Wigner Friend story as\n“extremely hypothetical,” would be extraordinarily\ndifficult to do. The upshot is that, while not impossible, one should\nnot typically expect to find reliable relative measurement records\nindicating that there are branches corresponding to alternative\nmacroscopic measurement records.  \nSecond, Everett repeatedly noted in his various deductions of\nsubjective appearances that it follows directly from the dynamical\nlaws of pure wave mechanics that it would seem to an ideal\nagent that he had fully determinate measurement results. Albert and\nLoewer presented a dispositional version of this line of argument in\ntheir presentation of the bare theory (a version of pure wave\nmechanics) as a way of understanding Everett’s formulation of\nquantum mechanics (Albert and Loewer 1988, and Albert 1992; see also\nthe bare theory chapter of Barrett 1999).  \nThe idea is that if there are no collapse of the quantum mechanical\nstate an ideal modeled observer like \\(J\\) would have the\nsure-fire disposition falsely to report and hence to believe\nthat he had a perfectly ordinary, fully sharp and determinate\nmeasurement record. The trick is to ask the observer not what result\nhe got, but rather whether he got some specific determinate\nresult. If the post-measurement state was:  \nthen \\(J\\) would report “I got a determinate result, either\nspin up or spin down”. And he would make precisely the same\nreport if he ended up in the post-measurement state:  \nSo, by the linearity of the dynamics, \\(J\\) would\nfalsely report “I got a determinate result, either spin\nup or spin down” when in the state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\):  \nThus, insofar as his beliefs agree with his sure-fire dispositions to\nreport that he got a fully determinate result, it would seem to\n\\(J\\) that he got a perfectly determinate ordinary measurement\nresult even when he did not (that is, he did not determinately get\n“spin up” and did not determinately get “spin\ndown”).  \nSo, while which result \\(J\\) got in state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is a relative fact, that it would seem to \\(J\\)\nthat he got some determinate result is an absolute fact. (See the discussion below and Albert (1992) and Barrett (1999) for further details regarding such\ndispositional properties. See Everett (1956, 129–30), (1955, 67), (1956, 121–3 and 130–3), and (1957, 186–8 and 194–5)\nfor parallel discussions in pure wave mechanics.)  \nWhile sometimes extremely difficult to detect, Everett insisted that\nalternative relative states, even alternative relative macroscopic\nmeasurement records, were always in principle detectable. Hence they\ndo not, as DeWitt worried, represent surplus structure at all. Indeed,\nsince all branches, in any basis, are in principle detectable, all\nbranches in any decomposition of the state of a composite system were\noperationally real on Everett’s view. As he put it in the long\nthesis:  \nWhile Everett understood decoherence considerations, he did not\nbelieve that they rendered the detection alternative measurement\nrecords impossible. Indeed, as indicated in his discussion of the\nWigner’s Friend story above, Everett held that it was always in\nprinciple possible to measure an observable that would detect an\nalternative post-measurement branch, and it was this that he\nused to argue the other direction. It is precisely because the linear\ndynamics requires that all branches of the global wave function are at\nleast in principle detectable that pure wave mechanics requires that\nall branches are equal real. \nAnd, again, note that this does not mean that only branches in one\nphysically preferred basis are real. Rather, it means that every\nbranch in every decomposition of a composite system is real in\nEverett’s operational sense of ‘real’ since any such\nstate might in principle entail observational consequences. That\nEverett considered alternative branches of the universal wave function\nto be in principle empirically detectable and hence operationally real\nrepresents a significant difference between his position and most\nsubsequent many-worlds interpretations, where alternative worlds are\ntypically assumed to be undetectable. \nBecause alternative branches are required by the linear dynamics and\nin principle detectable, they do not represent surplus structure on\nEverett’s view. In this sense, pure wave mechanics provides the\nsimplest possible theory compatible with the operational consequences\nof the linear dynamics.  \nOne upshot is that pure wave mechanics allows one to have a specific\nsort of inductive empirical evidence in favor of the theory. In\nparticular, since real for Everett means has observable\nconsequences, any experiment that illustrates quantum\ninterference provides empirical evidence for the operational existence\nof alternative Everett branches on some decomposition of the state.\nAgain, Everett was an operational realist concerning all branches in\nevery basis insofar as they might be detected. Specifically, one\nprovides increasingly compelling evidence in favor of pure wave\nmechanics correctly describing macroscopic measurement interactions\nthe closer one gets to being able to perform something like a\nWigner’s Friend interference experiment.  \nEverett did not solve the probability problem by finding probabilities\nin pure wave mechanics. Indeed, as suggested by his original thesis\ntitle, he repeatedly insisted that there were no probabilities and\ntook this to be an essential feature of the theory. Rather, what it\nmeant for pure wave mechanics to be empirically faithful with respect\nto the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics is that one can\nfind the standard quantum statistics we experience in the distribution\nof a typical relative relative sequence of a modeled observer’s\nmeasurement records. In explaining this, Everett appealed to a measure\nof typicality given by the norm squared of the amplitude associated\nwith each relative state in an orthogonal decomposition of the\nabsolute state. See Barrett (2017) for a detailed discussion of the\nnotion of typicality in Everett.  \nThe thought then is that if an observer supposes that his relative\nmeasurement records will be faithfully represented by a\ntypical relative sequence of measurements records, in\nEverett’s norm-squared measure of typicality, he will expect to\nobserve the standard statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.\n \nEverett got to the result in two steps. First, he found a well-behaved\nmeasure of typicality over relative states whose value is fully\ndetermined by the model of pure wave mechanics. Then he showed that,\nin the limit as the number of measurement interactions gets large,\nalmost all relative sequences of measurement records, in the sense of\nalmost all given by the specified measure, will exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics. Note that it is typically false that most\nrelative sequences by count will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics, and Everett knew this. This is why his explicit choice of\nhow to understand typicality is essential to his account of the\nstandard quantum statistics. (See Everett 1956, 120–30) and\n1957, 186–94) for discussions of typicality and the quantum\nstatistics.  \nnote that if one assumes that one’s relative records are\ntypical, in the precise sense that Everett specified, then they should\nbe expected to exhibit the standard quantum statistics. Were such an\nassumption added to the theory, then one should expect to see the\nstandard quantum statistics as determinate relative records. But note\nalso that one cannot derive the standard quantum probabilities, or\nanything else about probabilities, without an auxiliary assumption\nthat somehow ties Everett’s notion of typicality to one’s\nprobabilistic expectations. Such an assumption would represent a\nsignificant addition to pure wave mechanics.  \nFor his part, Everett did not try to deduce probabilities\nfrom pure wave mechanics. Rather, he simply argued that the sequence\nof results in a typical branch, in his specified sense of typical,\nshould be expected to satisfy the standard quantum statistics. It was\nthis this that Everett took to establish that his\nrelative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics was empirically\nfaithful over the standard quantum statistics.  \nPure wave mechanics, then, is empirically faithful since (1) one can\nfind an observer’s determinate measurement records as the\nrelative records of an idealized modeled observer in the theory and\n(2) the model of pure wave mechanics provides a typicality measure\nover relative states corresponding such that a typical relative\nsequence of measurement records in that measure will exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics. The first result is Everett’s\nresolution of the determinate record problem, and the second his\nresolution of the probability problem.  \nThe upshot is that if one associates one’s experience with\nrelative records and if one expects one’s relative sequence of\nrecords to be typical in the norm-squared-amplitude sense, then one\nshould expect one’s experience to agree with the standard\nstatistical predictions of quantum mechanics, wherever it makes\ncoherent predictions. And where the standard collapse theory and the\nCopenhagen interpretation do not make coherent predictions, as in the\nWigner’s Friend story, one should expect to see evidence that\nthe linear dynamics always correctly describes the evolution of every\nphysical system whatsoever. So while pure wave mechanics explains why\none would not typically observe other branches, it also predicts that\nother branches are in principle observable, and hence do not represent\nsurplus structure.  \nOne might, of course, want more than empirical faithfulness from a\nsatisfactory formulation of quantum mechanics. In keeping with his\nview that pure wave mechanics is quantum mechanics without\nprobabilities, Everett simply conceded that every relative state under\nevery decomposition of the absolute state in fact obtains. The\nresulting problem, one might feel, is that empirical faithfulness, in\nEverett’s sense at least, is a relatively weak form of empirical\nadequacy. This can be seen by considering how one should understand\nthe very notion of having a differential expectations when every\nphysically possible measurement result is in fact fully realized in\nthe model of the theory.  \nFor Everett to call his norm-squared-amplitude measure a measure of\ntypicality might suggest that a sample relative state is\nsomehow selected with respect to the measure. If that were the case,\nthen it would be natural to expect, by stipulation as suggested\nearlier, one’s relative sequence of measurement records to be\ntypical. But then it would also be natural to suppose that it would be\nprobable that a relative sequence of measurements records\nexhibit the standard quantum statistics, and, for Everett, there were\nno probabilities in the theory. And indeed, there are no probabilities\nwhatsoever in the statement of the theory, and hence no way to derive\nthem without adding something to the theory.  \nBut the problem here is more fundamental that that might suggest.\nInsofar as a probability is a measure over possibilities where\nprecisely one is in fact realized and insofar as all possibilities are\nrealized in pure wave mechanics, there simply can be no probabilities\nassociated with alternative relative sequences of measurement records.\nSimilarly, any understanding of typicality that somehow involves the\nselection of a typical relative sequence of records rather than an\natypical sequence of records is incompatible with pure wave mechanics\nsince the theory describes no such selection. Neither can the\ntypicality measure represent an expectation of the standard quantum\nstatistics obtaining for one’s actual relative sequence of\nmeasurement records at the exclusion of the rest since all such\nsequences are equally actual in Everett’s operationalist sense\nof actual. Insofar as the theory describes any possible result as\noccurring, it describes every possible result as occurring, so there\nis no particular sequence of measurement records that is realized\nsatisfying, or failing to satisfy, one’s prior expectations.\n \nThat Everett’s notion of empirical faithfulness is a relatively\nweak version of empirical adequacy, then, is exhibited in what pure\nwave mechanics, being empirically faithful, does not explain. In\nparticular, it does not explain what it is about the physical world\nthat makes it appropriate to expect one’s relative sequence of\nrecords to be typical in the norm-squared-amplitude sense, or any\nother sense. In short, while one can get subjective expectations for\nfuture experience by stipulation, the theory itself does not describe\na physical world where such expectations might be understood as\nexpectations concerning what will in fact occur. One might take\nEverett’s typicality measure to determine the subjective degree\nto which I should expect a particular relative sequence of records\nbeing (relative) mine, but to get even this would require\ncareful explanatory amendments to Everett’s presentation of the\ntheory. One can get a concrete sense of what such a strategy would\ninvolve by contrasting pure wave mechanics with something like Bohmian\nmechanics the many-thread or many-maps formulations of quantum\nmechanics where one has a clear notion of subjective quantum\nprobabilities (see below and Barrett 1999 and 2005 for discussions of\nthis approach). \nWhile he was initially skeptical of Everett’s views, DeWitt\nbecame an ardent proponent of the many-worlds interpretation, a theory\nthat DeWitt presented as the EWG interpretation of quantum mechanics\nafter Everett, Wheeler, and DeWitt’s graduate student R. Neill\nGraham. In his description of the many-worlds interpretation DeWitt\n(1970) emphasized that its central feature was the metaphysical\ncommitment to physically splitting worlds. DeWitt’s description\nsubsequently became the most popular understanding of Everett’s\ntheory. See Barrett (2011b) for further discussion of Everett’s\nattitude toward DeWitt and the many-worlds interpretation. See Lewis\n(2016) and Saunders, Barrett, Kent, and Wallace (eds) (2010) for\ndiscussions of recent formulations of the many-worlds interpretation.\n \nDeWitt described the theory in the context of the Schrödinger’s\ncat thought experiment.  \nDeWitt took this view to follow from “the mathematical formalism\nof quantum mechanics as it stands without adding anything to\nit.” More specifically, he claimed that EWG had proven a\nmetatheorem that the mathematical formalism of pure wave mechanics\ninterprets itself:  \nHe gave Everett credit for the metatheorem, Wheeler credit for\nencouraging Everett, and Graham credit for clarifying the metatheorem.\nDeWitt and Graham later described Everett’s formulation of\nquantum mechanics as follows:  \nFor his part, DeWitt conceded that this constant splitting of worlds\nwhenever the states of systems become correlated was counterintuitive:\n \nThat said, he strongly promoted the theory at every turn, and\nEverett’s views quickly came to be identified with DeWitt and\nGraham’s many-worlds interpretation. \nWhile Everett’s presentation of his theory was unclear at\nseveral points, DeWitt’s exegesis did little to help clarify\npure wave mechanics. Since a number of these confusions persist in\ndiscussions of Everett, we will briefly consider DeWitt and\nGraham’s interpretation and compare it against Everett’s\ndescription of the relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics.\n \nTo begin, since purely mathematical postulates entail only purely\nmathematical theorems, one cannot deduce any metaphysical commitments\nwhatsoever regarding the physical world from the mathematical\nformalism of pure wave mechanics alone. The formalism of pure wave\nmechanics might entail the sort of metaphysical commitments that\nDeWitt and others have envisioned only if supplemented with\nsufficiently strong metaphysical assumptions, strong enough to\ndetermine a metaphysical interpretation for the theory. Concerning the\nclaim that pure wave mechanics interprets itself by way of a\nmetatheorem that Everett proved, on even a broad understanding of what\nmight count as such a metatheorem, there is nothing answering to\nDeWitt’s description in either the long or short versions of\nEverett’s thesis.  \nSecond, contrary to what DeWitt, Graham, and others have supposed,\nEverett was not committed to causally isolated worlds. In contrast, as\nwe have seen, Everett held that it is always in principle possible for\nbranches to interact. More specifically, he argued that “no\nmatter what the state of [Wigner’s Friend] is, there is in\nprinciple a complete set of commuting operators for which it is an\neigenstate, so that, at least, the determination of these\nquantities will not affect the state nor in any way,” he denied\nthat there are fundamental restrictions about the “knowability\nof any state functions,” and he believed that the sense\nin which all branches of the global state are equally actual is given\nby the ever-present possibility of interaction between branches. So\nwhile one clearly can describe situations where there is no\npost-measurement interference between the branches representing\nincompatible measurement records, one can also describe interactions\nwhere there is, and for Everett there was no special physical\ndistinction to be made between the two cases.  \nThird, there was no consensus between Everett, Wheeler, DeWitt, and\nGraham concerning what Everett’s theory was. In particular, we\nknow what Everett thought of Graham’s formulation of the theory.\nIn his personal copy of DeWitt’s description of the many worlds\ninterpretation, Everett wrote the word “bullshit” next to\nthe passage where DeWitt presented Graham’s exegesis of\nEverett’s views (See Barrett and Byrne 2012, 364–6 for\nscans of Everett’s handwritten marginal notes).  \nFinally, as indicated in the discussion of empirical faithfulness\nabove, Everett’s understanding of pure wave mechanics was\ndecidedly non-metaphysical. In particular, He carefully avoided talk\nof multiple, splitting worlds, his understanding of the reality of\nbranches was purely operational, and he explicitly denied that the aim\nof physics was to produce true theories. That the proper aim, rather,\nwas to produce empirically faithful theories in the sense that he\ndescribed, was an essential part of Everett’s argument for why\nhis theory was not only acceptable but ought to be preferred to the\nother formulations of quantum mechanics that he knew (which explicitly\nincluded the standard collapse theory, the Copenhagen interpretation,\nand Bohmian mechanics; see Barrett and Byrne 2012,\n152–5). \nFor Everett, the relative states of its subsystems provided a way to\ncharacterize branches of the absolute state of a composite system.\nInsofar as the principle of the fundamental relativity of states\nallows one to consider the quantum-mechanical state in any specified\nbasis, there is no canonical way to individuate branches. This makes\nit natural perhaps to think of the existence of branches\noperationally, as Everett did. Rather than take the branches\ndetermined by a physically preferred basis or those determined by, or\nroughly determined by, some decoherence condition to determine which\nphysically possible worlds were real, he took every branch in any\nbasis to have observational consequences and hence to be real in\nhis operational sense. Given how he understood branches and their role\nin determining the empirical faithfulness of the theory, Everett never\nhad to say anything concerning how a particular physically preferred\nbasis is selected because none was required.  \nWhile Everett himself did not do so, one might nevertheless designate\na special set of branches of the global absolute state, say those that\nsatisfy exhibit an appropriate sort of stable diachronic identity, to\nrepresent worlds, or emergent worlds, or approximate emergent worlds.\nBut how one understands such physical entities cannot be determined\nsolely by the mathematical formalism of pure wave mechanics. \nThis has led recent many-worlds proponents like David Wallace (2010\nand 2012) to add explicit interpretative assumptions to the formalism\nof pure wave mechanics. In contrast with DeWitt, who seems to have\ntaken worlds to be basic entities described by the global absolute\nstate, Wallace takes the quantum state as basic, then seeks\nto characterize worlds as emergent entities represented in its\nstructure. The analogy he gives is that pure wave mechanics describes\nthe quantum state just as classical field theory describes physical\nfields (2010, 69). Worlds then are understood as physically real but\ncontingently emergent entities that are identified with approximate\nsubstructures of the quantum state, or as Wallace puts it,\n“mutually dynamically isolated structures instantiated within\nthe quantum state, which are structurally and dynamically\n‘quasiclassical’” (2010, 70). Just a bit more\ncarefully, one would expect such emergent worlds to be more or less\nisolated depending on the physical situation and properties one seeks\nto describe and the degree of decoherence in fact exhibited by the\nsystems as characterized. \nOn this account, there is no simple matter of fact concerning what or\neven how many emergent worlds there are because such questions depend\non one’s level of description and on how well-isolated one\nrequires the worlds to be for the explanatory considerations at hand.\nBut, however one individuates them, the emergent worlds correspond to\napproximately determinate decoherent substructures of the quantum\nstate. Hence, only some relative states describe physically real\nworlds. \nIn contrast, as we have seen, when Everett claimed that all branches\nwere equally real, he had something less metaphysical and more\nempirical in mind, which, in turn, suggests a quite different\nunderstanding of branches. In particular, since every branch in every\ndecomposition of the state has potential empirical consequences for\nthe results of one’s future observations, every branch, not just\nthose represented in a favored decohering basis, is operationally\nreal. In short, every relative state describes something that the\nlinear dynamics requires one to take as real in the only sense that\nEverett understood. \nThere is certainly a place for a decoherence account of\nquasiclassicality akin to the sort that Wallace and others favor as an\nextension of Everett’s project insofar as it yields a yet richer\nsense in which one might find our experience in the model of pure wave\nmechanics. But, given how he understood his theory and what was\nrequired for it to be empirically acceptable, Everett’s\nexplanatory goals were arguably more modest than those of many\nEverettians and hence more readily attained. \nConsider probability again. If one were to take pure wave mechanics to\nbe directly descriptive of the real physical world, one might feel\nthat one should explain what it is about the world that makes it\nappropriate to expect one’s relative sequence of records to be\ntypical in the norm-squared-amplitude sense when every physically\npossible outcome is in fact realized as a relative state. For his\npart, however, Everett believed that all that was required to explain\nthe standard quantum statistics was that one be able to find them\nsomehow associated in a precise and unambiguous way with the relative\nrecords of an ideal modeled observer. And he arguably did just this.\nThat such an account does not, without additional assumptions, explain\nwhy one should expect one’s measurement records to exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics in a world directly described by pure wave\nmechanics is a weakness of the account, but, arguably, one that need\nnot have worried Everett given the relatively modest explanatory aim\nof empirical faithfulness. (See the entry on the \n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics \n for further details regarding the approach.) \nWhat Albert and Loewer have called the bare theory of quantum\nmechanics (Albert and Loewer, 1988, and Albert, 1992) is pure wave\nmechanics with the standard interpretation of states. On this reading\nof Everett, one supposes that he intended to drop the collapse\ndynamics from the standard theory and keep the standard\neigenvalue-eigenstate link as the theory’s only interpretational\nprinciple. Here there is no special distinction between absolute and\nrelative states nor does one require the addition of a special notion\nof typicality to the theory. Rather, one uses Everett’s model of\nan idealized observer to argue that it would appear to such\nobservers that they had the perfectly determinate measurement outcomes\npredicted by the collapse dynamics when they in fact did not. This\ncaptures Everett’s thought of deducing the standard predictions\nof quantum mechanics as the subjective appearances of observers who\nare themselves treated within the theory. \nWe have already seen the basic argument here. Since \\(J\\) would report that he had a determinate result in post-measurement state \nand would report that he had a determinate result in post-measurement state \n\\(J\\) would, by the linearity of the dynamics, have the surefire disposition to falsely report that he had when in post measurement state \nMore concretely, in the superposed state he would be in a\nsuperposition of reporting “I got a determinate result, either spin up\nor spin down” (relative to the first branch) and reporting “I got a\ndeterminate result, either spin up or spin down” (relative to the\nsecond branch), which sounds precisely like the absolute\nreport “I got a determinate result, either spin up or spin\ndown.” \nThus, if one assumes that the observer’s reports are in fact\ntrue of his experience, it would appear to \\(J\\) (as a\nsimple, absolute fact) that he got a perfectly determinate ordinary\nmeasurement result even when he did not (that is, he did not\ndeterminately get “spin up” and did not determinately get “spin\ndown”). \nOne can similarly argue from the linear dynamics and the properties of\nan ideal observer that if \\(J\\) repeats his spin measurement, he\nwill end up with the sure-fire disposition to report that he got the\nsame result for the second measurement as for the first (even when he\ndid not in fact get an ordinary determinate result for either). Hence,\nit will appear to him that there has been a collapse of the\nquantum-mechanical state when there has been no collapse, splitting of\nworlds, or anything else that would produce an ordinary determinate\nmeasurement record. The subjective appearance of a collapse here is an\nillusion produced by the linear dynamics together with the\nobserver’s dispositions. \nThe linear dynamics also entails a sort of inter-subjective agreement\nbetween different observers. If a second observer were to\ncheck \\(J\\)’s measurement result, the second observer would\nend up believing that her result agreed with his (even when neither\nobserver in fact has an ordinary determinate measurement record). In\nthis sense, there is subjective agreement on the apparent result of\nthe apparent collapse. \nFinally, one can show that an observer who repeats a measurement on an\ninfinite sequence of systems in the same initial state will approach a\nstate where he reports that his measurement results were randomly\ndistributed with the standard quantum relative frequencies (when in\nfact he got no ordinary determinate results for any of his\nmeasurements). This is the feature of quantum mechanics without the\ncollapse postulate that Everett himself found the most\ncompelling. (See Albert (1992) and Barrett (1999) for further\ndiscussion of the suggestive properties of the bare theory. See\nEverett (1956, 129–30), (1955, 67), (1956, 121–3 and\n130–3), and (1957, 186–8 and 194–5) for his\ndiscussions of these properties.) \nWhile one can tell such stories about the sort of\nillusions that an observer would experience (each corresponding to\nspecific argument that Everett himself gave in both his long and short\ntheses), there are at least two serious problems with the bare theory. One is\nthat the bare theory is not empirically coherent: if the theory were\ntrue, it would be impossible to ever have reliable empirical evidence\nfor accepting it as true given the radical sort of illusions it\npredicts (See Barrett (1996) for a discussion of the idea of\nempirical coherence). Another is that if the bare\ntheory were true, one would most likely fail to have any determinate\nbeliefs at all since, on the linear dynamics, one would expect the\nglobal state to almost never be an eigenstate of any particular\nobserver being sentient (or even existing). (For a further discussion\nof how experience is supposed to work in the bare theory and some the\nproblems it encounters see Albert 1992; Bub, Clifton, and Monton,\n1998; and Barrett, 1994, 1996 and 1999.) \nEverett held that on his formulation of quantum mechanics “the\nformal theory is objectively continuous and causal, while subjectively\ndiscontinuous and probabilistic” (1973, p. 9). Albert and Loewer\n(1988) capture this feature directly in their many-minds theory by\ndistinguishing between an observer’s physical state,\nwhich evolves in a continuous, deterministic way, and the\nobserver’s mental state, which evolves in a\ndiscontinuous, stochastic way. \nA curious feature of this theory is that in order to get the\nobserver’s mental state in some way to supervene on his physical\nstate, Albert and Loewer associate with each observer a continuous\ninfinity of minds. The observer’s physical state, like all other\nphysical systems, always evolves in the usual deterministic way, but\neach mind jumps randomly to a mental state corresponding to one of the\nEverett branches that is produced in each measurement-like\ninteraction. The probability that a particular mind will experience an\nEverett branch associated with a quantum-mechanical amplitude\n\\(q\\) is equal to \\(q\\) squared. On the mental dynamics,\nthen, one should expect \\(a\\)-squared proportion of\n\\(J\\)’s minds to end up associated with the result “spin\nup” (the first term of the expression above) and \\(b\\)-squared\nproportion of \\(J\\)’s minds to end up associated with the\nresult “spin down” (the second term of the expression above). The\nmental dynamics is also memory-preserving so that once a mind is\nassociated with a particular branch, the mental state of the mind\nremains compatible with the measurement records represented in that\nbranch. \nAn advantage of many-minds theory over DeWitt’s original version\nof the many-worlds theory is that there is no need for a physically\npreferred basis here. One must choose a preferred basis in order to\nspecify the mental dynamics completely but this choice has nothing to\ndo with any physical facts; rather, it can simply be thought of as\npart of the description of the relationship between physical and\nmental states. Another advantage of the many-minds theory is that,\nunlike the standard variety of many-worlds theories where worlds and\nobservers split and are copied in measurement-like interactions, the\nmany-minds theory simply predicts the standard forward-looking quantum\nprobabilities for the future experiences of each particular mind.\nThis, of course, requires one to understand the minds as having\ntranstemporal identities, which Albert and Loewer clearly do as part\nof their unabashed commitment to a strong mind-body dualism. Finally,\nthe many-minds theory is one of the few formulations of quantum\nmechanics that are manifestly compatible with special relativity. (For\na discussion of why it is difficult to solve the quantum measurement\nproblem under the constraints of relativity see Barrett 2000 and 2002,\nfor discussions of locality in the many minds theory, see Hemmo and\nPitowski 2003, and Bacciagaluppi 2002, and for the relationship\nbetween relativity and the many worlds theory see Bacciagaluppi\n2002.) \nThe main problems with the many-minds theory concern its commitment to\na strong mind-body dualism and the question of whether the sort of\nmental supervenience one gets is worth the trouble of postulating a\ncontinuous infinity of minds associated with each observer. Concerning\nthe latter, one might well conclude that a single-mind theory, where\neach observer has precisely one mind that evolves randomly given the\nevolution of the standard quantum mechanical state and determines the\nobserver’s experiences and beliefs, would be preferable. (See\nAlbert, 1992 and Barrett, 1995 and 1999, for further discussions.) \nBoth the single-mind and many-minds theories can be thought of as\nhidden-variable theories like \n Bohmian mechanics.\n But instead of position being made determinate, as it is in\nBohm’s theory, and then assuming that the determinate positions\nof particles will provide observers with determinate measurement\nrecords, it is the mental states of the observers that are directly\nmade determinate here, and while this is a non-physical parameter, it\nis guaranteed to provide observers with determinate measurement\nrecords. \nOn the standard sort of many-worlds theory, worlds are taken to split\nover time as new branches are produced in measurement-like\ninteractions. One problem with this is that the forward-looking\nprobability of an observer getting each quantum-mechanically possible\noutcome for a measurement is simply one inasmuch as each possible\nmeasurement outcome is in fact recorded by some future copy\nof the observer one of the post-measurement branches. One way to get\nthe right forward-looking probabilities, the standard probabilistic\npredictions of quantum mechanics, is to postulate worlds that never\nbranch. Such worlds might be characterized by their complete\nhistories. If one is in such a world, then one simply experiences its\nhistory. \nThe idea here is closely related to many-history tradition of\ninterpreting Everett. Gell-Mann and Hartle (1990) characterized\nEverett’s theory as one that describes many, mutually decohering\nhistories. On this sort of theory, one might think of each physically\npossible trajectory through the Everett branches as a thread that\ndefines a world. \nOne can most clearly see how a many-threads theory provides\nforward-looking probabilities by considering how one might construct\nsuch a theory from Albert and Loewer’s many-minds theory. To\nthis end, consider each full trajectory that a particular mind of an\nobserver might take through the Everett branches. On the associated\nmany-threads theory, there is precisely one world for each such full\ntrajectory. What the mind would see is what in fact happens in this\nworld. In this way, each of an observer’s minds determines a\nnon-branching world. one then takes the quantum-mechanical amplitude\nassociated with the threads to determine a probability over the set of\nworlds. This is represents the prior epistemic probability of each\npossible non-branching world being in fact ours. These probabilities\nare then updated as one learns more about the actual history of our\nworld. Since such worlds and everything in them have perfectly\nordinary transtemporal identities there is be no special problem here\nin talking about forward-looking probabilities. The forward-looking\nprobability for a future event is just the epistemic probability that\nthe event in fact occurs in the world we in fact inhabit. \nThere is a close relationship between a no-collapse hidden-variable\ntheory like Bohmian mechanics and a non-branching many-worlds theory\nlike the many-threads theory. In Bohmian mechanics the wave function\nalways evolves in the usual deterministic way, but particles are taken\nto always have fully determinate positions. For an \\(N\\)-particle\nsystem, the particle configuration can be thought of as being pushed\naround in \\(3N\\)-dimensional configuration space by the flow of\nthe norm squared of the wave function just as a massless particle\nwould be pushed around by a compressible fluid (the compressible fluid\nhere is the probability distribution in configuration space given by\nthe standard wave function). Here both the evolution of the wave\nfunction and the evolution of the particle configuration are fully\ndeterministic. Quantum probabilities are the result of the\ndistribution postulate. The distribution postulate sets the initial\nprior probability distribution equal to the norm squared of the wave\nfunction for an initial time. One learns what the new effective wave\nfunction is from one’s measurement results, but one never knows\nmore than what is allowed by the standard quantum statistics. Indeed,\nBohm’s theory always predicts the standard quantum probabilities\nfor particle configurations, but it predicts these as epistemic\nprobabilities. Bohm’s theory is supposed to give determinate\nmeasurement results in terms of determinate particle configurations\n(say the position of the pointer on a measuring device). (See Barrett\n(1999) and the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics\n for more details.) \nIf one chooses position as the preferred physical observable and\nadopts the particle dynamics of Bohm’s theory, then one can\nconstruct a many-threads theory by fixing the initial wave function\nand the Hamiltonian and by considering every possible initial\nconfiguration of particles to correspond to a different full history\nfor a possible world. Here the prior probabilities are given by the\ndistribution postulate in Bohm’s theory, and these probabilities\nare Bayesian updated on the results of measurements. The updated\nepistemic probabilities yield the effective Bohmian wave function. So\nthe only difference between Bohm’s theory and the associated\nmany-threads theory is that the many-threads theory treats all\npossible Bohmian worlds as simultaneously existing worlds, only one of\nwhich is ours. A many-threads theory can be constructed for virtually\nany determinate physical quantity just as one would construct a\nhidden-variable or a modal theory. (See the entry on\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics.) \nThe comparison with Bohmian mechanics makes clear the sense in which\nthe single-mind theory, the many-minds theory, and the many-thread\ntheory are hidden-variable theories. In each case, it is the\ndeterminate value of a “hidden” variable (i.e. a variable\nnot determined by the standard quantum-mechanical state alone) that\ndetermines our measurement records, and it is the dynamics of this\nvariable together with the prior probabilities that yields the\nstandard quantum statistics. For his part, Everett explicitly\nconsidered such hidden-variable theories but held that his\nrelative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics did not need the\naddition of such a variable to explain the experience of the modeled\nobservers. This is a good reason to take such theories are failing to\ncapture Everett’s preferred formulation of quantum\nmechanics. \nAn approach that is close in spirit to Everett’s relative-state\ninterpretation of pure wave mechanics is to simply to deny that there\nare any salient absolute matters of fact about the properties of\nphysical systems or the records, experiences, and beliefs of observers\nand insist that all physical facts relevant to explaining our\nexperience are relative (see Saunders, 1995, 1997, and 1998, Conroy\n2012, and\n relational quantum mechanics\n for examples of how this might work). In the experiment above, a\nrelational formulation of quantum mechanics would not describe the\nobserver \\(J\\) as believing that his result was “spin up” and\nit would not describe him as believing that his result was “spin\ndown”. Rather, there would be no simple fact of the matter regarding\nwhat result \\(J\\) recorded. Here \\(J\\) recorded that his\nresult was “spin up” relative to \\(S\\) being x-spin up and\n\\(J\\) recorded that his result was “spin down” relative to\n\\(S\\) being x-spin down. Similarly, the state of \\(S\\) is\nx-spin up relative to \\(J\\) believing that his result was “spin\nup”, etc. On this reading of Everett, physical facts are essentially\nrelative, and there are, hence, typically no simple matters of fact\nabout the properties of any individual physical system. \nOne way to understand this is to think of Everett branches as an\nindexical akin to time. Just as one might have different incompatible\nphysical states obtain at different times, here one might have\ndifferent, incompatible physical states obtain at the same time\nbut at different branches. Rather than account for\ndeterminate measurement records at a time, one denies that there\ntypically is any simple matter of fact concerning what an\nobserver’s measurement record is at a time. Insofar as there is\na matter of fact concerning the value of a measurement record, it is a\nfact at a time and at a branch. On this proposal, one might propose a\ndifferent branch indexical for each complete basis one might specify.\nBut the complete set of relative facts at a time, the set of relative\nfacts that one gets by considering every possible branch indexical at\na time, does not require one to specify a preferred basis for the\ntheory. \nQuantum probabilities here would not be descriptive of which Everett\nbranch is actual, since they all are. Rather, quantum probabilities\nwould presumably be descriptive of the structure of the branch\nindexical perhaps somewhat as temporal duration is descriptive of\nthe time indexical. While it is unclear, at least on a\nstandard account of rational choice, why an agent should care to have\nsuch probabilities inform her decisions, it is not impossible that one\nmight formulate a compelling story, perhaps akin to how temporal facts\nmay affect an agent’s preferences. (See\n relational quantum mechanics\n for a further discussion of such approaches.) \nEverett took his version of the Wigner’s Friend story to reveal\nthe inconsistency of the standard collapse formulation of quantum\nmechanics and the incompleteness of the Copenhagen interpretation. The\nproblem was that neither could make sense of nested measurement. And\nsince pure wave mechanics allowed one to provide a consistent account\nof nested measurement, he took it to immediately resolve the\nmeasurement problem. The task then was to explain the sense in which\npure wave mechanics might be taken to be empirically faithful over\ndeterminate measurement records exhibiting the standard\nquantum-mechanical statistics. \nEverett’s relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics has\na number of salient virtues. It eliminates the collapse dynamics and\nhence immediately resolves the potential conflict between the two\ndynamical laws. It is consistent, applicable to all physical systems,\nand perhaps as simple as a formulation of quantum mechanics can be.\nAnd it is empirically faithful in that one can find an\nobserver’s quantum experience as relative records in the model\nof pure wave mechanics and one can find a measure over relative\nsequences of records such that most such sequences exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics.  \nInsofar as Everett’s standard of empirical faithfulness just\ninvolved finding measurement records associated with a modeled\nobserver in the theory that agree with one’s experience, it is a\nrelatively weak variety of empirical adequacy. The relative weakness\nof this condition is illustrated by the fact that the way that\none’s experience is found in the model of pure wave mechanics\ndoes not explain why one should expect to have that particular\nexperience in a world described by the theory. Judging a theory to be\nempirically adequate when it tells us that there is a sense in which\neverything physically possible in fact happens clearly puts pressure\non the very idea of empirical adequacy. But one might nevertheless\nargue that the empirical faithfulness of the relative-state\nformulation of pure wave mechanics represent a nontrivial empirical\nvirtue.  \nThere remain a number of alternative reconstructions of\nEverett’s relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics.\nInsofar as one takes pure wave mechanics to provide a clear starting\npoint for addressing the quantum measurement problem, one might find\nsuch alternatives naturally compelling.
