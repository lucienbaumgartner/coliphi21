Unfortunately, the\ndistinction is often drawn in different and mutually incompatible\nways. The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction has historically\nbeen drawn three main ways: the ‘principle-based\ndistinction’, the ‘reason-statement-based\ndistinction’ and the ‘perspective-based\ndistinction’. Each of these approaches has its own distinctive\nvices (Sections 1–3). However, a slightly modified version of\nthe historically influential principle-based approach seems to avoid\nmost if not all of these vices (Section 4). The distinction so\nunderstood differs from numerous other distinctions with which it\nmight easily be confused (Section 5). Finally, the distinction so\ndrawn is important to normative theorizing for a variety of reasons\n(Section 6).\n\nThe principle-based version of the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction actually predates the terminology\n‘agent-relative’ and ‘agent-neutral’. Thomas\nNagel instead uses the terms ‘subjective’ and\n‘objective’ to mark a version of the principle-based\ndistinction in his classic The Possibility of Altruism (Nagel\n1970). The terms ‘agent-relative’ and\n‘agent-neutral’ were later introduced by Derek Parfit\n(Parfit 1984) and Nagel himself then adopted Parfit’s\nterminology (Nagel 1986). As background to Nagel’s version of\nthe distinction, we must first note that for Nagel, reasons are\nuniversal, in the sense that for every token reason there corresponds\na predicate R which figures in a universally quantified\nproposition of the following form: \nWith this conception of the universality of reasons in hand, Nagel\narticulates the distinction as follows: \nDrawn in such formal terms, the distinction can seem alien and\ndifficult to grasp but the basic idea is actually not that complex. A\nfew examples should help illustrate Nagel’s idea. Suppose that\nthere is reason for me to phone a friend because doing so would make\nthe friend happy. Now suppose that my reason is best expressed as\nfollows—that phoning her would make someone happy. In that case,\nthe fact that the person who is made happy is my friend is\nincidental. If phoning a stranger would have generated just as much\nhappiness then I would have had just as much reason to call the\nstranger. This in turn suggests that the principle corresponding to\nthis reason is of the form, \nThe use of ‘promote’ in Nagel’s canonical\nformulation raises some interesting issues. Nagel holds that\nperforming an action A is a trivial way of promoting\nA, so I can promote the calling of my friend by calling her.\nIn one sense, Nagel builds teleology into his conception of a reason\nfor action. For Nagel glosses ‘promotion’ in such a way\nthat the fact that an action will produce the relevant sort of outcome\nis sufficient for there being a reason to perform that action (see\nNagel 1970: 52). So every reason entails that if someone can promote\nthe relevant outcome (which outcomes are relevant may depend on the\nagents involved if the reason is agent-relative) then it logically\nfollows from Nagel’s gloss of reasons in terms of promotion (in\nhis sense) that there is reason to perform that action. In another\nsense, though, Nagel does not build teleology into his conception of a\nreason for action. For Nagel does not hold that causally producing (or\neven instantiating) are necessary for there to be a reason\nfor the action. In his somewhat capacious sense of\n‘promote’, it is sufficient for an action to count as\npromoting an outcome if the action is such that not performing it\nwould bring about the non-occurrence of the relevant state of affairs\n(again, see Nagel 1970: 52). So actions which are necessary but not\nsufficient for a given outcome thereby count as promoting that\noutcome. So all reasons are not teleological in the sense of being\nreasons in virtue of their causally bringing about the relevant sort\nof outcome; simply preserving the possibility of that outcome is\nenough. However, all reasons are teleological in the sense that any\nreason for an agent A to X does entail that if a\nsuitable agent (who counts as suitable depends on whether the reason\nis agent-relative; if it is agent-neutral then any agent will do) can\npromote A’s X-ing then there is reason for\nthem to do so. Reasons are for Nagel teleological in the sense that\nthey all entail reasons for people to perform actions in the right\ncircumstances in virtue of what states of affairs they would causally\nbring about. This is not trivial. Some conceptions of reasons do not\nhave this consequence, as in the case of those conceptions which gloss\nreasons for action in a way that does not advert to promotion at\n all.[1] \nIn any event, for Nagel, the preceding principle (and hence the\ncorresponding reason) is agent-neutral because the antecedent contains\nno use of the free-agent variable ‘p’. The reason\nis in this sense not relativized to the agent for whom it is a reason.\nHowever, we could instead hold that the fact that it is my friend who\nwould be made happy is relevant to whether I have reason to call. In\nthat case, the principle corresponding to the reason would be of the\nform, \nThis principle is agent-relative because the free-agent variable\n‘p’ does appear in its antecedent. Basically, if\nthe sufficient condition for the application of the reason predicate\n(the condition given by the antecedent of the principle corresponding\nto the reason) includes such a free-agent variable then the reason is\nagent-relative; otherwise it is agent-neutral. It is easy enough to\nsee that on this conception, ethical egoism is an\nagent-relative theory (and hence concerns agent-relative reasons)\nwhile objective utilitarianism is an agent-neutral theory (and hence\nconcerns agent-neutral reasons). For egoism holds that there is reason\nfor a given agent to do something just in case his doing it would\npromote his welfare. Whereas objective\nutilitarianism, see the entry on\n consequentialism,\n (on at least one version) holds that someone ought to do something\njust insofar as it promotes welfare, period (no matter whose it is).\nIt is also important to be clear that the principles Nagel has in mind\nmust be understood as the basic normative principles of a theory\nrather than the theory’s account of what gives those principles\ntheir status as basic normative\n principles.[2]\n Otherwise various meta-ethical (see entry on\n metaethics)\n theories of what it is to be a reason (e.g., informed desire\naccounts) might be taken to imply agent-relativity when in fact they\nshould be understood as neutral on this issue. \nNagel’s version of the distinction is\n‘principle-based’ in the fairly straightforward sense that\none must first look to the principle corresponding to a given reason\nto determine whether it is agent-relative or agent-neutral. Nagel also\nmakes this clear in his later work. In The View From Nowhere\nhe holds that, \nThe context makes it relatively clear Nagel’s reference to the\n‘general form’ of a reason is a universally quantified\nprinciple corresponding to the reason of the sort he discussed in\nThe Possibility of Altruism. Derek Parfit, who is the first\none to introduce the terminology ‘agent-relative’ and\n‘agent-neutral’ makes it even more clear that the\ndistinction is in the first instance applied to normative theories.\nHaving described a moral theory he calls C, he remarks\nthat, \nParfit’s conception of moral principles as giving agents (common\nor separate) moral aims is itself controversial. Some moral theories\ninstead understand moral principles as (at least in some cases)\nproviding constraints on how to pursue one’s ends. Parfit later\nexplains how his terminology, when applied to reasons, maps onto\nNagel’s: \nThis is slightly confusing. First, how does Parfit’s distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral theories map onto his\ndistinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons? The\nformer is cast in terms of common aims while the second is cast in\nterms of whether a reason for one agent must also be a reason for\nanyone else. Second, how exactly does Parfit’s distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons correspond to\nNagel’s version of the distinction? The former is cast in terms\nof whether a reason for one agent must also be a reason for anyone\nelse while the latter is cast in terms of the occurrence of free agent\nvariables in the sufficient condition for the application of the\nreason predicate corresponding to the reason. These are not obviously\nequivalent, yet Parfit takes his distinction to be the same as\nNagel’s. \nThe first of these two questions is slightly easier to answer than the\nsecond. A moral theory is agent-neutral if it gives us common aims,\nbut if we have common aims then whenever there is a reason for you to\npromote an aim there will also be reason for me to promote that aim\n(if I can). So Parfit’s agent-neutral moral theories provide\nagent-neutral reasons in his sense—in the sense of being such\nthat a reason for one agent is guaranteed to be a reason for any agent\nsituated to promote the end which figures in that reason. By contrast,\na moral theory is agent-relative if it does not give every agent a\ncommon aim. However, if we do not have common aims then what is a\nreason for you may be no reason whatsoever for me even if I\nam in a position to promote the end which figures in that reason. So\nParfit’s agent-relative moral theories provide agent-relative\nreasons in his sense—reasons which are not such that a reason\nfor one agent entails a reason for any agent in a position to promote\nthe end which figures in that reason. So Parfit’s agent-relative\nmoral theories concern agent-relative reasons in his sense and his\nagent-neutral moral theories concern agent-neutral reasons in his\nsense. So the use of the same terminology is no coincidence, and\npresumably Parfit would agree that the agent-relativity of a reason is\nwell understood in terms of the agent-relativity of the principle\nassociated with that reason. Indeed, the primary reason we have\nincluded Parfit’s version of the distinction in this discussion\nof the principle-based version of the distinction is the suspicion\nthat his distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons\nis really just a corollary of his distinction between agent-relative\nand agent-neutral theories. The fact that Parfit clearly thinks that\nhis distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons is\njust the same as Nagel’s distinction also suggests that\nParfit’s distinction is well understood as principle-based,\nsince Nagel’s version of the distinction is a paradigmatic\ninstance of a principle-based version of the distinction. The other\n(closely related) reason for including Parfit’s version of the\ndistinction here is that it also shares the chief vice of\nNagel’s version. As explained below, neither Nagel’s nor\nParfit’s version of the distinction sits well with radical forms\nof moral particularism. \nWhat about our second question about Parfit’s distinctions,\nthough? Why should Parfit assume his version of the distinction\nbetween agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons is the same as\nNagel’s even though they are not drawn in the same way? Here it\nis relevant that (in at least one sense; see above) Nagel builds\nteleology into the logical form of the reason predicate, so that a\nreason is always understood as a reason to promote something.\nGiven this conception of reasons, it does seem that Parfit’s\nconception maps fairly neatly onto Nagel’s. For if a reason is\nagent-relative in Nagel’s sense, then whether there is a reason\nfor me to promote the state of affairs for which it is a reason will\ndepend on whether I am the agent who figures in the token reason under\nconsideration. An agent-relative reason to promote A’s\nhappiness will give me a reason only if I am A or suitably\nrelated to A (e.g., there can be agent-relative reasons to\npromote the welfare of my nearest and dearest). So reasons\nwhich are agent-relative in Nagel’s sense are agent-relative in\nParfit’s sense. By contrast, if a reason is agent-neutral in\nNagel’s sense then it gives any agent who can promote the state\nof affairs it favors a reason to promote that state of affairs. In\nNagel’s colorful phrase, agent-neutral reasons in his sense\ntransfer “across the gap between persons” (Nagel 1970:\n79). So reasons that are agent-neutral in Nagel’s sense are\nagent-neutral in Parfit’s sense as well. Moreover, so long as we\nassume that all reasons are teleological, any reason which is\nagent-relative in Parfit’s sense is agent-relative in\nNagel’s sense and any reason that is agent-neutral in\nParfit’s sense is agent-neutral in Nagel’s sense. For\nplausibly the only way a reason for one person to promote X\ncould fail to also provide someone else who could promote X a\nreason to do so would be if the reason was indexed to me in the way\nNagel’s agent-relative reasons are. So long as we hold onto the\nassumption that all reasons for action are teleological,\nParfit’s version of the distinction and Nagel’s version of\nthe distinction are at least extensionally equivalent in all possible\nworlds in spite of their rather different formulations of the\ndistinction. \nIn different ways, both Nagel and Parfit formulate the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in terms of general\nprinciples and the distinctions they draw do indeed seem useful and\nimportant (more on why they are useful and important below). For a\nmore explicit defense of drawing the distinction in terms of general\nprinciples (or ‘rules’ in their terminology), see also\nMcNaughton and Rawling\n 1991.[3]\n However, one unfortunate consequence of these classical\nprinciple-based ways of drawing the distinction is that they are\nincompatible with radical forms of particularism of the sort\nrecently defended by Jonathan Dancy and others. There are actually\nmany forms of moral particularism (see Jonathan Dancy’s entry on\nparticularism in this Encyclopedia; see also McKeever and Ridge 2005a,\n2016), but particularists are united in their embrace of holism in the\ntheory of reasons. On a holistic conception of reasons, a\nconsideration which functions as a reason in one context need not\nfunction as a reason at all in another context. For example, that my\ncalling my friend would give him pleasure may be a reason here, but\nnot a reason in another context (perhaps his pleasure would be purely\nsadistic in the second case, taking pleasure in some misfortune of\nmine). The atomist impulse is to build whatever is necessary for the\nconsideration’s status as a reason into the reason itself, so\nthat whatever is a reason in one context is thereby guaranteed to be a\nreason in any other context as well. So in the preceding example, the\natomist would insist that the second example just shows that we\nmischaracterized the reason in the first case. The real reason to call\nmy friend in the first case is not merely that it will give him\npleasure but rather that it will give him innocent pleasure, and that\nconsideration is not present in the second case. Particularists argue\nat some length that we should resist this atomistic impulse and stick\nwith the more natural characterization of the reason in the first case\nand accept a holistic conception of reasons. Particularists then argue\nthat holism in the theory of reasons in turn supports the conclusion\nthat morality is not well understood in terms of principles (for\ncritical discussion of this move, see McKeever and Ridge 2005b). \nParticularism is an interesting position and it would be a shame if\nsome plausible version of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction\nwere not compatible with the leading ideas behind particularism.\nHowever, it seems that both Nagel’s and Parfit’s versions\nof the distinction do not sit well with particularism. This is most\nclear in the case of Nagel. His doctrine of the universality of\nreasons directly contradicts holism about reasons yet plays an\nessential role in his account of what he calls the ‘general\nform’ of a reason which in turn plays an essential role in his\nversion of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction.\nParfit’s distinction between agent-relative and agent-neutral\ntheories of course presupposes that we should think about morality in\nterms of normative theories, which also contradicts many forms of\nparticularism. Finally, Parfit’s distinction between\nagent-relative and agent-neutral reasons holds that a reason is\nagent-neutral only if it is guaranteed to provide a reason for any\nagent who can promote the end which figures in the reason (again, we\nare assuming all reasons are teleological and hence always involve an\nend). Particularists will reject the idea that just because something\nis a reason for one agent it thereby must be a reason for any other\nagent who can promote the end which figures in the reason. For on a\nholistic conception of how reasons function, there may be some further\naspect of another agent’s situation which cancels the force of\nthis consideration as a reason even though he could promote the\nrelevant end. If this is right then for this sort of particularism it\nwill follow trivially that all reasons are agent-relative and this\nmakes the distinction useless for their purposes. So perhaps\nunsurprisingly, the principle-based version of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction does not seem like a\npromising one if we want to make sure that the distinction is useful\nto particularists as well as their generalist opponents. We should\ntherefore consider whether either the reason-statement-based version\nof the distinction or the perspective-based version of the distinction\nare more likely to be available to particularists as well while still\ndoing roughly the same sort of important philosophical work that Nagel\nand Parfit had in mind. \nThe second version of the distinction foregoes Nagel’s appeal to\nthe ‘general form’ of the reason, but instead is\nformulated in terms of the reason itself. We call this the\n‘reason-statement-based version’ of the distinction\nbecause it holds that whether a reason is agent-relative depends on\nwhether a full statement of the reason itself (forget about its\n“general form”) involves pronominal back-reference to the\nagent for whom it is a reason. Philip Pettit puts forward a\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction: \nOn Pettit’s account, whether a reason is agent-relative depends\non whether it (the reason) can be fully stated without pronominal\nback-reference to the agent for whom it is a reason. The use of\nanaphoric pronouns in Pettit’s version of the distinction does\nnot really mark much of a departure from Nagel’s formulation.\nFor Nagel’s ‘free agent variables’ are really\ntechnical devices which function just like anaphoric pronouns by\nreferring back to the agent for whom the consideration is a reason.\nThe real difference between Nagel’s formulation and\nPettit’s is that Nagel’s formulation is cast in terms of\nthe general form of a reason whereas Pettit’s formulation is\ncast in terms of a full statement of the reason itself, which need not\ninvolve any mention of the general form of the reason. For Pettit, the\nfull statement of a reason need not involve a universal quantifier at\nall. One of Pettit’s illustrative examples of a full statement\nof a reason is “that the action is in his\ninterest” and this statement involves no universal\nquantification whatsoever. So Pettit’s version of the\ndistinction, and more generally the reason-statement-based version of\nthe distinction, seems unlikely to offend against particularist\nsensibilities. \nMoreover, Pettit’s distinction seems to do much the same\nphilosophical work as Nagel’s version of the distinction. For in\nboth cases agent-relativity is characterized in terms of a certain\nsort of back-reference to the person for whom the consideration is a\nreason while agent-neutrality is in both cases characterized in terms\nof the absence of such back-reference. The only difference is that for\nNagel the relevant back-reference is to be found in the general form\nof the reason (which turns out to be a universally quantified\nprinciple giving a sufficient condition for the application of the\nreason predicate) whereas for Pettit the relevant back-reference is to\nbe found in a full statement of the reason itself. So far, it looks\nlike we have a kind of dominance argument for the\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction. It seems likely to\ndo much the same work as Nagel’s distinction and mirrors the\nlogical form of Nagel’s distinction, but does so without making\nthe distinction unavailable to particularists. \nHowever, the reason-statement-based version of the distinction has\nproblems of its own. Most significantly, this version of the\ndistinction seems to presuppose a particular ontology of reasons, in\nwhich case we end up inviting particularists to the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral party only by rescinding the invitations\nof those who hold opposing ontological views about reasons. For\nsuppose I think that reasons just are facts and also hold that there\nare no distinctively indexical facts. Rather, there are ordinary facts\nwhich can be characterized in indexical terms or characterized in\nnon-indexical terms. So the fact that having a beer at 6:13 p.m. on\nJanuary 17, 2005 would make MR happy is identical to the fact that\nhaving a beer now would make me happy. Here we have one fact which can\nbe expressed in two different ways. Given this package of ontological\nviews, the reason-statement-based version of the distinction looks\nunhelpful. For let us suppose that the fact that having a beer now\nwould give me pleasure provides an agent-relative reason for me to\nhave the beer—a sort of egoistic reason. On the\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction, the reason is\nagent-relative only if a full statement of the reason must\ninvolve pronominal reference to the agent for whom it is a reason.\nHowever, if reasons just are facts (this is my ontology of reasons)\nthen it is simply not true that a full statement of this reason (read:\nthis fact) must involve pronominal back-reference to me. For\ninstead of saying that having a beer would make him happy, you could\nsay that my reason is that having a beer would make MR happy. On the\nontology under consideration, this seems like a full statement (what\nis left out?) of the fact which is my reason to have the beer just as\nmuch as the anaphoric pronominal statement of my reason. Indeed, given\nthese ontological views it is hard to see how any reason could be\nagent-relative since any fact can be given a full statement without\nthe use of indexicals of any kind. Moreover, the problem here is not\nlimited to this particular ontology. Someone who holds that reasons\nare true propositions or states of affairs and who also holds that\nthere are no irreducibly indexical propositions or states of affairs\n(only indexical ‘modes of presentation’ of such\npropositions or states of affairs) will have trouble making use of the\nreason-statement version of the distinction for just this reason. \nThis is not to say that there are not ontologies which would provide a\nframework in which the reason-statement version of the distinction\ncould be useful. Two ontologies spring to mind. First, those who hold\nthat a reason is not just a fact but a fact plus a particular mode of\npresentation (a particular way of grasping the fact, as it were) might\nwell be able to make good use of the reason-statement-based version of\nthe distinction. Second, those who hold that reasons are just facts\nbut also hold that there really are irreducibly indexical facts can\nalso make sense of the reason-statement-based version of the\ndistinction. Still, it seems like a considerable cost that this\nversion of the distinction seems to exclude so many reasonable\nontological views. So whereas Nagel’s principle-based version of\nthe distinction excludes particularists, Pettit’s\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction excludes those who\nhold any of a wide range of ontological views about reasons. We should\nsee if we can do better. \nThe third way in which the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction\nhas historically been drawn is in terms of the perspectives from which\nthe reasons in question can be recognized as reasons. The basic idea\nis to specify a suitably objective perspective and hold that\nagent-neutral reasons can be appreciated as such from that perspective\nwhile agent-relative reasons cannot. Jonathan Dancy seems to read\nNagel in this way: \nThis reading of Nagel is to some extent invited by Nagel’s use\nof the metaphor of a ‘view from nowhere’. Moreover, it is\ntrue that in The Possibility of Altruism Nagel does argue\nthat agent-relative reasons (which he then called\n‘subjective’) cannot be recognized from a certain sort of\nimpersonal perspective. However, this was precisely supposed to be the\nconclusion of a substantive and highly controversial argument which\nNagel has since rejected (on the strength of an argument from Nicholas\nSturgeon; see Sturgeon 1974). If agent-relative reasons cannot be\nappreciated from a suitably objective perspective then Nagel quite\nclearly thinks that this will need to be established by argument. It\nis not part of his definition of agent-relativity; otherwise\nhe could have skipped most of the argument of The Possibility of\nAltruism as his main conclusion would have been established by\nlinguistic fiat. As we have seen, he instead defines agent-relativity\nin terms of the general form of the reason. \nStill, even if this is not what Nagel had in mind might this approach\nnot be philosophically useful and important? It would, after all, have\nthe virtue of being a distinction which is available to\nparticularists. For the idea of more and less objective perspectives\nis not obviously incompatible with even very radical forms of\nparticularism. Nor does it seem to exclude a variety of ontological\nviews about reasons as the reason-statement-based version of the\ndistinction did. However useful the distinction is, though, it is not\none which is well-suited to doing the work traditionally associated\nwith the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction. For a start, a\nplausible litmus test for any proposed version of the distinction is\nthat it uncontroversially classifies egoistic reasons as\nagent-relative and utilitarian reasons (to maximize happiness,\nsimpliciter) as agent-neutral. These are perhaps the most commonly\ncited paradigms of each sort of reason, after all. Also, the\ndistinction is often thought to capture in a more abstract sense what\nHenry Sidgwick was discussing when he spoke of a ‘dualism of\npractical reason’ between reasons of self-interest and reasons\nof general benevolence (see Sidgwick 1907). \nThe crucial point is that it is far from obvious that the\nperspective-based distinction satisfies this litmus test.\nNagel’s attempt to prove that agent-relative reasons in his\nsense (including egoistic reasons) cannot be appreciated from a\nsuitably objective perspective is widely regarded as a failure, as are\nmany other attempts to refute egoism (and agent-relativism more\ngenerally) by showing it is incompatible with some suitable objective\nperspective. So perhaps egoistic reasons can, after all, be\nappreciated even from an ideally objective perspective on any of a\nwide range of conceptions of objectivity. Perhaps not, though; perhaps\nsome clever argument will still show that agent-relativity is\nincompatible with some important and independent notion of\nobjectivity. In any event, this remains at best a very controversial\nhunch rather than something which has been uncontroversially\ndemonstrated. This alone should give us great pause about adopting the\nperspective-based approach to the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction. Egoistic reasons are paradigmatic agent-relative reasons,\nand it should be trivial that they come out as such rather than a\nmatter of great controversy. Moreover, the same point applies not only\nto egoistic reasons but to all of the typically invoked paradigms of\nagent-relativity. Reasons arising out of special relations to\none’s nearest and dearest are also paradigmatically\nagent-relative, but it is also far from clear that they will come out\nas such on the perspective-based approach. So even if we keep a single\nconception of objectivity as fixed there will be great controversy\nover whether seemingly paradigmatic instances of agent-relativity\nreally are such. This is unfortunate. The agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction should be one which is useful for framing these\ndebates at the outset (for more on this, see Dreier 1993) and not one\nwhich we can deploy with confidence only after the debates have been\nsettled. However, there will also be great controversy over just what\nthe right conception of objectivity is as well as controversy over the\nimplications of any given conception thereof. This threatens to mire\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in such controversy from\nthe outset as to make it virtually useless. Much better instead to\ndefine agent-relativity and agent-neutrality in terms of the logical\nform of the principle corresponding to the reason and then let it be a\nmatter of substantive debate whether agent-relative reasons so\nunderstood can be appreciated from various objective perspectives. \nWe seemed to have reached a dialectical cul de sac. The\nprinciple-based approach draws the distinction nicely but is\ninaccessible to particularists. The reason-statement-based approach to\nthe distinction is tenable on certain ontological views about reasons\nbut seems useless on a wide variety of other plausible ontological\nviews about reasons. Finally, the perspective-based approach threatens\nto just change the subject or at least to mire the application of the\ndistinction down in so much controversy as to make it useless as a\ntool for framing the debates which it seems so naturally suited to\nframe. \nFortunately, though, the principle-based approach can actually be\nunderstood in a way that is compatible with particularism after all,\nand this is how we propose to understand the distinction (this goes\nbeyond the existing literature, but does so in the spirit of a\n‘friendly amendment’ to Nagel’s account). The key\nmove is to not build Nagel’s conception of universality into the\narticulation of the distinction. So one might allow that a given\nconsideration (or state of affairs, or feature of a situation; insert\nyour favored ontology of reasons here) is a reason in one case but\nthat very same consideration might be no reason at all (or even a\nreason with the opposite valence) in another situation due to some\ndifference between the two situations. At least, drawing of the\ndistinction should not rule this out. In this way, the distinction is\ncompatible with the particularist’s favored holistic conception\nof reasons. \nThis very quickly leads to an awkward question, though. Nagel drew his\ndistinction in terms of principles which incorporated his conception\nof universality. For Nagel’s principles were universally\nquantified generalizations which held that whenever an agent\ncan promote a certain sort of state of affairs there is reason to do\nso. So a different way of understanding ‘the general form of a\nreason’ or as one might prefer to put it, the principle\ncorresponding to the reason, is needed. Fortunately, there is an\nalternative conception ready to hand. As Sean McKeever and Ridge argue\nelsewhere (see McKeever and Ridge 2006) there is a species of hedged\nmoral principle which is compatible with the particularist’s\nholistic conception of reasons. McKeever and Ridge call these\n‘default principles’, and they are well situated to make\nNagel’s principle-based distinction available even to as hardy a\nparticularist as Jonathan Dancy. As background, recall that on the\nholistic conception of how reasons work, what is a reason here may be\nno reason at all or even a reason with the opposite valence elsewhere.\nSo for example, the fact that it would give a father pleasure is a\nreason for his son to give him a kiss on the cheek but that very same\nconsideration (that it would give him pleasure) may be no reason at\nall for him to watch a snuff film. Intuitively, the status of the fact\nthat it would give him pleasure as a reason is ‘defeated’\nin the latter case by the fact that the pleasure would be sadistic (or\nan expression of depravity, or whatever). Holists therefore call such\nfacts ‘defeaters’. This is also compatible with what\nholists call ‘enablers’—facts which are necessary\nfor some other fact to function as a reason. In fact, distinguishing\nenablers from reasons also arguably helps block another challenge to\nthe distinction between agent-relative reasons and agent-neutral\nreasons, namely that all reasons must make some reference to the agent\nbecause there being a reason implies that the agent is able to perform\nthe action. This objection could be blocked by characterizing this\nback-reference as trivial, but one might instead insist that the\nagent’s ability to perform the action is an enabling condition\nrather than part of the reason itself; see Ronnow-Rasmussen 2009 for\nan argument along these lines. In any event, with this machinery in\nhand, default principles can help craft a version of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction that everyone (or just about\neveryone) can live with. \nGiven holism, a true and non-trivial principle about reasons must\naccommodate the possibility of defeaters. This can be done in one of\ntwo ways. First, one could try to list all of the different possible\ndefeaters in the antecedent and claim that none is present. However, a\nhardy particularist may insist that this is a fool’s game, on\nthe grounds that there is no saying in advance of considering all of\nthe indefinitely many possible contexts in which the putative reason\noccurs whether we have a complete list of all possible defeaters.\nAfter all, part of the particularist idea is that morality is far too\ncomplex for any such principles ever to be within our ken.\nParticularists allow that there may in principle be some infinitely\nlong generalization which lists all the defeaters, but deny that this\ncounts as a principle because it is not explanatory. However, there is\na second approach, and this is the approach which inspires the\nproposed conception of default principles. Instead of trying to list\nall of the possible defeaters and countervailing reasons one could\ninstead quantify over them. The proposal is most easily understood\nthrough illustrative examples. Returning to our example of pleasure\nand sadism, consider the following default principle: \n(P) is compatible with the particularist’s holistic conception\nof reasons. For in those cases in which the status of a fact about\npleasure as a reason is defeated by sadism (e.g.) the ‘no other\nfeature of the situation explains why F is not a\nreason…’ clause is not satisfied. Moreover, it is hard to\nsee how particularists could really object to principles as modest as\n(P). After all, (P) is compatible with the thesis that there are\nindefinitely many possible types of reasons and indefinitely many\npossible defeaters corresponding to each of those reasons. So the mere\navailability of default principles does not entail that the normative\nlandscape could be finitely (much less manageably) codified in some\nshort set of axioms like Ross’s list of prima facie\nduties, for instance. Furthermore, the availability of such principles\nin logical space does not in itself entail that they are presupposed\nby the very possibility of moral thought and judgment. So the\navailability of such principles is compatible with Dancy’s\ncanonical formulation of particularism, according to which, “the\npossibility of moral thought and judgement does not depend on the\nprovision of a suitable supply of moral principles” (Dancy 2004:\n7). \nWhat is the payoff of such principles in terms of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction? Default principles allow one\nto draw the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in much the same\nway that Nagel drew it but without thereby excluding\nparticularists. An initial gloss of the distinction might go as\nfollows. A given default principle will either include a free-agent\nvariable in the statement of the consideration which is the reason or\nnot. If it does then the reason is agent-relative; if not then the\nreason is agent-neutral. However, this is not quite right. For every\nstatement of a reason will be a statement about an action which is a\npossible action for the agent for whom it is a reason. I cannot have\nreason to perform an action that only someone else could perform,\nafter all. Since this sort of back-reference to the agent is entirely\ntrivial, we must explicitly add to our definition that it is not\nsufficient to make a reason agent-relative. Otherwise, all reasons\nwill implausibly come out as agent-relative for this trivial reason.\nIndeed, Derek Parfit already noticed this in his discussion,\nexplaining that, \nThis suggests that the statement of the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction should be slightly revised. The default principle\ncorresponding to a given reason will either include a\nnon-trivial free-agent-variable in the statement of the\nreason or not. If it does then the reason is agent-relative; otherwise\nit is agent-neutral. The idea is that the use of a free-agent variable\nto indicate that the action is one available to the agent for whom the\nfact is a reason is trivial in the sense that it must be included in\nthe statement of any reason whatsoever. So the reasons associated with\nthe default principle (P) [see above] are agent-neutral, as the only\nuse of the free-agent variable ‘p’ is the trivial one that\nindicates that x is a possible action of p’s.\nBy contrast, the reasons associated with the following principle would\nbe agent-relative: \nUnlike (P), the statement of the reason given in (P*) includes a\nnon-trivial use of a free-agent variable in its insistence that the\npleasure promoted must be p’s. So the reasons\nassociated with (P*) come out as agent-relative. It is not hard to see\nthat the proposed reading of the distinction should easily pass the\nlitmus test given above, classifying objective utilitarian reasons as\nagent-neutral (as with (P)) and egoistic reasons as agent-relative.\nMoreover, it is easy to see that the proposed reading of the\ndistinction would sort other paradigmatic instances of\nagent-relativity and agent-neutrality in an intuitively satisfying\nway. Abandoning Nagel’s assumption of universality in favor of\nour more modest default principles seems to allow us to make good\nsense of his distinction without excluding even fairly radical forms\nof particularism. \nHowever, before we rest too easily with this conclusion, we must first\naddress an important objection to default\n principles.[4]\n The challenge insists that they are all vacuously true simply in\nvirtue of their logical form. Since default principles are universally\nquantified conditionals, they can be false only if they have an\ninstantiation in which the antecedent is true and the consequent is\nfalse. The worry behind the vacuity objection is that the logical form\nof a default principle in conjunction with some very plausible\nassumptions about moral explanation entails that whenever the\nconsequent of a default principle is false, its antecedent will be\nfalse as well, in which case the principle itself is vacuously true.\nConsider the following inane default principle: \nLY is clearly absurd. For an action is wrong in virtue of a given fact\nor set of facts in the intended sense of ‘in virtue of’\nonly if the fact(s) in question is (or are) moral reason(s) not to\nperform the action which carry the day. Plausibly, that the fact that\nan action would be done in a leap year could never itself be a moral\nreason to perform the\n action.[5]\n So LY had better come out as false. The vacuity objection, however,\ninsists that LY turns out to be trivially true. Moreover, the\nobjection continues, the reason LY is true carries over to any default\nprinciple. \nLY is a universally quantified conditional ranging over possible\nactions and hence is false only if it has a possible instantiation in\nwhich its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. Presumably\nits consequent is necessarily always false—no action could be\nmade wrong in the relevant sense by being done in a leap\nyear—the fact that an action is done in a leap year could never\nin itself be a moral reason not to perform an action. So the crucial\nissue is whether any of its instantiations also has a true antecedent.\nThe antecedent is itself a conjunction and hence will be true only if\nboth conjuncts are true. However, the objection runs, the second of\nthe three conjuncts [(b) above] is necessarily false or is false for\nall possible actions. I am taking it as given that the leap year fact\nis not a moral reason, but the objection insists on general grounds\nthat it is implausible to suppose that there is no explanation of its\nfailure to be a moral reason. Moral facts are not arbitrary, at least\nin the extremely minimal sense that whenever something is or is not a\nmoral reason there will be some explanation of why this is\nso. Even someone who thought that morality was a direct function of\nthe arbitrary will of God should admit this much, since we will on\nsuch an account always be able to explain moral differences in terms\nof differences in God’s will even if we cannot go on to explain\nwhy God willed one way rather than another. So moral differences can\nalways be explained. Hence clause (b) in any default principle will\nalways be false, which is enough to make the antecedent false and so\nenough to make the conditional trivially true. \nAn adequate understanding of why the vacuity objection is unsound\nrequires careful attention to a further detail. The vacuity objection\ngoes from the premise that every time a fact is not a moral reason\nthere is some explanation for its failure to be a moral reason to the\nconclusion that the ‘no further feature of the situation\nexplains…’ clause of the corresponding default principle\nwill always be false whenever the fact in question is not a reason.\nHowever, this inference is valid only if it is valid to go from\n‘there is some explanation of p’ to ‘some\nfeature of the situation explains p’ and this inference\nis invalid. The inference would be valid only if we were to interpret\n‘feature of the situation’ so broadly that any possible\nexplanatory fact can count as a feature of the situation. This is not\nat all an intuitive reading of ‘feature of the situation’,\nnor is it the intended reading. Hence the vacuity objection is\nunsound. \nFor present purposes, the main point is just that a feature of a\nsituation must be a contingent fact. Necessary facts apply equally to\nall possible situations and hence are never features of any particular\nsituation in our sense. This is already enough to accommodate the\nplausible idea that every moral fact has an explanation of some kind\nwhile blocking the vacuity objection. For quite plausibly, the moral\nfacts in question will be explained by some necessary fact. For\nexample, the explanation of why the fact that a given action would be\ndone in a leap year is not a moral reason not to perform that action\nmight simply be that the fact that an action would be done in a leap\nyear could never be any kind of reason for action. That explanation is\nperhaps not the most illuminating one, but it is a kind of explanation\nand it is an explanation given in terms of a necessary fact. An\nalternative (and more controversial) explanation might appeal to the\nputative fact that a given fact is a moral reason only if it is a fact\nabout how the action bears in some way on welfare or treating people\nwith respect. This is a very controversial explanation, but the point\nis simply that if the main premise of this explanation (a kind of\npluralism involving utilitarian reasons and deontological reasons) is\ntrue then it very plausibly is a necessary truth. Once again, the fact\nin question does indeed have an explanation but it is not explained by\na feature of the situation. So there is no need to reject the\nplausible suggestion that every moral fact has some explanation to\nrefute the vacuity objection. \nMore importantly, no contingent feature of the situation could\nplausibly figure in an explanation of why the leap year fact is not a\nmoral reason in a given case. Indeed, because the leap year fact could\nnever be a reason its failure to be a reason here will in no\nway depend on any of the contingent features of this case. So none of\nthose contingent features of the case at hand will figure in an\nexplanation of why that fact is not a moral reason here. If the leap\nyear fact were sometimes a reason then things would be very different.\nFor in that case the contingent features that distinguish the\nsituation in which it is a reason from those in which it is not a\nmoral reason could intelligibly figure in an explanation of why the\nfact is not a moral reason here. Moreover, if asked to cite some\nparticular contingent feature of the situation that explains why that\nfact is not a moral reason here any sane moral agent would simply be\nperplexed. Hence for any default principle citing a patently absurd\ncandidate reason (and whose consequent is not necessarily true) there\nwill be possible instantiations of that principle in which the\nantecedent is true and the consequent is false. This line of argument\nis perfectly general, so any principle citing a putative reason in its\nantecedent which could never actually be a moral reason (and whose\nconsequent can be false; principles with tautologous consequents will\nof course be trivially true on anybody’s account) will turn out\nto be false. The only reason to doubt that the antecedent would\nsometimes be true was the thought that the ‘no feature of the\nsituation explains…’ clause is always trivially false.\nSince this rests on a failure to distinguish explanations in general\nfrom explanations cast in terms of contingent features, it is\nreasonable to conclude that default principles are not all vacuously\ntrue simply in virtue of their logical form. So default principles can\nsafely be invoked to articulate the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction and thereby capture Nagel’s basic idea without\nmaking the distinction useless to radical moral particularists like\nDancy. \nAs will be explained in section 6, the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction is a very useful and philosophically important one.\nHowever, as with all distinctions, its usefulness evaporates when it\nis confused with other related but different distinctions. This sort\nof confusion is depressingly commonplace, perhaps in virtue of an\nunfortunate tendency for philosophers to use terms like\n‘neutral’, ‘objective’, and\n‘relative’ without always being completely explicit about\nwhat those terms are supposed to mean. To guard against such\nconflations, this section canvasses a number of distinctions with\nwhich one might easily confuse the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction and explains how each differs from it. These distinctions\nare divided into six groups, where the distinctions are put into the\nsame group insofar as they all have the same feature(s) in common with\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction. \nThe first of these families of distinctions consists of those that are\nlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that they are\ndrawn in terms of a relativization of the reason to the agent who has\nthe reason, but in a different way from the way in which the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is. Only one widely employed\ndistinction clearly falls into this family: Bernard Williams’\ndistinction between internal and external reasons. On Williams’\naccount, a reason for acting is internal just in case it counts as a\nreason in virtue of its connection to the agent’s\n“motivational set” (desires, intentions, pro-attitudes,\netc.); otherwise it is external (see Williams 1981b). It is not hard\nto see how this distinction might easily be confused with the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, for one might easily suppose\nthat internal reasons just are agent-relative ones, while external\nreasons just are agent-neutral ones. However, the distinctions are not\nthe same, for a reason may be external and still be agent-relative.\nSuppose, for example, that we accept a default principle according to\nwhich the fact that an agent’s culture demands something is\nsometimes a reason to do it. Such a reason will be agent-relative in\nvirtue of the use of a free-agent variable to indicate that it is the\nagent’s own culture which determines what reasons she has. Or\nconsider a default principle according to which the fact that an\naction would satisfy the agent’s biological needs is sometimes a\nreason. Again, the relativization to the agent (here to the\nagent’s needs) entails that such a reason is agent-relative.\nEach of the reasons grounded by either of these latter two principles\nwill be both agent-relative and external, for an agent simply\nmay not care about her culture’s standards or her biological\nneeds. Hence, reasons for acting also can be both external and\nagent-relative. \nIn a second family of distinctions, we find distinctions that are like\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that they are also\ndrawn in terms of the principles underwriting an agent’s reasons\nfor acting, but are unlike it in that they are not drawn in terms of\ntheir relativity to the agent who has the reasons. Two main\ndistinctions fall into this family: universality/non-universality and\ngenerality/non-generality. Agent-neutrality is often confused with\nuniversality. A reason is universal insofar as any person, A,\nwho judges that one agent, B, has a reason is thereby\ncommitted to making the same judgment of anyone else, C, whom\nthey take to be in relevantly similar circumstances. So long as we\nassume reasons are associated with principles, this will mean that the\nprinciple associated with the reason will be universal in scope; that\nis to say, it will be of the form, “For all x, if\nx is an agent, then…” Note that this is much\nweaker than Nagel’s conception of universality; even default\nprinciples employ universal quantifiers and are universal in this\nsense. Universality in this thin sense is rightly taken to be a highly\nuncontroversial, perhaps even trivial, feature of reasons. However, it\nwould of course be a mistake to infer from this that agent-neutrality\nshould be uncontroversial, for the concepts are quite different.\nAgent-relative reasons, as well as agent-neutral reasons, can satisfy\nuniversality in this sense. An egoist principle, for example, would\ntypically be understood as a universally quantified thesis according\nto which for all agents A, if a given action maximizes\nA’s welfare then A ought to perform that action.\nNor, of course, is agent-neutrality the same as universality in\nNagel’s somewhat stronger sense according to which whatever is a\nreason in one case must be a reason anywhere. This is obvious once it\nis made explicit, but historical attempts to derive agent-neutrality\nfrom such forms of universality encourage the conflation (see, e.g.,\nHare 1963: 112–136). \nAgent-neutrality is also easily confused with generality, where a\nreason is general just in case the principle that underwrites it\ncontains no proper nouns or “rigidly designating”\ndescriptions (see Kripke 1972). Like universality, generality is a\nfunction of the principles underwriting the agent’s reasons.\nUpon reflection, though, it should be clear that the\ngeneral/non-general distinction simply cuts across the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction; agent-relative reasons could\nbe either general or non-general, as could agent-neutral ones. For\nexample, “The fact that God commands X-ing is a reason\nto X unless some other feature of the situation explains why\nit is not,” would be non-general (assuming that\n‘God’ is a rigid designator) yet agent-neutral, whereas,\n“The fact that God commands each person to do as her conscience\ndictates is a reason for each person to do as her conscience dictates\nunless some other feature of the situation explains why it is not a\nreason” would be both non-general and agent-relative. \nA third family of distinctions is like the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral one in that it is drawn in terms of a\nrelativization to the agent for whom the consideration is a reason,\nbut is not drawn in terms of the principle underwriting the\nreason. Here there are two very similar distinctions that merit\ndiscussion. In fact these two distinctions are so similar that they\nmight easily be confused with one another as well as with the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral one. The first of these two distinctions\nis the distinction between “deliberator relative” (DR)\nprinciples and “deliberator neutral” (DN) principles (see\nPostema 1998). Unlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction,\nthe DR/DN distinction is not one that is drawn in terms of the form of\nthose principles themselves. Unlike agent-relativity or\nagent-neutrality, deliberator relativity and deliberator neutrality\ncannot simply be “read off” from an accurate statement of\nthe principles themselves. For the DR/DN distinction concerns not the\nquestion of the form of the principles, but the question of the source\nof their authority, or if one prefers, their “force.” A\nprinciple’s having force for a given agent is then glossed as\nbeing such that the agent must recognize the principle’s\nvalidity to avoid counting as irrational. With this\nconception of force in play, the distinction is usefully characterized\nin the following way: \nA principle is DR iff (a) its force varies from one possible agent to\nthe next, which is to say at least some possible rational agents might\nreject the principle’s validity without thereby being\nirrational, or (b) it has force for no possible agents. This is just\nthe denial of DN. \nOnce the DR/DN distinction is explicitly articulated and compared with\nthe AR/AN distinction, it is clear that they are different\ndistinctions, doing different theoretical work. The distinctions\nsimply cut across one another. A principle might have an\nagent-relative logical form, and so be agent-relative, yet have be\ndeliberator neutral given the source of its authority. Egoism, for\nexample, is an agent-relative principle, but a defender of egoism\nmight argue that a failure to recognize egoism’s validity is\nsufficient for someone to count as irrational, in which case egoism is\nalso deliberator neutral.  \nThe other distinction falling into this third family is very similar\nto the DR/DN distinction. It also concerns the force, rather than the\nform, of a practical principle. The DR/DN distinction is in terms of\nwhich principles an agent must recognize as binding on her to\navoid counting as irrational. A slightly different distinction is\nthe between principles that really are binding on everyone\n(BN–“binding neutral”), even if one might not\naccept their authority without thereby counting as irrational,\nand those that are not (BR–“binding relative”).\nDrawing the distinction may commit us to the thesis that there is a\nfairly fundamental appearance/reality distinction to be drawn even\nwith respect to principles of practical reason, so that even an\nideally rational agent could, in principle, be mistaken at a given\npoint in time about which principle(s) bind her without thereby\ncounting as irrational. At any rate, it should be clear that this\ndistinction, like the closely aligned DR/DN distinction is quite\ndifferent from the AR/AN distinction. \nA fourth family of distinctions with which the AR/AN distinction might\neasily be confused is of those distinctions that are like the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that it is drawn in terms\nof relativization, but unlike it in that it is not in terms\nof a relativization to the agent who has the reason. There is perhaps\nonly one important distinction that clearly falls into this category:\nwhat Nicholas Sturgeon has helpfully referred to as\n“appraiser-relativism” (Sturgeon 1994). Though this may\nnot be essential to appraiser-relativism, it is worth noting that,\nunlike agent-relativism, appraiser-relativism is typically presented\nas a semantic thesis about terms of ordinary language (as opposed to\ntechnical terms like ‘agent-neutral’), to the effect that\nthe truth value of one and the same ethical or practical judgment can\nvary from one appraiser to the next. On such views, my judgment that\nwhat Hitler did was wrong could in principle be true while another\nperson making the very same judgment in a rather different context\n(but one in which Hitler’s actions, their context and\nconsequences are kept constant) could be false. By contrast, the\njudgment that there was agent-relative reason for Hitler to perform a\ngiven action will have a truth-value that is invariant across\ndifferent appraisers. Agent-relativism is a substantive view about\nwhat kinds of reasons people have, and is distinct from the semantic\nthesis of appraiser-relativism. Appraiser-relativism involves a\nrelativization to the person appraising an action, rather than a\nrelativization to the agent who might perform the action. \nA fifth family is of distinctions that in some sense divide reasons\ninto categories that might usefully be thought of as the\n“private” and the “non-private.” In this\nrespect, they are intuitively similar to the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, in that there is a\nrecognizable sense in which agent-relative reasons are\nprivate—their status as reasons for an agent is irreducibly a\nfunction of the features of that agent as such.\nCorrespondingly, agent-neutral reasons are public in the sense that\nthis is, by definition, not true of them. At least two other\ndistinctions are usefully thought of as dividing reasons into the\ncategories of private and non-private. However, each of these two\ndistinctions mark the private/non-private division in an importantly\ndifferent sense from the one in which the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction does. \nThe first of these two distinctions is one between reasons that are\n“essentially shared,” in a somewhat technical sense, and\nthose that are not. This distinction is perhaps the one that is most\nfrequently confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral one, and the\nphilosophical consequences are significant. As the distinction is\ntypically drawn, a reason is supposed to be “essentially\nshared” just in case whenever the reason is a reason for one\nagent to perform an action it is equally a reason for anyone\nto promote his performance of that action; otherwise it is not. So,\nfor example, if my reason to take a walk is essentially shared, it\nfollows that it is equally a reason for anyone to promote my taking a\nwalk. Put more quaintly, the question of whether reasons for acting\nare essentially shared is the question of whether a reason for me must\nprovide everyone else with a corresponding reason to help me do as\nthat reason recommends, insofar as they can. It is not hard to see how\nthere is a sense in which this distinction divides reasons into the\npublic and the non-public, as essentially shared reasons, unlike those\nthat are not essentially shared, provide reasons for everyone who can\npromote the state of affairs in which people act in accordance with\nthose reasons. That being “shared” has become a rather\ntechnical notion should be apparent, since in more ordinary terms you\nand I may both share a reason, that doing X would be pleasant\nsay, where each of our reasons provides no corresponding reasons for\nthe other. \nIt is also quite easy to see how this distinction might be confused\nwith the agent-relative/agent-neutral one. Suppose one embraces the\ntempting view that all reasons for acting must be\nteleological in form, which is to say that any principle\nunderwriting a reason for acting must individuate actions in terms of\nthe states of affairs that they promote. However, the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction itself should not be\nunderstood as incorporating such a highly controversial assumption,\nand the version of the distinction proposed in section IV as an\nimprovement on Nagel and Parfit therefore does not incorporate it.\nGiven the assumption of teleology, though, and given the rejection of\nholism in the theory of reasons (which Nagel’s universality\nimplicitly does reject) it would indeed follow that agent-neutrality\nand being essentially shared are necessarily co-extensive, since any\nuniversal (in Nagel’s sense) agent-neutral principle will then\nhave the following form: \nIt follows trivially from the supposition that all practical\nprinciples have this form that whenever one agent has reason to\npromote a state of affairs that any agent who can promote\nN will have reason to do so. \nHowever, the view that all reasons for acting are teleological, while\ntempting, is a substantive doctrine that one might reasonably reject.\nTeleology is certainly not a trivial feature of our understanding of\npractical reasons. To take just one example, T.M. Scanlon has recently\nargued at some length that not all reasons are teleological and that\nthe assumption that they are badly distorts our conception of\npractical reason (Scanlon 1998: 79–107). So it would be a\nmistake to allow one’s attraction to that substantive view to\nlead one to conflate the distinction between the\nagent-neutral/agent-relative distinction and the essentially\nshared/not essentially shared distinction. For insofar as one rejects\nthat assumption, one can very well allow that there are reasons which\nare both agent-neutral and not essentially shared. Consider,\nfor example, the following principle: \nThe reasons generated by this principle are clearly agent-neutral, but\nthey are not essentially shared, for it simply does not\nfollow from this principle that I have any reason to perform actions\nthat would reduce the total number of violent incidents (either by\nothers or myself in the future). I may very well have such further\nreasons, but they would be associated with a different principle, and\ntherefore might not be as weighty as the reasons associated\nwith the above agent-neutral principle. \nOn a historical note, it is perhaps no surprise that these two\ndistinctions are so often conflated. For we have seen that Nagel, the\noriginal and most influential proponent of the\nagent-neutral/agent-relative distinction, explicitly commits himself\nto the view that all reasons are teleological in form, and is driven\nby this view to conflate the two distinctions. Recall that Nagel\nembraces the following teleological conception of practical\nprinciples: \nNagel thinks this position is just an unproblematic simplification on\nthe grounds that he treats the performance “of act B as\na degenerate case of promoting the occurrence of act B”\n(Nagel 1970: 47). The reason it is not merely an\nunproblematic simplification is that putting all practical principles\ninto this form robs us of the ability to say that there is\nagent-neutral reason for an agent to but no reason for her to promote\nBing, except in the admittedly degenerate sense in which\nBing is a way of promoting Bing. \nOf Nagel’s critics, Christine Korsgaard has been most sensitive\nto the way in which he builds teleology into his view without argument\nfrom the very beginning. She notes, for example, that, “Nagel\ntreats all reasons as reasons to promote\nsomething…Nagel is in danger of ending up with consequentialism\nbecause that is where he started” (Korsgaard 1996a: 300). In\nspite of this perceptive diagnosis of Nagel’s error on this\nfront, though, Korsgaard occasionally blurs the two distinctions,\nclaiming that the criterion that the reason predicate not contain a\n“free agent variable” is simply a more formal way of\nsaying that these reasons are “common property” and not\n“personal property,” which on her view amounts to the\nthesis that they are essentially shared, as we have explicated that\nthesis (see Korsgaard 1996b: 276). That a philosopher perceptive\nenough to note and so accurately diagnose Nagel’s mistake could\nstill blur the two distinctions is a testament to the depth of the\nconfusion about these distinctions embedded throughout the current\nphilosophical literature. For another instance of this mistake, see\nMcNaughton and Rawling 1995a as well as Dreier 1993. \nA second distinction falling into this larger family of distinctions\nis the distinction between reasons that are intersubjective, and those\nthat are not, where intersubjectivity is cashed out in terms of the\npossibility of an agent’s successfully communicating the force\nof the reason to other agents. Korsgaard has emphasized this\ndistinction in a number of places and argued that all reasons for\nacting must be intersubjective (e.g., Korsgaard 1996b: 131–166).\nIt is not hard to see how non-intersubjective reasons might plausibly\nbe thought of as private and intersubjective reasons might be thought\nof as public; hence it is not too hard to see how that distinction\nmight be confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral one given the\ntendency to confuse that distinction with the private/public\ndistinction. Still, once intersubjectivity/non-intersubjectivity is\nexplicitly defined, it is relatively clear that it is different from\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction. For the former\ndistinction is drawn in terms of communicability and the latter\ndistinction makes no reference whatsoever to communicability. Indeed,\nfor all that has been said so far, a reason might be intersubjective\nand be either agent-relative or agent-neutral. Still, it is\nsurprisingly easy to run together these two distinctions. One way this\nconfusion might arise would happen in two stages. First, one might\nconfuse the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction with the\ndistinction between reasons that are essentially shared and\nthose that are not. Since intersubjective reasons are often\ncharacterized as reasons “we can share,” the\nstage is set for confusing both of those two distinctions with the\nfurther distinction between intersubjective and non-intersubjective\nreasons. For it would not be that difficult to confuse shareability\nwith being essentially shared. \nFinally, in the sixth family of distinctions, we find a distinction\nthat might easily be confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction as a kind of historical artifact. Here we have in mind the\ndistinction between “reasons for an agent to do something”\nand “reasons for something to happen.” Without actually\nconfusing them himself, Nagel may have unintentionally encouraged this\nconflation in remarking, for example, that, “Ethics is concerned\nnot only with what should happen, but also independently with what\npeople should or may do. Neutral reasons underlie the former;\nbut relative reasons can affect the latter” (Nagel 1986: 165).\nIn fact, however, it should be clear that these two distinctions are\ndifferent. The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction concerns the\nform of a practical principle, whereas the other distinction concerns\nwhether a reason is a reason for an agent to do something or a reason\nfor something to happen. One way of making the separateness of these\ntwo distinctions especially vivid is to note that someone might\nembrace the former distinction and admit that there are both kinds of\nreasons, but reject the very notion of a “reason for something\nto happen” as resting on an obscure, confused notion of a reason\nthat can float free of all possible agents. This is not to say that we\nshould in fact reject that notion; Wilfrid Sellars argues that a\ndistinction of this sort is an important one (see Sellars 1968:\n175–229. See also Castaneda 1975, with a discussion of\nSellars’s distinction). Rather, it is simply to note that it is\nnot obviously misguided to reject the very concept of a reason for\nsomething to happen, and we should leave room for someone to do this\nwithout supposing all reasons for acting are agent-relative, for that\nis simply another question. Even if I grant that all reasons must be\nreasons for someone, in that a reason presupposes a possible agent, I\ncan still hold that the principle underlying those reasons need not\nmake any non-trivial, ineliminable pronominal back-reference to that\nagent. Hence the two distinctions are different. \nIn sum, then, the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction shares a\nnumber of features with several other distinctions, and therefore is\neasily confused with those other distinctions. These other\ndistinctions have been broken down into six families, where those\nfamilies are divided in terms of what the distinctions in question\nhave in common with the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction.\nHaving discussed all six of these families at some length, it may be\nuseful to provide a concise review of the defining features of each\nfamily: \nHaving formulated the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction and\nseen how it differs from other important distinctions, we are now in a\nposition to consider why the distinction is an important one. The\ndistinction has played a very useful role in framing certain\ninteresting and important debates in normative philosophy. \nFor a start, the distinction helps frame a challenge to the\ntraditional assumption that what separates so-called consequentialists\nand deontologists is that the former but not the latter are committed\nto the idea that all reasons for action are teleological. A\ndeontological restriction forbids a certain sort of action (e.g.,\nstealing) even when stealing here is the only way to prevent even more\nstealing in the long run. Consequentialists charge that such a\nrestriction must be irrational, on the grounds that if stealing is\nforbidden then it must be bad but if it is bad then surely less\nstealing is better than more. The deontologist can respond in one of\ntwo ways. First, they could hold that deontological restrictions\ncorrespond to non-teleological reasons. The reason not to steal, on\nthis account, is not that stealing is bad in the sense that it should\nbe minimized but rather simply that stealing is forbidden no matter\nwhat the consequences (this is admittedly a stark form of deontology,\nbut there are less stern versions as well). This is indeed one way of\nunderstanding the divide between consequentialists and deontologists,\nbut the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, and in particular\nthe idea of agent-relative reasons, brings to the fore an alternative\nconception. For arguably, we could instead understand deontological\nrestrictions as corresponding to a species of reasons which are\nteleological after all so long as those reasons are agent-relative. If\nmy reason not to steal is that I should minimize my stealing then the\nfact that my stealing here would prevent five other people from\ncommitting similar acts of theft does nothing to suggest that I ought\nto steal. To really have any chance of working, the reasons will\nprobably need to be temporally relative as well as agent-relative. For\notherwise the reason corresponding to a deontological restriction will\ngive me reason to steal now if this is the only way to prevent me from\nstealing even more\n later.[6]\n If the reasons in play are agent-relative then perhaps the\ndeontologist can do more to defuse the consequentialist’s charge\nof paradox, though other problems now arise. The deontologist now can\nlook overly self-indulgent, so obsessed with the purity of her own\nsoul that she will not sacrifice her integrity for the greater good\n(see Ridge 2001a). Another worry is that reasons which are both\nagent-relative and temporally relative are not really teleological\nafter all in any interesting sense. For the only way to promote an\naction right now is simply by performing it. The broader and\nmore standard conception of promoting an action by causing it simply\nhas no foothold here, and if it did then the proposal would not\ncorrespond exactly with deontological intuitions. In spite of these\nworries, many philosophers have characterized the reasons\ncorresponding to deontological restrictions as agent-relative. Indeed,\nthe characterization of deontological restrictions as agent-relative\n(or agent-centered) is close to being an\n orthodoxy.[7] \nIf we can properly understand the reasons corresponding to\ndeontological restrictions as agent-relative (and temporally relative)\nteleological reasons but teleological reasons all the same then in\neffect we can, as James Dreier puts it, ‘consequentialize’\ndeontology, surprisingly enough. The apparent success of deploying\nagent-relativity to ‘consequentialize’ deontology leads\nDreier to defend the more bold hypothesis that any moral\ntheory can be represented as a form of consequentialism so long as we\nare willing to allow that consequentialism comes in agent-relative as\nwell as agent-neutral versions. The central idea behind\nconsequentialism, on this way of thinking, is its teleology and\ncommitment to maximizing, both of which seem compatible with\nagent-relativity about that which is\n maximized.[8]\n If Dreier is right about this then the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction may be more important than the distinction between\nconsequentialist theories and non-consequentialist theories. \nAnother advantage of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is\nthat it can bring to our attention important structural differences\nbetween what might otherwise seem like very similar normative\ntheories. For example, a theory which holds that our overriding reason\nis always to maximize actual utility seems very similar in spirit to a\ntheory which instead holds that our overriding reason is always to\nmaximize expected utility. One would naturally have thought\nthat both of these theories are agent-neutral so long as we assume\nthat utility is understood in agent-neutrally (in terms of general\nhappiness, e.g.). However, the reference to ‘expected’\nutility in the second theory actually seems to entail that the reasons\ncorresponding to that theory are agent-relative. For presumably the\nrelevant expectations are the agent’s, in which case we will\nneed to mark this with a free agent variable and that free agent\nvariable hardly seems\n trivial.[9]\n This is a surprising result, but there is no obvious way to block it\non the conception of agent-relativity proposed here (or on the\nclassical principle-based conceptions defended by Nagel, Parfit or\neven on the reason-statement-based version of the distinction defended\nby Pettit). This could itself be illuminating. Perhaps it suggests\nthat we need to draw a fundamental distinction between value and\nreasons, contra T.M. Scanlon and others who see value claims as really\njust indicating the presence of reasons; see Scanlon’s\ndiscussion of the ‘buck-passing account in Scanlon (1998). For\nsuch a distinction would allow us to say that while happiness is an\nagent-neutral good (thereby accommodating the intuition that there is\nsomething agent-neutral about the second theory) our reasons to\npromote that good are best understood in terms of the agent’s\nexpectations and hence agent-relative. \nNor should we forget that the first real use of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction was Nagel’s in The\nPossibility of Altruism. There Nagel tried to prove that all\nreasons must be agent-neutral on pain of a kind of practical\nsolipsism. Nagel eventually abandoned this argument in light of\nobjections from Nicholas Sturgeon (see Sturgeon 1974), but the\nargument is ingenious and Nagel may have abandoned it prematurely. If\nany such argument could ever be made to work then we might be able to\nsettle a wide range of difficult issues in normative philosophy\nwithout simply appealing to first-order intuitions about cases which\nso often seems to lead to philosophical stalemate. Moreover, if an\nargument like Nagel’s could be made to work then its\nimplications would be dramatic. Not only egoistic reasons but arguably\ndeontological reasons and reasons arising out of special relations to\none’s nearest and dearest would stand refuted, as would what\nNagel later referred to as ‘reasons of autonomy’ (see\nNagel 1986: 165). Furthermore, Nagel is not the only one to have\noffered abstract considerations in favor of the thesis that all\nreasons are agent-neutral. For example, some of Derek Parfit’s\nwork on personal identity is supposed to undermine the importance of\npersonal identity as such, and that in turn might undermine the\ntenability of agent-relativity (see Parfit 1984). \nThe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction was also invaluable in\nJames Dreier’s exploration of the often neglected issue of how\nan expressivist might make sense of agent-relative norms (see Dreier\n1996). Dreier’s argument is subtle and complex, and we shall not\ntry to reproduce it here. The point for present purposes is that his\ndiscussion highlights an important challenge for expressivists.\nAdmittedly, a more narrow version of this challenge was previously\nseen by Brian Medlin (see Medlin 1957), whose work heavily influenced\nDreier. However, Medlin cast the challenge specifically in terms of\negoistic reasons and that has important dialectical implications. As\nDreier points out, Medlin’s challenge applies to agent-centered\nnorms more generally and this wider scope matters. For we might well\nbe willing to abandon egoistic reasons, but if we also had to give up\non the intelligibility of deontology then the costs of expressivism\nmight well begin to seem too steep. Until Nagel and others drew the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, it was easy enough for\nphilosophers like Medlin to not fully appreciate the scope and power\nof their own arguments. \nFinally, the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction can also provide\na useful lens through which to examine some of the arguments of\nhistorical figures. Sidgwick’s famous discussion of the\n‘dualism of practical reason’ can now be seen as an\ninstance of the more general tension between agent-relative and\nagent-neutral reasons. G.E. Moore’s argument against ethical\negoism would, if sound, refute agent-relative conceptions more\ngenerally (see Moore 1903: 96–105), since Moore’s main\nobjection is not to egoism in particular but (in effect) to\nagent-relative conceptions of the good more generally. \nAlso, there is an interesting debate about whether Kantian moral\nprohibitions must be understood as agent-relative even if we allow\nthat all reasons are teleological (see Ridge 2009; compare Huckfeldt\n2007 and Dougherty 2013). The strategy is to understand the end to be\npromoted in agent-neutral terms, but also in such a way that the agent\nat any given point in time can best promote that agent-neutral aim\nonly by acting in accord with suitable deontological rules. One key\nidea behind this strategy is that the relevant end is “good\nwilling” understood in a broadly Kantian way, combined with a\nrobust theory of free will according to which one agent cannot ever\nfully control the will of another. The other key idea is that the\nagent-neutral teleological reasons in play are compatible with a\nnon-maximizing theory of right action. In particular, the idea will be\nthat the agent must always minimize the risk of the very worst of the\navailable outcomes. If the very worst of the available outcomes is\nthat everyone has a bad will, then one can ensure that the risk of\nthat outcome is zero by preserving one’s own good will. Given\nthat one cannot in this way fully control the will of another, the\nneeded self/other asymmetry is preserved without agent-relativity in\nthe theory of reasons or value. A suitable theory of right action and\nfree will can do the work that would otherwise require an\nagent-relative theory of reasons or value.  \nThe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is extremely important to\na wide range of debates in normative philosophy. Yet the distinction\nis often drawn in very different ways, with the risk that philosophers\nare simply talking past one another. In this entry, different ways of\ndrawing the distinction have been distinguished, and the virtues of a\nmodified version of the principle-based approach has been defended.\nThe distinction so drawn is different from a wide range of other\ndistinctions with which it might easily be confused; these\ndistinctions are laid out here to help guard against such confusions.\nFinally, the distinction so drawn is an important one in structuring\ncentral debates in normative theory, such as how to understand the\ndivide between consequentialists and deontologists.","contact.mail":"mridge@staffmail.ed.ac.uk","contact.domain":"staffmail.ed.ac.uk"}]
