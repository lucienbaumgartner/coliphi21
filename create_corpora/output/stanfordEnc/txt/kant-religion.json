Many of his\ncontemporaries, ranging from his students to the Prussian authorities,\nsaw his Critical project as inimical to traditional Christianity. The\nimpression of Kant as a fundamentally secular philosopher became even\nmore deeply entrenched through the twentieth century, though this is\nbelied by a closer inspection of his writings both before and after\nthe publication of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), i.e.,\nwhat are commonly referred to as his “pre-Critical” and\n“Critical” periods.\n\n\nAfter an initial overview discussion of Kant’s philosophy of\nreligion, this entry will turn to his views during the pre-Critical\nand then Critical periods. With regards to the former period, we will\ndiscuss Kant’s religious background, his views on the\nrelationship between God and nature, and then how some of the key\nfigures of the period influenced his philosophy of religion. We will\nalso discuss his conception of God and approach to the arguments for\nGod’s existence during this period.\n\n\nWe will then turn to his Critical period, where we will discuss how\nTranscendental Idealism shaped his philosophy of religion, his\nCritical treatment of the arguments for God’s existence, his\nconception of God, epistemology of religion, distinction between Deism\nand Theism, the relationship between the highest good and the\npractical postulates, interpretations of his approach to Christian\ndoctrine, an overview of the four parts of Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason, and, finally, his Opus\nPostumum. Throughout, attention will be paid to many of the\npoints of interpretative dispute over key aspects of his philosophy of\nreligion.\n\nThe impression through the twentieth century of Kant as a\nfundamentally secular philosopher was due in part to various\ninterpretative conventions (such as Strawson’s “principle\nof significance” – Strawson 1966, 16) whereby the\nmeaningfulness and/or thinkability of the supersensible is denied, as\nwell as through an artifact of how Kant’s philosophy religion is\nintroduced to most, namely through the widespread anthologization of\nhis objections to the traditional proofs for God’s\nexistence. \nKant’s philosophy in the pre-Critical period has been\ncharacterized variously as a progression from rationalism to\nempiricism to criticism (Paulsen 1963), the continued search for a\nmore proper method for metaphysics (De Vleeschauwer 1962), a\nreconciliation of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian ideas (Friedman\n1994) or of natural science and metaphysics (Schönfeld 2000; cf.\nAnderson 2015), and as an attempted articulation of a metaphysical\nalternative to Leibnizian “logicism” (i.e., the view that\n“anything that is not logically contradictory is possible”\n(Stang 2016). But what nearly all of Kant’s pre-Critical\nwritings have in common is the desire to frame a more adequate concept\nof God and of the relation of this being to the created universe. Thus\namong his earliest reflections we find a detailed sketch of a\nreligious outlook extracted from Alexander Pope’s “An\nEssay on Man” (1734) and a discussion, among other things, of\nwhy this position is philosophically superior to that of Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) and Christian Wolff\n(1679–1754). \nWithin Kant’s Critical period, not only do we find powerful\ndefenses of religious belief in all three Critiques {1781, 1788,\n1790}, but a considerable share of Kant’s work in the 1790s is\nalso devoted to the positive side of his philosophy of religion. This\nincludes his 1791 “Theodicy” essay, Religion within\nthe Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), “The End of All\nThings” (1794), and the Conflict of the Faculties\n(1798). Moreover, his lectures on logic, Reflexionen and the\nJäsche Logic present a robust account of the nature of religious\nbelief/faith [Glaube]. So, while Kant does deny the\npossibility of religious knowledge (as well as opinion), he\ncharacterizes this denial as necessary to safeguard faith, which he\nendorses as the proper mode of religious assent. One must, therefore,\nunderstand the negative elements in his philosophy of religion, such\nas his infamous objections to the traditional proofs for God’s\nexistence, in this context. As stated in the B-Preface to the\nCritique of Pure Reason, a central goal of the Critical\nproject is to establish the limits to knowledge “in order to\nmake room for faith” (Bxxx). \nThroughout Kant’s writings, we find ample discussions of\nreligious issues. These are, in many instances, clearly affirmative,\nthough they are often framed within objections to theoretical\nreason’s encroachments into the domain that is instead proper to\nfaith. Although his discussions of God and immortality are familiar to\nmost Kantians, the Critical corpus moves well beyond just these.\nEspecially in the 1790s, we find detailed treatments of biblical\nhermeneutics, miracles, revelation, as well as many distinctively\nChristian doctrines such as Original Sin, the Incarnation, Vicarious\nAtonement, and the Trinity. \nUnfortunately, however, the many positive elements of Kant’s\nphilosophy of religion have been eclipsed by its initial negative\nmoments, moments not meant to oppose religion, but rather reflective\nof the Lutheranism (or more precisely, the anti-liturgical Lutheran\nPietism) of his youth. Just as with Luther’s own negative\npolemics against religious despotism and scholastic arcana, we see in\nKant a parallel dialectic, where he, rather than opposing religion,\nsought to free it from the “monopoly of the schools” and\nset it on a footing suitable to “the common human\nunderstanding” (Bxxxii). Hence, as we will discuss through this\nentry, the statement that Kant sought out the limits to knowledge\n[Wissen] in order to “make room for faith\n[Glaube]” (Bxxx), is not an empty bromide, but rather\nthe key anthem for his overall philosophy of religion. \nThe influences on Kant’s pre-Critical religious thought can be\ndivided under three general headings, namely, the personal, the\nscientific and the philosophical. \nAmong the most important influences on Kant’s understanding of\nreligion is no doubt his experience of Pietism, a reform movement\nwithin German Lutheranism which aimed to fulfill what it saw as the\noriginal intention of Martin Luther. According to the founders of\nPietism, such as Philip Jacob Spener (1635–1705), this original\nintention required a more scrupulous religious and moral outlook, a\ndeep personal devotion to increasing one’s own piety and that of\nothers (through collegia pietatis, i.e., through private\nmeetings among lay persons for development of personal holiness), and\nconsequently exacting self-examination as well as the creation of a\ngeneral culture of supporting progress in these matters. Pietists saw\nOrthodox Lutheranism, by contrast, as having become frozen in vain\nintellectualism, an adherence to over-subtle and lifeless formalisms,\nand ecclesiastical politics. As a consequence, Pietists sought a\nreturn what Spener referred to as “apostolic simplicity”\nin theological matters. \nKant lived his entire life in the city of Königsberg, the second\nlargest center of Pietism after Halle. His parents were Pietists and\nhe was educated at the Collegium Fridericianum, a Pietist gymnasium\ndirected by Franz Albert Schultz (1692–1763). Although the\npositive influence of Protestantism in general, and Pietism in\nparticular, has been strongly disputed (Wood 1970: 197n.; Kuehn 2001),\nthe majority of scholars have argued otherwise. Kant’s use of\nPietist terminology such as the “change of heart”\n(Herzensänderung), classic theological language such as\n“radical evil” (radix malorum), his detailed\nengagement with Augustinian themes throughout the Religion,\nand focus on Pietist and Moravian models of grace (AK 7:54–57\n[1798]), which were prevalent in his region, all indicate the lasting\ninfluence of his religious upbringing. \nLike all of his German contemporaries, Kant could not have avoided\nbeing affected by memory of the acrimonious conflict that had occurred\nbetween the Pietists and Christian Wolff (1679–1754) at the\nUniversity of Halle just a generation prior. However, by the time Kant\narrived at the Collegium Fridericianum, Pietism—particularly in\nKönigsberg—had taken on a milder form, one which often\nsought to adopt but also revise the teachings of Wolff in accordance\nwith Pietist principles (De Vleeschauwer 1962; Kuehn 2001). The most\nsignificant example of this is found in Kant’s influential\nteacher at the University of Königsberg, Martin Knutzen\n(1713–1751), whose Philosophical Proof of the Truth of the\nChristian Religion (1740) argues that the core of Christianity\nlies in “presenting us with a genuine means of atonement”\n(Knutzen 1740: §39) and that the necessary revelation of such a\nmeans can be rationally demonstrated using largely, but not\nexclusively, Wolffian principles. \nFinally, among the personal influences on Kant’s view of\nreligion, whether positive or negative, there must be numbered his\nlong associations with Johann Georg Hamann (1730–1788) and\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803). Hamann, who at points was\npart of Kant’s small circle of friends, fiercely defended a\nmystical fideism and railed against the Enlightenment’s\nconfidence in reason. Through both his published writings and his\ndirect personal contacts, Hamann continually challenged Kant to\ndevelop and defend his own views regarding the relation between faith\nand reason, often drawing support from the skepticism of David Hume\n(see e.g., Hamann’s letters to Kant dated 27 July 1759 [AK\n10:7–17; C 47–54] and December 1759 [AK 10:26–31; C\n61–66; also Kuehn 2001: 118–126). Although less radical in\noutlook, Herder played a similar role, particularly later in\nKant’s life. \nAs with many philosophers of the modern period, Kant’s religious\nviews are deeply influenced by the scientific picture of nature that\ntook root in the wake of Copernicus. Most significant during the\npre-Critical period are the ideas that the universe is a centerless,\nceaselessly expanding, totality of things, which evolves towards ever\ngreater perfection according to physical (Newtonian) and spiritual\nlaws. Kant draws support for this view as well as inspiration for\ninterpreting its religious significance from the writings of, among\nothers, Alexander Pope (1688–1744), Thomas Wright\n(1711–1786), Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis\n(1698–1759), Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), and\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) (see Kant’s important\nnote on Newton and Rousseau justifying God and so proving Pope’s\n“theorem” that “Whatever is, is right” AK\n20:58–59). Consequently, much of Kant’s thinking about God\nduring this period is focused on framing a conception of God and of\nthis being’s relation to nature that adequately takes into\naccount this revised picture of the universe. \nThe third set of influences on Kant’s early religious views were\nphilosophical in the sense that he mainly encountered them in\npublished philosophical treatises and textbooks. To these chiefly\nbelong the writings of the Leibnizian-Wolffian school and those of\nwhat is sometimes referred to as the Thomasian-Pietistic school. \nThe Leibnizian-Wolffian School. As noted above, Kant had already\ndeveloped some criticisms of Leibniz’s Theodicy (1710)\nin 1753. He also studied the works of Wolff—most notably the\ntwo-volume Natural Theology (1736–1737)—as well\nas the theological writings of most of Wolff’s many followers.\nThe most important of these latter are Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n(1714–1762) and Johann August Eberhard (1739–1809). Kant\nused Baumgarten’s Metaphysics (1739) in his courses on\nmetaphysics for over forty years, and late in his career adopted its\nsection on natural theology alongside Eberhard’s Preparation\nfor Natural Theology (1781) for his lectures on philosophical\ntheology. Although there are many differences, sometimes major,\nbetween these figures, they all agree generally in maintaining that\nthe Principle of Non-Contradiction is the first principle of\nmetaphysics, that human actions are free but still subject to the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason, that truths in the divine intellect\nplace limits on the divine will, and that physical and moral laws are\ndependent on divine choice but can also be known as necessary from\nnature alone. They also all defend some version of the Ontological\nArgument. \nThe Thomasian-Pietistic School. Under this heading falls a group of\nphilosophers that perhaps should not be called a school, but\nnevertheless arise from two common sources, namely the writings of\nChristian Thomasius and also often from Pietism, and generally share\none common opponent, namely Christian Wolff. In terms of his influence\non Kant, the most important of these is undoubtedly Christian August\nCrusius (1715–1775). Although Kant is never an uncritical\nfollower of Crusius, it is clear that Kant studied his works intensely\nfrom the late 1750s until the middle of the 1760s, often taking his\nside against that of Leibniz and Wolff. Like others in this group,\nCrusius argues that the Principle of Non-Contradiction is an empty\nprinciple and thus is insufficient for founding metaphysics, that\nhuman actions are radically free and so not subject to the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason, and that moral laws can only be known through\nthe revelation of the divine will (in scripture or in conscience).\nNearly all of these disagreements with Wolff stem from the contention\nthat his system is inconsistent with the real significance of such\nreligious concepts as the duty and obedience to God, guilt, and\nconscience. \nCrusius also rejected the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the\nOntological Argument in terms that are very close to what we find in\nKant’s writings of this period. Philosophers of this school\ndeveloped a far more robust account of rational faith than is found in\nthe writings of Wolff. Thus, in a way reminiscent of the later Kant,\nCrusius argues that we are necessitated to believe something if its\ndenial would undermine or render impossible the pursuit of an end\ntowards which we have a duty (Crusius 1751: §339), the most\nimportant of which is our obligation to God (Crusius 1751: §345).\nThis obligation, according to Crusius, necessitates, among other\nthings, a belief in freedom, immortality and even in the reliability\nof reason itself (see Chance 2019). \nFinally, any account of the philosophical influences on Kant’s\nearly religious thought must include mention of the “Profession\nof Faith of the Savoyard Vicar” from Rousseau’s Emile,\nor Education (1762), a book that is thought to have had a\nprofound impact on Kant’s intellectual development in the second\nhalf of the 1760s. In many respects, the Vicar’s expression of a\nhumble and common sense religious outlook has parallels in\nKant’s own development in the later 1760s as mentioned in\n section 2.2 below. \nAn mentioned above, Kant earliest reflections on religious themes\ninclude a comparison between Alexander Pope’s Essay on\nMan (1733–4) and the theologies advanced by Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) and Christian Wolff\n(1679–1754). According to the pre-Critical Kant, the Leibnizian\nposition rests on an inconsistent and limited view of the divine\nbeing, one in which the eternal essences of things retain a degree of\nindependence, whereas Pope \nsubjects every possibility to the dominion of an all-sufficient Being;\nunder this Being things can have no other properties, not even those\nwhich are called essentially necessary, apart from those which\nharmonise together to give complete expression to His perfection. (AK\n2:233–234, note 3704) \nAlready in these passages we find hints of the main features of\nKant’s pre-Critical metaphysics, all of which point back to this\nreligious context, namely: \nKant’s engagement with this last point in particular relates to\nhis lifelong preference for, and interest in, the Physico-Theological\nArgument (see\n section 3.1.2.3 below). \nKant’s initial attempt to articulate a metaphysics that could\njustify all these views is found in two works of 1755, A New\nElucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition and\nUniversal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, Or Essay on\nthe Constitution of the Mechanical Origin of the Whole Universe\naccording to Newtonian Principles. The former focuses on the\nlaying the foundation of a metaphysical system including points\n (i–v)\n above. The latter then focuses on\n (vi)\n by purporting to show that even just the Newtonian laws of nature\nexhibit such a tendency to bring about order and perfection in nature\nas can only be explained by a conception of God as the all-sufficient\nground of the essences of things. The continued influence of the\nreligious outlook of Pope’s Essay on Man (and hence\nalso of the specific brand of Deism, similar to Shaftesbury’s\nand Lord Bolingbroke’s, to which it is related) is evidenced in\nthe fact that the Universal Natural History contains no less\nthan six separate passages from this work, three of which Kant uses to\nintroduce the three divisions of his book. \nFor whatever reasons, Kant seems to have been unsatisfied by this\ninitial attempt, and so set out in the 1760s to better defend and\nexplain this same general system of thought in his Only Possible\nArgument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God\n(1763b). This time, however, he is much more concerned with\narticulating a firm methodological basis for his metaphysics, as is\nevident in the work itself as well as in the key essays of the period,\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763a) and Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of\nthe Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1764). \nDespite retaining this commitment to his earlier metaphysics, it seems\nclear that at this time Kant also becomes convinced that there exists\na common sense religious standpoint that is not dependent upon the\nproof of metaphysical doctrines, but which is equivalent or perhaps\neven stronger in its practical import (see, e.g., AK 2:65 [1763b]).\nWith the eventual abandonment of his pre-Critical project in the late\n1760s it is this alternative source of religious conviction that will\nblossom into the re-founding of his religious thought in moral\ntheology (see\n sections 3.3–3.7 below). \nThrough the remainder of this section, we will focus on three\nparticular religious topics discussed by Kant during the Pre-Critical\nperiod: his treatment of God as an all-sufficient being, his critique\nof the ontological argument, and his own early argument for\nGod’s existence. \nAs noted above, this idea first makes its appearance in Kant’s\nearly notes. Kant does not attempt to justify the concept, but instead\nuses it in order to argue that the view that evil has its source in\nrestrictions placed on the divine will by the truths of the divine\nintellect—a view he attributed to Leibniz—is\nincomprehensible. The primary significance of divine all-sufficiency\nhere is that it means that there can be no necessity prior to the\ndivine will. Since Leibniz and Wolff identified truths in the divine\nintellect with the natures or essences of things, as well as with\ntheir inner possibility, all-sufficiency for Kant also means that\nthese too must be dependent on the plan of the divine will. In\nUniversal Natural History, Kant argues from the perfect order\nof the physical universe to the existence of an all-sufficient being,\nasking whether it does \nnot provide an undeniable proof of their [i.e., all physical things]\ncommon first origin, which must be an all-sufficient highest mind in\nwhich the natures of things were designed in accordance with unified\npurposes? (AK 1:228–229 [1755b]) \nFor Kant this means that the divine will not only orders what is\ncontingent in nature—a view held equally by Leibniz and\nWolff—but also that it brings about order and perfection through\nbeing the ground of the inner possibilities of all things (i.e., their\nnatures or essences), indeed even the most basic laws of matter (see\nAK 2:151–154 [1763b]). \nIn The Only Possible Argument, Kant claims that the thought\nof God as the all-sufficient is “of all thoughts the most\nsublime, [but] is still widely neglected, and mostly not considered at\nall” (AK 2:151), and declares that if \nexpanded to include all that is possible or real, is a far more\nappropriate expression for designating the supreme perfection of the\nDivine Being than the concept of the infinite, which is commonly\nemployed. (AK 2:154) \nIn connection with\n section 3.1.2.1\n below, it is important to note that Kant rejects the Ontological\nArgument in both the New Elucidation and in The Only\nPossible Argument, though for different reasons in each case. In\nthe former, Kant employs a version of the objection formulated by\nJohannes Caterus (1590–1655) in his response to Descartes’\nMeditations (AK 1:395 [1755a]). In essence, the objection is\nthat although the Ontological Argument proves that the concept of\nexistence is necessarily contained in the concept of God, this is only\na connection among concepts. For the argument to work, then, one would\nfirst have to show that it is a concept of something actual. By the\ntime of The Only Possible Argument, however, Kant seems to no\nlonger accept this criticism. Instead, he mainly rejects the argument\nbased upon his analysis of concept of existence, which purportedly\nshows that it is not a real predicate (AK 2:72–77, AK\n2:156–157 [1763b]). His preferred pre-Critical reason for\nrejecting the Ontological Argument is basically the same as will be\ndiscussed in\n section 3.1.2.1.\n Nevertheless, at this time Kant also articulates a version the\nobjection used by Gaunilo of Marmoutiers (eleventh century) in\nresponse to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) (AK 2:156–157\n[1763b]). \nKant’s own argument for God’s existence is closely\nconnected to his conception of God as all-sufficient and the ground of\nall real possibility. In the New Elucidation, the argument is\nextremely brief with its core consisting in the claim that\n“nothing can be conceived as possible unless whatever is real in\nevery possible concept exists and indeed exists absolutely\nnecessarily”; “for if this be denied, nothing at all would\nbe possible; in other words, there would be nothing but the\nimpossible” (AK 1:395). A very similar argument features later\nin The Only Possible Argument where it is presented in much\ngreater detail. Here again the central idea is that possibility\npresupposes something actual, and so there is a being which, if it did\nnot exist, then nothing would be possible; but such a being is\nabsolutely necessary (AK 2:83). \nIn both the New Elucidation and in The Only Possible\nArgument, though more fully, Kant immediately proceeds to derive\nfrom the above proof the further properties of what is absolutely\nnecessary. This ground of all possibility must be found in one being,\nwhich is unique, simple, immutable and eternal, containing supreme\nreality, and hence possessing both intellect and will. Consistent with\nhis criticism of Leibniz mentioned in\n section 2.2.1\n Kant rejects both theological voluntarism and intellectualism,\narguing that neither God’s intellect nor will takes precedence\nover and so limits the other, but instead they must stand in absolute\nharmony. For this reason, “the possibilities of things\nthemselves, which are given through the divine nature, harmonise with\nhis great desire” so that “unity, harmony and order are\nthemselves to be found in the possibilities of things” (AK\n2:91–92 [1763b]). \nWith the introduction of Transcendental Idealism’s epistemic\nstrictures, Kant came to the conclusion that religion must fall\noutside the scope of theoretical reason. However, instead of atheism\nor agnosticism, Kant advanced a novel philosophical theology that\ngrounds religion on the “needs” of practical reason. In\nthe B-Preface to the Critique of Pure Reason, he in fact\nintimates that his interest in religion is part of what motivated\nTranscendental Idealism. That is, as quoted earlier, Kant sought to\nestablish the limits to knowledge “in order to make room for\nfaith” (Bxxx). Such a faith has its source in the needs of pure\npractical reason (AK 8:137 [1785a], AK 5:142 [1788], AK 6:139 [1793]),\nand it is through these needs that Kant maintains that we can extend\nour cognition for practical purposes, allowing us to form a warranted\nconception of God and the afterlife in the service of the highest good\n(A814/B843–A819/B847). Kant coins the term “pure rational\nfaith” (AK 8:142) in What does it mean to Orient oneself in\nThinking (1785a) and later uses this term as well as the\n“pure philosophical doctrine of religion” (AK 6:10\n[1793]), “pure religion of reason” (AK 6:12), “pure\nrational system of religion” (AK 6:12) and simply “pure\nrationalism” to refer to his positive philosophy of religion.\nNote, however, that Kant always intends by these terms specifically\npractical rather than theoretical reason, as the\n“needs” which serve as the basis for faith pertain to our\npractical, moral lives. \nWe will here begin with a discussion of Kant’s critique of the\ntraditional proofs for God’s existence before moving on to the\npositive side of his philosophy of religion. Although the fame of this\ncritique has been taken as indicative of his philosophy of religion as\na whole, it is instead representative of his distinction in the\nCritical period between the illicit attempts at a positive philosophy\nof religion driven by theoretical reason, versus a philosophy of\nreligion that has its ground in practical philosophy. \nThe Transcendental Dialectic’s “Ideal of Reason”\ncontains the best known and most frequently anthologized components of\nKant’s philosophy of religion. In addition to its portrayal of\nthe ens realissimum, one finds within it Kant’s\nobjections to the Ontological, Cosmological and Physico-theological\n(Design) arguments. It is thus the text most central to the negative\nelements of Kant’s philosophy of religion and is integral to the\nwidely held view that Kant is hostile to religion. \nKant maintains that underlying all the traditional proofs for\nGod’s existence is the concept of the ens realissimum,\nthe most real being. Reason comes to the idea of this being through\nthe principle that every individuated object is subject to the\n“principle of complete determination”. While the\ngenerality of concepts allows them to be less than fully determined\n(e.g., our concept of a horse extends over horses that are different\ncolors, heights, etc.), individuated objects must be completely\ndetermined (e.g., an individual horse must have specific colors, a\nspecific height, etc.). \nHence, where the particular determinations of actual objects are\ndiscovered through experience, our concepts, which in themselves are\nnot objects of experience, remain partly indeterminate. Nevertheless,\nreason can construct for itself what is on the one hand still an\nabstraction but yet also an individuated entity. Kant refers to such\nentities as “ideals” and in most instances they are used\nby us regulatively as archetypes for reflection. For example, when\nconsidering whether or not to get a pet, one might envision an ideal\npet, a pet with the optimal set of desirable attributes. Such an\narchetype for thought, however, is still not completely determined,\nfor the ideal can still be neutral between various attributes that are\nnot regarded as relevant to one’s interests (for example, one\nmay not consider any specific nostril width salient to one’s\nchoice of pet). \nBy contrast, the ens realissimum is the concept of an\nindividual object that is completely determined, and is such through\nreason alone. In the case of most ideals, their determinations are the\nresult of various empirical concepts as well as various subjective\ninterests (such as what one believes a pet would bring to one’s\ndaily life). However, in the ens realissimum, all its\ndeterminations are set solely through reason’s formal\napplication of the principle of complete determination, aggregating\ntogether all possible predicates and selecting from these predicates\nall those which have a fully positive reality (no negative predicates,\nno derivative predicates). That is, following the concept of\n“the most real being”, reason brings together all possible\npredicates and eliminates those which involve some limitation or\ndeficiency. \nIn doing this, the faculty does not violate any of the standards Kant\nsets out within Transcendental Idealism, for reason is merely applying\nthe formal principle of complete determination to all possible\npredicates and constructing an idea (or more precisely, an ideal)\nthereby. This construction can then be entertained by the intellect,\nor perhaps, used as a regulative principle, as one does with other\nless grand ideals. Transcendental error comes in, however, if reason\nalso then tenders the ens realissimum as not merely a formal\nconstruct but as the metaphysical ground of all that is: since it (in\nprinciple) contains all determinations, and these determinations are\nof actual entities, a “transcendental subreption” may\noccur that transforms the ens realissimum from just an\nintellectual construct into a metaphysical reality as the sum total of\nall actuality. \nAs with other transcendental errors, we can subreptively conflate a\nsubjective principle generated by our intellects and of only\nregulative use to one that is objective, a real being not constructed\nin thought, but discovered through thought. Such, we may say, is the\nsource of error in Spinoza’s use of substance and in other\nmonistic metaphysics. Our construction of the ens realissimum\nhas the appearance of an actual unity since it is the concept of the\nsum total of all positive predicates. This appearance then casts an\nillusion unrecognized by the metaphysicians, leading them into the\nsubreptive error. \nAccording to the Ontological Argument, it is self-evident from the\nidea of the most real being that that being exists. Whatever it is\nthat is this most real being, it must include all predicates that\ncontribute to its greatness or reality; and given that actual\nexistence is (allegedly) one such predicate, whatever it is that is\nthe most real being is therefore a being who by definition must exist.\nHence, if one were to compare two beings, both equally great in all\nrespects except that one exists and one does not, the one that does\nnot exist, by virtue of its non-existence, is lacking a predicate that\ncontributes to the greatness of the other. The correct conception of\nthat than which nothing greater can be conceived must,\ntherefore, include existence. \nThe Critique of Pure Reason contains four distinct objections\nto the Ontological Argument. The first two of these follow what may be\nthought of as the standard assumption by the proponents of this\nargument that “God exists” is to be treated as an analytic\njudgment (A594/B622–A597/B625). Though rarely mentioned in the\nliterature, these arguments are salient to the common objection that\nKant’s critique of the Ontological Argument doesn’t impact\nthe Anselmian version (Plantinga 1966, Forgie 1975). \nThe second two objections arise as a result of the defeat of the\nanalytic rendering, and turn to a reading of “God exists”\nas synthetic (A597/B625–A602/B630). By far, the most famous of\nthese objections is that existence is not a predicate. What, however,\nKant means by “predicate” requires some examination. \nOf key significance here is Kant’s distinction between\n“logical” versus “real” predicates. The former\nis best understood as a syntactic notion: the second term, along with\nthe subject term, of a complete and well-formed proposition. A real\npredicate, by contrast, is distinguished by its semantic function. As\nKant describes it, a real predicate “goes beyond the concept of\nthe subject and enlarges it” (A598/B626). Hence, logical and\nreal predicates involve two different orders of analysis, one\nsyntactic, one semantic. They are neither mutually exclusive (Abaci\n2008), nor exhaustive (Pasternack 2018). They instead distinguish\nbetween two different roles that one and the same term can have. \nTo help Kant make his case that existence is not a real predicate,\ni.e., a predicate that “enlarges” the subject term, he\nappeals to the distinction between an actual and non-actual unit of\ncurrency, say one hundred dollars. Between the two, there is no\ndifference in the concepts of each: existence adds nothing to the\nconcept of one hundred dollars. So, when one claims that “one\nhundred dollars exist”, one is not picking out one of its\npredicates, part of the nature of a hundred dollars, but rather one is\njust “positing” (A598/B626) its existence. Likewise, to\nclaim that “God exists” is merely to posit God’s\nexistence. It is not a statement which attributes the property of\nexistence to the subject term, God. \nUnderlying this analysis is Kant’s contention that existence\ndoes not add anything to the subject concept; for it if did, then, he\ncontends, a hundred dollars actualized would be different from it as\nmerely possible: “my concept would not express the entire object\nand thus would not be the suitable concept for it” (A599/B627).\nThat is, the hundred dollars as possible would not be the same as what\nis actualized in the actual hundred dollars. \nThere are, unsurprisingly, many different interpretations as to what\nKant means when he claims that existence does not\n“enlarge” or add to the subject term. Let us here consider\nthree. \nThe first comes from James Van Cleve’s Problems from\nKant (1999), where he offers an analysis of real predication that\nrenders conceptual enlargement (i.e., a predicate that “goes\nbeyond” its subject) in terms of logical non-entailment. He\nwrites: \nA predicate P enlarges a concept \\(C =_{df} \\Diamond\n\\exists x (Cx \\amp {\\sim}Px)\\). \nIf C = triangle and P = red, P would be,\nfollowing this definition, a real predicate, since it is possible that\nthere exists an x which is a triangle and is not red. By\ncontrast, if P = three-sidedness, then we do not, by this\ndefinition, have a real predicate of C, since there are no\ntriangles that are not three-sided. In other words, where C =\ntriangle and P = three-sidedness, since \\(\\forall x (Cx \\supset\nPx)\\), P fails to meet the test for conceptual enlargement of\nC. Likewise, existence will fail to meet the definition above\nsince for any concept C, \\(\\exists x (Cx \\supset\n\\langle\\textrm{exists}\\rangle x)\\). That is, if there exists some\nx such that x is a C, then x exists.\nHence, Van Cleve treats existence as not an enlarging concept since,\nper his analysis, he is “letting the existential quantifier\nexpress existence” (Van Cleve 1999: 188). \nNick Stang follows Van Cleve in “letting the existential\nquantifier express existence” and further argues that Kant\nsubscribes to an “actualism” whereby there are no\nnon-existing objects (i.e., if unicorns do not exist,\n“unicorn” does not name an object, but rather references a\nstring of predicates). As such, Stang asserts that since\n“exists applies to every object, it does not\ndistinguish some objects from other objects” (Stang 2015: 599).\nNotice, however, that Stang’s rationale for why existence is not\na predicate is that it is actually a “predicate that applies to\nevery object there is”. That is, Stang interprets existence as\nan internal mark of our concept of objecthood itself (Stang 2015:\n599). \nA third recent analysis can be found in R. Lanier Anderson’s\nThe Poverty of Conceptual Thought (2015). Anderson seeks to\nshow that philosophers need to follow Kant’s treatment of\nexistence in order to preserve our contemporary use of modal terms.\nFor if our modal terms (existence, possibility, necessity) were\npredicates, then a change in modal terms would demand a change in the\ncontents of our concepts of objects. \nAccordingly, Anderson’s argument is intended to reflect\nKant’s conclusion from his hundred dollars example: “what\nwould exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my\nconcept” (A600/B628). More specifically, Anderson argues that if\nour modal terms were predicates, then the non-actual possible would\nhave as one of its marks, non-actual possibility; whereas the actual\nwould have existence as one of its marks. As a result, if one were to\nconsider the actualization of some non-actual possible P,\nP-actualized would no longer be the same P as\nthe P of P-non-actual possible. As Anderson\nexplains: \nthe supposition that <existence> would determine the concept of\na thing is incompatible with its logical function of a modal category,\nwhich is to separate the actual objects from the merely possible ones\nwithout altering the contents of the things’ concepts.\n(Anderson 2015: 322) \nKant further contends that the Cosmological Argument is parasitic on\nthe Ontological. He demonstrates this by taking Leibniz’s Modal\nArgument as emblematic of all other Cosmological Arguments and then\ncontends that a being posited as necessary in order to explain the\ncontingency of creation has built into it the same error as discussed\nabove. According to Leibniz’s Modal Argument, the existence of a\ncontingent reality can only be ultimately explained through a cause\nwhose existence is in itself necessary. However, something whose\nexistence is in itself necessary is something whose existence cannot\ndepend upon anything else but itself, its own nature. This returns us\nto the Ontological Argument, or at least the objectionable idea at its\nheart, for the necessary being that the Cosmological Argument proposes\nis also the idea of a being whose essence involves existence. So, as\nbefore, since existence is not a predicate, Kant rejects the coherence\nof the idea of a being whose existence depends upon nothing but its\nown nature. \nKant’s assessment of the Physico-Theological (Design) Argument\nis substantially different from his treatment of the other two classic\nproofs. While he still contends that it, like the Cosmological\nargument, remains ultimately grounded upon the Ontological\nArgument’s assumption that existence is a predicate, this\nobjection does not fully undo the force of the Physico-Theological\nArgument. Kant in fact expresses sympathy for this argument, writing,\nfor instance, that it “always deserves to be mentioned with\nrespect” (A623/B651) and that it is “the oldest, the\nclearest, and the most accordant with the common reason of\nmankind” (A623/B651). He further claims that the argument\nsucceeds in at least establishing “an\narchitect of the world” and a cause\n“proportioned” to the order of nature. So, up to this\npoint in the argument, he writes, “we have nothing to bring\nagainst the rationality and utility of this procedure, but have rather\nto commend it further” (A624/B652). What Kant cannot accept,\nhowever, is its advance from a “Wise Author of Nature” to\nan infinite creator. When it moves from architect to creator, it\nproposes an “original” and “supreme” cause,\nand in so doing, it calls for a being whose existence depends upon\nnothing but itself. This returns us to the Cosmological/Modal\nargument, and thus to its dependency on the Ontological. Despite,\nhowever, the failure of the argument to establish the existence of an\ninfinite creator, Kant does not abandon the relevance, particularly\nthe regulative relevance of the idea of a “Wise Author of\nNature” for the natural sciences, a point he repeats in both the\nAppendix to the Transcendental Dialectic and in the Canon of Pure\nReason. \nKant’s distinction between Deism and Theism is intertwined with\nhis distinction between Transcendental Theology and Natural Theology\n(A631/B659–A632/B660). The meaning of these terms, however, are\nnot what some have assumed (e.g., Wood 1991). \nIn his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion,\nKant defines “Transcendental Theology” as the\n“recognition [Kenntniss] of God by means of concepts of\npure reason” (AK 28:596 [1821]). These concepts are not,\nhowever, the pure concepts of the understanding, but rather what he\ncalls the four “classes of concepts” (B110): namely,\nquantity, quality, relation and modality. More precisely, Kant sees\nTranscendental Theology as a consequence of reason’s quest for\nthe unconditioned condition, with its concepts of God corresponding to\nthe unconditioned for each of the “classes of concepts”,\nnamely: ens summum (quality), ens entium (quantity),\nens originarium (modality), and ens realissimum\n(relation). \nAs Transcendental Theology employs no “information” about\nthe conditioned (i.e., the created world), it is without the resources\nneeded to develop a concept of God “in concreto”\n(AK 28:1020 [1817]). Absent the “materials for the concept of\nGod from empirical principles and empirical information” (AK\n28:1020 [1817]), Transcendental Theology can do no more than attribute\nto God “what is true of him as a thing in general” (AK\n28:1020 [1817]). That is, its concept of God is just that of\nunconditioned quality, quantity, modality, and relation. \nAbsent all “information” about the conditioned,\nTranscendental Theology is thus without the resources to develop the\nconcept of God used in either Natural or Moral Theology, i.e, the\n“wise author of nature” or the judge and\n“ruler” of nature, respectively (AK 28:452 [1968], AK\n28:596 [1821], AK 28:1002 [1817]). Consequently, Kant claims that\nTranscendental Theology is inadequate, yielding “only a\nsilhouette of a theology” (AK 28:605, AK 28:452 [1968]). Its\nconception of God is “useless” (AK 28:596 [1821]),\n“unusable” (AK 28:452 [1968]), and “quite\nsuperfluous to us” (AK 28:1020 [1817]). For it provides us only\nwith the god of Deism, and according to the lectures, this God is\n“useless” and “unusable”. \nHence, despite the familiar-seeming term, Kant does not mean by\n“Deism” how it was typically used by the British. Their\nDeism is rather much more akin to what Kant means by\n“Theism”, as the outcome of Natural (vs. Transcendental)\nTheology. That is, Kant maintains in the Critique of Pure\nReason that our picture of nature as having systematic unity\ncommits us to seeing nature “as if” it were created by a\n“Wise Author” (A644/B672–A645/B673). \nThis is not, however, a new twist on the Argument from Design. While\nKant turns to Theism to explain how we make the ground of the natural\norder “comprehensible” (AK 6:65n [1793]) to ourselves,\nthis is not a proof for God’s existence but rather an appeal to\nthe idea of a Wise Author varyingly described as\n“symbolic” (AK 4:437 [1785b]), “heuristic”\n(A671/B699), a “focus imaginarius” (A645/B673),\nor a supposition to be taken \nonly problematically [vs assertorically] … so as to regard all\nthe connection of things in the world of sense as if they had their\nground in this being of reason. (A681/B709) \nIt is nonetheless a supposition that (at least from the later 1770\nthrough most of the 1780s) Kant believes we cannot do without.\n“[W]e must presuppose such a being” (A697/B725), for in\nits absence, reason would be at odds with itself, at once intending a\nsystematic unity to nature and at the same time without a principle to\nground that systematicity. \nLastly, note that despite Allen Wood’s claim in\n“Kant’s Deism” that Kant’s account of Deism is\ndisconnected from the “common seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century usage” and thus is\n“idiosyncratic” (Wood 1991), Wood has mistaken the more\nfamiliar British use of the term with how the term was used by German\nRationalism. For example, Wolff, in his Theologia Naturalis\nhighlights the areas of agreement between Deism and atheism, arguing\nthat Deism can easily devolve into a “practical atheism”.\n(Theologia Naturalis, §547). Baumgarten as well, in the\nMetaphysica, the textbook that Kant used in his courses on\nMetaphysics and Natural Theology, follows Wolff in this, describing\nDeism as “the doctrine [which] maintains that almost nothing is\nconceivable about God, except perhaps his existence”\n(§862). Hence, however idiosyncratic this use of\n“Deism” may seem to the modern reader, it would not have\nbeen so for Kant’s contemporary audience. In short, Kant uses\n“Deism” in a manner reflective of Wolff and\nBaumgarten’s approach rather than how the British employed\nit. \nDespite Kant’s explicit claim that one of the underlying drivers\nof Transcendental Idealism is to defend faith against theoretical\nreason, it is widely believed that his philosophical system powerfully\nchallenges, if not outright bars, religious belief. His criticisms of\nthe traditional arguments for God’s existence are taken as\nillustrative of his opposition to religion, and the so-called\n“Restriction Thesis” of Transcendental Idealism is\nregarded as a barrier against all legitimate religious assent\n(Wolterstorff 1998, Rawls 2000, DiCenso 2012). \nAccording to Kant, we can have no knowledge of anything outside of\nexperience, outside the scope of the spatio-temporal-causal order.\nHence, there can be no knowledge of God, of the soul, of the\nafterlife, or anything else beyond that order. To compound this\nrestriction, Kant further asserts that we also can have no\n“cognition” [Erkenntnis] of objects outside the\nscope of experience. While the former is less ambiguous, the latter\nhas generated more debate, hanging very much on what it is to have a\n“cognition” (e.g., Watkins & Willaschek 2017, Chignell\n2017). \nMany have taken “cognition” to be a semantic notion, and\nso have taken Kant’s denial of the cognizability of the\nsupersensible as a denial of even the intelligibility of religious\nconcepts. Thus, it is not merely that we cannot prove whether or not\nGod exists, but the concept of God itself, like all other concepts of\nsupersensible entities and properties, (allegedly) cannot even have\nmeaning for us. \nThe former position, that we can have no knowledge of the\nsupersensible, is textually well supported. Knowledge\n[Wissen], for Kant, follows its traditional tripartite model\nas justified-true-belief, and if there is neither experience nor\nrational proof of any supersensible claim, no such claim can meet with\nsuitable justification. \nThe latter position, that we can have no cognition of supersensible\nobjects, is likewise correct. However, the alleged implication that\nthis makes meaningful thought about them impossible is false. Kant\ndoes not reject the thinkability of the supersensible, and, in fact,\nthe body of arguments in the Transcendental Dialectic show this to be\nclearly the case. If, for example, propositions about the\nsupersensible were incoherent according to Kant, then he would not\nneed his Antinomies or Paralogisms. Rather, he could sweep them all\naway quite simply through the charge that they fall short of the\nconditions for meaning. \nThe problem, thus, is not that we cannot coherently think the\nsupersensible. It is, rather, that we can think about it in too many\nways. Absent experience, reason is without a touchstone through which\nhypotheses can be refuted. Instead, so long as the ideas of reason are\ninternally consistent, it can construct a multitude of theses and\nantitheses about the supersensible. It can, moreover, argue quite\nrobustly in favor of each, something we see both in the Antinomies and\nall the more grandly in the great tomes of the metaphysicians. The\nproblem, for Kant, is thus not about meaning, but rather it is\nepistemic: having no possible experience of the supersensible, we lack\nthe theoretical resources to adjudicate between competing claims.\nAccordingly, to cognize, for Kant, is to think an object or\nproposition in relation to the order of nature and the material\nconditions that govern whether or not it obtains—what Kant calls\nthe cognition’s “real possibility”. The conditions\nfor real possibility, in turn, provide the investigational framework\nthrough which we can verify or falsify what is being cognized. \n“Cognition”, thus, is not a semantic notion, but\nepistemic. It is a mode of thinking that is not just fanciful\nimagining but is directed to objects whose reality can be determined.\nThinking requires merely the logical possibility of what is being\nentertained. So long as it is not self-contradictory, it can be\nthought. Cognition, by contrast, embeds the thought in the material\nconditions for, or the Real Possibility of, the object of thought,\nsomething that is not possible once one steps beyond the scope of\npossible experience. \nHence, we cannot have a cognition of God because, as Kant argues in\nthe Transcendental Dialectic’s Ideal of Reason, there is no\nviable argument for God’s existence. Likewise, we cannot prove\nor disprove a miracle, for its alleged supersensible cause is not\nsomething whose conditions are determinable for us. Even if we\nexperience some event whose cause is supersensible, we have no way\nwhatsoever to establish that this is so, and have nothing to guide our\nhypotheses about how to test for miracles or how they come to be. \nNone of this challenges the intelligibility of religious doctrines. So\nlong as they are not self-contradictory, they are thinkable. It is\njust that their truth or falsehood cannot possibly be known. Moreover,\nsince they are not within the spectrum of epistemic evaluation, we\ncannot opine regarding them, for opinion [Meinung], as Kant\nunderstands the term, is a mode of assent based upon the weighing of\ntheoretical grounds (evidence and argument) for and against truth. \nYet, this does not leave us with agnosticism either. Along with\nknowledge and opinion, Kant identifies faith as our third legitimate\nmode of holding-to-be-true [Fürwahrhalten]. Faith is,\nfor Kant, a mode of justified assent, though the nature of its\njustification is quite different from opinion and knowledge. It is not\nrooted in experience or argument, but rather in what he characterizes\nas the “needs” of practical reason. Hence, for Kant,\nreligious belief finds its proper seat not in intellectual reflection\nbut in our practical lives. \nMoreover, Kant sees faith, unlike knowledge, as engaging with our\nwill, calling it a “free assent”. This is important for\nthe practical function of faith, since our commitment to morality does\nnot so simply depend on our affirmation of the postulates, but in our\nfree act of faith through which we more completely bind ourselves to\nmorality. Morality, thus “inevitably leads to religion”\n(AK 6:6 [1793]), since we need the latter in order to sustain or fully\nrealize our commitment to the former. This, however, must not be\ninterpreted as “theological ethics”, as if the authority\nof the moral law depended upon God. It is not its authority that is in\nquestion (perhaps with the exception of the argument at AK 5:114 in\nthe Critique of Practical Reason [1788]). Rather, this\nadvance from morality to religion concerns how we bind ourselves to\nthe former (cf. A632/B660, AK 5:481 [1788], AK 6:3 [1793]). \nAlthough Kant’s presentation of faith as legitimate mode of\n“holding-to-be-true”, is consistently maintained through\nthe Critical period’s published corpus, some Kantians have opted\nto develop interpretations which dismiss or overlook such discussions.\nWe will here briefly compare four different stances on religious\nassent in Kant. \nSome scholars hold that we should mostly ignore what Kant has to say\nabout the postulates, and, consequently, the positive part of his\nreligious philosophy. This is either because the postulates are taken\nas hold-overs from Kant’s pre-Critical period that are\nincompatible with his Critical philosophy (Allison 1990), or because\nthe philosophical reasoning involving them is so bad as to be\nirrelevant to what makes Kant an important philosopher (Rawls 2000).\nRegardless of whether the postulates are a hold-over or simply poorly\nsupported, the result is the same: for scholars who take this view, it\nis not important to have a detailed understanding of the attitudes\ninvolved in postulation, as they aren’t key to understanding\nwhat is valuable about Kant’s philosophy. \nA second position that may be understood as an attempt to reconcile\nTranscendental Idealism with Kant’s philosophy of religion is to\nreplace what he says about assent with a non-doxic attitude where\nreligious concepts, rather than objects of belief, are instead taken\nas regulative ideals or representations of moral principles\n(Davidovich 1993, Henrich 1999, DiCenso 2012). While there are many\npassages in the Critical period where Kant promotes assent, this is a\nview in line with some fasciles of the Opus Postumum. Guyer\n(2005), for example, maintains that rather than the Opus\nPostumum reflecting a break from Kant’s Critical stance on\nreligious assent, it instead finally brings the true character of his\nposition to light. \nThe most widespread view in recent scholarship is one that corresponds\nwith the works of Stevenson (2003), Chignell (2007), and Pasternack\n(2011). It also has earlier adherents including Beck (1960) and Wood\n(1970). Although there are interpretative differences among these\nfigures, there is a shared recognition that Kant does regard actual\nassent (holding-to-be-true) as having its ground in our moral\ninterests, as driven by a “need” or the\n“needs” of practical reason. \nWood (1970), for example, bases his view upon the “Absurdum\nPracticum” argument where Kant states that anyone who\nrenounces the postulates would become “contemptible” in\ntheir own eyes (A828/B856, AK 28:1083 [1817]). Chignell and Pasternack\ndevelop their interpretations primarily by way of an analysis of texts\nwhere Kant discusses the relationship between belief, knowledge and\nopinion. What is emphasized among these interpreters is the moral\nsignificance of religious assent rather than ontological commitment.\nSuch may be taken as the spirit of Kant’s comment that “I\nmust not even say ‘It is morally certain that there is a\nGod’, but rather ‘I am morally certain’”\n(A829/B857). \nNote that while there are a considerable number of texts where Kant\nendorses the need for religious assent, we may nevertheless\ndistinguish between a number of positions. One holds that the adoption\nof a belief-state that is more akin to the symbolic use of the\npostulates, adopting them only in the form of an “as if”,\nwithout a commitment to their objective reality (Ferreira 2014). The\nmost famous indication of the “as if” attitude appears at\n4:448. Another position (Pasternack 2011, Insole 2016) is that Kant\nregarded faith as including a commitment to the objective reality of\nits objects. Passages in support of this view include AK 5:4 &\n5:134 [1788], AK 5:456 & 5:469 [1790], AK 8:139 [1785a], AK\n20:299. Note further that the spirit behind the “as if”\nattitude may be reemerging in a new form within the recent interest in\nKant’s conception of moral hope. \nIn the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant writes\nthat \nall interest of my reason (the speculative as well as the practical)\nis united in the following three questions: 1. What can I know? 2.\nWhat should I do? 3. What may I hope. \nKant then goes on to explain that hope is \nsimultaneously practical and theoretical, so that the practical leads\nlike a clue to a reply to the theoretical question and, in its highest\nform, the speculative question. \nKant further describes hope in relation to our interest in happiness\n(A805/B833). The latter point perhaps connects more specifically with\nhow Kant frames the highest good in the Critique of Pure\nReason versus later work. Nevertheless, despite how Kant\nhighlights the question of hope in this text, it does not receive the\nsame level of exposition as knowledge, opinion or faith. For further\ndiscussion of Kant on hope, see the section on Kant in the  entry on\n hope. \nKant’s doctrine of the highest good is the foundation of his\npositive philosophy of religion. With the exception of some musings\n(esp. in the Critique of Pure Reason) about an assent driven\nby our regulative employment of purposiveness (cf. B426, A670/B698 and\nA826/B854), the path to religion is through the highest good. It is\nthrough this doctrine that Kant endorses belief in God’s\nexistence as well as the immortality of the soul. It is also through\nthis doctrine that Kant sets out what in the Religion he\ncalls the Pure Rational System of Religion. Therein, Kant appraises\nChristian doctrines to determine whether or not they are conducive to\nour duty to pursue the highest good (see\n section 3.6.4\n and\n section 3.7\n below). \nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant distinguishes\nbetween the “supreme”, the “complete”, and\n“highest” good. By “supreme good”, he means\nthe good that is “not subordinate to any other” (AK 5:110\n[1788]). That is, if there are a plurality of values, the supreme good\nis the one that overrides the rest. Hence, if pleasure were taken as a\nvalue, its value would be subordinate to morality, and thus its value\nwould be defeated or overridden if the pleasure comes through a\nviolation of the moral law. \nThe “complete good” is one that “is not part of a\nstill greater whole of the same kind” (AK 5:110 [1788). Kant\nthen explains that while morality is the supreme good, it is not the\ncomplete good “as the object of the faculty of desire of\nrational finite beings” (AK 5:110). This is because in addition\nto morality, finite rational beings also desire happiness. So,\nalthough happiness is subordinate to morality, morality is not the\n“complete good” because it does not encompass all that we\ndesire. \nKant then presents the highest good as a synthesis of morality and\nhappiness in order to meet the axiological principles of supremacy and\ncompleteness. More specifically, he presents the highest good as an\nideal state of affairs in which there is a proportional distribution\nof happiness in accordance with moral worth (A809/B837, AK 5:110 &\n5:145 [1788]; AK 5:471 [1790]; AK 6:8n & 6:99 [1793]; AK 8:139\n[1785a]; AK 8:281 [1764]). Nevertheless, some interpreters have\nproposed that Kant withdrew this formulation in later years,\nsupporting instead the notion that the highest good reflects the idea\nof maximal happiness and maximal morality as two independent variables\n(Reath 1988, Guyer 2011, Moran 2012). However, Pasternack (2017a)\nargues at length that the corpus neither supports this nor the\nputative abandonment of one or both of the postulates of God and\nimmortality (see\n section 3.5.2\n below). \nAlthough Kant enumerates three postulates, freedom, God, and\nimmortality, their etiologies differ. In contrast to the latter two,\nthe postulate of freedom is more directly tied to the fact of reason,\ntaken as a necessary condition for the bindingness of the moral law\nupon us. By contrast, the postulates of God and Immortality are rooted\nin the highest good. As such, we will here only be concerned with the\nlatter two “religious” postulates. \nWhile the Critique of Pure Reason shows some sympathy for the\nArgument from Design, Kant remarks that it can only get us to a\n“Wise Author of Nature”, a being who is responsible for\nthe order of nature, rather than a creator, a being with infinite\ncapacities, or a moral being. By contrast, the Canon of the First\nCritique advances a conception of God as omnipotent,\nomniscient, and omnibenevolent. Hence, as there argued, in order for\nthe highest good to obtain, there must be a being capable of arranging\nthe world such that happiness is exactly proportioned to moral worth.\nThis being must further have the cognitive powers necessary to judge\nor moral worth, and, presumably, a will aligned with morality. \nKant explains that our construction of the classic conception of God\nas omnipotent, omniscient and all good gains its validity through the\nneed for this being as the agent responsible for the distribution of\nhappiness in proportion to moral worth (A816/B845–A819/B847). It\nis through morality and the highest good that we “produced a\nconcept of the divine being that we now hold to be correct”\n(A818/B846). Likewise, “What does it Mean to Orient Oneself in\nThinking”, Kant explains that the very “concept\nof God and even the conviction of his existence” arises\nthrough our practical needs and that these needs operate as the\n“signpost or compass by means of which the speculative thinker\norients himself in his rational excursions into the field of\nsupersensible objects” (AK 8:142 [1785a]). In other words, while\ntheoretical reason on its own ventures into this field without any\nvalid warrants, the needs of practical reason, from which we form both\nour concepts of the postulates and the basis for our assent, is, Kant\nmaintains, the sole basis by which we may extend our cognition (i.e.,\nvalid construction of concepts) into the supersensible. \nThe postulate of immortality is typically found alongside Kant’s\ndiscussions of the postulate of God. He regards both as necessary\nconditions for the realization of the highest good, though the\nfunction of this postulate undergoes a number of revisions through the\nCritical period. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant presents two distinct\narguments for it. The first is a non-moral argument and is found in\nthe B-Paralogism, after his rejection of Mendelssohn’s argument\nfor the same. Mendelssohn’s argument builds off the thesis that\nthe soul is a simple entity and cessation of existence involves a\ndissolution of one part and then another. He thus concludes that since\nthe soul is simple, it is impossible for it to cease to exist. Kant\nrejects this argument on the grounds that even simple beings can have\na degree of reality (an intensive magnitude) that can diminish to\nzero, he shortly thereafter presents his own argument for the\nsoul’s immortality, one that has a similar metaphysical bent:\n(a) since throughout nature there is a proportionality between\npurposes and the conditions for the realization of those purposes,\nthere should be a similar proportionality between our capacities and\nthe conditions for their realization, and (b) since the grandeur of\nour capacities, including both our natural talents and moral vocation,\nexceeds what can be realized in this life, it follows (c) that we are\njustified in affirming a “future life”. This argument, or\none very similar to it, is also present in the Canon’s\ndiscussion of “doctrinal belief” [doctrinale\nGlaube]. However, this is not an argument that endures beyond the\n1780s. It is absent in later works, and in the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant explicitly dismisses it along with all other\nnon-moral arguments for the afterlife (cf. AK 5:460 & 5:468\n[1790]). \nThe other and better known argument for this postulate is first found\nin the Critique of Pure Reason’s Canon. Like his\nargument for the postulate of God, Kant also argues that we must\npostulate the immortality of the soul as a necessary condition for the\ndistribution of happiness in the highest good. Given the exigencies of\nthe natural order, this distribution cannot be secured within this\norder. We must therefore posit a “future life”, a\n“Kingdom of Grace” where “every happiness awaits us\nas long as we do not ourselves limit our share of it through the\nunworthiness to be happy” (A812/B840). Hence, in the First\nCritique, the purpose of the afterlife is to provide a domain\nfor the highest good’s distribution of happiness. \nBefore moving forward, let us discuss the belief found in some\nquarters (Reath 1989, Rawls 2000, Guyer 2005) that Kant abandoned the\npostulate of immortality in the 1790s. \nThe most common claim used to support this assertion is that\nKant’s uses the phrase “highest good in the world”\n(AK 5:450 [1790]) in the Critique of Judgment in order to\nsignal a shift away from an afterlife ideal distribution of happiness\nin proportion to moral worth to the ideal of the highest good as\nconnected with our ordinary corporeal existence. What, however, Kant\nmeans by “in the world” requires some investigation before\nany such conclusions can be drawn. \nFirst, Kant directly discusses what he intends by “world”\nin the Critique of Pure Reason where he explains to readers\nthat he will be using “nature” to refer to “the\nunity in the existence of appearances” (A419/B447) versus\n“world”, which has a “transcendental sense”,\nsuch that when dealing with cosmological ideas, “world”\ngoes beyond just the phenomenal to the “sum total of existing\nthings” (A419/B447). \nSecond, we see “world” used in this manner throughout the\ncorpus, including passages where it is quite clear that Kant uses\n“world” in its “transcendental sense”,\nextending beyond just the realm of nature (e.g., A811/B839, A813/B839,\nAK 5:143 [1788], AK 8:139 [1785a], 20:298. In fact, Kant even\ndescribes the postulate of immortality as obtaining “in the\nworld” at the opening of his discussion of this postulate in the\nCritique of Practical Reason (AK 5:122—see also 5:143\n[1788]). \nThird, the highest good is linked with the immortality of the soul\ncontinually through the texts of the 1790s, including the Critique of\nJudgment, where it can be found more than a dozen times through its\nfinal section. It is mentioned briefly in the “Theodicy”\nessay of 1791 (AK 8:262 & 8:269n), in multiple passages throughout\nthe Religion, in “The End of All Things” (AK\n8:328–330 [1794]) in the Conflict of the Faculties (AK\n7:40, 7:44, etc. [1798]), the 1796 “Proclamation” Essay\n(AK 8:418–419), as well as in “Real Progress” (AK\n20:298). Accordingly, despite the stature of those who put forward the\nclaim that Kant abandoned the postulate of immortality circa 1790, it\nis a claim that does not attend to either how Kant uses\n“world” versus “nature”, nor the surfeit of\naffirmative discussions about the afterlife through the 1790s. \nFourth, supporters of the abandonment thesis assert that Kant no\nlonger needs the postulate of immorality (and perhaps God) because in\nthe 1790s he further abandons his earlier picture of the highest good\nas a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral worth, adopting\ninstead the idea that this ideal is composed of maximal happiness and\nmaximal morality as two independent variables. The basis for this\nclaim is his 1793 essay “On the Common Saying: ‘That may\nbe Correct in Theory, but it is of no use in Practice’”\nwhere Kant describes the highest good as “universal happiness\ncombined with and in conformity with the purest morality throughout\nthe world” (AK 8:279). Yet the interpretative merits of this\nclaim built upon this passage are greatly diminished once one attends\nto the footnote Kant attaches to it, where he explains that he does\nnot mean happiness on its own, “but only of a proportion between\nit and the worthiness of a subject” (AK 8:280n). \nThe abandonment thesis is further defended by Guyer (2016) where in\naddition to building his case for this thesis based upon the\naforementioned depiction of the highest good at AK 8:279, he also\nargues that in the Religion Kant has given up the Second\nCritique’s rationale for the postulate of immortality,\nnamely, immortality as required for the sake of an eternal striving\nfor perfection. Rather than being tied to (striving for) perfection,\nwe find in the Religion that our moral worthiness is instead\ntied to our supreme maxim or “change of heart”. \nThat is, Guyer proposes that the standard for moral worthiness offered\nby Kant in the Religion no longer itself requires the\npostulation of immortality. This is a view likewise advanced by\nPasternack (2014: 142–146) in his discussion of the\n“change of heart” in the Religion. Unlike what is\nfound in the Second Critique, in both the Religion\nand “The End of All Things” (1794), Kant presents our\nafterlife fate as solely dependent upon (or should be viewed as solely\ndependent upon) what we can morally achieve in this life (AK\n6:69n–71n [1793], AK 8:328–330 [1794]). Hence, once our\nmoral worthiness is understood as something to be achieved in this\nlife, how one interprets Kant’s commitment to the postulate\ncentrally turns on how one interprets his views on the distribution of\nhappiness within the highest good. \nAs discussed through this subsection, Kant’s views on the\npostulate of immortality through the Critical period involve these\nthree core issues: (a) the standard for moral worth articulated by\nKant in various texts; (b) whether Kant continues to regard the\nhighest good as a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral\nworth versus as maximal happiness and maximal morality as two\nindependent variables; and (c) whether or not the distribution of\nhappiness (especially if taken as proportionate to moral worth)\ndepends upon the postulate of immortality (i.e., cannot take place\nwithin the causal order of nature). Beyond these three core issues,\nfurther issues include: (d) the limitations to and relevance of our\nspeculations about the nature of the afterlife (see AK\n6:69n–6:71n [1793] and AK 8:328–332 [1794]) and (e) the\nhistorical backdrop for Kant’s engagement with various models of\nthe afterlife (see Bunch 2010). \nIn October 1794, Kant received a royal rescript from the court of\nFrederick William II reprimanding him for his heterodox writings on\nChristianity and prohibiting him from further publication which\n“distort and disparage” Christianity (cf. AK 7:6\n[1798]). In his official response (unknown date, but late October 1794\nis most likely), Kant agreed to “hereafter refrain altogether\nfrom discoursing publicly, in lectures or writing, on religion,”\nbut also protested that his writings nevertheless have made\n“no appraisal of Christianity” (AK 7:8\n[1798]). \nPutting aside the question as to whether Kant might have prevaricated\nin his response, the question remains: to what extent does Kant engage\nwith Christian doctrine and to what extent is his philosophical\ntheology compatible with it? On the one hand, there are\nepistemological questions which we have addressed elsewhere in this\nentry. But there is also the question of whether or not Kant saw his\nwork as compatible or at odds with such core Christian doctrines as\nOriginal Sin, Grace, the Incarnation, and Vicarious Atonement. We will\nhere consider four interpretative positions. \nSome interpreters have claimed that the Religion serves as\nKant’s philosophical defense of traditional Christian doctrines,\nand that it succeeds in this regard. This is a view advanced by Chris\nFirestone and Nathan Jacobs in their In Defense of Kant’s\nReligion. For example, these authors hold that Kant’s\nportrayal of moral evil in Part One is shaped by an “Augustinian\nmetaphysic” (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), that in Part Two\nKant promotes the idea of the Incarnation, utilizing a\n“Scotistic understanding of divine being” (Firestone &\nJacobs 2008: 161) and that Part Four not only concludes with an\nargument for the “priority of belief in Christianity” but\ndefends the necessity of special revelation which, as they earlier\nclaim, is necessary for Kant’s critical philosophy as a whole\n(Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 115). \nA similar position is advanced by Stephen Palmquist who finds in the\nReligion not only an examination of those aspects of rational\nreligion which conform with Christian doctrine, but also a\nphilosophical defense of the need for revelation. Palmquist claims,\nfor example, that Religion’s treatment of Original Sin\nis used by Kant to articulate “what we might call a Christ-sized\n‘hole’ in the heart of humanity’s rational\ncapacity” (Palmquist 2016: 165), that Kant “regarded the\nChristian Gospel as a genuine revelation” (Palmquist 2016: 166)\nand that an otherwise deficient “bare reason” requires\nrevelatory content in order that we may “believe” in our\nown capacity to imitate the “archetype of perfection”\n(Palmquist 2016: 166). That is, Palmquist contends that, in line with\ntraditional Christianity, Kant regards our salvation as dependent upon\nhaving faith in the historical reality of the Incarnation. \nA second school of interpretation likewise maintains that Kant wrote\nthe Religion for the purposes of offering a philosophical\ndefense of traditional Christian doctrines. This school, however,\nholds that he was ultimately unsuccessful. This is a view which\nprincipally flows from Karl Barth’s 1947 Die protestantische\nTheologie im 19. Jahrhundert, and is adopted by a group of later\nphilosophers of religion including members of the school of\n“Reformed Epistemology”, including Philip Quinn, Nicholas\nWolterstorff and John Hare. \nWithin Kant circles, they are best known for the so-called\n“Conundrum” interpretation of Kant’s\nReligion, where these authors protest that Kant’s\nventure into philosophical theology is not only inconsistent with the\nepistemic strictures of Transcendental Idealism (Wolterstorff 1998),\nbut also is internally inconsistent in virtue of the fact that its\nunderstanding of Original Sin is essentially Augustinian while its\nunderstanding of moral restoration is Pelagian. Wolterstorff goes so\nfar as to claim that Kant’s philosophical theology suffers from\n“not just implausibility or tension, but internal\ncontradiction” (Wolterstorff 1991: 49). Likewise, John Hare\n(1996) declares it an outright “failure” and Gordon\nMichalson (1990) contends that the Religion contains a litany\nof “wobbles” between incompatible Christian and\nEnlightenment commitments. \nAlthough there are a number of other targets of criticism, their main\ncontention is that Kant inconsistently accepts (a) the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin which holds that our moral capacities have\nthrough the Fall been damaged in such a way that we are incapable of\nmoral improvement without Sanctifying Grace; and yet (b) Kant\nsubscribes to what they call his “Stoic Maxim” that\n“a person’s moral worth is determined entirely by that\nperson himself” (Wolterstorff 1991: 48). Recently, Andrew\nChignell has accepted the essence of the “Conundrum”\nobjection, relying upon it as a reason why Kant must appeal to hope:\nsince Kant’s alleged “Stoic Maxim” leaves no room\nfor divine aid, and yet divine aid seems to be needed, it can be (at\nbest) an object of hope, since unlike other propositional attitudes,\nhope is rationally permissible in the face of a (seeming)\nimpossibility so long as it does not rise to an impossibility of\n“the most fundamental modal level” (Chignell 2014:\n114–115). \nA third school holds that despite appearances to the contrary, the\nReligion does not engage in “theological speculation\nconcerning the doctrine of grace in any form” (DiCenso 2012:\n117). This view is advanced by James DiCenso in his 2012 commentary on\nthe Religion, and more recently by Allen Wood in his Kant\nand Religion (2020). The former’s 2012 commentary\nadvises that we avoid any literal reading of religious doctrines in\nthe text, and that we should instead interpret Kant’s treatment\nof them as presenting no more than our moral ideals in\n“imaginatively enhanced or pictorial form” (2012:\n28).  Likewise, in the latter’s Kant and\nReligion (2020), the author presents\nthe Religion as a study of how we can understand\nChristianity’s presentation of a “second-person relationship\nbetween myself and God” (Wood 2020: 137) as instead symbols\nfor a first-person “self-relation” (Wood 2020: 137,\n143) through which we gain “a meaningful and\nemotionally enriched way of relating to our own past” (Wood\n2020: 145). Interestingly, these interpretations\ncohere with certain interpretations of Kant’s philosophical\ntheology in the Opus Postumum (see Section 4 below), with\nboth extending not only the thesis that God, for Kant, is nothing but\na symbol of our moral ideals, but that all religious doctrines\ninvolving the supersensible should likewise be interpreted as\nsuch. \nFurther, both interpretations pick up on a number of comments in\nthe Religion where Kant associates the historical side of\nreligion with our need for symbols to help us with the “highest\nconcepts and grounds of reason” (AK 6:109 [1793]) and hopes for\na future time where we will no longer need “all statutes that\nrest on history” (AK 6:121 [1793]). Nevertheless, this aspect\nof Kant’s treatment of religion does not apply to the\npostulates, nor does it pertain to the underlying moral/theological\nissues which are symbolized in specific doctrines (e.g., our innate\npropensity to evil as represented in the story of Genesis, or our hope\nfor divine as represented in the Crucifixion). \nWhat principally differentiates DiCenso (2012) and Wood (2020),\nhowever, is that the former’s hermeneutic denies outright that Kant\never engages with any doctrine in its literal form, whereas the latter\nsees the core goal of the Religion to “interpret\nrevealed Christianity in such a way … [to] show that reason and\nChristianity are allies, not enemies” (Wood 2020: 20). But in\norder to realize that goal, doctrines have to be rendered as just\nsymbols. So, while Wood recognizes that Kant rejects various doctrines\n(e.g. the story of Abraham and Isaac on Wood 2020: 14; and the\ninheritability of sin on Wood 2020: 62), such rejections occur only\nwhen doctrines are understood literally.  Accordingly, Wood would have\nus look past Kant’s engagements with literal doctrines and take Kant\nas claiming that they need to be understood just as symbols. This\nwould then allow for the thesis that “everything in revealed\n(Christian) faith is compatible with rational faith” (Wood 2020:\n20), which Wood asserts is the aim of the so-called “Second\nExperiment” of the\nReligion, i.e. the goal of the Second Experiment is\nto “disprove the hypothesis... [that] there are parts\nof revealed Christianity that are demonstrably and permanently\nincompatible with rational religion” (Wood 2020: 20).  \nA fourth interpretative position is that the aim of Religion\nis to (a) examine the scope of “unity” or\n“compatibility” between rational religion and historical\nfaith and (b) evaluate which aspects of historical faith (with\nChristianity being the primary focus) are apt vehicles for rational\nreligion versus those which are incompatible with it (Pasternack\n2014). Hence, the Religion was not written as a Christian\napologetic, but rather is Kant’s inquiry into the relationship\nbetween natural theology and revealed religion. However, unlike the\nmany other such inquiries written during the era, Kant’s own\nversion of natural theology is one that shaped by moral rather than\ntheoretical reason. \nBy way of this interpretative framework, Pasternack (2014) maintains\nthat the Religion is both compatible with the epistemic\nstrictures of Transcendental Idealism (contrary the interpretations\nsummarized above) as well as internally consistent. As for the\ndiscussions where Kant appears to be guided by an “Augustinian\nmetaphysic” (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), “firmly\nensconced within the Augustinian tradition” (Quinn 1988: 91) or\n“accommodating” (Wood 1970: 246) tenets “fundamental\nto Augustine” (Beiser 2006: 594), he is rather examining such\ntenets in order to determine whether or not they have\n“unity” or “compatibility” with rational\nreligion. Such doctrines as Original Sin, Grace, the Incarnation,\nVicarious Atonement and so forth are thus examined by Kant in the\nReligion in order to, in each case, assess whether or not\nthey cohere with his moral anthropology and doctrine of the highest\ngood. \nUntil the recent spate of commentaries on the Religion,\nlittle work has been done on its overall aims and structure. Although\nPart One of the text has long been mined for insights into\nKant’s picture of the moral agency, such studies did not\nconsider how the overall text might inform the passages minded\ntherefrom. The last decade, however, has seen the publication of a\nnumber of commentaries on the Religion, each with their own\ndistinctive interpretations (Firestone & Jacobs 2008, DiCenso\n2012, Pasternack 2014, Miller 2015, Palmquist 2016), most of whose\nauthors are mentioned in this entry. The above section also provides a\nbrief overview of their respective positions with regards to the\nrelationship between Kant’s Religion and core Christian\ndoctrines. In this section, we will briefly review what Kant himself\nsays about his project and how it unfolds through its four parts. \nTo begin, the publication of the Religion (1793) has a\ncomplicated history. Kant initially planned to write a series of\nessays on Christian doctrines, but that was frustrated when the second\nof these essays was denied official imprimatur. Because the Prussian\nCensorship Commission had different rules for the publication of\narticles versus books, Kant chose to combine the planned essays into a\nsingle volume, and to avoid further scrutiny by the Commission, he\nmade sure that it was assessed as a work of philosophy rather than\ntheology. Although such maneuvers ultimately led to his censorship\nduring the reign of Frederick William II, Kant nevertheless was able\nto publish the Religion, whose First Preface includes, after\nan initial discussion of how through the highest good “morality\nleads inevitably to religion” (AK 6:8n), a defense of his\nrationale for treating the work as one of philosophical theology\nrather than “biblical theology” (AK 6:7–6:11). The\nPreface then ends with Kant’s characterization of the\nReligion as an “attempt” or\n“experiment” (Versuch) at determining the scope\nof overlap between the “pure philosophical doctrine of\nreligion” (AK 6:10) and the contents of historical faith\n(especially Christianity). \nThe Preface to the second edition begins with a discussion of the\nReligion’s title, which as Kant explains, is meant to\ndepict two overlapping domains, the “wider sphere of\nfaith” and the “narrower” sphere of the “pure\nreligion of reason” (AK 6:12). Kant then writes that\nfrom “this standpoint I can also make this second\nexperiment” (zweiten Versuch), without, however,\nexplicitly enumerating a “first experiment”. \nSome have proposed (Hare 1996, Reardon 1988) that the unstated\n“first experiment” pertains to the domain of overlap\nbetween Biblical Theology and the Pure Rational System of Religion.\nThe Second Experiment then seeks \nto show that certain items in the outer circle lead back within the\ninner circle when looked at in the light of, or translated in terms of\nmoral concepts. (Hare 1996: 40) \nOthers have proposed that the First Experiment pertains to the\nReligion’s “transcendental elements” while\nthe Second Experiment “aims at assessing one particular\nempirical religion”, namely Christianity (Palmquist 2000: 143),\nor serves as a philosophical apologetic for Christianity (Firestone\n& Jacobs 2008). \nPasternack (2017b), however, argues that the interpretative debate\nover the first/second experiment distinction rests on a simple\nmistake. Normally, Versuch would be translated as\n“attempt”, but early Anglophone translators of the\nReligion chose instead “experiment”. That choice\nhas passed along through contemporary translations and has led\ninterpreters to make far too much of this passage. The passage appears\ntowards the opening of the Preface to the second edition of\nthe Religion and is, as argued by Pasternack, merely meant by\nKant to indicate that he is issuing his second attempt\n[zweiten Versuch] at the very same non-enumerated\n“experiment” [Versuch] similarly described in the\nPreface to the first edition (compare the language at AK 6:10\nin the First Preface to AK 6:12 in the Second). In other words,\nPasternack asserts that the many attempts to divide out the\nReligion into two distinct “experiments” is an\nunfortunate byproduct of the secondary literature, unrelated to the\nactual structure of the text. \nWhat both Prefaces ultimately explain is that Kant’s goal in the\nReligion is to (a) provide an inquiry into the scope of\noverlap between historical faith (especially in the form of\nChristianity) and pure rational religion; and (b) use the latter as a\nguide for distinguishing between which elements of the former are\nmatters of “genuine religion” rather than\n“cult” (AK 6:12–13). Each of the\nReligion’s four parts then take on core issues with\nChristian doctrine. \nIn Part One, Kant’s aim is to examine the Christian doctrine of\nOriginal Sin, especially as he would have been exposed to it through\nhis Lutheran Pietist upbringing. His interest is in finding out\nwhether there is any overlap between this historical doctrine and pure\nrational religion. More specifically, his goal is to assess the\ndoctrine of Original Sin so as to determine what (if any) overlap it\nhas with rational religion. He thus considers such matters as: how can\nour moral condition be innate and yet we can remain responsible for\nit; whether, as would have been held by the Augustinian tradition,\nOriginal Sin involves such a fundamental corruption of our faculties\nthat we lose the cognitive and volitional capacities needed to will\nthe good; and then in the “General Remark” or first\nParergon, whether or not our corrupted moral condition is\nsuch that divine aid is required for us to overcome it. Throughout, we\nsee Kant taking up these and other themes within the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin, sometimes finding places of overlap with\nrational religion, sometimes finding the two in conflict. \nThe Second Part of the Religion moves on to Christology and\nthe alleged role of Christ in our salvation. Kant begins with a\ndiscussion of the Incarnation and whether it can be interpreted in\nsuch a way that is compatible with pure rational religion (AK\n6:60–6:66). He then moves on to three\n“difficulties:” how to understand the doctrine of\nSanctifying Grace (the “change of heart” or moral\nregeneration) in relation to pure rational religion; whether an\nindividual can know his/her moral status as having undergone a\n“change of heart”, and how this relates to the challenge\nof moral perseverance; how to understand the “debt of sin”\nor the issue of “Justifying Grace”. On this issue, we\nagain see Kant opposing the prevailing doctrines of his day,\nexplicitly rejecting the idea of “vicarious atonement” (AK\n6:72–73) as anathema to pure rational religion. \nThe Third Part of the Religion considers religion from a\nhistorical standpoint, including the need for the founding of a\nuniversal church, the importance of that church for the moral\nimprovement of society (the “ethical community”),\nquestions of divine providence, and eschatology. \nKant’s focus in this part is the social dimension of moral evil,\nwhere he draws from the Predisposition to Humanity discussed in Part\nOne (see Wood 1999), and argues that we “mutually corrupt each\nother’s moral dispositions and make one another evil” (AK\n6:94). The goal of the universal church is to promote a new sort of\nsocial exchange guided by our collective “duty sui\ngeneris” of human beings to work cooperatively towards\n“a common end, namely the promotion of the highest good”\n(AK 6:97). The ethical community is then presented as an ideal state\nof affairs reflecting the realization of the highest good. \nThe final part of the Religion focuses on ecclesiology. After\nan initial discussion of the religious framework for the ethical\ncommunity, Kant offers an important discussion of Christianity as a\nnatural versus a “learned” religion. The point of the\nformer is that “genuine religion”, is one that can be\n“comprehensibly and convincingly” communicated to all\nhuman beings “through their own reason” (AK 6:162) without\nany necessary role for revelation. The latter, by contrast, turns to\nthe “dogmas of faith” (AK 6:163) and its dangers. This\nbegins Kant’s discussion of “counterfeit service”,\n“priestcraft” and the “delusions of religion”\nhe sees in ecclesiastical practice. While rational religion maintains\nthat nothing apart from “good life-conduct” is required to\n“become well-pleasing to God” (AK 6:170), historical faith\nroutinely claims that God’s judgment is based instead on our\ndoctrinal commitments and liturgical observances. \nTherein, Kant examines the ultimate “subjective ground of\nreligious delusion” (AK 6:168), how the artificies of organized\nreligion let us “slip back into evil” (AK 6:184) and then\nfinally how practices including prayer, church attendance, and rituals\ncould nevertheless still be reconstituted for the genuine moral\nreligion of a universal church and “cosmopolitan moral\ncommunity” (AK 6:194–200). \nEach of the four parts of the Religion close with a section\nentitled “General Remark” or “Parergon”\n(Supplement or Appendix) to its main body. In the Second Edition to\nthe Religion, Kant adds a brief explanation of the function\nof the Parerga, describing them as concerned with matters\nwhich are at the “border” of the “boundaries of pure\nreason”. He lists these as: (1) the effects of grace; (2)\nmiracles; (3) the holy mysteries; (4) the means of grace. Kant\nexplains that reason \ndoes not contest the possibility or actuality of the objects of these\nideas; it just cannot incorporate them into its maxims of thought or\naction. (AK 6:52) \nThey are topics to which we are lead given the issues under discussion\nthrough the main body of each part, but are all matters of caution for\nus for while they each pertain to a need that seems unfulfilled\nthrough what pure reason can allow for genuine religion, and in some\nmanner may invigorate our moral lives, they are all also paths to\n“dogmatic faith” (6:52). \nHence, each part of the Religion ends with a caution somewhat\nakin to the cautions which shape the Critique of Pure\nReason’s Dialectic: though the needs of reason drive us to\nspeculation, we must not fall into error thereby. For example, while\nthe logic of ought implies can warrants our belief that a\n“change of heart” is possible, we cannot either affirm or\ndeny a role for divine aid/grace. Likewise, while Transcendental\nIdealism leaves room for the possibility of a “supernatural\nintervention” (AK 6:191), we are not epistemically situated so\nthat we can ever justifiably claim that some particular effect was in\nfact due to such intervention. \nThe parerga thus are used by Kant to separate out what\ndoctrines of historical faith the pure rational system of religion can\nassess versus what doctrines that—while we are compelled to\nspeculate about them—require our agnosticism. As such, the\nparerga reflect limit issues, at the “border” of\nrational religion, for which there is both a theoretical interest and\nmoral need to visit, but also where the dangers that we stray into\ndogmatism are the greatest (Palmquist 2016, Muchnik 2019). \nIn the mid-1790s, Kant began to explore what he saw as a “gap...\nin the critical philosophy” (Kant to Garve, September 21, 1798\nAK 12:257), namely, how to transition from what he established about\nnatural science in general in the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science to physics in particular. However, his notes on\nthis “gap” exceeded his original plan, as they came to\ncover not only how to transition from the foundations of natural\nscience to physics, but also self-positing, God, and the nature of\ntranscendental philosophy. These notes, which were composed during a\nroughly seventeen-year period, and came to be assembled under the\ntitle, Opus Postumum, prompt questions as to whether or not\nKant’s views on God during this period represent a break from or\ncontinuity with the philosophy of religion he presented in his\nprevious works. And further, if there is continuity, in what way might\nits contents help to illuminate Kant’s overall Critical\nphilosophy of religion? \nFor instance, there are many passages in the Opus Postumum\nwhich present God not as a substance or a being outside of us, but\nrather an ideal or thought-object. For some, this is taken as an\nindication that in Kant’s final years, he withdrew from his more\naffirmative religious views seen up through the mid-1790s\n(Förster 2000). While for others, it finally articulates the view\nthat Kant held throughout the Critical period, namely that despite\ntextual evidence to the contrary, Kant never advanced any argument,\nmoral or otherwise, for belief in God (W. Sullivan 1971, Guyer 2000,\nByrne 2007). \nNevertheless, amidst the passages in the Opus Postumum which\npresent God as merely an ideal or thought-object, there are others\nwhich are not so deflationary, presenting God in a manner similar to\nthe more familiar works of the Critical period (AK 21:13–14 [OP\n220–222], AK 22:126–127 [OP 206–207]). \nOne way to understand these discrepancies is to recognize that the\nOpus Postumum is a collection of notes written over more than\na decade, unedited, and possibly different from what would have been\nthe final version of the treatise. Hence, Kant might have been\nrethinking his philosophy of religion, exploring possibilities, or\nworking through some ideas which could fill his perceived “gap\nin the critical philosophy”, ideas that neither undercut the\nepistemic strictures of the Critique of Pure Reason nor the\nreligiously affirmative language in his practical philosophy. \nFurther, though Kant sometimes describes God as an ideal or\nthought-object, he also says the same about the world and\nman-in-the-world, raising the possibility that his discussions of God\ntook place in two separate spheres: transcendental philosophy proper,\nwhich provides the purely formal conditions of metaphysics and so\nincludes only the ideals we must construct in order to posit ourselves\nin the world (namely, God, the world, and man-in-the-world); and\nmetaphysics, which is transcendental philosophy applied to certain\nobjects (“[the transcendental philosopher] addresses merely what\nis formal, [the metaphysician] what is material (the object, the\nmaterial)” [AK 21:79 [OP: 246]]). If this is right, then it\ncould be that Kant does not repudiate or deflate his prior philosophy\nof religion, but merely adds a new layer to it. Unfortunately, the\nOpus Postumum’s unfinished state makes it difficult to\ncome to a secure conclusion about where Kant’s thinking on\nreligion stood in his final years.","contact.mail":"l.pasternack@okstate.edu","contact.domain":"okstate.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-06-22","date.changed":"2021-04-19","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-religion/","author1":"Lawrence Pasternack","author2":"Courtney Fugate","entry":"kant-religion","body.text":"\n\n\nKant has long been seen as hostile to religion. Many of his\ncontemporaries, ranging from his students to the Prussian authorities,\nsaw his Critical project as inimical to traditional Christianity. The\nimpression of Kant as a fundamentally secular philosopher became even\nmore deeply entrenched through the twentieth century, though this is\nbelied by a closer inspection of his writings both before and after\nthe publication of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), i.e.,\nwhat are commonly referred to as his “pre-Critical” and\n“Critical” periods.\n\n\nAfter an initial overview discussion of Kant’s philosophy of\nreligion, this entry will turn to his views during the pre-Critical\nand then Critical periods. With regards to the former period, we will\ndiscuss Kant’s religious background, his views on the\nrelationship between God and nature, and then how some of the key\nfigures of the period influenced his philosophy of religion. We will\nalso discuss his conception of God and approach to the arguments for\nGod’s existence during this period.\n\n\nWe will then turn to his Critical period, where we will discuss how\nTranscendental Idealism shaped his philosophy of religion, his\nCritical treatment of the arguments for God’s existence, his\nconception of God, epistemology of religion, distinction between Deism\nand Theism, the relationship between the highest good and the\npractical postulates, interpretations of his approach to Christian\ndoctrine, an overview of the four parts of Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason, and, finally, his Opus\nPostumum. Throughout, attention will be paid to many of the\npoints of interpretative dispute over key aspects of his philosophy of\nreligion.\n\nThe impression through the twentieth century of Kant as a\nfundamentally secular philosopher was due in part to various\ninterpretative conventions (such as Strawson’s “principle\nof significance” – Strawson 1966, 16) whereby the\nmeaningfulness and/or thinkability of the supersensible is denied, as\nwell as through an artifact of how Kant’s philosophy religion is\nintroduced to most, namely through the widespread anthologization of\nhis objections to the traditional proofs for God’s\nexistence. \nKant’s philosophy in the pre-Critical period has been\ncharacterized variously as a progression from rationalism to\nempiricism to criticism (Paulsen 1963), the continued search for a\nmore proper method for metaphysics (De Vleeschauwer 1962), a\nreconciliation of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian ideas (Friedman\n1994) or of natural science and metaphysics (Schönfeld 2000; cf.\nAnderson 2015), and as an attempted articulation of a metaphysical\nalternative to Leibnizian “logicism” (i.e., the view that\n“anything that is not logically contradictory is possible”\n(Stang 2016). But what nearly all of Kant’s pre-Critical\nwritings have in common is the desire to frame a more adequate concept\nof God and of the relation of this being to the created universe. Thus\namong his earliest reflections we find a detailed sketch of a\nreligious outlook extracted from Alexander Pope’s “An\nEssay on Man” (1734) and a discussion, among other things, of\nwhy this position is philosophically superior to that of Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) and Christian Wolff\n(1679–1754). \nWithin Kant’s Critical period, not only do we find powerful\ndefenses of religious belief in all three Critiques {1781, 1788,\n1790}, but a considerable share of Kant’s work in the 1790s is\nalso devoted to the positive side of his philosophy of religion. This\nincludes his 1791 “Theodicy” essay, Religion within\nthe Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), “The End of All\nThings” (1794), and the Conflict of the Faculties\n(1798). Moreover, his lectures on logic, Reflexionen and the\nJäsche Logic present a robust account of the nature of religious\nbelief/faith [Glaube]. So, while Kant does deny the\npossibility of religious knowledge (as well as opinion), he\ncharacterizes this denial as necessary to safeguard faith, which he\nendorses as the proper mode of religious assent. One must, therefore,\nunderstand the negative elements in his philosophy of religion, such\nas his infamous objections to the traditional proofs for God’s\nexistence, in this context. As stated in the B-Preface to the\nCritique of Pure Reason, a central goal of the Critical\nproject is to establish the limits to knowledge “in order to\nmake room for faith” (Bxxx). \nThroughout Kant’s writings, we find ample discussions of\nreligious issues. These are, in many instances, clearly affirmative,\nthough they are often framed within objections to theoretical\nreason’s encroachments into the domain that is instead proper to\nfaith. Although his discussions of God and immortality are familiar to\nmost Kantians, the Critical corpus moves well beyond just these.\nEspecially in the 1790s, we find detailed treatments of biblical\nhermeneutics, miracles, revelation, as well as many distinctively\nChristian doctrines such as Original Sin, the Incarnation, Vicarious\nAtonement, and the Trinity. \nUnfortunately, however, the many positive elements of Kant’s\nphilosophy of religion have been eclipsed by its initial negative\nmoments, moments not meant to oppose religion, but rather reflective\nof the Lutheranism (or more precisely, the anti-liturgical Lutheran\nPietism) of his youth. Just as with Luther’s own negative\npolemics against religious despotism and scholastic arcana, we see in\nKant a parallel dialectic, where he, rather than opposing religion,\nsought to free it from the “monopoly of the schools” and\nset it on a footing suitable to “the common human\nunderstanding” (Bxxxii). Hence, as we will discuss through this\nentry, the statement that Kant sought out the limits to knowledge\n[Wissen] in order to “make room for faith\n[Glaube]” (Bxxx), is not an empty bromide, but rather\nthe key anthem for his overall philosophy of religion. \nThe influences on Kant’s pre-Critical religious thought can be\ndivided under three general headings, namely, the personal, the\nscientific and the philosophical. \nAmong the most important influences on Kant’s understanding of\nreligion is no doubt his experience of Pietism, a reform movement\nwithin German Lutheranism which aimed to fulfill what it saw as the\noriginal intention of Martin Luther. According to the founders of\nPietism, such as Philip Jacob Spener (1635–1705), this original\nintention required a more scrupulous religious and moral outlook, a\ndeep personal devotion to increasing one’s own piety and that of\nothers (through collegia pietatis, i.e., through private\nmeetings among lay persons for development of personal holiness), and\nconsequently exacting self-examination as well as the creation of a\ngeneral culture of supporting progress in these matters. Pietists saw\nOrthodox Lutheranism, by contrast, as having become frozen in vain\nintellectualism, an adherence to over-subtle and lifeless formalisms,\nand ecclesiastical politics. As a consequence, Pietists sought a\nreturn what Spener referred to as “apostolic simplicity”\nin theological matters. \nKant lived his entire life in the city of Königsberg, the second\nlargest center of Pietism after Halle. His parents were Pietists and\nhe was educated at the Collegium Fridericianum, a Pietist gymnasium\ndirected by Franz Albert Schultz (1692–1763). Although the\npositive influence of Protestantism in general, and Pietism in\nparticular, has been strongly disputed (Wood 1970: 197n.; Kuehn 2001),\nthe majority of scholars have argued otherwise. Kant’s use of\nPietist terminology such as the “change of heart”\n(Herzensänderung), classic theological language such as\n“radical evil” (radix malorum), his detailed\nengagement with Augustinian themes throughout the Religion,\nand focus on Pietist and Moravian models of grace (AK 7:54–57\n[1798]), which were prevalent in his region, all indicate the lasting\ninfluence of his religious upbringing. \nLike all of his German contemporaries, Kant could not have avoided\nbeing affected by memory of the acrimonious conflict that had occurred\nbetween the Pietists and Christian Wolff (1679–1754) at the\nUniversity of Halle just a generation prior. However, by the time Kant\narrived at the Collegium Fridericianum, Pietism—particularly in\nKönigsberg—had taken on a milder form, one which often\nsought to adopt but also revise the teachings of Wolff in accordance\nwith Pietist principles (De Vleeschauwer 1962; Kuehn 2001). The most\nsignificant example of this is found in Kant’s influential\nteacher at the University of Königsberg, Martin Knutzen\n(1713–1751), whose Philosophical Proof of the Truth of the\nChristian Religion (1740) argues that the core of Christianity\nlies in “presenting us with a genuine means of atonement”\n(Knutzen 1740: §39) and that the necessary revelation of such a\nmeans can be rationally demonstrated using largely, but not\nexclusively, Wolffian principles. \nFinally, among the personal influences on Kant’s view of\nreligion, whether positive or negative, there must be numbered his\nlong associations with Johann Georg Hamann (1730–1788) and\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803). Hamann, who at points was\npart of Kant’s small circle of friends, fiercely defended a\nmystical fideism and railed against the Enlightenment’s\nconfidence in reason. Through both his published writings and his\ndirect personal contacts, Hamann continually challenged Kant to\ndevelop and defend his own views regarding the relation between faith\nand reason, often drawing support from the skepticism of David Hume\n(see e.g., Hamann’s letters to Kant dated 27 July 1759 [AK\n10:7–17; C 47–54] and December 1759 [AK 10:26–31; C\n61–66; also Kuehn 2001: 118–126). Although less radical in\noutlook, Herder played a similar role, particularly later in\nKant’s life. \nAs with many philosophers of the modern period, Kant’s religious\nviews are deeply influenced by the scientific picture of nature that\ntook root in the wake of Copernicus. Most significant during the\npre-Critical period are the ideas that the universe is a centerless,\nceaselessly expanding, totality of things, which evolves towards ever\ngreater perfection according to physical (Newtonian) and spiritual\nlaws. Kant draws support for this view as well as inspiration for\ninterpreting its religious significance from the writings of, among\nothers, Alexander Pope (1688–1744), Thomas Wright\n(1711–1786), Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis\n(1698–1759), Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), and\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) (see Kant’s important\nnote on Newton and Rousseau justifying God and so proving Pope’s\n“theorem” that “Whatever is, is right” AK\n20:58–59). Consequently, much of Kant’s thinking about God\nduring this period is focused on framing a conception of God and of\nthis being’s relation to nature that adequately takes into\naccount this revised picture of the universe. \nThe third set of influences on Kant’s early religious views were\nphilosophical in the sense that he mainly encountered them in\npublished philosophical treatises and textbooks. To these chiefly\nbelong the writings of the Leibnizian-Wolffian school and those of\nwhat is sometimes referred to as the Thomasian-Pietistic school. \nThe Leibnizian-Wolffian School. As noted above, Kant had already\ndeveloped some criticisms of Leibniz’s Theodicy (1710)\nin 1753. He also studied the works of Wolff—most notably the\ntwo-volume Natural Theology (1736–1737)—as well\nas the theological writings of most of Wolff’s many followers.\nThe most important of these latter are Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n(1714–1762) and Johann August Eberhard (1739–1809). Kant\nused Baumgarten’s Metaphysics (1739) in his courses on\nmetaphysics for over forty years, and late in his career adopted its\nsection on natural theology alongside Eberhard’s Preparation\nfor Natural Theology (1781) for his lectures on philosophical\ntheology. Although there are many differences, sometimes major,\nbetween these figures, they all agree generally in maintaining that\nthe Principle of Non-Contradiction is the first principle of\nmetaphysics, that human actions are free but still subject to the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason, that truths in the divine intellect\nplace limits on the divine will, and that physical and moral laws are\ndependent on divine choice but can also be known as necessary from\nnature alone. They also all defend some version of the Ontological\nArgument. \nThe Thomasian-Pietistic School. Under this heading falls a group of\nphilosophers that perhaps should not be called a school, but\nnevertheless arise from two common sources, namely the writings of\nChristian Thomasius and also often from Pietism, and generally share\none common opponent, namely Christian Wolff. In terms of his influence\non Kant, the most important of these is undoubtedly Christian August\nCrusius (1715–1775). Although Kant is never an uncritical\nfollower of Crusius, it is clear that Kant studied his works intensely\nfrom the late 1750s until the middle of the 1760s, often taking his\nside against that of Leibniz and Wolff. Like others in this group,\nCrusius argues that the Principle of Non-Contradiction is an empty\nprinciple and thus is insufficient for founding metaphysics, that\nhuman actions are radically free and so not subject to the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason, and that moral laws can only be known through\nthe revelation of the divine will (in scripture or in conscience).\nNearly all of these disagreements with Wolff stem from the contention\nthat his system is inconsistent with the real significance of such\nreligious concepts as the duty and obedience to God, guilt, and\nconscience. \nCrusius also rejected the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the\nOntological Argument in terms that are very close to what we find in\nKant’s writings of this period. Philosophers of this school\ndeveloped a far more robust account of rational faith than is found in\nthe writings of Wolff. Thus, in a way reminiscent of the later Kant,\nCrusius argues that we are necessitated to believe something if its\ndenial would undermine or render impossible the pursuit of an end\ntowards which we have a duty (Crusius 1751: §339), the most\nimportant of which is our obligation to God (Crusius 1751: §345).\nThis obligation, according to Crusius, necessitates, among other\nthings, a belief in freedom, immortality and even in the reliability\nof reason itself (see Chance 2019). \nFinally, any account of the philosophical influences on Kant’s\nearly religious thought must include mention of the “Profession\nof Faith of the Savoyard Vicar” from Rousseau’s Emile,\nor Education (1762), a book that is thought to have had a\nprofound impact on Kant’s intellectual development in the second\nhalf of the 1760s. In many respects, the Vicar’s expression of a\nhumble and common sense religious outlook has parallels in\nKant’s own development in the later 1760s as mentioned in\n section 2.2 below. \nAn mentioned above, Kant earliest reflections on religious themes\ninclude a comparison between Alexander Pope’s Essay on\nMan (1733–4) and the theologies advanced by Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) and Christian Wolff\n(1679–1754). According to the pre-Critical Kant, the Leibnizian\nposition rests on an inconsistent and limited view of the divine\nbeing, one in which the eternal essences of things retain a degree of\nindependence, whereas Pope \nsubjects every possibility to the dominion of an all-sufficient Being;\nunder this Being things can have no other properties, not even those\nwhich are called essentially necessary, apart from those which\nharmonise together to give complete expression to His perfection. (AK\n2:233–234, note 3704) \nAlready in these passages we find hints of the main features of\nKant’s pre-Critical metaphysics, all of which point back to this\nreligious context, namely: \nKant’s engagement with this last point in particular relates to\nhis lifelong preference for, and interest in, the Physico-Theological\nArgument (see\n section 3.1.2.3 below). \nKant’s initial attempt to articulate a metaphysics that could\njustify all these views is found in two works of 1755, A New\nElucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition and\nUniversal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, Or Essay on\nthe Constitution of the Mechanical Origin of the Whole Universe\naccording to Newtonian Principles. The former focuses on the\nlaying the foundation of a metaphysical system including points\n (i–v)\n above. The latter then focuses on\n (vi)\n by purporting to show that even just the Newtonian laws of nature\nexhibit such a tendency to bring about order and perfection in nature\nas can only be explained by a conception of God as the all-sufficient\nground of the essences of things. The continued influence of the\nreligious outlook of Pope’s Essay on Man (and hence\nalso of the specific brand of Deism, similar to Shaftesbury’s\nand Lord Bolingbroke’s, to which it is related) is evidenced in\nthe fact that the Universal Natural History contains no less\nthan six separate passages from this work, three of which Kant uses to\nintroduce the three divisions of his book. \nFor whatever reasons, Kant seems to have been unsatisfied by this\ninitial attempt, and so set out in the 1760s to better defend and\nexplain this same general system of thought in his Only Possible\nArgument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God\n(1763b). This time, however, he is much more concerned with\narticulating a firm methodological basis for his metaphysics, as is\nevident in the work itself as well as in the key essays of the period,\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763a) and Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of\nthe Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1764). \nDespite retaining this commitment to his earlier metaphysics, it seems\nclear that at this time Kant also becomes convinced that there exists\na common sense religious standpoint that is not dependent upon the\nproof of metaphysical doctrines, but which is equivalent or perhaps\neven stronger in its practical import (see, e.g., AK 2:65 [1763b]).\nWith the eventual abandonment of his pre-Critical project in the late\n1760s it is this alternative source of religious conviction that will\nblossom into the re-founding of his religious thought in moral\ntheology (see\n sections 3.3–3.7 below). \nThrough the remainder of this section, we will focus on three\nparticular religious topics discussed by Kant during the Pre-Critical\nperiod: his treatment of God as an all-sufficient being, his critique\nof the ontological argument, and his own early argument for\nGod’s existence. \nAs noted above, this idea first makes its appearance in Kant’s\nearly notes. Kant does not attempt to justify the concept, but instead\nuses it in order to argue that the view that evil has its source in\nrestrictions placed on the divine will by the truths of the divine\nintellect—a view he attributed to Leibniz—is\nincomprehensible. The primary significance of divine all-sufficiency\nhere is that it means that there can be no necessity prior to the\ndivine will. Since Leibniz and Wolff identified truths in the divine\nintellect with the natures or essences of things, as well as with\ntheir inner possibility, all-sufficiency for Kant also means that\nthese too must be dependent on the plan of the divine will. In\nUniversal Natural History, Kant argues from the perfect order\nof the physical universe to the existence of an all-sufficient being,\nasking whether it does \nnot provide an undeniable proof of their [i.e., all physical things]\ncommon first origin, which must be an all-sufficient highest mind in\nwhich the natures of things were designed in accordance with unified\npurposes? (AK 1:228–229 [1755b]) \nFor Kant this means that the divine will not only orders what is\ncontingent in nature—a view held equally by Leibniz and\nWolff—but also that it brings about order and perfection through\nbeing the ground of the inner possibilities of all things (i.e., their\nnatures or essences), indeed even the most basic laws of matter (see\nAK 2:151–154 [1763b]). \nIn The Only Possible Argument, Kant claims that the thought\nof God as the all-sufficient is “of all thoughts the most\nsublime, [but] is still widely neglected, and mostly not considered at\nall” (AK 2:151), and declares that if \nexpanded to include all that is possible or real, is a far more\nappropriate expression for designating the supreme perfection of the\nDivine Being than the concept of the infinite, which is commonly\nemployed. (AK 2:154) \nIn connection with\n section 3.1.2.1\n below, it is important to note that Kant rejects the Ontological\nArgument in both the New Elucidation and in The Only\nPossible Argument, though for different reasons in each case. In\nthe former, Kant employs a version of the objection formulated by\nJohannes Caterus (1590–1655) in his response to Descartes’\nMeditations (AK 1:395 [1755a]). In essence, the objection is\nthat although the Ontological Argument proves that the concept of\nexistence is necessarily contained in the concept of God, this is only\na connection among concepts. For the argument to work, then, one would\nfirst have to show that it is a concept of something actual. By the\ntime of The Only Possible Argument, however, Kant seems to no\nlonger accept this criticism. Instead, he mainly rejects the argument\nbased upon his analysis of concept of existence, which purportedly\nshows that it is not a real predicate (AK 2:72–77, AK\n2:156–157 [1763b]). His preferred pre-Critical reason for\nrejecting the Ontological Argument is basically the same as will be\ndiscussed in\n section 3.1.2.1.\n Nevertheless, at this time Kant also articulates a version the\nobjection used by Gaunilo of Marmoutiers (eleventh century) in\nresponse to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) (AK 2:156–157\n[1763b]). \nKant’s own argument for God’s existence is closely\nconnected to his conception of God as all-sufficient and the ground of\nall real possibility. In the New Elucidation, the argument is\nextremely brief with its core consisting in the claim that\n“nothing can be conceived as possible unless whatever is real in\nevery possible concept exists and indeed exists absolutely\nnecessarily”; “for if this be denied, nothing at all would\nbe possible; in other words, there would be nothing but the\nimpossible” (AK 1:395). A very similar argument features later\nin The Only Possible Argument where it is presented in much\ngreater detail. Here again the central idea is that possibility\npresupposes something actual, and so there is a being which, if it did\nnot exist, then nothing would be possible; but such a being is\nabsolutely necessary (AK 2:83). \nIn both the New Elucidation and in The Only Possible\nArgument, though more fully, Kant immediately proceeds to derive\nfrom the above proof the further properties of what is absolutely\nnecessary. This ground of all possibility must be found in one being,\nwhich is unique, simple, immutable and eternal, containing supreme\nreality, and hence possessing both intellect and will. Consistent with\nhis criticism of Leibniz mentioned in\n section 2.2.1\n Kant rejects both theological voluntarism and intellectualism,\narguing that neither God’s intellect nor will takes precedence\nover and so limits the other, but instead they must stand in absolute\nharmony. For this reason, “the possibilities of things\nthemselves, which are given through the divine nature, harmonise with\nhis great desire” so that “unity, harmony and order are\nthemselves to be found in the possibilities of things” (AK\n2:91–92 [1763b]). \nWith the introduction of Transcendental Idealism’s epistemic\nstrictures, Kant came to the conclusion that religion must fall\noutside the scope of theoretical reason. However, instead of atheism\nor agnosticism, Kant advanced a novel philosophical theology that\ngrounds religion on the “needs” of practical reason. In\nthe B-Preface to the Critique of Pure Reason, he in fact\nintimates that his interest in religion is part of what motivated\nTranscendental Idealism. That is, as quoted earlier, Kant sought to\nestablish the limits to knowledge “in order to make room for\nfaith” (Bxxx). Such a faith has its source in the needs of pure\npractical reason (AK 8:137 [1785a], AK 5:142 [1788], AK 6:139 [1793]),\nand it is through these needs that Kant maintains that we can extend\nour cognition for practical purposes, allowing us to form a warranted\nconception of God and the afterlife in the service of the highest good\n(A814/B843–A819/B847). Kant coins the term “pure rational\nfaith” (AK 8:142) in What does it mean to Orient oneself in\nThinking (1785a) and later uses this term as well as the\n“pure philosophical doctrine of religion” (AK 6:10\n[1793]), “pure religion of reason” (AK 6:12), “pure\nrational system of religion” (AK 6:12) and simply “pure\nrationalism” to refer to his positive philosophy of religion.\nNote, however, that Kant always intends by these terms specifically\npractical rather than theoretical reason, as the\n“needs” which serve as the basis for faith pertain to our\npractical, moral lives. \nWe will here begin with a discussion of Kant’s critique of the\ntraditional proofs for God’s existence before moving on to the\npositive side of his philosophy of religion. Although the fame of this\ncritique has been taken as indicative of his philosophy of religion as\na whole, it is instead representative of his distinction in the\nCritical period between the illicit attempts at a positive philosophy\nof religion driven by theoretical reason, versus a philosophy of\nreligion that has its ground in practical philosophy. \nThe Transcendental Dialectic’s “Ideal of Reason”\ncontains the best known and most frequently anthologized components of\nKant’s philosophy of religion. In addition to its portrayal of\nthe ens realissimum, one finds within it Kant’s\nobjections to the Ontological, Cosmological and Physico-theological\n(Design) arguments. It is thus the text most central to the negative\nelements of Kant’s philosophy of religion and is integral to the\nwidely held view that Kant is hostile to religion. \nKant maintains that underlying all the traditional proofs for\nGod’s existence is the concept of the ens realissimum,\nthe most real being. Reason comes to the idea of this being through\nthe principle that every individuated object is subject to the\n“principle of complete determination”. While the\ngenerality of concepts allows them to be less than fully determined\n(e.g., our concept of a horse extends over horses that are different\ncolors, heights, etc.), individuated objects must be completely\ndetermined (e.g., an individual horse must have specific colors, a\nspecific height, etc.). \nHence, where the particular determinations of actual objects are\ndiscovered through experience, our concepts, which in themselves are\nnot objects of experience, remain partly indeterminate. Nevertheless,\nreason can construct for itself what is on the one hand still an\nabstraction but yet also an individuated entity. Kant refers to such\nentities as “ideals” and in most instances they are used\nby us regulatively as archetypes for reflection. For example, when\nconsidering whether or not to get a pet, one might envision an ideal\npet, a pet with the optimal set of desirable attributes. Such an\narchetype for thought, however, is still not completely determined,\nfor the ideal can still be neutral between various attributes that are\nnot regarded as relevant to one’s interests (for example, one\nmay not consider any specific nostril width salient to one’s\nchoice of pet). \nBy contrast, the ens realissimum is the concept of an\nindividual object that is completely determined, and is such through\nreason alone. In the case of most ideals, their determinations are the\nresult of various empirical concepts as well as various subjective\ninterests (such as what one believes a pet would bring to one’s\ndaily life). However, in the ens realissimum, all its\ndeterminations are set solely through reason’s formal\napplication of the principle of complete determination, aggregating\ntogether all possible predicates and selecting from these predicates\nall those which have a fully positive reality (no negative predicates,\nno derivative predicates). That is, following the concept of\n“the most real being”, reason brings together all possible\npredicates and eliminates those which involve some limitation or\ndeficiency. \nIn doing this, the faculty does not violate any of the standards Kant\nsets out within Transcendental Idealism, for reason is merely applying\nthe formal principle of complete determination to all possible\npredicates and constructing an idea (or more precisely, an ideal)\nthereby. This construction can then be entertained by the intellect,\nor perhaps, used as a regulative principle, as one does with other\nless grand ideals. Transcendental error comes in, however, if reason\nalso then tenders the ens realissimum as not merely a formal\nconstruct but as the metaphysical ground of all that is: since it (in\nprinciple) contains all determinations, and these determinations are\nof actual entities, a “transcendental subreption” may\noccur that transforms the ens realissimum from just an\nintellectual construct into a metaphysical reality as the sum total of\nall actuality. \nAs with other transcendental errors, we can subreptively conflate a\nsubjective principle generated by our intellects and of only\nregulative use to one that is objective, a real being not constructed\nin thought, but discovered through thought. Such, we may say, is the\nsource of error in Spinoza’s use of substance and in other\nmonistic metaphysics. Our construction of the ens realissimum\nhas the appearance of an actual unity since it is the concept of the\nsum total of all positive predicates. This appearance then casts an\nillusion unrecognized by the metaphysicians, leading them into the\nsubreptive error. \nAccording to the Ontological Argument, it is self-evident from the\nidea of the most real being that that being exists. Whatever it is\nthat is this most real being, it must include all predicates that\ncontribute to its greatness or reality; and given that actual\nexistence is (allegedly) one such predicate, whatever it is that is\nthe most real being is therefore a being who by definition must exist.\nHence, if one were to compare two beings, both equally great in all\nrespects except that one exists and one does not, the one that does\nnot exist, by virtue of its non-existence, is lacking a predicate that\ncontributes to the greatness of the other. The correct conception of\nthat than which nothing greater can be conceived must,\ntherefore, include existence. \nThe Critique of Pure Reason contains four distinct objections\nto the Ontological Argument. The first two of these follow what may be\nthought of as the standard assumption by the proponents of this\nargument that “God exists” is to be treated as an analytic\njudgment (A594/B622–A597/B625). Though rarely mentioned in the\nliterature, these arguments are salient to the common objection that\nKant’s critique of the Ontological Argument doesn’t impact\nthe Anselmian version (Plantinga 1966, Forgie 1975). \nThe second two objections arise as a result of the defeat of the\nanalytic rendering, and turn to a reading of “God exists”\nas synthetic (A597/B625–A602/B630). By far, the most famous of\nthese objections is that existence is not a predicate. What, however,\nKant means by “predicate” requires some examination. \nOf key significance here is Kant’s distinction between\n“logical” versus “real” predicates. The former\nis best understood as a syntactic notion: the second term, along with\nthe subject term, of a complete and well-formed proposition. A real\npredicate, by contrast, is distinguished by its semantic function. As\nKant describes it, a real predicate “goes beyond the concept of\nthe subject and enlarges it” (A598/B626). Hence, logical and\nreal predicates involve two different orders of analysis, one\nsyntactic, one semantic. They are neither mutually exclusive (Abaci\n2008), nor exhaustive (Pasternack 2018). They instead distinguish\nbetween two different roles that one and the same term can have. \nTo help Kant make his case that existence is not a real predicate,\ni.e., a predicate that “enlarges” the subject term, he\nappeals to the distinction between an actual and non-actual unit of\ncurrency, say one hundred dollars. Between the two, there is no\ndifference in the concepts of each: existence adds nothing to the\nconcept of one hundred dollars. So, when one claims that “one\nhundred dollars exist”, one is not picking out one of its\npredicates, part of the nature of a hundred dollars, but rather one is\njust “positing” (A598/B626) its existence. Likewise, to\nclaim that “God exists” is merely to posit God’s\nexistence. It is not a statement which attributes the property of\nexistence to the subject term, God. \nUnderlying this analysis is Kant’s contention that existence\ndoes not add anything to the subject concept; for it if did, then, he\ncontends, a hundred dollars actualized would be different from it as\nmerely possible: “my concept would not express the entire object\nand thus would not be the suitable concept for it” (A599/B627).\nThat is, the hundred dollars as possible would not be the same as what\nis actualized in the actual hundred dollars. \nThere are, unsurprisingly, many different interpretations as to what\nKant means when he claims that existence does not\n“enlarge” or add to the subject term. Let us here consider\nthree. \nThe first comes from James Van Cleve’s Problems from\nKant (1999), where he offers an analysis of real predication that\nrenders conceptual enlargement (i.e., a predicate that “goes\nbeyond” its subject) in terms of logical non-entailment. He\nwrites: \nA predicate P enlarges a concept \\(C =_{df} \\Diamond\n\\exists x (Cx \\amp {\\sim}Px)\\). \nIf C = triangle and P = red, P would be,\nfollowing this definition, a real predicate, since it is possible that\nthere exists an x which is a triangle and is not red. By\ncontrast, if P = three-sidedness, then we do not, by this\ndefinition, have a real predicate of C, since there are no\ntriangles that are not three-sided. In other words, where C =\ntriangle and P = three-sidedness, since \\(\\forall x (Cx \\supset\nPx)\\), P fails to meet the test for conceptual enlargement of\nC. Likewise, existence will fail to meet the definition above\nsince for any concept C, \\(\\exists x (Cx \\supset\n\\langle\\textrm{exists}\\rangle x)\\). That is, if there exists some\nx such that x is a C, then x exists.\nHence, Van Cleve treats existence as not an enlarging concept since,\nper his analysis, he is “letting the existential quantifier\nexpress existence” (Van Cleve 1999: 188). \nNick Stang follows Van Cleve in “letting the existential\nquantifier express existence” and further argues that Kant\nsubscribes to an “actualism” whereby there are no\nnon-existing objects (i.e., if unicorns do not exist,\n“unicorn” does not name an object, but rather references a\nstring of predicates). As such, Stang asserts that since\n“exists applies to every object, it does not\ndistinguish some objects from other objects” (Stang 2015: 599).\nNotice, however, that Stang’s rationale for why existence is not\na predicate is that it is actually a “predicate that applies to\nevery object there is”. That is, Stang interprets existence as\nan internal mark of our concept of objecthood itself (Stang 2015:\n599). \nA third recent analysis can be found in R. Lanier Anderson’s\nThe Poverty of Conceptual Thought (2015). Anderson seeks to\nshow that philosophers need to follow Kant’s treatment of\nexistence in order to preserve our contemporary use of modal terms.\nFor if our modal terms (existence, possibility, necessity) were\npredicates, then a change in modal terms would demand a change in the\ncontents of our concepts of objects. \nAccordingly, Anderson’s argument is intended to reflect\nKant’s conclusion from his hundred dollars example: “what\nwould exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my\nconcept” (A600/B628). More specifically, Anderson argues that if\nour modal terms were predicates, then the non-actual possible would\nhave as one of its marks, non-actual possibility; whereas the actual\nwould have existence as one of its marks. As a result, if one were to\nconsider the actualization of some non-actual possible P,\nP-actualized would no longer be the same P as\nthe P of P-non-actual possible. As Anderson\nexplains: \nthe supposition that <existence> would determine the concept of\na thing is incompatible with its logical function of a modal category,\nwhich is to separate the actual objects from the merely possible ones\nwithout altering the contents of the things’ concepts.\n(Anderson 2015: 322) \nKant further contends that the Cosmological Argument is parasitic on\nthe Ontological. He demonstrates this by taking Leibniz’s Modal\nArgument as emblematic of all other Cosmological Arguments and then\ncontends that a being posited as necessary in order to explain the\ncontingency of creation has built into it the same error as discussed\nabove. According to Leibniz’s Modal Argument, the existence of a\ncontingent reality can only be ultimately explained through a cause\nwhose existence is in itself necessary. However, something whose\nexistence is in itself necessary is something whose existence cannot\ndepend upon anything else but itself, its own nature. This returns us\nto the Ontological Argument, or at least the objectionable idea at its\nheart, for the necessary being that the Cosmological Argument proposes\nis also the idea of a being whose essence involves existence. So, as\nbefore, since existence is not a predicate, Kant rejects the coherence\nof the idea of a being whose existence depends upon nothing but its\nown nature. \nKant’s assessment of the Physico-Theological (Design) Argument\nis substantially different from his treatment of the other two classic\nproofs. While he still contends that it, like the Cosmological\nargument, remains ultimately grounded upon the Ontological\nArgument’s assumption that existence is a predicate, this\nobjection does not fully undo the force of the Physico-Theological\nArgument. Kant in fact expresses sympathy for this argument, writing,\nfor instance, that it “always deserves to be mentioned with\nrespect” (A623/B651) and that it is “the oldest, the\nclearest, and the most accordant with the common reason of\nmankind” (A623/B651). He further claims that the argument\nsucceeds in at least establishing “an\narchitect of the world” and a cause\n“proportioned” to the order of nature. So, up to this\npoint in the argument, he writes, “we have nothing to bring\nagainst the rationality and utility of this procedure, but have rather\nto commend it further” (A624/B652). What Kant cannot accept,\nhowever, is its advance from a “Wise Author of Nature” to\nan infinite creator. When it moves from architect to creator, it\nproposes an “original” and “supreme” cause,\nand in so doing, it calls for a being whose existence depends upon\nnothing but itself. This returns us to the Cosmological/Modal\nargument, and thus to its dependency on the Ontological. Despite,\nhowever, the failure of the argument to establish the existence of an\ninfinite creator, Kant does not abandon the relevance, particularly\nthe regulative relevance of the idea of a “Wise Author of\nNature” for the natural sciences, a point he repeats in both the\nAppendix to the Transcendental Dialectic and in the Canon of Pure\nReason. \nKant’s distinction between Deism and Theism is intertwined with\nhis distinction between Transcendental Theology and Natural Theology\n(A631/B659–A632/B660). The meaning of these terms, however, are\nnot what some have assumed (e.g., Wood 1991). \nIn his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion,\nKant defines “Transcendental Theology” as the\n“recognition [Kenntniss] of God by means of concepts of\npure reason” (AK 28:596 [1821]). These concepts are not,\nhowever, the pure concepts of the understanding, but rather what he\ncalls the four “classes of concepts” (B110): namely,\nquantity, quality, relation and modality. More precisely, Kant sees\nTranscendental Theology as a consequence of reason’s quest for\nthe unconditioned condition, with its concepts of God corresponding to\nthe unconditioned for each of the “classes of concepts”,\nnamely: ens summum (quality), ens entium (quantity),\nens originarium (modality), and ens realissimum\n(relation). \nAs Transcendental Theology employs no “information” about\nthe conditioned (i.e., the created world), it is without the resources\nneeded to develop a concept of God “in concreto”\n(AK 28:1020 [1817]). Absent the “materials for the concept of\nGod from empirical principles and empirical information” (AK\n28:1020 [1817]), Transcendental Theology can do no more than attribute\nto God “what is true of him as a thing in general” (AK\n28:1020 [1817]). That is, its concept of God is just that of\nunconditioned quality, quantity, modality, and relation. \nAbsent all “information” about the conditioned,\nTranscendental Theology is thus without the resources to develop the\nconcept of God used in either Natural or Moral Theology, i.e, the\n“wise author of nature” or the judge and\n“ruler” of nature, respectively (AK 28:452 [1968], AK\n28:596 [1821], AK 28:1002 [1817]). Consequently, Kant claims that\nTranscendental Theology is inadequate, yielding “only a\nsilhouette of a theology” (AK 28:605, AK 28:452 [1968]). Its\nconception of God is “useless” (AK 28:596 [1821]),\n“unusable” (AK 28:452 [1968]), and “quite\nsuperfluous to us” (AK 28:1020 [1817]). For it provides us only\nwith the god of Deism, and according to the lectures, this God is\n“useless” and “unusable”. \nHence, despite the familiar-seeming term, Kant does not mean by\n“Deism” how it was typically used by the British. Their\nDeism is rather much more akin to what Kant means by\n“Theism”, as the outcome of Natural (vs. Transcendental)\nTheology. That is, Kant maintains in the Critique of Pure\nReason that our picture of nature as having systematic unity\ncommits us to seeing nature “as if” it were created by a\n“Wise Author” (A644/B672–A645/B673). \nThis is not, however, a new twist on the Argument from Design. While\nKant turns to Theism to explain how we make the ground of the natural\norder “comprehensible” (AK 6:65n [1793]) to ourselves,\nthis is not a proof for God’s existence but rather an appeal to\nthe idea of a Wise Author varyingly described as\n“symbolic” (AK 4:437 [1785b]), “heuristic”\n(A671/B699), a “focus imaginarius” (A645/B673),\nor a supposition to be taken \nonly problematically [vs assertorically] … so as to regard all\nthe connection of things in the world of sense as if they had their\nground in this being of reason. (A681/B709) \nIt is nonetheless a supposition that (at least from the later 1770\nthrough most of the 1780s) Kant believes we cannot do without.\n“[W]e must presuppose such a being” (A697/B725), for in\nits absence, reason would be at odds with itself, at once intending a\nsystematic unity to nature and at the same time without a principle to\nground that systematicity. \nLastly, note that despite Allen Wood’s claim in\n“Kant’s Deism” that Kant’s account of Deism is\ndisconnected from the “common seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century usage” and thus is\n“idiosyncratic” (Wood 1991), Wood has mistaken the more\nfamiliar British use of the term with how the term was used by German\nRationalism. For example, Wolff, in his Theologia Naturalis\nhighlights the areas of agreement between Deism and atheism, arguing\nthat Deism can easily devolve into a “practical atheism”.\n(Theologia Naturalis, §547). Baumgarten as well, in the\nMetaphysica, the textbook that Kant used in his courses on\nMetaphysics and Natural Theology, follows Wolff in this, describing\nDeism as “the doctrine [which] maintains that almost nothing is\nconceivable about God, except perhaps his existence”\n(§862). Hence, however idiosyncratic this use of\n“Deism” may seem to the modern reader, it would not have\nbeen so for Kant’s contemporary audience. In short, Kant uses\n“Deism” in a manner reflective of Wolff and\nBaumgarten’s approach rather than how the British employed\nit. \nDespite Kant’s explicit claim that one of the underlying drivers\nof Transcendental Idealism is to defend faith against theoretical\nreason, it is widely believed that his philosophical system powerfully\nchallenges, if not outright bars, religious belief. His criticisms of\nthe traditional arguments for God’s existence are taken as\nillustrative of his opposition to religion, and the so-called\n“Restriction Thesis” of Transcendental Idealism is\nregarded as a barrier against all legitimate religious assent\n(Wolterstorff 1998, Rawls 2000, DiCenso 2012). \nAccording to Kant, we can have no knowledge of anything outside of\nexperience, outside the scope of the spatio-temporal-causal order.\nHence, there can be no knowledge of God, of the soul, of the\nafterlife, or anything else beyond that order. To compound this\nrestriction, Kant further asserts that we also can have no\n“cognition” [Erkenntnis] of objects outside the\nscope of experience. While the former is less ambiguous, the latter\nhas generated more debate, hanging very much on what it is to have a\n“cognition” (e.g., Watkins & Willaschek 2017, Chignell\n2017). \nMany have taken “cognition” to be a semantic notion, and\nso have taken Kant’s denial of the cognizability of the\nsupersensible as a denial of even the intelligibility of religious\nconcepts. Thus, it is not merely that we cannot prove whether or not\nGod exists, but the concept of God itself, like all other concepts of\nsupersensible entities and properties, (allegedly) cannot even have\nmeaning for us. \nThe former position, that we can have no knowledge of the\nsupersensible, is textually well supported. Knowledge\n[Wissen], for Kant, follows its traditional tripartite model\nas justified-true-belief, and if there is neither experience nor\nrational proof of any supersensible claim, no such claim can meet with\nsuitable justification. \nThe latter position, that we can have no cognition of supersensible\nobjects, is likewise correct. However, the alleged implication that\nthis makes meaningful thought about them impossible is false. Kant\ndoes not reject the thinkability of the supersensible, and, in fact,\nthe body of arguments in the Transcendental Dialectic show this to be\nclearly the case. If, for example, propositions about the\nsupersensible were incoherent according to Kant, then he would not\nneed his Antinomies or Paralogisms. Rather, he could sweep them all\naway quite simply through the charge that they fall short of the\nconditions for meaning. \nThe problem, thus, is not that we cannot coherently think the\nsupersensible. It is, rather, that we can think about it in too many\nways. Absent experience, reason is without a touchstone through which\nhypotheses can be refuted. Instead, so long as the ideas of reason are\ninternally consistent, it can construct a multitude of theses and\nantitheses about the supersensible. It can, moreover, argue quite\nrobustly in favor of each, something we see both in the Antinomies and\nall the more grandly in the great tomes of the metaphysicians. The\nproblem, for Kant, is thus not about meaning, but rather it is\nepistemic: having no possible experience of the supersensible, we lack\nthe theoretical resources to adjudicate between competing claims.\nAccordingly, to cognize, for Kant, is to think an object or\nproposition in relation to the order of nature and the material\nconditions that govern whether or not it obtains—what Kant calls\nthe cognition’s “real possibility”. The conditions\nfor real possibility, in turn, provide the investigational framework\nthrough which we can verify or falsify what is being cognized. \n“Cognition”, thus, is not a semantic notion, but\nepistemic. It is a mode of thinking that is not just fanciful\nimagining but is directed to objects whose reality can be determined.\nThinking requires merely the logical possibility of what is being\nentertained. So long as it is not self-contradictory, it can be\nthought. Cognition, by contrast, embeds the thought in the material\nconditions for, or the Real Possibility of, the object of thought,\nsomething that is not possible once one steps beyond the scope of\npossible experience. \nHence, we cannot have a cognition of God because, as Kant argues in\nthe Transcendental Dialectic’s Ideal of Reason, there is no\nviable argument for God’s existence. Likewise, we cannot prove\nor disprove a miracle, for its alleged supersensible cause is not\nsomething whose conditions are determinable for us. Even if we\nexperience some event whose cause is supersensible, we have no way\nwhatsoever to establish that this is so, and have nothing to guide our\nhypotheses about how to test for miracles or how they come to be. \nNone of this challenges the intelligibility of religious doctrines. So\nlong as they are not self-contradictory, they are thinkable. It is\njust that their truth or falsehood cannot possibly be known. Moreover,\nsince they are not within the spectrum of epistemic evaluation, we\ncannot opine regarding them, for opinion [Meinung], as Kant\nunderstands the term, is a mode of assent based upon the weighing of\ntheoretical grounds (evidence and argument) for and against truth. \nYet, this does not leave us with agnosticism either. Along with\nknowledge and opinion, Kant identifies faith as our third legitimate\nmode of holding-to-be-true [Fürwahrhalten]. Faith is,\nfor Kant, a mode of justified assent, though the nature of its\njustification is quite different from opinion and knowledge. It is not\nrooted in experience or argument, but rather in what he characterizes\nas the “needs” of practical reason. Hence, for Kant,\nreligious belief finds its proper seat not in intellectual reflection\nbut in our practical lives. \nMoreover, Kant sees faith, unlike knowledge, as engaging with our\nwill, calling it a “free assent”. This is important for\nthe practical function of faith, since our commitment to morality does\nnot so simply depend on our affirmation of the postulates, but in our\nfree act of faith through which we more completely bind ourselves to\nmorality. Morality, thus “inevitably leads to religion”\n(AK 6:6 [1793]), since we need the latter in order to sustain or fully\nrealize our commitment to the former. This, however, must not be\ninterpreted as “theological ethics”, as if the authority\nof the moral law depended upon God. It is not its authority that is in\nquestion (perhaps with the exception of the argument at AK 5:114 in\nthe Critique of Practical Reason [1788]). Rather, this\nadvance from morality to religion concerns how we bind ourselves to\nthe former (cf. A632/B660, AK 5:481 [1788], AK 6:3 [1793]). \nAlthough Kant’s presentation of faith as legitimate mode of\n“holding-to-be-true”, is consistently maintained through\nthe Critical period’s published corpus, some Kantians have opted\nto develop interpretations which dismiss or overlook such discussions.\nWe will here briefly compare four different stances on religious\nassent in Kant. \nSome scholars hold that we should mostly ignore what Kant has to say\nabout the postulates, and, consequently, the positive part of his\nreligious philosophy. This is either because the postulates are taken\nas hold-overs from Kant’s pre-Critical period that are\nincompatible with his Critical philosophy (Allison 1990), or because\nthe philosophical reasoning involving them is so bad as to be\nirrelevant to what makes Kant an important philosopher (Rawls 2000).\nRegardless of whether the postulates are a hold-over or simply poorly\nsupported, the result is the same: for scholars who take this view, it\nis not important to have a detailed understanding of the attitudes\ninvolved in postulation, as they aren’t key to understanding\nwhat is valuable about Kant’s philosophy. \nA second position that may be understood as an attempt to reconcile\nTranscendental Idealism with Kant’s philosophy of religion is to\nreplace what he says about assent with a non-doxic attitude where\nreligious concepts, rather than objects of belief, are instead taken\nas regulative ideals or representations of moral principles\n(Davidovich 1993, Henrich 1999, DiCenso 2012). While there are many\npassages in the Critical period where Kant promotes assent, this is a\nview in line with some fasciles of the Opus Postumum. Guyer\n(2005), for example, maintains that rather than the Opus\nPostumum reflecting a break from Kant’s Critical stance on\nreligious assent, it instead finally brings the true character of his\nposition to light. \nThe most widespread view in recent scholarship is one that corresponds\nwith the works of Stevenson (2003), Chignell (2007), and Pasternack\n(2011). It also has earlier adherents including Beck (1960) and Wood\n(1970). Although there are interpretative differences among these\nfigures, there is a shared recognition that Kant does regard actual\nassent (holding-to-be-true) as having its ground in our moral\ninterests, as driven by a “need” or the\n“needs” of practical reason. \nWood (1970), for example, bases his view upon the “Absurdum\nPracticum” argument where Kant states that anyone who\nrenounces the postulates would become “contemptible” in\ntheir own eyes (A828/B856, AK 28:1083 [1817]). Chignell and Pasternack\ndevelop their interpretations primarily by way of an analysis of texts\nwhere Kant discusses the relationship between belief, knowledge and\nopinion. What is emphasized among these interpreters is the moral\nsignificance of religious assent rather than ontological commitment.\nSuch may be taken as the spirit of Kant’s comment that “I\nmust not even say ‘It is morally certain that there is a\nGod’, but rather ‘I am morally certain’”\n(A829/B857). \nNote that while there are a considerable number of texts where Kant\nendorses the need for religious assent, we may nevertheless\ndistinguish between a number of positions. One holds that the adoption\nof a belief-state that is more akin to the symbolic use of the\npostulates, adopting them only in the form of an “as if”,\nwithout a commitment to their objective reality (Ferreira 2014). The\nmost famous indication of the “as if” attitude appears at\n4:448. Another position (Pasternack 2011, Insole 2016) is that Kant\nregarded faith as including a commitment to the objective reality of\nits objects. Passages in support of this view include AK 5:4 &\n5:134 [1788], AK 5:456 & 5:469 [1790], AK 8:139 [1785a], AK\n20:299. Note further that the spirit behind the “as if”\nattitude may be reemerging in a new form within the recent interest in\nKant’s conception of moral hope. \nIn the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant writes\nthat \nall interest of my reason (the speculative as well as the practical)\nis united in the following three questions: 1. What can I know? 2.\nWhat should I do? 3. What may I hope. \nKant then goes on to explain that hope is \nsimultaneously practical and theoretical, so that the practical leads\nlike a clue to a reply to the theoretical question and, in its highest\nform, the speculative question. \nKant further describes hope in relation to our interest in happiness\n(A805/B833). The latter point perhaps connects more specifically with\nhow Kant frames the highest good in the Critique of Pure\nReason versus later work. Nevertheless, despite how Kant\nhighlights the question of hope in this text, it does not receive the\nsame level of exposition as knowledge, opinion or faith. For further\ndiscussion of Kant on hope, see the section on Kant in the  entry on\n hope. \nKant’s doctrine of the highest good is the foundation of his\npositive philosophy of religion. With the exception of some musings\n(esp. in the Critique of Pure Reason) about an assent driven\nby our regulative employment of purposiveness (cf. B426, A670/B698 and\nA826/B854), the path to religion is through the highest good. It is\nthrough this doctrine that Kant endorses belief in God’s\nexistence as well as the immortality of the soul. It is also through\nthis doctrine that Kant sets out what in the Religion he\ncalls the Pure Rational System of Religion. Therein, Kant appraises\nChristian doctrines to determine whether or not they are conducive to\nour duty to pursue the highest good (see\n section 3.6.4\n and\n section 3.7\n below). \nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant distinguishes\nbetween the “supreme”, the “complete”, and\n“highest” good. By “supreme good”, he means\nthe good that is “not subordinate to any other” (AK 5:110\n[1788]). That is, if there are a plurality of values, the supreme good\nis the one that overrides the rest. Hence, if pleasure were taken as a\nvalue, its value would be subordinate to morality, and thus its value\nwould be defeated or overridden if the pleasure comes through a\nviolation of the moral law. \nThe “complete good” is one that “is not part of a\nstill greater whole of the same kind” (AK 5:110 [1788). Kant\nthen explains that while morality is the supreme good, it is not the\ncomplete good “as the object of the faculty of desire of\nrational finite beings” (AK 5:110). This is because in addition\nto morality, finite rational beings also desire happiness. So,\nalthough happiness is subordinate to morality, morality is not the\n“complete good” because it does not encompass all that we\ndesire. \nKant then presents the highest good as a synthesis of morality and\nhappiness in order to meet the axiological principles of supremacy and\ncompleteness. More specifically, he presents the highest good as an\nideal state of affairs in which there is a proportional distribution\nof happiness in accordance with moral worth (A809/B837, AK 5:110 &\n5:145 [1788]; AK 5:471 [1790]; AK 6:8n & 6:99 [1793]; AK 8:139\n[1785a]; AK 8:281 [1764]). Nevertheless, some interpreters have\nproposed that Kant withdrew this formulation in later years,\nsupporting instead the notion that the highest good reflects the idea\nof maximal happiness and maximal morality as two independent variables\n(Reath 1988, Guyer 2011, Moran 2012). However, Pasternack (2017a)\nargues at length that the corpus neither supports this nor the\nputative abandonment of one or both of the postulates of God and\nimmortality (see\n section 3.5.2\n below). \nAlthough Kant enumerates three postulates, freedom, God, and\nimmortality, their etiologies differ. In contrast to the latter two,\nthe postulate of freedom is more directly tied to the fact of reason,\ntaken as a necessary condition for the bindingness of the moral law\nupon us. By contrast, the postulates of God and Immortality are rooted\nin the highest good. As such, we will here only be concerned with the\nlatter two “religious” postulates. \nWhile the Critique of Pure Reason shows some sympathy for the\nArgument from Design, Kant remarks that it can only get us to a\n“Wise Author of Nature”, a being who is responsible for\nthe order of nature, rather than a creator, a being with infinite\ncapacities, or a moral being. By contrast, the Canon of the First\nCritique advances a conception of God as omnipotent,\nomniscient, and omnibenevolent. Hence, as there argued, in order for\nthe highest good to obtain, there must be a being capable of arranging\nthe world such that happiness is exactly proportioned to moral worth.\nThis being must further have the cognitive powers necessary to judge\nor moral worth, and, presumably, a will aligned with morality. \nKant explains that our construction of the classic conception of God\nas omnipotent, omniscient and all good gains its validity through the\nneed for this being as the agent responsible for the distribution of\nhappiness in proportion to moral worth (A816/B845–A819/B847). It\nis through morality and the highest good that we “produced a\nconcept of the divine being that we now hold to be correct”\n(A818/B846). Likewise, “What does it Mean to Orient Oneself in\nThinking”, Kant explains that the very “concept\nof God and even the conviction of his existence” arises\nthrough our practical needs and that these needs operate as the\n“signpost or compass by means of which the speculative thinker\norients himself in his rational excursions into the field of\nsupersensible objects” (AK 8:142 [1785a]). In other words, while\ntheoretical reason on its own ventures into this field without any\nvalid warrants, the needs of practical reason, from which we form both\nour concepts of the postulates and the basis for our assent, is, Kant\nmaintains, the sole basis by which we may extend our cognition (i.e.,\nvalid construction of concepts) into the supersensible. \nThe postulate of immortality is typically found alongside Kant’s\ndiscussions of the postulate of God. He regards both as necessary\nconditions for the realization of the highest good, though the\nfunction of this postulate undergoes a number of revisions through the\nCritical period. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant presents two distinct\narguments for it. The first is a non-moral argument and is found in\nthe B-Paralogism, after his rejection of Mendelssohn’s argument\nfor the same. Mendelssohn’s argument builds off the thesis that\nthe soul is a simple entity and cessation of existence involves a\ndissolution of one part and then another. He thus concludes that since\nthe soul is simple, it is impossible for it to cease to exist. Kant\nrejects this argument on the grounds that even simple beings can have\na degree of reality (an intensive magnitude) that can diminish to\nzero, he shortly thereafter presents his own argument for the\nsoul’s immortality, one that has a similar metaphysical bent:\n(a) since throughout nature there is a proportionality between\npurposes and the conditions for the realization of those purposes,\nthere should be a similar proportionality between our capacities and\nthe conditions for their realization, and (b) since the grandeur of\nour capacities, including both our natural talents and moral vocation,\nexceeds what can be realized in this life, it follows (c) that we are\njustified in affirming a “future life”. This argument, or\none very similar to it, is also present in the Canon’s\ndiscussion of “doctrinal belief” [doctrinale\nGlaube]. However, this is not an argument that endures beyond the\n1780s. It is absent in later works, and in the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant explicitly dismisses it along with all other\nnon-moral arguments for the afterlife (cf. AK 5:460 & 5:468\n[1790]). \nThe other and better known argument for this postulate is first found\nin the Critique of Pure Reason’s Canon. Like his\nargument for the postulate of God, Kant also argues that we must\npostulate the immortality of the soul as a necessary condition for the\ndistribution of happiness in the highest good. Given the exigencies of\nthe natural order, this distribution cannot be secured within this\norder. We must therefore posit a “future life”, a\n“Kingdom of Grace” where “every happiness awaits us\nas long as we do not ourselves limit our share of it through the\nunworthiness to be happy” (A812/B840). Hence, in the First\nCritique, the purpose of the afterlife is to provide a domain\nfor the highest good’s distribution of happiness. \nBefore moving forward, let us discuss the belief found in some\nquarters (Reath 1989, Rawls 2000, Guyer 2005) that Kant abandoned the\npostulate of immortality in the 1790s. \nThe most common claim used to support this assertion is that\nKant’s uses the phrase “highest good in the world”\n(AK 5:450 [1790]) in the Critique of Judgment in order to\nsignal a shift away from an afterlife ideal distribution of happiness\nin proportion to moral worth to the ideal of the highest good as\nconnected with our ordinary corporeal existence. What, however, Kant\nmeans by “in the world” requires some investigation before\nany such conclusions can be drawn. \nFirst, Kant directly discusses what he intends by “world”\nin the Critique of Pure Reason where he explains to readers\nthat he will be using “nature” to refer to “the\nunity in the existence of appearances” (A419/B447) versus\n“world”, which has a “transcendental sense”,\nsuch that when dealing with cosmological ideas, “world”\ngoes beyond just the phenomenal to the “sum total of existing\nthings” (A419/B447). \nSecond, we see “world” used in this manner throughout the\ncorpus, including passages where it is quite clear that Kant uses\n“world” in its “transcendental sense”,\nextending beyond just the realm of nature (e.g., A811/B839, A813/B839,\nAK 5:143 [1788], AK 8:139 [1785a], 20:298. In fact, Kant even\ndescribes the postulate of immortality as obtaining “in the\nworld” at the opening of his discussion of this postulate in the\nCritique of Practical Reason (AK 5:122—see also 5:143\n[1788]). \nThird, the highest good is linked with the immortality of the soul\ncontinually through the texts of the 1790s, including the Critique of\nJudgment, where it can be found more than a dozen times through its\nfinal section. It is mentioned briefly in the “Theodicy”\nessay of 1791 (AK 8:262 & 8:269n), in multiple passages throughout\nthe Religion, in “The End of All Things” (AK\n8:328–330 [1794]) in the Conflict of the Faculties (AK\n7:40, 7:44, etc. [1798]), the 1796 “Proclamation” Essay\n(AK 8:418–419), as well as in “Real Progress” (AK\n20:298). Accordingly, despite the stature of those who put forward the\nclaim that Kant abandoned the postulate of immortality circa 1790, it\nis a claim that does not attend to either how Kant uses\n“world” versus “nature”, nor the surfeit of\naffirmative discussions about the afterlife through the 1790s. \nFourth, supporters of the abandonment thesis assert that Kant no\nlonger needs the postulate of immorality (and perhaps God) because in\nthe 1790s he further abandons his earlier picture of the highest good\nas a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral worth, adopting\ninstead the idea that this ideal is composed of maximal happiness and\nmaximal morality as two independent variables. The basis for this\nclaim is his 1793 essay “On the Common Saying: ‘That may\nbe Correct in Theory, but it is of no use in Practice’”\nwhere Kant describes the highest good as “universal happiness\ncombined with and in conformity with the purest morality throughout\nthe world” (AK 8:279). Yet the interpretative merits of this\nclaim built upon this passage are greatly diminished once one attends\nto the footnote Kant attaches to it, where he explains that he does\nnot mean happiness on its own, “but only of a proportion between\nit and the worthiness of a subject” (AK 8:280n). \nThe abandonment thesis is further defended by Guyer (2016) where in\naddition to building his case for this thesis based upon the\naforementioned depiction of the highest good at AK 8:279, he also\nargues that in the Religion Kant has given up the Second\nCritique’s rationale for the postulate of immortality,\nnamely, immortality as required for the sake of an eternal striving\nfor perfection. Rather than being tied to (striving for) perfection,\nwe find in the Religion that our moral worthiness is instead\ntied to our supreme maxim or “change of heart”. \nThat is, Guyer proposes that the standard for moral worthiness offered\nby Kant in the Religion no longer itself requires the\npostulation of immortality. This is a view likewise advanced by\nPasternack (2014: 142–146) in his discussion of the\n“change of heart” in the Religion. Unlike what is\nfound in the Second Critique, in both the Religion\nand “The End of All Things” (1794), Kant presents our\nafterlife fate as solely dependent upon (or should be viewed as solely\ndependent upon) what we can morally achieve in this life (AK\n6:69n–71n [1793], AK 8:328–330 [1794]). Hence, once our\nmoral worthiness is understood as something to be achieved in this\nlife, how one interprets Kant’s commitment to the postulate\ncentrally turns on how one interprets his views on the distribution of\nhappiness within the highest good. \nAs discussed through this subsection, Kant’s views on the\npostulate of immortality through the Critical period involve these\nthree core issues: (a) the standard for moral worth articulated by\nKant in various texts; (b) whether Kant continues to regard the\nhighest good as a distribution of happiness in proportion to moral\nworth versus as maximal happiness and maximal morality as two\nindependent variables; and (c) whether or not the distribution of\nhappiness (especially if taken as proportionate to moral worth)\ndepends upon the postulate of immortality (i.e., cannot take place\nwithin the causal order of nature). Beyond these three core issues,\nfurther issues include: (d) the limitations to and relevance of our\nspeculations about the nature of the afterlife (see AK\n6:69n–6:71n [1793] and AK 8:328–332 [1794]) and (e) the\nhistorical backdrop for Kant’s engagement with various models of\nthe afterlife (see Bunch 2010). \nIn October 1794, Kant received a royal rescript from the court of\nFrederick William II reprimanding him for his heterodox writings on\nChristianity and prohibiting him from further publication which\n“distort and disparage” Christianity (cf. AK 7:6\n[1798]). In his official response (unknown date, but late October 1794\nis most likely), Kant agreed to “hereafter refrain altogether\nfrom discoursing publicly, in lectures or writing, on religion,”\nbut also protested that his writings nevertheless have made\n“no appraisal of Christianity” (AK 7:8\n[1798]). \nPutting aside the question as to whether Kant might have prevaricated\nin his response, the question remains: to what extent does Kant engage\nwith Christian doctrine and to what extent is his philosophical\ntheology compatible with it? On the one hand, there are\nepistemological questions which we have addressed elsewhere in this\nentry. But there is also the question of whether or not Kant saw his\nwork as compatible or at odds with such core Christian doctrines as\nOriginal Sin, Grace, the Incarnation, and Vicarious Atonement. We will\nhere consider four interpretative positions. \nSome interpreters have claimed that the Religion serves as\nKant’s philosophical defense of traditional Christian doctrines,\nand that it succeeds in this regard. This is a view advanced by Chris\nFirestone and Nathan Jacobs in their In Defense of Kant’s\nReligion. For example, these authors hold that Kant’s\nportrayal of moral evil in Part One is shaped by an “Augustinian\nmetaphysic” (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), that in Part Two\nKant promotes the idea of the Incarnation, utilizing a\n“Scotistic understanding of divine being” (Firestone &\nJacobs 2008: 161) and that Part Four not only concludes with an\nargument for the “priority of belief in Christianity” but\ndefends the necessity of special revelation which, as they earlier\nclaim, is necessary for Kant’s critical philosophy as a whole\n(Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 115). \nA similar position is advanced by Stephen Palmquist who finds in the\nReligion not only an examination of those aspects of rational\nreligion which conform with Christian doctrine, but also a\nphilosophical defense of the need for revelation. Palmquist claims,\nfor example, that Religion’s treatment of Original Sin\nis used by Kant to articulate “what we might call a Christ-sized\n‘hole’ in the heart of humanity’s rational\ncapacity” (Palmquist 2016: 165), that Kant “regarded the\nChristian Gospel as a genuine revelation” (Palmquist 2016: 166)\nand that an otherwise deficient “bare reason” requires\nrevelatory content in order that we may “believe” in our\nown capacity to imitate the “archetype of perfection”\n(Palmquist 2016: 166). That is, Palmquist contends that, in line with\ntraditional Christianity, Kant regards our salvation as dependent upon\nhaving faith in the historical reality of the Incarnation. \nA second school of interpretation likewise maintains that Kant wrote\nthe Religion for the purposes of offering a philosophical\ndefense of traditional Christian doctrines. This school, however,\nholds that he was ultimately unsuccessful. This is a view which\nprincipally flows from Karl Barth’s 1947 Die protestantische\nTheologie im 19. Jahrhundert, and is adopted by a group of later\nphilosophers of religion including members of the school of\n“Reformed Epistemology”, including Philip Quinn, Nicholas\nWolterstorff and John Hare. \nWithin Kant circles, they are best known for the so-called\n“Conundrum” interpretation of Kant’s\nReligion, where these authors protest that Kant’s\nventure into philosophical theology is not only inconsistent with the\nepistemic strictures of Transcendental Idealism (Wolterstorff 1998),\nbut also is internally inconsistent in virtue of the fact that its\nunderstanding of Original Sin is essentially Augustinian while its\nunderstanding of moral restoration is Pelagian. Wolterstorff goes so\nfar as to claim that Kant’s philosophical theology suffers from\n“not just implausibility or tension, but internal\ncontradiction” (Wolterstorff 1991: 49). Likewise, John Hare\n(1996) declares it an outright “failure” and Gordon\nMichalson (1990) contends that the Religion contains a litany\nof “wobbles” between incompatible Christian and\nEnlightenment commitments. \nAlthough there are a number of other targets of criticism, their main\ncontention is that Kant inconsistently accepts (a) the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin which holds that our moral capacities have\nthrough the Fall been damaged in such a way that we are incapable of\nmoral improvement without Sanctifying Grace; and yet (b) Kant\nsubscribes to what they call his “Stoic Maxim” that\n“a person’s moral worth is determined entirely by that\nperson himself” (Wolterstorff 1991: 48). Recently, Andrew\nChignell has accepted the essence of the “Conundrum”\nobjection, relying upon it as a reason why Kant must appeal to hope:\nsince Kant’s alleged “Stoic Maxim” leaves no room\nfor divine aid, and yet divine aid seems to be needed, it can be (at\nbest) an object of hope, since unlike other propositional attitudes,\nhope is rationally permissible in the face of a (seeming)\nimpossibility so long as it does not rise to an impossibility of\n“the most fundamental modal level” (Chignell 2014:\n114–115). \nA third school holds that despite appearances to the contrary, the\nReligion does not engage in “theological speculation\nconcerning the doctrine of grace in any form” (DiCenso 2012:\n117). This view is advanced by James DiCenso in his 2012 commentary on\nthe Religion, and more recently by Allen Wood in his Kant\nand Religion (2020). The former’s 2012 commentary\nadvises that we avoid any literal reading of religious doctrines in\nthe text, and that we should instead interpret Kant’s treatment\nof them as presenting no more than our moral ideals in\n“imaginatively enhanced or pictorial form” (2012:\n28).  Likewise, in the latter’s Kant and\nReligion (2020), the author presents\nthe Religion as a study of how we can understand\nChristianity’s presentation of a “second-person relationship\nbetween myself and God” (Wood 2020: 137) as instead symbols\nfor a first-person “self-relation” (Wood 2020: 137,\n143) through which we gain “a meaningful and\nemotionally enriched way of relating to our own past” (Wood\n2020: 145). Interestingly, these interpretations\ncohere with certain interpretations of Kant’s philosophical\ntheology in the Opus Postumum (see Section 4 below), with\nboth extending not only the thesis that God, for Kant, is nothing but\na symbol of our moral ideals, but that all religious doctrines\ninvolving the supersensible should likewise be interpreted as\nsuch. \nFurther, both interpretations pick up on a number of comments in\nthe Religion where Kant associates the historical side of\nreligion with our need for symbols to help us with the “highest\nconcepts and grounds of reason” (AK 6:109 [1793]) and hopes for\na future time where we will no longer need “all statutes that\nrest on history” (AK 6:121 [1793]). Nevertheless, this aspect\nof Kant’s treatment of religion does not apply to the\npostulates, nor does it pertain to the underlying moral/theological\nissues which are symbolized in specific doctrines (e.g., our innate\npropensity to evil as represented in the story of Genesis, or our hope\nfor divine as represented in the Crucifixion). \nWhat principally differentiates DiCenso (2012) and Wood (2020),\nhowever, is that the former’s hermeneutic denies outright that Kant\never engages with any doctrine in its literal form, whereas the latter\nsees the core goal of the Religion to “interpret\nrevealed Christianity in such a way … [to] show that reason and\nChristianity are allies, not enemies” (Wood 2020: 20). But in\norder to realize that goal, doctrines have to be rendered as just\nsymbols. So, while Wood recognizes that Kant rejects various doctrines\n(e.g. the story of Abraham and Isaac on Wood 2020: 14; and the\ninheritability of sin on Wood 2020: 62), such rejections occur only\nwhen doctrines are understood literally.  Accordingly, Wood would have\nus look past Kant’s engagements with literal doctrines and take Kant\nas claiming that they need to be understood just as symbols. This\nwould then allow for the thesis that “everything in revealed\n(Christian) faith is compatible with rational faith” (Wood 2020:\n20), which Wood asserts is the aim of the so-called “Second\nExperiment” of the\nReligion, i.e. the goal of the Second Experiment is\nto “disprove the hypothesis... [that] there are parts\nof revealed Christianity that are demonstrably and permanently\nincompatible with rational religion” (Wood 2020: 20).  \nA fourth interpretative position is that the aim of Religion\nis to (a) examine the scope of “unity” or\n“compatibility” between rational religion and historical\nfaith and (b) evaluate which aspects of historical faith (with\nChristianity being the primary focus) are apt vehicles for rational\nreligion versus those which are incompatible with it (Pasternack\n2014). Hence, the Religion was not written as a Christian\napologetic, but rather is Kant’s inquiry into the relationship\nbetween natural theology and revealed religion. However, unlike the\nmany other such inquiries written during the era, Kant’s own\nversion of natural theology is one that shaped by moral rather than\ntheoretical reason. \nBy way of this interpretative framework, Pasternack (2014) maintains\nthat the Religion is both compatible with the epistemic\nstrictures of Transcendental Idealism (contrary the interpretations\nsummarized above) as well as internally consistent. As for the\ndiscussions where Kant appears to be guided by an “Augustinian\nmetaphysic” (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), “firmly\nensconced within the Augustinian tradition” (Quinn 1988: 91) or\n“accommodating” (Wood 1970: 246) tenets “fundamental\nto Augustine” (Beiser 2006: 594), he is rather examining such\ntenets in order to determine whether or not they have\n“unity” or “compatibility” with rational\nreligion. Such doctrines as Original Sin, Grace, the Incarnation,\nVicarious Atonement and so forth are thus examined by Kant in the\nReligion in order to, in each case, assess whether or not\nthey cohere with his moral anthropology and doctrine of the highest\ngood. \nUntil the recent spate of commentaries on the Religion,\nlittle work has been done on its overall aims and structure. Although\nPart One of the text has long been mined for insights into\nKant’s picture of the moral agency, such studies did not\nconsider how the overall text might inform the passages minded\ntherefrom. The last decade, however, has seen the publication of a\nnumber of commentaries on the Religion, each with their own\ndistinctive interpretations (Firestone & Jacobs 2008, DiCenso\n2012, Pasternack 2014, Miller 2015, Palmquist 2016), most of whose\nauthors are mentioned in this entry. The above section also provides a\nbrief overview of their respective positions with regards to the\nrelationship between Kant’s Religion and core Christian\ndoctrines. In this section, we will briefly review what Kant himself\nsays about his project and how it unfolds through its four parts. \nTo begin, the publication of the Religion (1793) has a\ncomplicated history. Kant initially planned to write a series of\nessays on Christian doctrines, but that was frustrated when the second\nof these essays was denied official imprimatur. Because the Prussian\nCensorship Commission had different rules for the publication of\narticles versus books, Kant chose to combine the planned essays into a\nsingle volume, and to avoid further scrutiny by the Commission, he\nmade sure that it was assessed as a work of philosophy rather than\ntheology. Although such maneuvers ultimately led to his censorship\nduring the reign of Frederick William II, Kant nevertheless was able\nto publish the Religion, whose First Preface includes, after\nan initial discussion of how through the highest good “morality\nleads inevitably to religion” (AK 6:8n), a defense of his\nrationale for treating the work as one of philosophical theology\nrather than “biblical theology” (AK 6:7–6:11). The\nPreface then ends with Kant’s characterization of the\nReligion as an “attempt” or\n“experiment” (Versuch) at determining the scope\nof overlap between the “pure philosophical doctrine of\nreligion” (AK 6:10) and the contents of historical faith\n(especially Christianity). \nThe Preface to the second edition begins with a discussion of the\nReligion’s title, which as Kant explains, is meant to\ndepict two overlapping domains, the “wider sphere of\nfaith” and the “narrower” sphere of the “pure\nreligion of reason” (AK 6:12). Kant then writes that\nfrom “this standpoint I can also make this second\nexperiment” (zweiten Versuch), without, however,\nexplicitly enumerating a “first experiment”. \nSome have proposed (Hare 1996, Reardon 1988) that the unstated\n“first experiment” pertains to the domain of overlap\nbetween Biblical Theology and the Pure Rational System of Religion.\nThe Second Experiment then seeks \nto show that certain items in the outer circle lead back within the\ninner circle when looked at in the light of, or translated in terms of\nmoral concepts. (Hare 1996: 40) \nOthers have proposed that the First Experiment pertains to the\nReligion’s “transcendental elements” while\nthe Second Experiment “aims at assessing one particular\nempirical religion”, namely Christianity (Palmquist 2000: 143),\nor serves as a philosophical apologetic for Christianity (Firestone\n& Jacobs 2008). \nPasternack (2017b), however, argues that the interpretative debate\nover the first/second experiment distinction rests on a simple\nmistake. Normally, Versuch would be translated as\n“attempt”, but early Anglophone translators of the\nReligion chose instead “experiment”. That choice\nhas passed along through contemporary translations and has led\ninterpreters to make far too much of this passage. The passage appears\ntowards the opening of the Preface to the second edition of\nthe Religion and is, as argued by Pasternack, merely meant by\nKant to indicate that he is issuing his second attempt\n[zweiten Versuch] at the very same non-enumerated\n“experiment” [Versuch] similarly described in the\nPreface to the first edition (compare the language at AK 6:10\nin the First Preface to AK 6:12 in the Second). In other words,\nPasternack asserts that the many attempts to divide out the\nReligion into two distinct “experiments” is an\nunfortunate byproduct of the secondary literature, unrelated to the\nactual structure of the text. \nWhat both Prefaces ultimately explain is that Kant’s goal in the\nReligion is to (a) provide an inquiry into the scope of\noverlap between historical faith (especially in the form of\nChristianity) and pure rational religion; and (b) use the latter as a\nguide for distinguishing between which elements of the former are\nmatters of “genuine religion” rather than\n“cult” (AK 6:12–13). Each of the\nReligion’s four parts then take on core issues with\nChristian doctrine. \nIn Part One, Kant’s aim is to examine the Christian doctrine of\nOriginal Sin, especially as he would have been exposed to it through\nhis Lutheran Pietist upbringing. His interest is in finding out\nwhether there is any overlap between this historical doctrine and pure\nrational religion. More specifically, his goal is to assess the\ndoctrine of Original Sin so as to determine what (if any) overlap it\nhas with rational religion. He thus considers such matters as: how can\nour moral condition be innate and yet we can remain responsible for\nit; whether, as would have been held by the Augustinian tradition,\nOriginal Sin involves such a fundamental corruption of our faculties\nthat we lose the cognitive and volitional capacities needed to will\nthe good; and then in the “General Remark” or first\nParergon, whether or not our corrupted moral condition is\nsuch that divine aid is required for us to overcome it. Throughout, we\nsee Kant taking up these and other themes within the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin, sometimes finding places of overlap with\nrational religion, sometimes finding the two in conflict. \nThe Second Part of the Religion moves on to Christology and\nthe alleged role of Christ in our salvation. Kant begins with a\ndiscussion of the Incarnation and whether it can be interpreted in\nsuch a way that is compatible with pure rational religion (AK\n6:60–6:66). He then moves on to three\n“difficulties:” how to understand the doctrine of\nSanctifying Grace (the “change of heart” or moral\nregeneration) in relation to pure rational religion; whether an\nindividual can know his/her moral status as having undergone a\n“change of heart”, and how this relates to the challenge\nof moral perseverance; how to understand the “debt of sin”\nor the issue of “Justifying Grace”. On this issue, we\nagain see Kant opposing the prevailing doctrines of his day,\nexplicitly rejecting the idea of “vicarious atonement” (AK\n6:72–73) as anathema to pure rational religion. \nThe Third Part of the Religion considers religion from a\nhistorical standpoint, including the need for the founding of a\nuniversal church, the importance of that church for the moral\nimprovement of society (the “ethical community”),\nquestions of divine providence, and eschatology. \nKant’s focus in this part is the social dimension of moral evil,\nwhere he draws from the Predisposition to Humanity discussed in Part\nOne (see Wood 1999), and argues that we “mutually corrupt each\nother’s moral dispositions and make one another evil” (AK\n6:94). The goal of the universal church is to promote a new sort of\nsocial exchange guided by our collective “duty sui\ngeneris” of human beings to work cooperatively towards\n“a common end, namely the promotion of the highest good”\n(AK 6:97). The ethical community is then presented as an ideal state\nof affairs reflecting the realization of the highest good. \nThe final part of the Religion focuses on ecclesiology. After\nan initial discussion of the religious framework for the ethical\ncommunity, Kant offers an important discussion of Christianity as a\nnatural versus a “learned” religion. The point of the\nformer is that “genuine religion”, is one that can be\n“comprehensibly and convincingly” communicated to all\nhuman beings “through their own reason” (AK 6:162) without\nany necessary role for revelation. The latter, by contrast, turns to\nthe “dogmas of faith” (AK 6:163) and its dangers. This\nbegins Kant’s discussion of “counterfeit service”,\n“priestcraft” and the “delusions of religion”\nhe sees in ecclesiastical practice. While rational religion maintains\nthat nothing apart from “good life-conduct” is required to\n“become well-pleasing to God” (AK 6:170), historical faith\nroutinely claims that God’s judgment is based instead on our\ndoctrinal commitments and liturgical observances. \nTherein, Kant examines the ultimate “subjective ground of\nreligious delusion” (AK 6:168), how the artificies of organized\nreligion let us “slip back into evil” (AK 6:184) and then\nfinally how practices including prayer, church attendance, and rituals\ncould nevertheless still be reconstituted for the genuine moral\nreligion of a universal church and “cosmopolitan moral\ncommunity” (AK 6:194–200). \nEach of the four parts of the Religion close with a section\nentitled “General Remark” or “Parergon”\n(Supplement or Appendix) to its main body. In the Second Edition to\nthe Religion, Kant adds a brief explanation of the function\nof the Parerga, describing them as concerned with matters\nwhich are at the “border” of the “boundaries of pure\nreason”. He lists these as: (1) the effects of grace; (2)\nmiracles; (3) the holy mysteries; (4) the means of grace. Kant\nexplains that reason \ndoes not contest the possibility or actuality of the objects of these\nideas; it just cannot incorporate them into its maxims of thought or\naction. (AK 6:52) \nThey are topics to which we are lead given the issues under discussion\nthrough the main body of each part, but are all matters of caution for\nus for while they each pertain to a need that seems unfulfilled\nthrough what pure reason can allow for genuine religion, and in some\nmanner may invigorate our moral lives, they are all also paths to\n“dogmatic faith” (6:52). \nHence, each part of the Religion ends with a caution somewhat\nakin to the cautions which shape the Critique of Pure\nReason’s Dialectic: though the needs of reason drive us to\nspeculation, we must not fall into error thereby. For example, while\nthe logic of ought implies can warrants our belief that a\n“change of heart” is possible, we cannot either affirm or\ndeny a role for divine aid/grace. Likewise, while Transcendental\nIdealism leaves room for the possibility of a “supernatural\nintervention” (AK 6:191), we are not epistemically situated so\nthat we can ever justifiably claim that some particular effect was in\nfact due to such intervention. \nThe parerga thus are used by Kant to separate out what\ndoctrines of historical faith the pure rational system of religion can\nassess versus what doctrines that—while we are compelled to\nspeculate about them—require our agnosticism. As such, the\nparerga reflect limit issues, at the “border” of\nrational religion, for which there is both a theoretical interest and\nmoral need to visit, but also where the dangers that we stray into\ndogmatism are the greatest (Palmquist 2016, Muchnik 2019). \nIn the mid-1790s, Kant began to explore what he saw as a “gap...\nin the critical philosophy” (Kant to Garve, September 21, 1798\nAK 12:257), namely, how to transition from what he established about\nnatural science in general in the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science to physics in particular. However, his notes on\nthis “gap” exceeded his original plan, as they came to\ncover not only how to transition from the foundations of natural\nscience to physics, but also self-positing, God, and the nature of\ntranscendental philosophy. These notes, which were composed during a\nroughly seventeen-year period, and came to be assembled under the\ntitle, Opus Postumum, prompt questions as to whether or not\nKant’s views on God during this period represent a break from or\ncontinuity with the philosophy of religion he presented in his\nprevious works. And further, if there is continuity, in what way might\nits contents help to illuminate Kant’s overall Critical\nphilosophy of religion? \nFor instance, there are many passages in the Opus Postumum\nwhich present God not as a substance or a being outside of us, but\nrather an ideal or thought-object. For some, this is taken as an\nindication that in Kant’s final years, he withdrew from his more\naffirmative religious views seen up through the mid-1790s\n(Förster 2000). While for others, it finally articulates the view\nthat Kant held throughout the Critical period, namely that despite\ntextual evidence to the contrary, Kant never advanced any argument,\nmoral or otherwise, for belief in God (W. Sullivan 1971, Guyer 2000,\nByrne 2007). \nNevertheless, amidst the passages in the Opus Postumum which\npresent God as merely an ideal or thought-object, there are others\nwhich are not so deflationary, presenting God in a manner similar to\nthe more familiar works of the Critical period (AK 21:13–14 [OP\n220–222], AK 22:126–127 [OP 206–207]). \nOne way to understand these discrepancies is to recognize that the\nOpus Postumum is a collection of notes written over more than\na decade, unedited, and possibly different from what would have been\nthe final version of the treatise. Hence, Kant might have been\nrethinking his philosophy of religion, exploring possibilities, or\nworking through some ideas which could fill his perceived “gap\nin the critical philosophy”, ideas that neither undercut the\nepistemic strictures of the Critique of Pure Reason nor the\nreligiously affirmative language in his practical philosophy. \nFurther, though Kant sometimes describes God as an ideal or\nthought-object, he also says the same about the world and\nman-in-the-world, raising the possibility that his discussions of God\ntook place in two separate spheres: transcendental philosophy proper,\nwhich provides the purely formal conditions of metaphysics and so\nincludes only the ideals we must construct in order to posit ourselves\nin the world (namely, God, the world, and man-in-the-world); and\nmetaphysics, which is transcendental philosophy applied to certain\nobjects (“[the transcendental philosopher] addresses merely what\nis formal, [the metaphysician] what is material (the object, the\nmaterial)” [AK 21:79 [OP: 246]]). If this is right, then it\ncould be that Kant does not repudiate or deflate his prior philosophy\nof religion, but merely adds a new layer to it. Unfortunately, the\nOpus Postumum’s unfinished state makes it difficult to\ncome to a secure conclusion about where Kant’s thinking on\nreligion stood in his final years.","contact.mail":"courtney.fugate@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
