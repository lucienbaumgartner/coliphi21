Having received an extensive\neducation in Paris, he spent most of his life as an active servant of\nthe church. An associate of Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury\nduring his dispute with King Henry II of England, John eventually was\nraised to the office of Bishop of Chartres. John’s thought has\nbeen characterized as “humanistic”, since he valorizes the\ndignity of humanity and of nature generally: The latter is\nintelligible and may be understood through the application of natural\nreason. Yet John admitted that severe impediments exist to the\nattainment of wisdom. Throughout his writings, he professed to follow\nthe moderate skepticism of Cicero and the New Academy, which rejected\ndogmatic claims to certainty. The best that rational human inquiry may\nin most matters achieve, John says, is probable truth, always subject\nto re-evaluation and revision. The general tenor of his philosophy is\nreflected in his advocacy of moderation and his emphasis on nature as\na normative guide to earthly fulfillment. John composed several\ntreatises of philosophical interest, most notably the\nPolicraticus (PC), but also the Metalogicon (ML) and\nthe Entheticus de dogmate philosophorum (EMM). These works were all\ncompleted between 1154 and 1159, during the period of John’s\nservice to Archbishop Theobald, Becket’s predecessor at the see\nof Canterbury. John’s other writings—two letter\ncollections, two hagiographies, and a history—evince the\npractical application of his philosophical commitments.\n\nJohn of Salisbury was born at Old Sarum (the former site of Salisbury)\nin England between 1115 and 1120. Specific knowledge of his family\nbackground and early life is scant; something is known of a brother,\nRichard, and a half-brother, Robert, both of whom held offices within\nthe English church. John probably received an early education at\nSalisbury and then at Exeter. The first date safely associated with\nhim is 1136, when he traveled to Paris to study at\nMont-Sainte-Geneviève. In a famous autobiographical passage in\nthe Metalogicon, John narrates his twelve years of education,\nan important source for understanding French higher instruction in\nthis period. The list of his teachers includes many of the great\nthinkers of the mid-twelfth century, among them Peter Abelard, Robert\nof Melun, William of Conches, Thierry of Chartres, Adam de Petit Pont,\nGilbert of Poitiers, and Robert Pullan. John’s studies\nencompassed speculative philosophy, rhetoric, linguistic theory,\nliterature, and theology. He seems to have tutored students during his\nlater years in Paris. It was also during these years (specifically,\n1141 to 1147) that John likely drafted the first two parts of his\n1852-line philosophical and satirical poem, the Entheticus de\ndogmate philosophorum (or Entheticus maior); the final\ntwo parts likely date from late 1154 to mid-1156 (the much shorter\nEntheticus minor prefaces the Policraticus). \nLike many educated churchmen of his era, John eventually entered the\ncorridors of power rather than the cloister or the classroom. Through\nthe assistance of his friend Peter of Celle, John joined, in 1148, the\nhousehold of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, a vocal and energetic\nadvocate of the rights of the English church. In his capacity as\nsecretary to Theobald, John was an omnicompetent administrator: He\ncomposed the Archbishop’s letters, advised him on legal and\npolitical affairs, traveled often to the Continent as an\narchiepiscopal envoy, and altogether lived in the manner of a trusted\nintimate. John’s first letter collection, which he assembled\nshortly after Theobald’s death in 1161, is largely comprised of\nofficial letters under Theobald’s name, augmented by letters\nJohn himself wrote on Canterbury’s behalf and some personal\nmissives. \nTheobald’s court attracted many clerics with training and\nexperience similar to John’s own, so he could continue to\nindulge his intellectual pursuits in a sympathetic environment during\nthe 1140s and 1150s. John was counted a member of a circle of learned\nclerics, among whom was Thomas Becket (the future archbishop and\nmartyr), who was a trusted servant of Theobald before he was appointed\nKing Henry II’s Chancellor in late 1154. John’s activities\non behalf of Theobald brought him into contact with some of the most\npowerful and prominent men of twelfth-century Europe. He was present\nat the Roman curia for many crucial occurrences during the pontificate\nof Eugenius III (1145–1153), the final four years of which he\nlater chronicled in his Historia Pontificalis (HP) (written\nduring the early period of his Becket-related exile, likely early 1164\nto early 1166). He enjoyed a warm friendship with his fellow\ncountryman Nicholas Breakspear, who ascended the papal throne as\nAdrian IV in 1154. John was also well-acquainted with important\nfigures in twelfth-century secular life, in France as well as England,\nmost especially Henry II. John had supported Henry’s side in the\nstruggle against the partisans of King Stephen during the period of\nEnglish history known as the Anarchy. John was, however, sufficiently\nvocal in his opposition to Henry’s policies toward the English\nchurch to be banished from the royal court during 1156 and 1157.\nAlthough he ultimately recovered favor, he acquired a lingering\nskepticism about Henry’s motives that was to be confirmed by\nlater events. As busy as John seems to have been with Canterbury\nadministration in the final years of Theobald’s archiepiscopacy,\nthis was also the period (late 1156 through late 1159) in which John\nproduced the two works for which he is best known and esteemed: the\nMetalogicon, which presents a survey of the scholastic\ncurriculum and a defense of the study of the trivium; and,\nthe Policraticus, a work of moral and political philosophy\ngrounded in a Ciceronian moderate skepticism and replete with\nexempla drawn from Biblical, patristic, and classical\nsources. \nAfter Becket became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, he began to\ndefend ecclesiastical liberty against Henry’s encroachments,\npartly in response to which Becket tasked John with composing (in\nearly 1163) a hagiography of Anselm—a prior Canterbury\narchbishop who’d wrestled with overreaching English\nmonarchs—in support of formal canonization. As the conflict\nbetween Becket and Henry deepened, John backed the church’s\ncause against the English crown, albeit somewhat reluctantly. John\nconsequently spent much of the 1160s in exile, either in France or at\nthe papal court, lobbying on behalf of Becket and against Henry and\nthe English bishops who backed the king. Most of the copious volume of\nletters contained in John’s second letter collection date from\nand form important testimony to this period. Following Becket’s\nmurder in December 1170, an event at which John was a bystander, he served\nthe English church in numerous capacities during the early 1170s.\nImportantly, John wrote one of the earliest hagiographies of Becket,\nused in support of an initial canonization effort. John was\nconsecrated Bishop of Chartres in 1176 (a post in which he dedicated\nhimself to promoting the cult of Becket). He died there in 1180 and is\nburied in the nearby abbey church of Notre-Dame-de-Josaphat. \nIt was once supposed that John of Salisbury was “the best-read\nman of the twelfth century” (Poole 1932: 191). Janet Martin,\nhowever, has convincingly demonstrated that much of John’s\nfamiliarity with Latin (and, to some extent, Greek) classics derived\nfrom so-called florilegia, collections of brief passages\n(Martin 1977, 1979, 1984). These compilations were probably readily\navailable in the extensive (pre-Reformation) library of Christ Church\nmonastery, attached to Canterbury Cathedral. This does not mean that\nJohn lacked direct acquaintance with ancient philosophical texts and\nideas. At minimum, a list of his personal library (which he left to\nChartres Cathedral, where he served as bishop from 1176 to 1180)\nmentions Cicero’s De officiis and De oratore,\nSeneca’s Naturalium quaestionum libros, and Valerius\nMaximus (Webb 1932: 65–69). Of course, John knew many more\nancient Latin authors and texts than those contained in his own\ncollection. In addition to Christ Church’s library, John’s\ntravels afforded him access to considerable textual resources.\nMoreover, intellectuals of the time often traded volumes or\ncommissioned copies thereof. Hence, the Latin philosophers, especially\nCicero and Seneca, enjoyed wide dissemination during the twelfth\ncentury, and John relied heavily upon them (see the comprehensive\noverview by Hermand-Schebat 2015). \nAmong the Greek philosophers, John’s knowledge was meager at\nbest, if only because the language of ancient Greece was almost\nentirely absent in the Latin West during the twelfth century. Until\nthe dissemination of Latin translations of the Aristotelian corpus,\nand a few works by Plato, over the course of the thirteenth century,\nlittle in the way of acquaintance was possible. The only one of\nPlato’s texts that John could have accessed was the\nTimaeus in the partial translation by Calcidius; among\nAristotle’s writings, he clearly was somewhat familiar with the\nsix books of the Organon, which formed the foundation for the\nAristotelian logical and “scientific” system. In an\nundated letter to his former teacher Richard of\nl’Évêque, John expresses interest in acquiring\n(unspecified) works by Aristotle (JL2: 294–95). (Bloch 2012\noffers a thorough analysis of the technical aspects of John’s\nuse of classical sources in his philosophy, with special, but not\nexclusive, attention to Aristotle.) \nYet John clearly knew a great deal more about the doctrines of the\nclassical Greek philosophers than this account might indicate. There were\na number of Latin-language writers who transmitted to the Middle Ages\naccounts of Greek philosophical teachings, including Apuleius,\nCalcidius, Cicero, Lactantius, and St. Augustine. Thus, for example,\nJohn was aware of the existence of Plato’s Republic and\nsome of its leading ideas, even though that text did not circulate in\nEurope until the fifteenth century (Dutton 1983; PC: 54, 137). He was\nalso able to make considerable reference to Epicurus, albeit primarily\nfiltered through the highly critical writings of Cicero and other\nLatin authors (Nederman and Bollermann 2011). And, the translated\ntexts of ancient Greek thinkers sometimes contained passing references\nto other of their philosophical precepts, forming so-called\n“underground” sources (a term applied to John by Nederman\nand Brückmann 1983: 228–29). One instance of this is\nJohn’s use of key elements of Aristotelian ethical theory in his\nmajor writings, nearly one hundred years before the circulation of a\nLatin version of the Nicomachean Ethics, explicable by\nAristotle’s occasional references to his moral principles in the\nOrganon (Nederman 1997). \nDespite the relative paucity of John’s access to ancient\nphilosophical writings, he pieced together a great deal of information\nabout the ideas posited by their authors. This was central to\nJohn’s vision of his intellectual enterprise. In a famous\ncomment in the Metalogicon, John speaks of the heritage to\nwhich he owes a great debt: \n… our age enjoys the benefit of the age preceding, and often\nknows more than it, not indeed because our intelligence outstrips\ntheirs, but because we depend on the strength of others and on the\nabundant learning of our ancestors. Bernard of Chartres used to say\nthat we are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants so that we\nare able to see more and further than they, not indeed by the\nsharpness of our own vision or the height of our bodies, but because\nwe are lifted up on high and raised aloft by the greatness of giants.\nWith these words I will readily concur…. (ML: 257) \nWhile what John owes to the great Christian theologians of the past\nshould by no means be diminished, he clearly and stridently viewed\nhimself as heir to the ancient traditions of philosophical inquiry.\nFor this reason, among others, the term “humanist” has\nbeen bestowed upon him (by Leibschütz 1950 and more recently\nNederman 2005: 41–43, but challenged by Olsen 1998 and later\nBloch 2012: 61). The issue is not whether John read his classical\npredecessors “accurately”, but how he found inspiration in\nand adapted them in such a manner as to defend and further his own\nendeavors as a philosopher. \nThe most fundamental of John’s philosophical commitments arises\nexpressly from Cicero. Beyond John’s self-conscious (and largely\nsuccessful) effort to imitate Cicero’s polished style of Latin\nexpression, he embraces the Ciceronian dedication to the program of\nthe New Academy (Nederman 2005; Grellard 2013). The New Academy\nadvocated an anti-dogmatic probabilistic theory of knowledge according\nto which claims to certainty remain open to challenge, so long as they\nhave not been demonstrated beyond doubt. Cicero distanced himself from\nthe more radically skeptical method of the so-called “Old\nAcademy”, which denied that anything whatsoever could be known\nwith certainty (Cicero De natura deorum: 1.1). As Cicero explains, the New Academy\ndoes not foreclose the possibility of the human mind attaining truth\n(pace the Old Academy), only insisting that the criteria for\ndiscerning truth from falsity are not self-evident or intuitive and\nthat the senses can be deceived (Cicero Academica: 2.24.76–2.30.98).\nCicero’s skeptical stance has the character not of absolute\ndoubt but of anti-dogmatism. \nJohn overtly adopted the same Ciceronian New Academic perspective in\nall of his noteworthy contributions to philosophy: the\nPolicraticus, the Metalogicon, and the\nEntheticus de dogmate philosophorum maior. The first is his\nbest-known work, a treatise on proper courtly and royal conduct which\ncontains a great measure of political theory; the second comprises his\ncritical appraisal of the state of education in twelfth-century\nEurope, with special attention to the advances in knowledge occasioned\nby the Aristotelian learning of his time; the last is a lengthy\ndidactic poem. While scholars have normally treated these writings as\ndiscrete and largely unrelated (Wilks 1984a and von Moos 1984 are\nexceptions), they are united methodologically by their shared\nendorsement and application of Ciceronian moderate skepticism, which\nproves to be crucial in framing the substance of John’s\nphilosophical stance. Charles B. Schmitt’s claim that\nJohn’s “treatment [of the New Academy] has little\nphilosophical sophistication” proves unsustainable (Schmitt\n1972: 37–38). \nBecause John enjoyed broad access to Cicero’s main works of\nphilosophy, he possessed a comprehensive understanding of the issues\nat stake in adherence to New Academic skepticism (Denery 2016),\nclearly grasping the epistemological differences underpinning moderate\nand rigorous skeptical stances. In his Entheticus maior, John\nchides the radically skeptical view of the Old Academy that “the\nhuman race is deprived of light” (EMM: 1.138), endorsing the\nposition associated with the New Academy that  \none should hesitate in all things except those which are proved by\nliving reason … These things, [the Academic] declares, are\nknown; he passes doubtfully on other things, of which more certainty\nis to be had from experience. For the usual course of events makes\nprobable what you always see under a similar pattern. Yet, since it\nsometimes happens otherwise, these things are not sufficiently\ncertain, and yet not without evidence. What he, therefore, affirms to\nbe true, he thinks to be necessary; for the rest, he says “I\nbelieve” or “I think it to be”. (EMM, ll.\n1143–44, 1147–54) \nCommencing with his first work of philosophical reflection, John had\nalready declared his allegiance to an essentially Ciceronian\noutlook. \nJohn’s Metalogicon reiterates this position, repeatedly\nproclaiming his explicit commitment to the philosophical program of\nthe New Academy. In the prologue, he announces,  \nAn Academic in matters which to the wise man are doubtful, I do not\nswear that what I say is true, but, be it true or false, I remain\ncontent with probability alone. (ML: 122)  \nWhile John distances his version of skepticism from more radical\nviews, he admits that the process of achieving knowledge is\ntroublesome. Echoing a remark by Cicero, John observes,  \n… it is a great thing to discover the truth, which, as our\nAcademic friends claim, lies hidden as it were at the bottom of a well\n…. (ML: 205)  \nJohn returns often in the Metalogicon to Cicero’s\nmethodological injunction against embracing insufficiently\nsubstantiated truth-claims too hastily. A main theme of the\nMetalogicon might aptly be characterized as the refutation of\nthe arid argumentation that occurred among the teachers of his time as\na result of their unwillingness to renounce their rigid formulae and\nfixed dogmas. \nJohn of Salisbury’s most extensive discussion and application of\nthe Ciceronian New Academy occurs in the Policraticus. That\ntreatise again contains repeated self-identification of its author\nwith the teachings of the Academy, its prologue echoing the words of\nthe Metalogicon:  \nIn philosophy, I am a devotee of Academic dispute, which measures by\nreason that which presents itself as more probable. … I do not\nrecede from their footprints in those matters about which the wise\nperson has doubts. (PC: 7)  \nThis is raised to the level of an evaluative standard in Book\nSeven’s recounting of the major schools of Greco-Roman\nphilosophy, the stated aim of which is to discover the valuable\nlessons of each as well as to demonstrate the limitations inherent in\nall (PC: 148–49). The treatment of the Academic School is given\npride of place, opening this critical history of pagan philosophy.\nEven as he admits his own devotion to the Academy, John stresses the\ndivide that exists within the School between an extreme skepticism and\nhis own moderate Ciceronian stance, offering a reductio\nargument against the former: \nYet I do not say that all those who are included under the name of\nAcademic have upheld the rule of modesty, since even its basic creed\nis in dispute and parts of it are open as much to derision as to\nerror… If the Academic is in doubt about each thing, he is\ncertain about nothing… But he possesses uncertainty about\nwhether he is in doubt, so long as he does not know for certain that\nhe does not know this doubt itself. (PC: 150) \nRadical skepticism cannot attain the mantle of philosophy, John says,\nbecause the philosopher’s love of wisdom requires the admission\nthat one may know what is true (PC: 151–52). \nJohn’s moderate skepticism accepts that there are three reliable\nfoundations for knowledge: faith, reason, and the senses (PC:\n153–56). Thus, it does not behoove the philosopher to question\nhis faith in the existence of God, nor the certainty of some\nmathematical postulates, nor a number of other first principles which\n“one is not permitted to doubt, except for those who are\noccupied by the labors of not knowing anything” (PC: 154).\nThough it might seem that John’s skepticism is not so very\nskeptical after all, he generates a lengthy list of  \ndoubtful matters about which the wise person is not convinced by the\nauthority of either faith or his senses or manifest reason, and in\nwhich contrary claims rest on the support of some evidence. (PC: 152)\n \nThese topics include major issues of metaphysics, cosmology, natural\nscience, theology, and ethics. Among the ethical topics that John\ncites as susceptible to doubt, and thus open to rational debate, are\n \nthe uses and end and origins of virtues and vices, whether a man who\nhas one virtue has all the virtues, whether all sins are equal and are\npunishable equally. (PC: 152)  \nThe entire list is clearly meant to be illustrative rather than\ninclusive (PC: 152–53). In sum, John opens up to rational\ndispute an extraordinarily broad array of topics which are appropriate\nfor philosophical discourse. In confronting all such debatable\nsubjects, John counsels adherence to the Academic method, since  \nthe Academics have doubts regarding these matters with so much modesty\nthat I perceive them to have guarded diligently against the danger of\nrashness. (PC: 153)  \nUnique among all schools of philosophy, the Academy resists the\ntemptation to replace open discussion of uncertain matters with\nprematurely closed dogma. In John’s view, the moderate\nskepticism of the New Academy alone defends the liberty of inquiry\nthat he regards to be necessary to the quest for truth. \nAlthough the Policraticus does not restate the\nepistemological bases of intellectual fallibility addressed in the\nEntheticus and Metalogicon, it clearly takes for\ngranted that the human mind is furnished with the potential power to\ncomprehend truth. Hence, John rejects the Augustinian claim that even\nCicero’s moderate skepticism  \npiles up darkness from some hidden source, and warns that the whole of\nphilosophy is obscure, and does not allow one to hope that any light\nwill be found in it. (Augustine Against the Academicians:\n3.14.30)  \nIn a surprising twist, John enlists Augustine himself in support of\nthose who evince Academic doubt:  \nEven our Augustine does not assail them, since he himself somewhat\nfrequently employs Academic moderation in his works and propounds many\nmatters as ambiguous which would not seem to be in question to another\narguing with greater confidence and just as safely. (PC: 152)  \nOn John’s reading, Augustine practiced the Academic method even\nwhile he excoriated it in principle. The validity of this\ninterpretation aside, John seeks any evidence whatsoever to bolster\nhis view that “mortals can know very little” (EMM, l.\n1142). \nJohn’s admiration for temperate Academic skepticism supports\nwhat is among the key themes of his philosophy: modestia or\nmoderatio. He was a convinced adherent of an\nAristotelian-tinged doctrine that virtue necessarily consists in the\nmean, and that moderation in all things is the most valid standard for\njudging human thought and action (Nederman 1997). As John points out\nin the Entheticus, the Academic stance is consonant with  \na modest mind … that no one may accuse it of being guilty of\nfalsehood; it thus tempers all words with qualifiers, so that it\nshould always be rightly credible. (EMM, ll. 155–58)  \nJohn stresses that the possessors of such a modest mind\n“restrain their words according to condition, time, cause, and\nmanner, [and] they avoid speaking with too much simplicity”\n(EMM, ll. 161–62). Academic moderation results in rhetorical and\nintellectual humility, if not caution, consistent with the virtuous\nmean. \nThe counsel of moderation as crucial to any form of virtue permeates\nJohn’s later corpus as well. In the Metalogicon, he\ninsists that education has a definite ethical component that requires\nrecognition and examination. As he acknowledges in his prefatory\nremarks, \nI have deliberately included a number of comments on moral issues,\nsince my view is that everything that is read or written is valueless\nexcept in so far as it affords support to the way we live. Any\nprofession of philosophy whatsoever is valueless and deceitful if it\ndoes manifest itself in the cultivation of virtue and the conduct of\nour lives. (ML: 122) \nMaking men virtuous is not a distinct enterprise from making them\nintelligent or knowledgeable; it is worthless to be well-educated if\none is unable to apply this learning in the service of moral\nrectitude. Moreover, the very techniques one employs in the\nacquisition of knowledge are subject to ethical evaluation and\njudgment. Proper learning is defined not only by the quantity of\nknowledge inculcated, but by the quality of the educational\nexperience. John believes that the doctrine of moderation and the\nvirtuous mean is essential to any pedagogy which takes seriously its\nduty to mold morals as well as intellect. \nThe theme of moderation appears most prominently in the\nMetalogicon’s discussion of the correct attitude that\nthe student ought to adopt toward his subject matter. Intellectual\ndiscipline, John asserts, arises out of adherence to a mean course\nbetween the overzealous pursuit of all topics and an absence of\nintellectual curiosity: “If, however, there is no moderation,\nall these qualities [of the mind] turn to their opposites. Subtlety is\nreft of its utility” (ML: 194). The mind must first discriminate\namong its potential subjects of study in order to eliminate those that\nare unsuitable, namely, matters that pertain to God alone as well as\n“things which are harmful; … from which come pain, anger,\ncupidity, and their followers, envy, hate, slander, lechery and vanity\n…” (ML: 299). Yet, excessive caution yields an intellect\nthat resists inquiry into new or foreign territory. John maintains\nthat proper philosophical investigation demands careful reflection\nupon the boundaries of one’s intelligence in consort with the\ncorrect application of our God-given powers of reason (ML:\n180–82). \nJohn extends his discussion of intellectual moderation to pedagogical\npractice, such that a moderate attitude toward study is manifested in\nthe extent of materials one consults. The Metalogicon warns\nthat  \nto follow up what some one even of the most contemptible of men has\never said is a sign either of complete masochism or of empty top-show,\nand it impedes and overwhelms minds which would be better off spending\ntheir time on other things. (ML: 177)  \nThe well-trained scholar will survey those authorities who are\ndeserving of respect, while ignoring works that do not merit effort\nand attention. Equally importantly, learning ought not to be an\nall-consuming, exclusive (and therefore excessive) way of life.\nRather,  \nintelligence must … be carefully cultivated under the control\nboth of study and of relaxation, the former designed to give it\nstrength, the latter encouragement … Intelligence starts with\nnature, is assisted by practice, is dulled by excess of toil, and is\nsharpened by controlled exercise. (ML: 148)  \nThe overzealous scholar courts counterproductive conduct, if not the\nperil of his soul. \nThe notion that wisdom entails a moderate cast of mind forms the basis\nfor John’s criticism of pedagogical techniques then current in\nthe schools. The temper of the times discourages observation of the\nmean, so that instructors prompt students to all manner of\nintellectual excess. Disputations are conducted without concern for\ntime, place, or topic, in spite of the fact that  \nAristotle ought to have checked this immoderation on the part of those\nwho identify indiscriminate volubility with the exercise of dialectic.\n(ML: 196)  \nIt is on grounds of immoderation that John objects to the unrestrained\nuse of the verbal duel:  \nA voluble tongue … throws one’s life into confusion, and,\nunless checked by the curb of moderation, drives one’s whole\nbeing headlong. (ML: 195–96; translation slightly altered)  \nHe has observed this situation, he says, at first hand. After visiting\nformer school associates from Paris, John reports his disappointment,\nfinding that “[t]hey had made progress—in just this one\nthing that, having unlearned moderation, they had thereby lost all\nmodesty” (ML: 201). For like reasons, the Metalogicon\nurges re-evaluation of the contemporary practices associated with\nphilosophical studies. When logic and dialectic are employed without\nregard for the pursuit of wisdom, when their practice moves beyond the\nmean, when, in sum, philosophy becomes immoderately fond of its own\nimage, the goal of wisdom ceases to be paramount and such study is\nsterile and pointless. \nThe theme of moderation likewise infuses the Policraticus,\nthe audience for which was two-fold: first, courtiers and other\nso-called “bureaucrats” (per Forhan 1985) who serve the\ninterests of the realm; and second, rulers who are ultimately\nresponsible for maintaining peace and justice in their kingdoms.\nJohn’s primary concern is to illuminate the vices of kings and\ntheir servants in order to instruct them in the forms of behavior\nappropriate to men of status and power. But John adopts a realistic\napproach, explicitly acknowledging that the demands of an ascetic\nmorality are unsuitable for such people. Since John intended the\nPolicraticus to be a practical guidebook, he was prepared to\nallow that  \nif moderation is displayed, I do not judge it unbecoming … to\ndwell at times upon the pleasures of the senses; as has been said,\nnothing is unseemly that is beyond measure … Modestly pursued\nfor purposes of recreation, they are excused upon the license of\nleisure. (FCP: 373)  \nJohn orients the value of moderation toward the actual conditions\nunder which courtiers and princes live. But there is an implicit\npolitical warning: Those in positions of leadership must not become so\nin thrall to such pursuits that these become ends in themselves and\nthe business of the kingdom suffers. \nMore broadly, John harnesses the principle of moderation to a general\ntheory of virtue, one that has important consequences for his\npolitical as well as moral thought. It is central to John’s\ndoctrine throughout the Policraticus that if any action  \nexceeds the mean, it is a fault. Every virtue is marked by its own\nboundaries, and consists in the mean. If one exceeds this, one is off\nthe road, not on it. (FCP: 157)  \nBad men “‘withdraw from the mean between vices, which is\nthe field of virtue’” (FCP: 374). But John by no means\nendorses zealotry. Employing the metaphor of the left and right hands,\nJohn observes that  \nto stray to the right is to insist vehemently upon the virtues\nthemselves [that is, to be fanatical]. To stray to the left is to\nexceed the mean in works of virtue, which consists in the mean. Truly\nall vehemence is inimical to salvation, and all excess is in error; an\nexcess of goodness and of habitually good deeds is very evil. (PC: 53)\n \nWhile this view may seem strange for an orthodox churchman to assert,\nit reveals the extent of John’s concern about how his audience\nmight interpret his remarks. All virtues by nature may be attained\nonly when pursued within definite limits, and so he is not expecting\ncourtiers to be saints. Almost certainly referring to Aristotle, John\nremarks that  \nthe philosopher says: Beware that which is excessive because if one\nabandons this cautious moderation itself, to that extent does one\nwithdraw incautiously from the path of virtue … What, therefore\nis advanced by excess, if the queen of the virtues, justice, perishes\nin its excessiveness? (PC: 54) \nOverstepping good in the name of goodness itself is as repugnant as\nthe utter absence of moral propriety. \nTo determine the virtuous mean in any specific circumstance, John\nadvances an essentially Ciceronian standard: “Discretion with\nregard to time, place, amount, person and cause readily draws the\nproper distinction” between virtuous and vicious actions.\nIndeed, one might understand John to advocate a sort of\ncircumstantialist—though by no means relativist—moral\ntheory, since discretion “is the origin and source of moderation\nin its widest sense without which no duty is properly performed”\n(FCP: 373). Attention to context is required, for John, to guide the\ndeterminations one ought to make of what constitutes virtuous\nbehavior. Thus, it is clearly vicious to take a human life, yet as a\nform of punishment or as the result of a justly fought battle, it may\nbe vicious not to take a life. This conception of virtue\nposits the identification of a morally correct action as a sort of\nmoving target, rather than a fixed moral absolute that applies at all\ntimes and in all places. This seems to be the philosophical premise\nbehind his argument that various activities that might be viewed as\nreprehensible in themselves may be morally justifiable when conducted\nin the proper measure. In Book One of the Policraticus,\nfollowing a lengthy and scathing critique of hunting—a favorite\npastime of the English aristocracy to whom he is writing—John\nreverses course: “The activity, however, is laudable when\nmoderation is shown and hunting is pursued with judgment and, when\npossible, with profit” (FCP: 25). The same holds for the many\nother popular courtly “frivolities”. John’s\noverarching aim is to keep his audience mindful of that\n“moderation without which the good life is impossible”\n(FCP: 161), the very essence of which is the performance of the right\nact in the right way and in the right situation, in accordance with\none’s best judgment. (For further discussion of this topic, see\nthe supplement on\n Practical Moderate Skepticism.) \nJohn applies his principle that virtue is by definition a mean between\nexcess and deficiency emphatically to the ruler. The moral qualities\nof the community as a whole are inextricable linked, in John’s\nview, to the moral characteristics of its royal head. By dint of his\npersonal character, the good prince—the king—assures the\ncoherence and well-being of the polity he rules; by contrast, a\nvicious prince—the tyrant—will reduce his subjects to\nslaves of his own private desires. Given the definition of virtue that\nJohn posits, the actions of a king must themselves and by definition\nbe moderate. According to the Policraticus, the moderation\nexercised by the good ruler necessarily unifies and balances the\nrelationship that his people enjoy with one another. Employing a\nmusical metaphor, he asks,  \nHow much more care should be taken by princes to be moderate—at\none time by the vigour of justice, at another by the forgiveness of\nmercy—so that subjects are made to be of a single mind …\nand the works of peace and charity create one perfect and great\nharmony out of pursuits which appear discordant? (PC: 51)  \nThis does not mean that the king is the absolute arbiter of his\nsubjects’ morals. Rather, the good prince should instruct by\nexample, adopting that “tranquil moderation of mind” so\nvalued in the magistrates of antiquity (PC: 54). While never\nencouraging vice, John’s preferred ruler would tolerate—or\nat least not punish hastily and harshly—those evils committed by\nmembers of the community that do not endanger public order or\nreligious orthodoxy. John cautions that “the amount of the\naffection, with which subjects are embraced [by the king] like\nbrothers in the arms of charity must be confined to the limits of\nmoderation”, lest his people lose respect for him and believe\nthat they can perform all manner of wickedness without fear of\nconsequence (PC: 49). Yet, the Policraticus protests against\nthe ruler “who is too excessively inclined towards the punishing\nof the faults of subjects” (PC: 54). While the king should\nrapidly take action against those “flagrant crimes” that\n“one is not permitted to endure or which cannot faithfully be\nendured”, he should also demonstrate mildness and patience\ntoward those acts of his subjects “which honor and religion can\nsecurely endure” (PC: 140). Special royal virtue, the art of\ngovernance, consists in the moderate use of the authority that God has\nbestowed. \nAlthough John regards the king as “the minister of God”\nand the servant of divine law, the good ruler must restrain himself\nwith the bridle of law and hold back his will, while maintaining\nhumility in his relations with his subjects, since he is defined by\nmoderation in all his deeds and decrees (PC: 28–29,\n46–49). A good ruler will display such restraint despite his\ndivinely mandated power, according to John, because the king’s\ningrained moral character—the result of a careful program of\ninstruction—necessarily guides him to seek justice and to\nrespect divine dictates. It bears emphasis that John’s\nconception of the nature of political power is an entirely\npersonalized one: The incumbent makes the office. The king’s\ndisposition to follow the path of moderation is reinforced by the\nrewards that he receives: Honored among men, he guarantees a peaceful\nreign and safe succession; beloved of God, he will receive the gift of\nsalvation. “Kings can both flourish and abound with the most\nsweet worldly things”, John proclaims, “and yet can pick\nthe most useful fruits of eternity” (PC: 55). Nor does he\nsuppose that such desserts pertain only to the most righteous of\nrulers:  \nTo refuse evil is a great thing in them [princes], even if they do no\ngreat goodness, provided that they do not permit their subjects to\nindulge in evil. (PC: 55)  \nThe king who refrains from misusing his great powers and who pursues\npolicies that maintain the harmonious order of the community assures\nhappiness (temporal and eternal) for himself, his progeny, and his\nsubjects.  \nThe opposite of the king is the tyrant, who is characterized by the\nimmoderate application of political power over those subject to him.\nIf the ruler seeks excessive domination, if he attempts to use his\npower to enslave the community, then he is a tyrant. That is, the\ntyrant is a person possessing a wholly self-interested and willful\ncharacter whose ambition for the supreme governmental office has been\nfulfilled. What renders him a tyrant is, strictly speaking, neither\nhis moral qualities nor the power he exercises, but the conjunction\nand combination of the two. A tyrant claims a monopoly of\ndiscretionary authority over all those under his control, so that the\nmaintenance of his full license requires the absence of true freedom\nfor others. The Policraticus insists that “as long as\nall, collectively and individually, are borne along at the will of a\nsingle head, they are deprived of their own free will” (FCP:\n184). Nor does John believe that the victim of the tyrant ought\n“to make a virtue of necessity by uniting consent and necessity\nand by gracefully embracing that which is incumbent upon him”\n(FCP: 184), as this preserves the mere semblance of liberty. John\ninstead advocates positive measures to protect the community from its\ntyrant—in the last instance, by tyrannicide (discussed below).\nThe good government of the king, typified by rule in accordance with\nthe virtuous mean, is regarded by the Policraticus to be the\nsole guarantee of the freedom necessary for the exercise of moral\ngoodness in society. \nIn line with John’s heavy emphasis on moderation, significant\nsections of Books Seven and Eight of the Policraticus deliver\na withering critique of a philosophy he regards as the antithesis of\nmoderation, namely, Epicureanism (despite virtually no mention of\nEpicurus and/or his school in the examination of John’s use of\nclassical philosophy in Hermand-Schebat 2015). While John’s\nviews reflect Cicero’s highly critical perspective (similar\ncriticisms exist in Seneca and Augustine’s De civitate\ndei), several aspects of John’s presentation of\nEpicureanism seem highly distinctive and innovative. In selectively\nappropriating Epicurean doctrines, he omits significant dimensions of\nthe tradition, while extending other elements in novel directions.\nClassical Epicureanism depended upon an atomistic cosmology that\nposited random occurrences in the void as the ontological premise of\nthe universe. As a consequence, classical Epicureans insisted that no\npolitical lessons followed from their moral theory. John sets aside\nthe cosmological backdrop to Epicurean ethical teachings, while also\nfinding in them the source of a potent (albeit dangerous) political\ndoctrine. There does not seem to be any direct precedent for such an\ninterpretation, but, given John’s inventive use of authorities\nand exempla, one ought not to be surprised by his selective\nand idiosyncratic treatment of the Epicurean school (von Moos 1984;\nMartin 1984).  \nOne indication that John is offering a unique reading of the Epicurean\ntradition emerges from his claim that the ideas of Epicurus himself\nare not to be mainly disdained, but that his followers should be\nblamed for turning his ethics into a form of untrammeled hedonism.\nDeviating from his ancient and patristic sources, John detaches master\nfrom school, finding some merit in Epicurus’ notion that\nhappiness may be sought through the pursuit of moderate hedonism.\n“[I]f moderation is displayed”, John states,  \nI do not judge it unbecoming … to dwell at times upon these\npleasures of the senses … [for] nothing is unseemly except that\nwhich is beyond measure. (FCP: 373)  \n“[T]he field of virtue” consists neither in excessive\nenjoyment of nor denial of pleasure, but is to be found in “the\nmean between vices” (FCP: 374). \nJohn asserts that the followers of Epicurus broke loose from the\ncrucial restraint of moderation, such that Epicureanism became the\npursuit of sensual pleasure without bounds. John separates\nEpicurus’ acceptable philosophy from its later practice:  \n…[W]hat should have been the instrument of virtue has been\ndiverted by writers to the profit of filthiness. Flesh then has\nconcluded (for assuredly no man endowed with sense holds the opinion)\nthat to think, say, and do all that the mind, tongue, and hand covet\nand to thwart oneself or to repress one’s inclination in nothing\nis the life of a man enjoying supreme happiness …. (FCP: 273)\n \nThe sensual has been placed above the philosophical, the external\nabove the internal, and pleasure above wisdom, so that in all ways\nEpicureanism subverts true happiness. Epicureanism not only perverts\nthe individual, but also the entire body politic, inasmuch as a nation\nthat “has … been conquered by its own\nself-indulgence” is ripe for conquest (FCP: 331). \nThose whom John labels Epicureans are so branded not because of any\nself-proclaimed adherence to the school of Epicurus, but rather\nbecause of their observable behaviors and deeds. Excess is the\ndefining characteristic of Epicureans, “who in all matters serve\ntheir own personal desires” (PC: 182). Because they “teach\nphilosophy and … serve their own private wills”, they are\nalso hypocrites (PC: 175). Despite John’s flexible standard for\nevaluating moderation, he finds that “the world is filled with\nEpicureans for the reason that in its great multitude of men there are\nfew who are not slaves to lust” (FCP: 399–400). Since most\npeople are susceptible to sensual gratification, one need not call\noneself an Epicurean, John asserts, in order to practice its\nteachings. \nJohn is convinced that Epicureans, lacking moderation, cannot achieve\nthe happiness that Epicurus himself postulated (FCP: 399), because\n \ntoilsome is the passage to happiness by the route of pleasure, for its\nvotaries gather wealth to maintain themselves, seek grandeur to be\nupheld by power, position to inspire respect and to avoid contempt,\nand aim at glory to win fame. Yet that life which Epicurus describes\nis not acquired by all these means. (FCP: 274)  \nOne sign that a man driven by Epicurean acquisitiveness is\nnotoriety—whether in conduct, speech, or dress—“for\nnotoriety connotes lack of moderation” (FCP: 371). Thus it is\nthat “ermine makes the judge” (FCP: 386). A person’s\ndesire for possessions “exhaust[s] the strength of [his] whole\nbeing” and can never lead to the good life, “[f]or the\nfrenzy of avarice … covets to excess the possessions of others\nor guards its own too tenaciously” (FCP: 277). John is explicit\nabout the origin of this vicious cycle: “Pride is the beginning\nof all sin”, creating in man the desire to be pre-eminent. From\nits “poisonous root” spring ambition, acquisitiveness,\nhoarding, resentment, flattery, false modesty, over-indulgence, and\nall manner of evils (FCP: 295). \nWhile John recognizes hierarchy as intrinsic to human and corporate\nrelations, he warns of the perverting effects hierarchy can produce\nwhen the twin pillars of liberality and justice have been toppled:\n“Wealth, influence, and favor, since they confer much power, put\ncharacter to a severe test” (FCP: 298). The only way to survive\nsuch a test is to embrace the guiding light of moderation, for\n“[e]ach one more easily becomes puffed up with pride in that in\nwhich he excels others, unless he be sustained by the grace of\nmoderation” (FCP: 297). Though aware of Plato’s contention\nthat such pleasures ought to be actively struggled against (a stock\nview of classical philosophers), John advocates that “the safer\ncourse [is] to flee and evade the conflict”, as he has never\n“read of anyone who has challenged carnal pleasures who has not\nfallen in the encounter” (FCP: 353). Likely, his own experience\nand observations of rampant Epicureanism also inform his views. \nJohn’s treatment of Epicureanism leads him to identify a\npolitical component not present in the ancient school. For John, the\nEpicurean mindset and lifestyle are intimately associated with and\nform the foundation for tyranny, which is not a wholly political\nconcept. The Policraticus details several species of tyrant:\nthe private tyrant, the ecclesiastical tyrant, and the public or royal\ntyrant (PC: 191–92). According to John, anyone who employs power\nto impose his will arbitrarily upon another is a tyrant. John admits\nthat his definition deviates considerably from the ordinary\nunderstanding: \nIt is said that the tyrant is one who oppresses a people by forceful\ndomination; but it is not solely over a people that [the tyrant]\nexercises his tyranny, but he can do so from the lowest position. For\nif not over a people, still he will lord over (dominatur)\nwhomever he can … Who is it who does not wish to come before\nsome other one if he might be subdued? (PC: 163) \nAnyone, in John’s estimation, is capable of behaving\ntyrannically, owing to humans’ deep-seated desire to seek\nsensual gratification. “They who wish to do their own will are\nto be rated as Epicureans”, John concludes, “for when\nactions become the slave of lust, affection changes to passion”\n(FCP: 399). The vices of Epicureanism spring from “the well of\npassion”, which leads men to suppose that they “can do\nwith impunity” whatever they wish and “can to a certain\ndegree be just like God”—not in imitation of divine\ngoodness, but in the belief that their wills can supplant God’s\nown. Thus, Epicureanism promotes pride and ambition, leading to\n“a passion for power and honors” that constitutes the root\nof tyranny (PC: 162–63). (For John’s paradigmatic example,\nsee the supplement on\n The Epicurean Tyrant.) \nAnother substantive philosophical issue John of Salisbury engages is\nthe role played by nature in the foundations of social and political\norder, an interest evident across his works. That John adopts a\nnaturalistic framework in the Policraticus might seem\nsensible, but it appears also as a crucial feature of the\nMetalogicon, wherein John develops the Ciceronian theme that\nhumans are transformed from animalistic primordial beings into civil\ncreatures as a consequence of the realization of the inhering human\ncapacities of reason and language. Thus, education forms a highly\nrelevant element of his naturalism. \nJohn’s appeal to a Ciceronian conception of the natural\nfoundations of society in the Metalogicon arises out of his\nattempt to refute the doctrine, ascribed to the possibly fictional\nCornificius and his followers, that the qualities and powers with\nwhich men are born constitute the limit of their knowledge and\nfaculties (Tobin 1989). Under this view, human beings ought not to\nseek to improve their condition or to develop their minds and skills,\nrelying instead on God’s redemptive grace, while shunning the\nmaterial world and their own natures completely (ML: 137,\n141–42). In opposition to Cornificius, John argues that the\nmundane and sinful character of human nature does not end the debate.\nRather, God through nature has granted to mankind the capacity to\nimprove its lot by diligent application of the native faculties of\nreason and speech. This is not to say that John considers man’s\nnature (in Aristotelian terms) to be wholly perfectible; grace is\nstill required. Yet men may accomplish much by nature alone, contrary\nto the Cornifician teaching that no attempt can (or perhaps should) be\nmade to develop post-lapsarian man (ML: 125–26). \nA major pillar supporting John’s case against the Cornificians\nis an adapted version of Cicero’s depiction of the primitive\ndevelopment of human association. John deploys his source in order to\ndemonstrate that social interaction among men is an important\nwell-spring of true (albeit partial, because merely mortal) happiness\nor blessedness (beatitudo). The Metalogicon regards\nnature (in Stoic fashion), “the most benign parent and governor\nof all things in order most due”, as imprinted with a divine\nplan (ML: 124). Thus, if nature has granted to man alone the powers of\nspeech and reason, this is so he may “gain blessedness”\n(ML: 125). Such a plan emerges from the rational observation of the\nstructure of the universe:  \n[T]he one and true God, in order to bind the parts of the universe in\na firm alliance and to keep charity alive, ordered them in such a way\nthat one thing needed the help of another, and one made good the\ndeficiency of another, every single one being as it were a member of\nevery other one. All things if separated from one another are thus\nonly half complete, but are made perfect when allied to others, since\nall things are held together by mutual support. (ML: 125)  \nThis theme of reciprocity imbues John’s corpus, employed in his\ncorrespondence and forming the basis of his organic metaphor for the\npolity (addressed below) (see JL1: 181). In the Metalogicon,\nthis universal model of mutual interconnection indicates the natural\ncourse which ought to guide human behavior: “[I]t is not\npossible even to imagine a kind of blessedness which knows nothing of\ncommunion or exists outside society”, John declares, because\nnature decrees that earthly happiness derives from human association\n(ML: 125). To imperil society by assailing man’s capacity to\nimprove his rational powers—an accusation which John levels\nagainst Cornificius—is thus to cut man off from the happiness\nwhich God has allotted to him in the present life, as well as to\nexclude the possibility of fulfilling the terms of divinely bestowed\ngrace. \nJohn’s view is that man’s rational faculty demands a level\nof sociability unparalleled in nature. In Ciceronian fashion, the\nMetalogicon argues that reason’s discovery of the\nnaturalness of association is not sufficient, because such individual\nrealization can never generate the community that it knows to be\nnatural to and beneficial for human existence. Speech is the mechanism\nby which mute wisdom translates its insights into public proclamations\nand persuades men to follow their natural inclination by surrendering\ntheir private interests in favor of the common good (ML: 126). Should\nhumans retain their rational abilities yet be deprived of speech,\n“they will become brute beasts, and … cities will seem\nlike farmyards rather than gatherings of human beings united in the\nbonds of society” (ML: 126). Enlightened eloquence, however,\n \ngave birth to so many glorious cities … and bound so many\npeoples in the bonds of charity, that whoever strives to put asunder\nwhat God has joined together for the common benefit of all would\nrightly be accounted the common enemy of all. (ML: 126)  \nJohn’s vision of society is comparable to Cicero’s in its\nquasi-contractual quality, in that human association requires, beyond\ngeographic proximity, explicit agreement to share a common life in all\nof the features that compose a community. Only the eloquent use of\nlanguage can convince selfish men that by nature they prefer the\ncommon good to personal welfare. In this regard, John’s reliance\non Cicero is pronounced: The Metalogicon presumes that the\nbond of association among men is simultaneously a product of their\nactive cooperation, a natural, but not purely natural (in contrast to\nAristotle), outcome. \nThe real significance of the Cornifician position lies in its\nopposition to “all cities simultaneously and the whole of civil\nlife”, since, by claiming that men should not develop their\ncapacities for reason and speech, any opportunity for man to associate\nis in the process denied (ML: 127). The Cornifician error is to\ninterpret the fixity of post-lapsarian human nature as a permanent\ncondition, whereas, if this were correct, society could never have\nbeen formed originally, let alone maintained. Yet, John recognizes\nthat conscious effort is required if men are to join together in\ncommunal life. John conceives of human association as a process of man\nrefining and improving his own abilities in order to aid the cause of\nnature. The Metalogicon’s understanding of the genesis\nof society is profoundly indebted to Cicero’s notion that\nnature’s endowment is only a point of departure which men must\ndevelop and shape if they are truly to live in accordance with their\nown natural inclinations. \nThis commitment to naturalism is perhaps even more on display in the\nPolicraticus, in which John repeatedly asserts that\n“nature is the best guide to living” (PC: 27, 127, 201).\nThe Policraticus follows the teaching in the\nMetalogicon that, while nature provides the foundation for\nhuman capabilities, they are only potentialities. “The beginning\nof each thing is from nature”, John observes, but people may\n(and should) develop their natural capacities by means of practice\nuntil they master their art, a principle that “obtains in\nliberal and mechanical occupations” alike (PC: 125). While\nnature offers a model for human conduct and association, the natural\nscheme for living well may only be realized with the cooperation of\npeople who partake in it. \nJohn’s naturalistic conception of cooperative association\ninforms the famous organic analogy that he proposes and develops in\nthe Policraticus. Ascribing his insight to a letter of\ninstruction (John’s creation) purportedly by Plutarch to Emperor\nTrajan, John commences with the simple observation that the\ncommonwealth may be likened to a “body which is animated”\n(PC: 66; on the history of the controversy about the letter’s\nauthenticity, see Martin 1984: 194–96). The different offices of\npolitical society are represented as analogous to the distinct parts\nof the human anatomy. Like all bodies, the commonwealth is guided by a\nsoul, which John assigns to “those who direct the practice of\nreligion” (PC: 67). Yet, just as the eternal human soul is not\ncoextensive with the mortal physical organism within which it resides,\nthe clerical soul of the polity is not, strictly speaking, a member of\nthe commonwealth (see Nederman 2013). Because the political creature\nis an essentially secular entity, the body politic is ruled by the\nprince, who “occupies the place of the head” (PC: 69).\n(For further discussion of the relationship between the secular body\nand its ecclesiastical soul, see the supplement on\n Princely Tyranny and the Liberty of the Church.) \nThe senate, composed of the prince’s counselors, functions as\nthe commonwealth’s heart. The senses correspond to the royal\njudges and local agents who exercise jurisdiction in the king’s\nname. The financial officers constitute the body’s stomach and\nintestines, while the tax-collector and the soldier represent the two\nhands. Finally, John compares the feet to the artisans and peasants\n“who erect, sustain and move forward the mass of the whole\nbody” (PC: 67). Each part of the organism, according to the\nPolicraticus, has its own definite function, fixed by its\nlocation within the overall scheme of the body. None of the members\nmay be excluded or removed without serious damage to the whole. \nJohn’s functional depiction of the community was not, as is\nsometimes supposed, primarily intended to justify hierarchy and\ndivision within society (for a contrary view, see Struve 1984:\n309–11). Rather, the body politic found in the\nPolicraticus is the expression of a principle of cooperative\nharmony through which otherwise disparate individuals and interests\nare reconciled and bound together. John adopts a\n“physiological” approach to the political organism,\naccording to which all of the organs cooperate reciprocally in order\nto achieve a common purpose. The Policraticus insists that\n“there can be no faithful and firm coherence where there is not\na tenacious unity of wills and a virtual joining together of souls\nthemselves” (PC: 77). Echoing the naturalistic principle\narticulated in the Metalogicon, John posits that all parts of\nthe body must be truly oriented toward and dedicated to a common or\npublic welfare that supersedes the aggregate private goods within the\npolity. The ruler and magistrates are advised to attend “to the\nutility of all”, the feet are counseled “to concentrate on\nthe public utility in all matters”, and in general “all\nthe members” are expected to “keep watch over the public\nadvantage” (PC: 136, 126, 135). The security of the body politic\ncan only be maintained by means of a joint commitment to a public good\nwhich benefits all, so that  \neach individual may be likened to a part of the others reciprocally\nand each believes what is to his own advantage to be determined by\nthat which he recognizes to be most useful for others. (PC: 126)  \nJohn’s political body is one in which, beyond all social\ndifferentiation, there is “mutual charity reigning\neverywhere”, because all segments are attuned to the same\nenduring common purpose that encompasses the valid interests of the\nwhole (PC: 142). Unity follows from cooperation, and cooperation stems\nfrom the existence of a good shared by the entire community and each\nof its members. \nFollowing from his use of a physiological model of social\norganization, John identifies maintenance of the ‘health’\nof the body politic as necessary to ensuring a cooperative spirit and\navoiding fragmentation. For John, the political body’s health\ndepends on the practice of justice by the organs and members. This\nassociation between the common good and justice entails a correlative\nobligation on the part of all members of the commonwealth:  \nInasmuch as the duties of each individual are practiced so that\nprovision is made for the corporate community, as long as justice is\npracticed, the ends of all are imbued with the sweetness of honey.\n(PC: 131)  \nEvery organ and limb must conduct itself according to the dictates of\njustice if the polity is to exist as a corporate whole. John’s\nconception of justice follows the Ciceronian duality (Cicero De\nofficiis: I.7.23) of negative obligation and positive duty:  \nJustice consists chiefly in this: do not do harm and prevent the doing\nof harm out of duty to humanity. When you do harm, you assent to\ninjury. When you do not impede the doing of harm, you are a servant of\ninjustice. (PC: 62)  \nBecause justice is inherently productive of social cooperation,\nwhereas injustice necessarily tends to disharmony and social\ndisintegration, John construes justice as both a generalized virtue\nand the guarantor of the body’s health. Since justice is the\nsalient characteristic of the common good, it determines the manner in\nwhich each bodily member performs its functions. Not only kings and\nmagistrates, but even the lowliest of parts, are viewed by John as\npotential agents of public justice (see Nederman 1997), reinforced by\nthe fact that the function of each is absolutely necessary for the\nwell-being of all. The wide diffusion of responsibility for the\nmaintenance of justice assures that all members of the body politic\npossess the basic faculties necessary for guarding and protecting the\ncommon good. \nJohn is willing, under exceptional circumstances, to extend this\ndiscretion to direct political action against evil rulers. He\ndescribes two circumstances that warrant public concern: the\ncommission by rulers of minor offenses, which can be tolerated by the\ncommunity, and of flagrant crimes, which endanger the well-being of\nthe body politic (PC: 140–41). In the first instance, citizens\nshould express their disapproval and recommend corrective measures,\nbut should not challenge the king’s position. In the second\ncase, when the common good and religion are threatened by a tyrant,\nmembers of the political organism ought—indeed, are bound by the\nfunctionalist terms of the political order—to take action to\ndeflect injury to the body. This claim forms the basis for\nJohn’s controversial doctrine of tyrannicide. Scholars have\ndebated whether these remarks amount to a theory of tyrant-killing or\nmerely an account of the bad endings that have come to all tyrants\n(Van Laarhoven 1984; Nederman 1988). John’s seemingly\ncontradictory claim that tyrants are both the servants of God and\nassured of divine punishment (PC: 201–02) finds resolution\nthrough numerous historical examples of the destruction of tyrannical\nrulers once their ordained purpose has been achieved. \nYet, as elsewhere in John’s writings, this religious dimension\nof tyrannicide is paralleled by a philosophical justification that\ndepends on reason alone. Because John considers tyranny to be a crime\nagainst “the body of justice itself” (PC: 25), he invokes\nthe organic nature of the community to explain the legitimacy, albeit\nrare, of tyrannicide. Inasmuch as one enjoys membership in the\npolitical community, one may ultimately be responsible—based on\neach part’s duty to see justice served in the whole—for\neradicating the incorrigible tyrant. John does not believe that such\naction should be undertaken lightly, specifying a set of conditions\nthat must be met prior to eliminating a tyrant (PC: 209; see\n207–09 for the paradigmatic proper tyrannicide). Following from\nhis naturalistic paradigm, John asserts that “whoever does not\nprosecute [the tyrant] transgresses against himself and against the\nwhole body of the secular republic” (PC: 25). Note that slaying\na tyrant, under the caveats John specifies, falls within the general\nobligation on the part of every member of the political body, without\ndistinction, to pursue justice. Since the health of each depends upon\nthe health of all, John posits a strong link between the organic\nnature of social and political order and the widespread public defense\nof that order, extending even to the act of removing a tyrant (on\nJohn’s use of medical metaphors, see Shogimen and Nederman\n2011). \nJohn’s supposedly non-philosophical works—two substantial\nletter collections, two hagiographies, and a (brief)\nhistory—attest, in various ways, to his central commitment to a\npractical philosophy. John’s contemporary readers shared his\nunderstanding that all of his works both partake in the moral and\nphilosophical and have immediate, real-world relevance. Upon receiving\na copy of John’s first letter collection, his close friend and\nfrequent correspondent Peter of Celle described it as “seasoned\nwith philosophy, clothed in the characters of rhetoric” (quoted\nin JL1, x). In myriad ways within and across his non-theoretical\ntexts, John addresses the nature of philosophy, provides examples of\nmoderate skepticism at work, outlines the parameters of moderation and\nimmoderation as to both virtues and vices, and examines the\nrelationship between the secular body politic and its ecclesiastical\nsoul. \nJohn often drew attention to the practical dimensions of philosophy.\nIn a passage in John’s Life of Saint Anselm, for\ninstance, he expands on his critique of what he viewed as the sterile\napproach to learning—both philosophy for its own sake and for a\npurpose not oriented toward the cultivation of virtue—then\ndominant in the schools. John reports that Anselm, having been perhaps\noverly diligent in his studies, “c[ame] back to his senses and\nwisely examin[ed] his ways”, a pedagogical practice recommended\nin the Metalogicon. He then realized “that a stream of\neloquence or this world’s philosophy does not confer true\nhappiness. These often produce pride …” (A&B: 21). In\nlight of John’s sustained indictment of rampant Epicurean\ntendencies, as well as his judgment that Epicureanism is incapable of\nleading to the summum bonum, it is likely that “this\nworld’s philosophy” represents a retroactive reference to\nJohn’s present. \nA number of the letters John wrote during his Becket-related exile in\nFrance include meditations on the true purpose of philosophy and the\nrole of the true philosopher. In a letter to his fellow churchman\nGerard of Pucelle, John characterizes his exile as “the trial of\nthe purpose of true philosophers … those who suffer in\ninnocence and for the defence of faith and justice” (JL2:\n68–69). In light of the very real constraints on John’s\nfinances, it is not surprising that he found comfort in the\nphilosophic tradition of rejecting worldly possessions, claiming that\n“[n]othing is more fitting for a philosopher than to profess the\ntruth, reverence justice, despise the world, and, when necessary, to\nlove poverty” (JL2: 68–69). In a letter dating to the same\nperiod, John explains to his friend Hugh, abbot of Bury St. Edmunds,\nthat philosophy is the “foster parent of virtues and governess\nof duty … She lays down that the useful and the honourable are\nlinked together by mutual predication …” (JL2:\n264–65), a distinctively Ciceronian theme. To fellow philosopher\nJohn Saracen, John casts his state of exile—in language that\nboth echoes the Policraticus and calls to mind\nBoethius—as conducive to philosophy, writing that he now views\nhis present condition as a  \nfriend, who opened my eyes, formerly dazzled by the absurd fantasies\nof fortune, drove away courtly trifles and alluring pleasures, urged\nme on the path of virtue, and numbered me among the throngs of the\nphilosophers. (JL2: 270–71) \nOccupying the pinnacle of this throng, in John’s estimation, is\nhis former teacher, Gilbert of Poitiers, “the most learned man\nof our day” (HP: 15), whose heresy trial at the 1148 Council of\nRheims John attended and reports at length in his Historia\nPontificalis (for an analysis of John’s account of the\ntrial and its aftermath, see Bollermann and Nederman 2014). Among the\nqualities that single Gilbert—and, hence, the ideal (Christian)\nphilosopher—out, John notes that he possessed  \nthe very keenest intelligence … had read most things and\n… after spending almost sixty years in reading and close study,\nwas so learned in the liberal arts that … he was held to\nsurpass all in every subject … [and was] thoroughly conversant\nwith the [church] doctors. (HP: 16, 27)  \nWhile displaying “the great moderation always habitual to\nhim”, Gilbert “made use of every branch of learning as\noccasion demanded, knowing that all were consistent with each other,\nand mutually illuminating” (HP: 26–27). These sentiments\necho and reinforce the Metalogicon’s lessons on\nscholars and study. \nFinally, in the prologue to the Historia Pontificalis, John\ndelineates a philosophy of history firmly rooted in the practical: A\nchronicle such as his will “profit my contemporaries and future\ngenerations” because it generates a record  \nvaluable for establishing or abolishing customs, for strengthening or\ndestroying privileges; and nothing … teaches the living more\nsurely and soundly than knowledge of the deeds of the departed. (HP:\n3)  \nJohn’s mention of customs and privileges is particularly\nnoteworthy, as he wrote the Historia early in his exile, when\nKing Henry II was insisting that Becket and the English church submit\nto the so-called ancient customs and privileges his royal predecessors\nhad purportedly enjoyed. \nIn sum, John does not embrace the traditional doctrine that\ncontemplation is inherently superior to and more praiseworthy than\naction. Quite to the contrary, he adopts the position that the entire\npoint of philosophical inquiry is to provide guidance in the conduct\nof one’s affairs. John’s principles of philosophical\ninquiry should thus be viewed in the context of his broadly humanistic\nproject, namely, the identification of the features conducive to human\nhappiness. Throughout his writings, he stresses that philosophy ought\nnot to be a specialized, dry, and obscure pursuit, but rather an\nintegral feature of an active, dutiful, and devout life within the\npolitical arena. Philosophical investigation is to be valued because\nknowledge and its by-products (including social order and virtue)\npromote the earthly summum bonum of humanity. In contrast to\nthe Epicureans, whom he observes abounding at court, John’s\nstandard of living well is not found in the physical comfort\nassociated with wealth, power, status, and luxury. Rather, he proposes\nthat wisdom, properly attained, promotes the useful goods of virtue,\nqualities of the human soul that ultimately generate the highest\ndegree of happiness. We should desire to be wise and virtuous, John\nbelieves, because we will thereby fulfill our natural (and divinely\nordained) purpose as human beings. And when we flourish in this way,\nwe cannot fail to become happy in the way God intended. \nThis basic orientation of mind constitutes the core of John’s\nmain contributions to philosophy. The Metalogicon is meant to\nbe a practical guidebook to such happiness through a morally-guided\nquest for knowledge, a goal that John regards to be of far greater\nworth and far more befitting the philosopher than the technical\npursuits too commonly found in the schools. Likewise, in proposing the\npolitical ideas of the Policraticus, he sought to illustrate\nthe principle that philosophy provides invaluable aid in achieving the\ngood life of both the individual and the entire community. The\nvitality of John’s thought consists primarily in its\nconfrontation with the tensions between the demands of everyday life,\nwhether in the classroom or at court, and the requirements of living\nwell in a moral and religious sense. His vision of philosophy is the\nself-consciously practical one of revealing how our moral and\nintellectual characteristics may help us to navigate toward lives that\nare fulfilling on earth, while also attaining the ultimate heavenly\nreward. Much of John’s career proves a testament to his\nconviction that philosophy only possesses value to the extent that it\nshapes our choices and actions. \nTracing the philosophical lineage of John’s thought through his\nlater works illustrates the essential unity of his intellectual\nperspective. He did not discriminate radically between his speculative\nand his practical work. On the contrary, he seems to have\nenthusiastically incorporated philosophical principles into the\nconduct of his everyday life as well as his analysis of contemporary\nevents and personalities. Philosophy for John was not to be left at\nthe schoolhouse door, for it ought to occupy an important place in the\nworld at large. The task of philosophical discourse is to aid in\ndiscerning the good from the evil, the true from the false, and so to\nilluminate the path toward happiness by navigating the tricky by-ways\nof public life.","contact.mail":"kbollermann@icloud.com","contact.domain":"icloud.com"},{"date.published":"2016-08-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/john-salisbury/","author1":"Karen Bollermann","author1.info":"http://pols.tamu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/cary-j-nederman-professor/","entry":"john-salisbury","body.text":"\n\n\nJohn of Salisbury (1115/20–1180) was among the foremost\nphilosophers of the so-called twelfth century Renaissance,\ncontributing to the development of political and moral philosophy as\nwell as to the medieval theory of education and to the dissemination\nof emerging Aristotelian learning. Having received an extensive\neducation in Paris, he spent most of his life as an active servant of\nthe church. An associate of Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury\nduring his dispute with King Henry II of England, John eventually was\nraised to the office of Bishop of Chartres. John’s thought has\nbeen characterized as “humanistic”, since he valorizes the\ndignity of humanity and of nature generally: The latter is\nintelligible and may be understood through the application of natural\nreason. Yet John admitted that severe impediments exist to the\nattainment of wisdom. Throughout his writings, he professed to follow\nthe moderate skepticism of Cicero and the New Academy, which rejected\ndogmatic claims to certainty. The best that rational human inquiry may\nin most matters achieve, John says, is probable truth, always subject\nto re-evaluation and revision. The general tenor of his philosophy is\nreflected in his advocacy of moderation and his emphasis on nature as\na normative guide to earthly fulfillment. John composed several\ntreatises of philosophical interest, most notably the\nPolicraticus (PC), but also the Metalogicon (ML) and\nthe Entheticus de dogmate philosophorum (EMM). These works were all\ncompleted between 1154 and 1159, during the period of John’s\nservice to Archbishop Theobald, Becket’s predecessor at the see\nof Canterbury. John’s other writings—two letter\ncollections, two hagiographies, and a history—evince the\npractical application of his philosophical commitments.\n\nJohn of Salisbury was born at Old Sarum (the former site of Salisbury)\nin England between 1115 and 1120. Specific knowledge of his family\nbackground and early life is scant; something is known of a brother,\nRichard, and a half-brother, Robert, both of whom held offices within\nthe English church. John probably received an early education at\nSalisbury and then at Exeter. The first date safely associated with\nhim is 1136, when he traveled to Paris to study at\nMont-Sainte-Geneviève. In a famous autobiographical passage in\nthe Metalogicon, John narrates his twelve years of education,\nan important source for understanding French higher instruction in\nthis period. The list of his teachers includes many of the great\nthinkers of the mid-twelfth century, among them Peter Abelard, Robert\nof Melun, William of Conches, Thierry of Chartres, Adam de Petit Pont,\nGilbert of Poitiers, and Robert Pullan. John’s studies\nencompassed speculative philosophy, rhetoric, linguistic theory,\nliterature, and theology. He seems to have tutored students during his\nlater years in Paris. It was also during these years (specifically,\n1141 to 1147) that John likely drafted the first two parts of his\n1852-line philosophical and satirical poem, the Entheticus de\ndogmate philosophorum (or Entheticus maior); the final\ntwo parts likely date from late 1154 to mid-1156 (the much shorter\nEntheticus minor prefaces the Policraticus). \nLike many educated churchmen of his era, John eventually entered the\ncorridors of power rather than the cloister or the classroom. Through\nthe assistance of his friend Peter of Celle, John joined, in 1148, the\nhousehold of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, a vocal and energetic\nadvocate of the rights of the English church. In his capacity as\nsecretary to Theobald, John was an omnicompetent administrator: He\ncomposed the Archbishop’s letters, advised him on legal and\npolitical affairs, traveled often to the Continent as an\narchiepiscopal envoy, and altogether lived in the manner of a trusted\nintimate. John’s first letter collection, which he assembled\nshortly after Theobald’s death in 1161, is largely comprised of\nofficial letters under Theobald’s name, augmented by letters\nJohn himself wrote on Canterbury’s behalf and some personal\nmissives. \nTheobald’s court attracted many clerics with training and\nexperience similar to John’s own, so he could continue to\nindulge his intellectual pursuits in a sympathetic environment during\nthe 1140s and 1150s. John was counted a member of a circle of learned\nclerics, among whom was Thomas Becket (the future archbishop and\nmartyr), who was a trusted servant of Theobald before he was appointed\nKing Henry II’s Chancellor in late 1154. John’s activities\non behalf of Theobald brought him into contact with some of the most\npowerful and prominent men of twelfth-century Europe. He was present\nat the Roman curia for many crucial occurrences during the pontificate\nof Eugenius III (1145–1153), the final four years of which he\nlater chronicled in his Historia Pontificalis (HP) (written\nduring the early period of his Becket-related exile, likely early 1164\nto early 1166). He enjoyed a warm friendship with his fellow\ncountryman Nicholas Breakspear, who ascended the papal throne as\nAdrian IV in 1154. John was also well-acquainted with important\nfigures in twelfth-century secular life, in France as well as England,\nmost especially Henry II. John had supported Henry’s side in the\nstruggle against the partisans of King Stephen during the period of\nEnglish history known as the Anarchy. John was, however, sufficiently\nvocal in his opposition to Henry’s policies toward the English\nchurch to be banished from the royal court during 1156 and 1157.\nAlthough he ultimately recovered favor, he acquired a lingering\nskepticism about Henry’s motives that was to be confirmed by\nlater events. As busy as John seems to have been with Canterbury\nadministration in the final years of Theobald’s archiepiscopacy,\nthis was also the period (late 1156 through late 1159) in which John\nproduced the two works for which he is best known and esteemed: the\nMetalogicon, which presents a survey of the scholastic\ncurriculum and a defense of the study of the trivium; and,\nthe Policraticus, a work of moral and political philosophy\ngrounded in a Ciceronian moderate skepticism and replete with\nexempla drawn from Biblical, patristic, and classical\nsources. \nAfter Becket became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, he began to\ndefend ecclesiastical liberty against Henry’s encroachments,\npartly in response to which Becket tasked John with composing (in\nearly 1163) a hagiography of Anselm—a prior Canterbury\narchbishop who’d wrestled with overreaching English\nmonarchs—in support of formal canonization. As the conflict\nbetween Becket and Henry deepened, John backed the church’s\ncause against the English crown, albeit somewhat reluctantly. John\nconsequently spent much of the 1160s in exile, either in France or at\nthe papal court, lobbying on behalf of Becket and against Henry and\nthe English bishops who backed the king. Most of the copious volume of\nletters contained in John’s second letter collection date from\nand form important testimony to this period. Following Becket’s\nmurder in December 1170, an event at which John was a bystander, he served\nthe English church in numerous capacities during the early 1170s.\nImportantly, John wrote one of the earliest hagiographies of Becket,\nused in support of an initial canonization effort. John was\nconsecrated Bishop of Chartres in 1176 (a post in which he dedicated\nhimself to promoting the cult of Becket). He died there in 1180 and is\nburied in the nearby abbey church of Notre-Dame-de-Josaphat. \nIt was once supposed that John of Salisbury was “the best-read\nman of the twelfth century” (Poole 1932: 191). Janet Martin,\nhowever, has convincingly demonstrated that much of John’s\nfamiliarity with Latin (and, to some extent, Greek) classics derived\nfrom so-called florilegia, collections of brief passages\n(Martin 1977, 1979, 1984). These compilations were probably readily\navailable in the extensive (pre-Reformation) library of Christ Church\nmonastery, attached to Canterbury Cathedral. This does not mean that\nJohn lacked direct acquaintance with ancient philosophical texts and\nideas. At minimum, a list of his personal library (which he left to\nChartres Cathedral, where he served as bishop from 1176 to 1180)\nmentions Cicero’s De officiis and De oratore,\nSeneca’s Naturalium quaestionum libros, and Valerius\nMaximus (Webb 1932: 65–69). Of course, John knew many more\nancient Latin authors and texts than those contained in his own\ncollection. In addition to Christ Church’s library, John’s\ntravels afforded him access to considerable textual resources.\nMoreover, intellectuals of the time often traded volumes or\ncommissioned copies thereof. Hence, the Latin philosophers, especially\nCicero and Seneca, enjoyed wide dissemination during the twelfth\ncentury, and John relied heavily upon them (see the comprehensive\noverview by Hermand-Schebat 2015). \nAmong the Greek philosophers, John’s knowledge was meager at\nbest, if only because the language of ancient Greece was almost\nentirely absent in the Latin West during the twelfth century. Until\nthe dissemination of Latin translations of the Aristotelian corpus,\nand a few works by Plato, over the course of the thirteenth century,\nlittle in the way of acquaintance was possible. The only one of\nPlato’s texts that John could have accessed was the\nTimaeus in the partial translation by Calcidius; among\nAristotle’s writings, he clearly was somewhat familiar with the\nsix books of the Organon, which formed the foundation for the\nAristotelian logical and “scientific” system. In an\nundated letter to his former teacher Richard of\nl’Évêque, John expresses interest in acquiring\n(unspecified) works by Aristotle (JL2: 294–95). (Bloch 2012\noffers a thorough analysis of the technical aspects of John’s\nuse of classical sources in his philosophy, with special, but not\nexclusive, attention to Aristotle.) \nYet John clearly knew a great deal more about the doctrines of the\nclassical Greek philosophers than this account might indicate. There were\na number of Latin-language writers who transmitted to the Middle Ages\naccounts of Greek philosophical teachings, including Apuleius,\nCalcidius, Cicero, Lactantius, and St. Augustine. Thus, for example,\nJohn was aware of the existence of Plato’s Republic and\nsome of its leading ideas, even though that text did not circulate in\nEurope until the fifteenth century (Dutton 1983; PC: 54, 137). He was\nalso able to make considerable reference to Epicurus, albeit primarily\nfiltered through the highly critical writings of Cicero and other\nLatin authors (Nederman and Bollermann 2011). And, the translated\ntexts of ancient Greek thinkers sometimes contained passing references\nto other of their philosophical precepts, forming so-called\n“underground” sources (a term applied to John by Nederman\nand Brückmann 1983: 228–29). One instance of this is\nJohn’s use of key elements of Aristotelian ethical theory in his\nmajor writings, nearly one hundred years before the circulation of a\nLatin version of the Nicomachean Ethics, explicable by\nAristotle’s occasional references to his moral principles in the\nOrganon (Nederman 1997). \nDespite the relative paucity of John’s access to ancient\nphilosophical writings, he pieced together a great deal of information\nabout the ideas posited by their authors. This was central to\nJohn’s vision of his intellectual enterprise. In a famous\ncomment in the Metalogicon, John speaks of the heritage to\nwhich he owes a great debt: \n… our age enjoys the benefit of the age preceding, and often\nknows more than it, not indeed because our intelligence outstrips\ntheirs, but because we depend on the strength of others and on the\nabundant learning of our ancestors. Bernard of Chartres used to say\nthat we are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants so that we\nare able to see more and further than they, not indeed by the\nsharpness of our own vision or the height of our bodies, but because\nwe are lifted up on high and raised aloft by the greatness of giants.\nWith these words I will readily concur…. (ML: 257) \nWhile what John owes to the great Christian theologians of the past\nshould by no means be diminished, he clearly and stridently viewed\nhimself as heir to the ancient traditions of philosophical inquiry.\nFor this reason, among others, the term “humanist” has\nbeen bestowed upon him (by Leibschütz 1950 and more recently\nNederman 2005: 41–43, but challenged by Olsen 1998 and later\nBloch 2012: 61). The issue is not whether John read his classical\npredecessors “accurately”, but how he found inspiration in\nand adapted them in such a manner as to defend and further his own\nendeavors as a philosopher. \nThe most fundamental of John’s philosophical commitments arises\nexpressly from Cicero. Beyond John’s self-conscious (and largely\nsuccessful) effort to imitate Cicero’s polished style of Latin\nexpression, he embraces the Ciceronian dedication to the program of\nthe New Academy (Nederman 2005; Grellard 2013). The New Academy\nadvocated an anti-dogmatic probabilistic theory of knowledge according\nto which claims to certainty remain open to challenge, so long as they\nhave not been demonstrated beyond doubt. Cicero distanced himself from\nthe more radically skeptical method of the so-called “Old\nAcademy”, which denied that anything whatsoever could be known\nwith certainty (Cicero De natura deorum: 1.1). As Cicero explains, the New Academy\ndoes not foreclose the possibility of the human mind attaining truth\n(pace the Old Academy), only insisting that the criteria for\ndiscerning truth from falsity are not self-evident or intuitive and\nthat the senses can be deceived (Cicero Academica: 2.24.76–2.30.98).\nCicero’s skeptical stance has the character not of absolute\ndoubt but of anti-dogmatism. \nJohn overtly adopted the same Ciceronian New Academic perspective in\nall of his noteworthy contributions to philosophy: the\nPolicraticus, the Metalogicon, and the\nEntheticus de dogmate philosophorum maior. The first is his\nbest-known work, a treatise on proper courtly and royal conduct which\ncontains a great measure of political theory; the second comprises his\ncritical appraisal of the state of education in twelfth-century\nEurope, with special attention to the advances in knowledge occasioned\nby the Aristotelian learning of his time; the last is a lengthy\ndidactic poem. While scholars have normally treated these writings as\ndiscrete and largely unrelated (Wilks 1984a and von Moos 1984 are\nexceptions), they are united methodologically by their shared\nendorsement and application of Ciceronian moderate skepticism, which\nproves to be crucial in framing the substance of John’s\nphilosophical stance. Charles B. Schmitt’s claim that\nJohn’s “treatment [of the New Academy] has little\nphilosophical sophistication” proves unsustainable (Schmitt\n1972: 37–38). \nBecause John enjoyed broad access to Cicero’s main works of\nphilosophy, he possessed a comprehensive understanding of the issues\nat stake in adherence to New Academic skepticism (Denery 2016),\nclearly grasping the epistemological differences underpinning moderate\nand rigorous skeptical stances. In his Entheticus maior, John\nchides the radically skeptical view of the Old Academy that “the\nhuman race is deprived of light” (EMM: 1.138), endorsing the\nposition associated with the New Academy that  \none should hesitate in all things except those which are proved by\nliving reason … These things, [the Academic] declares, are\nknown; he passes doubtfully on other things, of which more certainty\nis to be had from experience. For the usual course of events makes\nprobable what you always see under a similar pattern. Yet, since it\nsometimes happens otherwise, these things are not sufficiently\ncertain, and yet not without evidence. What he, therefore, affirms to\nbe true, he thinks to be necessary; for the rest, he says “I\nbelieve” or “I think it to be”. (EMM, ll.\n1143–44, 1147–54) \nCommencing with his first work of philosophical reflection, John had\nalready declared his allegiance to an essentially Ciceronian\noutlook. \nJohn’s Metalogicon reiterates this position, repeatedly\nproclaiming his explicit commitment to the philosophical program of\nthe New Academy. In the prologue, he announces,  \nAn Academic in matters which to the wise man are doubtful, I do not\nswear that what I say is true, but, be it true or false, I remain\ncontent with probability alone. (ML: 122)  \nWhile John distances his version of skepticism from more radical\nviews, he admits that the process of achieving knowledge is\ntroublesome. Echoing a remark by Cicero, John observes,  \n… it is a great thing to discover the truth, which, as our\nAcademic friends claim, lies hidden as it were at the bottom of a well\n…. (ML: 205)  \nJohn returns often in the Metalogicon to Cicero’s\nmethodological injunction against embracing insufficiently\nsubstantiated truth-claims too hastily. A main theme of the\nMetalogicon might aptly be characterized as the refutation of\nthe arid argumentation that occurred among the teachers of his time as\na result of their unwillingness to renounce their rigid formulae and\nfixed dogmas. \nJohn of Salisbury’s most extensive discussion and application of\nthe Ciceronian New Academy occurs in the Policraticus. That\ntreatise again contains repeated self-identification of its author\nwith the teachings of the Academy, its prologue echoing the words of\nthe Metalogicon:  \nIn philosophy, I am a devotee of Academic dispute, which measures by\nreason that which presents itself as more probable. … I do not\nrecede from their footprints in those matters about which the wise\nperson has doubts. (PC: 7)  \nThis is raised to the level of an evaluative standard in Book\nSeven’s recounting of the major schools of Greco-Roman\nphilosophy, the stated aim of which is to discover the valuable\nlessons of each as well as to demonstrate the limitations inherent in\nall (PC: 148–49). The treatment of the Academic School is given\npride of place, opening this critical history of pagan philosophy.\nEven as he admits his own devotion to the Academy, John stresses the\ndivide that exists within the School between an extreme skepticism and\nhis own moderate Ciceronian stance, offering a reductio\nargument against the former: \nYet I do not say that all those who are included under the name of\nAcademic have upheld the rule of modesty, since even its basic creed\nis in dispute and parts of it are open as much to derision as to\nerror… If the Academic is in doubt about each thing, he is\ncertain about nothing… But he possesses uncertainty about\nwhether he is in doubt, so long as he does not know for certain that\nhe does not know this doubt itself. (PC: 150) \nRadical skepticism cannot attain the mantle of philosophy, John says,\nbecause the philosopher’s love of wisdom requires the admission\nthat one may know what is true (PC: 151–52). \nJohn’s moderate skepticism accepts that there are three reliable\nfoundations for knowledge: faith, reason, and the senses (PC:\n153–56). Thus, it does not behoove the philosopher to question\nhis faith in the existence of God, nor the certainty of some\nmathematical postulates, nor a number of other first principles which\n“one is not permitted to doubt, except for those who are\noccupied by the labors of not knowing anything” (PC: 154).\nThough it might seem that John’s skepticism is not so very\nskeptical after all, he generates a lengthy list of  \ndoubtful matters about which the wise person is not convinced by the\nauthority of either faith or his senses or manifest reason, and in\nwhich contrary claims rest on the support of some evidence. (PC: 152)\n \nThese topics include major issues of metaphysics, cosmology, natural\nscience, theology, and ethics. Among the ethical topics that John\ncites as susceptible to doubt, and thus open to rational debate, are\n \nthe uses and end and origins of virtues and vices, whether a man who\nhas one virtue has all the virtues, whether all sins are equal and are\npunishable equally. (PC: 152)  \nThe entire list is clearly meant to be illustrative rather than\ninclusive (PC: 152–53). In sum, John opens up to rational\ndispute an extraordinarily broad array of topics which are appropriate\nfor philosophical discourse. In confronting all such debatable\nsubjects, John counsels adherence to the Academic method, since  \nthe Academics have doubts regarding these matters with so much modesty\nthat I perceive them to have guarded diligently against the danger of\nrashness. (PC: 153)  \nUnique among all schools of philosophy, the Academy resists the\ntemptation to replace open discussion of uncertain matters with\nprematurely closed dogma. In John’s view, the moderate\nskepticism of the New Academy alone defends the liberty of inquiry\nthat he regards to be necessary to the quest for truth. \nAlthough the Policraticus does not restate the\nepistemological bases of intellectual fallibility addressed in the\nEntheticus and Metalogicon, it clearly takes for\ngranted that the human mind is furnished with the potential power to\ncomprehend truth. Hence, John rejects the Augustinian claim that even\nCicero’s moderate skepticism  \npiles up darkness from some hidden source, and warns that the whole of\nphilosophy is obscure, and does not allow one to hope that any light\nwill be found in it. (Augustine Against the Academicians:\n3.14.30)  \nIn a surprising twist, John enlists Augustine himself in support of\nthose who evince Academic doubt:  \nEven our Augustine does not assail them, since he himself somewhat\nfrequently employs Academic moderation in his works and propounds many\nmatters as ambiguous which would not seem to be in question to another\narguing with greater confidence and just as safely. (PC: 152)  \nOn John’s reading, Augustine practiced the Academic method even\nwhile he excoriated it in principle. The validity of this\ninterpretation aside, John seeks any evidence whatsoever to bolster\nhis view that “mortals can know very little” (EMM, l.\n1142). \nJohn’s admiration for temperate Academic skepticism supports\nwhat is among the key themes of his philosophy: modestia or\nmoderatio. He was a convinced adherent of an\nAristotelian-tinged doctrine that virtue necessarily consists in the\nmean, and that moderation in all things is the most valid standard for\njudging human thought and action (Nederman 1997). As John points out\nin the Entheticus, the Academic stance is consonant with  \na modest mind … that no one may accuse it of being guilty of\nfalsehood; it thus tempers all words with qualifiers, so that it\nshould always be rightly credible. (EMM, ll. 155–58)  \nJohn stresses that the possessors of such a modest mind\n“restrain their words according to condition, time, cause, and\nmanner, [and] they avoid speaking with too much simplicity”\n(EMM, ll. 161–62). Academic moderation results in rhetorical and\nintellectual humility, if not caution, consistent with the virtuous\nmean. \nThe counsel of moderation as crucial to any form of virtue permeates\nJohn’s later corpus as well. In the Metalogicon, he\ninsists that education has a definite ethical component that requires\nrecognition and examination. As he acknowledges in his prefatory\nremarks, \nI have deliberately included a number of comments on moral issues,\nsince my view is that everything that is read or written is valueless\nexcept in so far as it affords support to the way we live. Any\nprofession of philosophy whatsoever is valueless and deceitful if it\ndoes manifest itself in the cultivation of virtue and the conduct of\nour lives. (ML: 122) \nMaking men virtuous is not a distinct enterprise from making them\nintelligent or knowledgeable; it is worthless to be well-educated if\none is unable to apply this learning in the service of moral\nrectitude. Moreover, the very techniques one employs in the\nacquisition of knowledge are subject to ethical evaluation and\njudgment. Proper learning is defined not only by the quantity of\nknowledge inculcated, but by the quality of the educational\nexperience. John believes that the doctrine of moderation and the\nvirtuous mean is essential to any pedagogy which takes seriously its\nduty to mold morals as well as intellect. \nThe theme of moderation appears most prominently in the\nMetalogicon’s discussion of the correct attitude that\nthe student ought to adopt toward his subject matter. Intellectual\ndiscipline, John asserts, arises out of adherence to a mean course\nbetween the overzealous pursuit of all topics and an absence of\nintellectual curiosity: “If, however, there is no moderation,\nall these qualities [of the mind] turn to their opposites. Subtlety is\nreft of its utility” (ML: 194). The mind must first discriminate\namong its potential subjects of study in order to eliminate those that\nare unsuitable, namely, matters that pertain to God alone as well as\n“things which are harmful; … from which come pain, anger,\ncupidity, and their followers, envy, hate, slander, lechery and vanity\n…” (ML: 299). Yet, excessive caution yields an intellect\nthat resists inquiry into new or foreign territory. John maintains\nthat proper philosophical investigation demands careful reflection\nupon the boundaries of one’s intelligence in consort with the\ncorrect application of our God-given powers of reason (ML:\n180–82). \nJohn extends his discussion of intellectual moderation to pedagogical\npractice, such that a moderate attitude toward study is manifested in\nthe extent of materials one consults. The Metalogicon warns\nthat  \nto follow up what some one even of the most contemptible of men has\never said is a sign either of complete masochism or of empty top-show,\nand it impedes and overwhelms minds which would be better off spending\ntheir time on other things. (ML: 177)  \nThe well-trained scholar will survey those authorities who are\ndeserving of respect, while ignoring works that do not merit effort\nand attention. Equally importantly, learning ought not to be an\nall-consuming, exclusive (and therefore excessive) way of life.\nRather,  \nintelligence must … be carefully cultivated under the control\nboth of study and of relaxation, the former designed to give it\nstrength, the latter encouragement … Intelligence starts with\nnature, is assisted by practice, is dulled by excess of toil, and is\nsharpened by controlled exercise. (ML: 148)  \nThe overzealous scholar courts counterproductive conduct, if not the\nperil of his soul. \nThe notion that wisdom entails a moderate cast of mind forms the basis\nfor John’s criticism of pedagogical techniques then current in\nthe schools. The temper of the times discourages observation of the\nmean, so that instructors prompt students to all manner of\nintellectual excess. Disputations are conducted without concern for\ntime, place, or topic, in spite of the fact that  \nAristotle ought to have checked this immoderation on the part of those\nwho identify indiscriminate volubility with the exercise of dialectic.\n(ML: 196)  \nIt is on grounds of immoderation that John objects to the unrestrained\nuse of the verbal duel:  \nA voluble tongue … throws one’s life into confusion, and,\nunless checked by the curb of moderation, drives one’s whole\nbeing headlong. (ML: 195–96; translation slightly altered)  \nHe has observed this situation, he says, at first hand. After visiting\nformer school associates from Paris, John reports his disappointment,\nfinding that “[t]hey had made progress—in just this one\nthing that, having unlearned moderation, they had thereby lost all\nmodesty” (ML: 201). For like reasons, the Metalogicon\nurges re-evaluation of the contemporary practices associated with\nphilosophical studies. When logic and dialectic are employed without\nregard for the pursuit of wisdom, when their practice moves beyond the\nmean, when, in sum, philosophy becomes immoderately fond of its own\nimage, the goal of wisdom ceases to be paramount and such study is\nsterile and pointless. \nThe theme of moderation likewise infuses the Policraticus,\nthe audience for which was two-fold: first, courtiers and other\nso-called “bureaucrats” (per Forhan 1985) who serve the\ninterests of the realm; and second, rulers who are ultimately\nresponsible for maintaining peace and justice in their kingdoms.\nJohn’s primary concern is to illuminate the vices of kings and\ntheir servants in order to instruct them in the forms of behavior\nappropriate to men of status and power. But John adopts a realistic\napproach, explicitly acknowledging that the demands of an ascetic\nmorality are unsuitable for such people. Since John intended the\nPolicraticus to be a practical guidebook, he was prepared to\nallow that  \nif moderation is displayed, I do not judge it unbecoming … to\ndwell at times upon the pleasures of the senses; as has been said,\nnothing is unseemly that is beyond measure … Modestly pursued\nfor purposes of recreation, they are excused upon the license of\nleisure. (FCP: 373)  \nJohn orients the value of moderation toward the actual conditions\nunder which courtiers and princes live. But there is an implicit\npolitical warning: Those in positions of leadership must not become so\nin thrall to such pursuits that these become ends in themselves and\nthe business of the kingdom suffers. \nMore broadly, John harnesses the principle of moderation to a general\ntheory of virtue, one that has important consequences for his\npolitical as well as moral thought. It is central to John’s\ndoctrine throughout the Policraticus that if any action  \nexceeds the mean, it is a fault. Every virtue is marked by its own\nboundaries, and consists in the mean. If one exceeds this, one is off\nthe road, not on it. (FCP: 157)  \nBad men “‘withdraw from the mean between vices, which is\nthe field of virtue’” (FCP: 374). But John by no means\nendorses zealotry. Employing the metaphor of the left and right hands,\nJohn observes that  \nto stray to the right is to insist vehemently upon the virtues\nthemselves [that is, to be fanatical]. To stray to the left is to\nexceed the mean in works of virtue, which consists in the mean. Truly\nall vehemence is inimical to salvation, and all excess is in error; an\nexcess of goodness and of habitually good deeds is very evil. (PC: 53)\n \nWhile this view may seem strange for an orthodox churchman to assert,\nit reveals the extent of John’s concern about how his audience\nmight interpret his remarks. All virtues by nature may be attained\nonly when pursued within definite limits, and so he is not expecting\ncourtiers to be saints. Almost certainly referring to Aristotle, John\nremarks that  \nthe philosopher says: Beware that which is excessive because if one\nabandons this cautious moderation itself, to that extent does one\nwithdraw incautiously from the path of virtue … What, therefore\nis advanced by excess, if the queen of the virtues, justice, perishes\nin its excessiveness? (PC: 54) \nOverstepping good in the name of goodness itself is as repugnant as\nthe utter absence of moral propriety. \nTo determine the virtuous mean in any specific circumstance, John\nadvances an essentially Ciceronian standard: “Discretion with\nregard to time, place, amount, person and cause readily draws the\nproper distinction” between virtuous and vicious actions.\nIndeed, one might understand John to advocate a sort of\ncircumstantialist—though by no means relativist—moral\ntheory, since discretion “is the origin and source of moderation\nin its widest sense without which no duty is properly performed”\n(FCP: 373). Attention to context is required, for John, to guide the\ndeterminations one ought to make of what constitutes virtuous\nbehavior. Thus, it is clearly vicious to take a human life, yet as a\nform of punishment or as the result of a justly fought battle, it may\nbe vicious not to take a life. This conception of virtue\nposits the identification of a morally correct action as a sort of\nmoving target, rather than a fixed moral absolute that applies at all\ntimes and in all places. This seems to be the philosophical premise\nbehind his argument that various activities that might be viewed as\nreprehensible in themselves may be morally justifiable when conducted\nin the proper measure. In Book One of the Policraticus,\nfollowing a lengthy and scathing critique of hunting—a favorite\npastime of the English aristocracy to whom he is writing—John\nreverses course: “The activity, however, is laudable when\nmoderation is shown and hunting is pursued with judgment and, when\npossible, with profit” (FCP: 25). The same holds for the many\nother popular courtly “frivolities”. John’s\noverarching aim is to keep his audience mindful of that\n“moderation without which the good life is impossible”\n(FCP: 161), the very essence of which is the performance of the right\nact in the right way and in the right situation, in accordance with\none’s best judgment. (For further discussion of this topic, see\nthe supplement on\n Practical Moderate Skepticism.) \nJohn applies his principle that virtue is by definition a mean between\nexcess and deficiency emphatically to the ruler. The moral qualities\nof the community as a whole are inextricable linked, in John’s\nview, to the moral characteristics of its royal head. By dint of his\npersonal character, the good prince—the king—assures the\ncoherence and well-being of the polity he rules; by contrast, a\nvicious prince—the tyrant—will reduce his subjects to\nslaves of his own private desires. Given the definition of virtue that\nJohn posits, the actions of a king must themselves and by definition\nbe moderate. According to the Policraticus, the moderation\nexercised by the good ruler necessarily unifies and balances the\nrelationship that his people enjoy with one another. Employing a\nmusical metaphor, he asks,  \nHow much more care should be taken by princes to be moderate—at\none time by the vigour of justice, at another by the forgiveness of\nmercy—so that subjects are made to be of a single mind …\nand the works of peace and charity create one perfect and great\nharmony out of pursuits which appear discordant? (PC: 51)  \nThis does not mean that the king is the absolute arbiter of his\nsubjects’ morals. Rather, the good prince should instruct by\nexample, adopting that “tranquil moderation of mind” so\nvalued in the magistrates of antiquity (PC: 54). While never\nencouraging vice, John’s preferred ruler would tolerate—or\nat least not punish hastily and harshly—those evils committed by\nmembers of the community that do not endanger public order or\nreligious orthodoxy. John cautions that “the amount of the\naffection, with which subjects are embraced [by the king] like\nbrothers in the arms of charity must be confined to the limits of\nmoderation”, lest his people lose respect for him and believe\nthat they can perform all manner of wickedness without fear of\nconsequence (PC: 49). Yet, the Policraticus protests against\nthe ruler “who is too excessively inclined towards the punishing\nof the faults of subjects” (PC: 54). While the king should\nrapidly take action against those “flagrant crimes” that\n“one is not permitted to endure or which cannot faithfully be\nendured”, he should also demonstrate mildness and patience\ntoward those acts of his subjects “which honor and religion can\nsecurely endure” (PC: 140). Special royal virtue, the art of\ngovernance, consists in the moderate use of the authority that God has\nbestowed. \nAlthough John regards the king as “the minister of God”\nand the servant of divine law, the good ruler must restrain himself\nwith the bridle of law and hold back his will, while maintaining\nhumility in his relations with his subjects, since he is defined by\nmoderation in all his deeds and decrees (PC: 28–29,\n46–49). A good ruler will display such restraint despite his\ndivinely mandated power, according to John, because the king’s\ningrained moral character—the result of a careful program of\ninstruction—necessarily guides him to seek justice and to\nrespect divine dictates. It bears emphasis that John’s\nconception of the nature of political power is an entirely\npersonalized one: The incumbent makes the office. The king’s\ndisposition to follow the path of moderation is reinforced by the\nrewards that he receives: Honored among men, he guarantees a peaceful\nreign and safe succession; beloved of God, he will receive the gift of\nsalvation. “Kings can both flourish and abound with the most\nsweet worldly things”, John proclaims, “and yet can pick\nthe most useful fruits of eternity” (PC: 55). Nor does he\nsuppose that such desserts pertain only to the most righteous of\nrulers:  \nTo refuse evil is a great thing in them [princes], even if they do no\ngreat goodness, provided that they do not permit their subjects to\nindulge in evil. (PC: 55)  \nThe king who refrains from misusing his great powers and who pursues\npolicies that maintain the harmonious order of the community assures\nhappiness (temporal and eternal) for himself, his progeny, and his\nsubjects.  \nThe opposite of the king is the tyrant, who is characterized by the\nimmoderate application of political power over those subject to him.\nIf the ruler seeks excessive domination, if he attempts to use his\npower to enslave the community, then he is a tyrant. That is, the\ntyrant is a person possessing a wholly self-interested and willful\ncharacter whose ambition for the supreme governmental office has been\nfulfilled. What renders him a tyrant is, strictly speaking, neither\nhis moral qualities nor the power he exercises, but the conjunction\nand combination of the two. A tyrant claims a monopoly of\ndiscretionary authority over all those under his control, so that the\nmaintenance of his full license requires the absence of true freedom\nfor others. The Policraticus insists that “as long as\nall, collectively and individually, are borne along at the will of a\nsingle head, they are deprived of their own free will” (FCP:\n184). Nor does John believe that the victim of the tyrant ought\n“to make a virtue of necessity by uniting consent and necessity\nand by gracefully embracing that which is incumbent upon him”\n(FCP: 184), as this preserves the mere semblance of liberty. John\ninstead advocates positive measures to protect the community from its\ntyrant—in the last instance, by tyrannicide (discussed below).\nThe good government of the king, typified by rule in accordance with\nthe virtuous mean, is regarded by the Policraticus to be the\nsole guarantee of the freedom necessary for the exercise of moral\ngoodness in society. \nIn line with John’s heavy emphasis on moderation, significant\nsections of Books Seven and Eight of the Policraticus deliver\na withering critique of a philosophy he regards as the antithesis of\nmoderation, namely, Epicureanism (despite virtually no mention of\nEpicurus and/or his school in the examination of John’s use of\nclassical philosophy in Hermand-Schebat 2015). While John’s\nviews reflect Cicero’s highly critical perspective (similar\ncriticisms exist in Seneca and Augustine’s De civitate\ndei), several aspects of John’s presentation of\nEpicureanism seem highly distinctive and innovative. In selectively\nappropriating Epicurean doctrines, he omits significant dimensions of\nthe tradition, while extending other elements in novel directions.\nClassical Epicureanism depended upon an atomistic cosmology that\nposited random occurrences in the void as the ontological premise of\nthe universe. As a consequence, classical Epicureans insisted that no\npolitical lessons followed from their moral theory. John sets aside\nthe cosmological backdrop to Epicurean ethical teachings, while also\nfinding in them the source of a potent (albeit dangerous) political\ndoctrine. There does not seem to be any direct precedent for such an\ninterpretation, but, given John’s inventive use of authorities\nand exempla, one ought not to be surprised by his selective\nand idiosyncratic treatment of the Epicurean school (von Moos 1984;\nMartin 1984).  \nOne indication that John is offering a unique reading of the Epicurean\ntradition emerges from his claim that the ideas of Epicurus himself\nare not to be mainly disdained, but that his followers should be\nblamed for turning his ethics into a form of untrammeled hedonism.\nDeviating from his ancient and patristic sources, John detaches master\nfrom school, finding some merit in Epicurus’ notion that\nhappiness may be sought through the pursuit of moderate hedonism.\n“[I]f moderation is displayed”, John states,  \nI do not judge it unbecoming … to dwell at times upon these\npleasures of the senses … [for] nothing is unseemly except that\nwhich is beyond measure. (FCP: 373)  \n“[T]he field of virtue” consists neither in excessive\nenjoyment of nor denial of pleasure, but is to be found in “the\nmean between vices” (FCP: 374). \nJohn asserts that the followers of Epicurus broke loose from the\ncrucial restraint of moderation, such that Epicureanism became the\npursuit of sensual pleasure without bounds. John separates\nEpicurus’ acceptable philosophy from its later practice:  \n…[W]hat should have been the instrument of virtue has been\ndiverted by writers to the profit of filthiness. Flesh then has\nconcluded (for assuredly no man endowed with sense holds the opinion)\nthat to think, say, and do all that the mind, tongue, and hand covet\nand to thwart oneself or to repress one’s inclination in nothing\nis the life of a man enjoying supreme happiness …. (FCP: 273)\n \nThe sensual has been placed above the philosophical, the external\nabove the internal, and pleasure above wisdom, so that in all ways\nEpicureanism subverts true happiness. Epicureanism not only perverts\nthe individual, but also the entire body politic, inasmuch as a nation\nthat “has … been conquered by its own\nself-indulgence” is ripe for conquest (FCP: 331). \nThose whom John labels Epicureans are so branded not because of any\nself-proclaimed adherence to the school of Epicurus, but rather\nbecause of their observable behaviors and deeds. Excess is the\ndefining characteristic of Epicureans, “who in all matters serve\ntheir own personal desires” (PC: 182). Because they “teach\nphilosophy and … serve their own private wills”, they are\nalso hypocrites (PC: 175). Despite John’s flexible standard for\nevaluating moderation, he finds that “the world is filled with\nEpicureans for the reason that in its great multitude of men there are\nfew who are not slaves to lust” (FCP: 399–400). Since most\npeople are susceptible to sensual gratification, one need not call\noneself an Epicurean, John asserts, in order to practice its\nteachings. \nJohn is convinced that Epicureans, lacking moderation, cannot achieve\nthe happiness that Epicurus himself postulated (FCP: 399), because\n \ntoilsome is the passage to happiness by the route of pleasure, for its\nvotaries gather wealth to maintain themselves, seek grandeur to be\nupheld by power, position to inspire respect and to avoid contempt,\nand aim at glory to win fame. Yet that life which Epicurus describes\nis not acquired by all these means. (FCP: 274)  \nOne sign that a man driven by Epicurean acquisitiveness is\nnotoriety—whether in conduct, speech, or dress—“for\nnotoriety connotes lack of moderation” (FCP: 371). Thus it is\nthat “ermine makes the judge” (FCP: 386). A person’s\ndesire for possessions “exhaust[s] the strength of [his] whole\nbeing” and can never lead to the good life, “[f]or the\nfrenzy of avarice … covets to excess the possessions of others\nor guards its own too tenaciously” (FCP: 277). John is explicit\nabout the origin of this vicious cycle: “Pride is the beginning\nof all sin”, creating in man the desire to be pre-eminent. From\nits “poisonous root” spring ambition, acquisitiveness,\nhoarding, resentment, flattery, false modesty, over-indulgence, and\nall manner of evils (FCP: 295). \nWhile John recognizes hierarchy as intrinsic to human and corporate\nrelations, he warns of the perverting effects hierarchy can produce\nwhen the twin pillars of liberality and justice have been toppled:\n“Wealth, influence, and favor, since they confer much power, put\ncharacter to a severe test” (FCP: 298). The only way to survive\nsuch a test is to embrace the guiding light of moderation, for\n“[e]ach one more easily becomes puffed up with pride in that in\nwhich he excels others, unless he be sustained by the grace of\nmoderation” (FCP: 297). Though aware of Plato’s contention\nthat such pleasures ought to be actively struggled against (a stock\nview of classical philosophers), John advocates that “the safer\ncourse [is] to flee and evade the conflict”, as he has never\n“read of anyone who has challenged carnal pleasures who has not\nfallen in the encounter” (FCP: 353). Likely, his own experience\nand observations of rampant Epicureanism also inform his views. \nJohn’s treatment of Epicureanism leads him to identify a\npolitical component not present in the ancient school. For John, the\nEpicurean mindset and lifestyle are intimately associated with and\nform the foundation for tyranny, which is not a wholly political\nconcept. The Policraticus details several species of tyrant:\nthe private tyrant, the ecclesiastical tyrant, and the public or royal\ntyrant (PC: 191–92). According to John, anyone who employs power\nto impose his will arbitrarily upon another is a tyrant. John admits\nthat his definition deviates considerably from the ordinary\nunderstanding: \nIt is said that the tyrant is one who oppresses a people by forceful\ndomination; but it is not solely over a people that [the tyrant]\nexercises his tyranny, but he can do so from the lowest position. For\nif not over a people, still he will lord over (dominatur)\nwhomever he can … Who is it who does not wish to come before\nsome other one if he might be subdued? (PC: 163) \nAnyone, in John’s estimation, is capable of behaving\ntyrannically, owing to humans’ deep-seated desire to seek\nsensual gratification. “They who wish to do their own will are\nto be rated as Epicureans”, John concludes, “for when\nactions become the slave of lust, affection changes to passion”\n(FCP: 399). The vices of Epicureanism spring from “the well of\npassion”, which leads men to suppose that they “can do\nwith impunity” whatever they wish and “can to a certain\ndegree be just like God”—not in imitation of divine\ngoodness, but in the belief that their wills can supplant God’s\nown. Thus, Epicureanism promotes pride and ambition, leading to\n“a passion for power and honors” that constitutes the root\nof tyranny (PC: 162–63). (For John’s paradigmatic example,\nsee the supplement on\n The Epicurean Tyrant.) \nAnother substantive philosophical issue John of Salisbury engages is\nthe role played by nature in the foundations of social and political\norder, an interest evident across his works. That John adopts a\nnaturalistic framework in the Policraticus might seem\nsensible, but it appears also as a crucial feature of the\nMetalogicon, wherein John develops the Ciceronian theme that\nhumans are transformed from animalistic primordial beings into civil\ncreatures as a consequence of the realization of the inhering human\ncapacities of reason and language. Thus, education forms a highly\nrelevant element of his naturalism. \nJohn’s appeal to a Ciceronian conception of the natural\nfoundations of society in the Metalogicon arises out of his\nattempt to refute the doctrine, ascribed to the possibly fictional\nCornificius and his followers, that the qualities and powers with\nwhich men are born constitute the limit of their knowledge and\nfaculties (Tobin 1989). Under this view, human beings ought not to\nseek to improve their condition or to develop their minds and skills,\nrelying instead on God’s redemptive grace, while shunning the\nmaterial world and their own natures completely (ML: 137,\n141–42). In opposition to Cornificius, John argues that the\nmundane and sinful character of human nature does not end the debate.\nRather, God through nature has granted to mankind the capacity to\nimprove its lot by diligent application of the native faculties of\nreason and speech. This is not to say that John considers man’s\nnature (in Aristotelian terms) to be wholly perfectible; grace is\nstill required. Yet men may accomplish much by nature alone, contrary\nto the Cornifician teaching that no attempt can (or perhaps should) be\nmade to develop post-lapsarian man (ML: 125–26). \nA major pillar supporting John’s case against the Cornificians\nis an adapted version of Cicero’s depiction of the primitive\ndevelopment of human association. John deploys his source in order to\ndemonstrate that social interaction among men is an important\nwell-spring of true (albeit partial, because merely mortal) happiness\nor blessedness (beatitudo). The Metalogicon regards\nnature (in Stoic fashion), “the most benign parent and governor\nof all things in order most due”, as imprinted with a divine\nplan (ML: 124). Thus, if nature has granted to man alone the powers of\nspeech and reason, this is so he may “gain blessedness”\n(ML: 125). Such a plan emerges from the rational observation of the\nstructure of the universe:  \n[T]he one and true God, in order to bind the parts of the universe in\na firm alliance and to keep charity alive, ordered them in such a way\nthat one thing needed the help of another, and one made good the\ndeficiency of another, every single one being as it were a member of\nevery other one. All things if separated from one another are thus\nonly half complete, but are made perfect when allied to others, since\nall things are held together by mutual support. (ML: 125)  \nThis theme of reciprocity imbues John’s corpus, employed in his\ncorrespondence and forming the basis of his organic metaphor for the\npolity (addressed below) (see JL1: 181). In the Metalogicon,\nthis universal model of mutual interconnection indicates the natural\ncourse which ought to guide human behavior: “[I]t is not\npossible even to imagine a kind of blessedness which knows nothing of\ncommunion or exists outside society”, John declares, because\nnature decrees that earthly happiness derives from human association\n(ML: 125). To imperil society by assailing man’s capacity to\nimprove his rational powers—an accusation which John levels\nagainst Cornificius—is thus to cut man off from the happiness\nwhich God has allotted to him in the present life, as well as to\nexclude the possibility of fulfilling the terms of divinely bestowed\ngrace. \nJohn’s view is that man’s rational faculty demands a level\nof sociability unparalleled in nature. In Ciceronian fashion, the\nMetalogicon argues that reason’s discovery of the\nnaturalness of association is not sufficient, because such individual\nrealization can never generate the community that it knows to be\nnatural to and beneficial for human existence. Speech is the mechanism\nby which mute wisdom translates its insights into public proclamations\nand persuades men to follow their natural inclination by surrendering\ntheir private interests in favor of the common good (ML: 126). Should\nhumans retain their rational abilities yet be deprived of speech,\n“they will become brute beasts, and … cities will seem\nlike farmyards rather than gatherings of human beings united in the\nbonds of society” (ML: 126). Enlightened eloquence, however,\n \ngave birth to so many glorious cities … and bound so many\npeoples in the bonds of charity, that whoever strives to put asunder\nwhat God has joined together for the common benefit of all would\nrightly be accounted the common enemy of all. (ML: 126)  \nJohn’s vision of society is comparable to Cicero’s in its\nquasi-contractual quality, in that human association requires, beyond\ngeographic proximity, explicit agreement to share a common life in all\nof the features that compose a community. Only the eloquent use of\nlanguage can convince selfish men that by nature they prefer the\ncommon good to personal welfare. In this regard, John’s reliance\non Cicero is pronounced: The Metalogicon presumes that the\nbond of association among men is simultaneously a product of their\nactive cooperation, a natural, but not purely natural (in contrast to\nAristotle), outcome. \nThe real significance of the Cornifician position lies in its\nopposition to “all cities simultaneously and the whole of civil\nlife”, since, by claiming that men should not develop their\ncapacities for reason and speech, any opportunity for man to associate\nis in the process denied (ML: 127). The Cornifician error is to\ninterpret the fixity of post-lapsarian human nature as a permanent\ncondition, whereas, if this were correct, society could never have\nbeen formed originally, let alone maintained. Yet, John recognizes\nthat conscious effort is required if men are to join together in\ncommunal life. John conceives of human association as a process of man\nrefining and improving his own abilities in order to aid the cause of\nnature. The Metalogicon’s understanding of the genesis\nof society is profoundly indebted to Cicero’s notion that\nnature’s endowment is only a point of departure which men must\ndevelop and shape if they are truly to live in accordance with their\nown natural inclinations. \nThis commitment to naturalism is perhaps even more on display in the\nPolicraticus, in which John repeatedly asserts that\n“nature is the best guide to living” (PC: 27, 127, 201).\nThe Policraticus follows the teaching in the\nMetalogicon that, while nature provides the foundation for\nhuman capabilities, they are only potentialities. “The beginning\nof each thing is from nature”, John observes, but people may\n(and should) develop their natural capacities by means of practice\nuntil they master their art, a principle that “obtains in\nliberal and mechanical occupations” alike (PC: 125). While\nnature offers a model for human conduct and association, the natural\nscheme for living well may only be realized with the cooperation of\npeople who partake in it. \nJohn’s naturalistic conception of cooperative association\ninforms the famous organic analogy that he proposes and develops in\nthe Policraticus. Ascribing his insight to a letter of\ninstruction (John’s creation) purportedly by Plutarch to Emperor\nTrajan, John commences with the simple observation that the\ncommonwealth may be likened to a “body which is animated”\n(PC: 66; on the history of the controversy about the letter’s\nauthenticity, see Martin 1984: 194–96). The different offices of\npolitical society are represented as analogous to the distinct parts\nof the human anatomy. Like all bodies, the commonwealth is guided by a\nsoul, which John assigns to “those who direct the practice of\nreligion” (PC: 67). Yet, just as the eternal human soul is not\ncoextensive with the mortal physical organism within which it resides,\nthe clerical soul of the polity is not, strictly speaking, a member of\nthe commonwealth (see Nederman 2013). Because the political creature\nis an essentially secular entity, the body politic is ruled by the\nprince, who “occupies the place of the head” (PC: 69).\n(For further discussion of the relationship between the secular body\nand its ecclesiastical soul, see the supplement on\n Princely Tyranny and the Liberty of the Church.) \nThe senate, composed of the prince’s counselors, functions as\nthe commonwealth’s heart. The senses correspond to the royal\njudges and local agents who exercise jurisdiction in the king’s\nname. The financial officers constitute the body’s stomach and\nintestines, while the tax-collector and the soldier represent the two\nhands. Finally, John compares the feet to the artisans and peasants\n“who erect, sustain and move forward the mass of the whole\nbody” (PC: 67). Each part of the organism, according to the\nPolicraticus, has its own definite function, fixed by its\nlocation within the overall scheme of the body. None of the members\nmay be excluded or removed without serious damage to the whole. \nJohn’s functional depiction of the community was not, as is\nsometimes supposed, primarily intended to justify hierarchy and\ndivision within society (for a contrary view, see Struve 1984:\n309–11). Rather, the body politic found in the\nPolicraticus is the expression of a principle of cooperative\nharmony through which otherwise disparate individuals and interests\nare reconciled and bound together. John adopts a\n“physiological” approach to the political organism,\naccording to which all of the organs cooperate reciprocally in order\nto achieve a common purpose. The Policraticus insists that\n“there can be no faithful and firm coherence where there is not\na tenacious unity of wills and a virtual joining together of souls\nthemselves” (PC: 77). Echoing the naturalistic principle\narticulated in the Metalogicon, John posits that all parts of\nthe body must be truly oriented toward and dedicated to a common or\npublic welfare that supersedes the aggregate private goods within the\npolity. The ruler and magistrates are advised to attend “to the\nutility of all”, the feet are counseled “to concentrate on\nthe public utility in all matters”, and in general “all\nthe members” are expected to “keep watch over the public\nadvantage” (PC: 136, 126, 135). The security of the body politic\ncan only be maintained by means of a joint commitment to a public good\nwhich benefits all, so that  \neach individual may be likened to a part of the others reciprocally\nand each believes what is to his own advantage to be determined by\nthat which he recognizes to be most useful for others. (PC: 126)  \nJohn’s political body is one in which, beyond all social\ndifferentiation, there is “mutual charity reigning\neverywhere”, because all segments are attuned to the same\nenduring common purpose that encompasses the valid interests of the\nwhole (PC: 142). Unity follows from cooperation, and cooperation stems\nfrom the existence of a good shared by the entire community and each\nof its members. \nFollowing from his use of a physiological model of social\norganization, John identifies maintenance of the ‘health’\nof the body politic as necessary to ensuring a cooperative spirit and\navoiding fragmentation. For John, the political body’s health\ndepends on the practice of justice by the organs and members. This\nassociation between the common good and justice entails a correlative\nobligation on the part of all members of the commonwealth:  \nInasmuch as the duties of each individual are practiced so that\nprovision is made for the corporate community, as long as justice is\npracticed, the ends of all are imbued with the sweetness of honey.\n(PC: 131)  \nEvery organ and limb must conduct itself according to the dictates of\njustice if the polity is to exist as a corporate whole. John’s\nconception of justice follows the Ciceronian duality (Cicero De\nofficiis: I.7.23) of negative obligation and positive duty:  \nJustice consists chiefly in this: do not do harm and prevent the doing\nof harm out of duty to humanity. When you do harm, you assent to\ninjury. When you do not impede the doing of harm, you are a servant of\ninjustice. (PC: 62)  \nBecause justice is inherently productive of social cooperation,\nwhereas injustice necessarily tends to disharmony and social\ndisintegration, John construes justice as both a generalized virtue\nand the guarantor of the body’s health. Since justice is the\nsalient characteristic of the common good, it determines the manner in\nwhich each bodily member performs its functions. Not only kings and\nmagistrates, but even the lowliest of parts, are viewed by John as\npotential agents of public justice (see Nederman 1997), reinforced by\nthe fact that the function of each is absolutely necessary for the\nwell-being of all. The wide diffusion of responsibility for the\nmaintenance of justice assures that all members of the body politic\npossess the basic faculties necessary for guarding and protecting the\ncommon good. \nJohn is willing, under exceptional circumstances, to extend this\ndiscretion to direct political action against evil rulers. He\ndescribes two circumstances that warrant public concern: the\ncommission by rulers of minor offenses, which can be tolerated by the\ncommunity, and of flagrant crimes, which endanger the well-being of\nthe body politic (PC: 140–41). In the first instance, citizens\nshould express their disapproval and recommend corrective measures,\nbut should not challenge the king’s position. In the second\ncase, when the common good and religion are threatened by a tyrant,\nmembers of the political organism ought—indeed, are bound by the\nfunctionalist terms of the political order—to take action to\ndeflect injury to the body. This claim forms the basis for\nJohn’s controversial doctrine of tyrannicide. Scholars have\ndebated whether these remarks amount to a theory of tyrant-killing or\nmerely an account of the bad endings that have come to all tyrants\n(Van Laarhoven 1984; Nederman 1988). John’s seemingly\ncontradictory claim that tyrants are both the servants of God and\nassured of divine punishment (PC: 201–02) finds resolution\nthrough numerous historical examples of the destruction of tyrannical\nrulers once their ordained purpose has been achieved. \nYet, as elsewhere in John’s writings, this religious dimension\nof tyrannicide is paralleled by a philosophical justification that\ndepends on reason alone. Because John considers tyranny to be a crime\nagainst “the body of justice itself” (PC: 25), he invokes\nthe organic nature of the community to explain the legitimacy, albeit\nrare, of tyrannicide. Inasmuch as one enjoys membership in the\npolitical community, one may ultimately be responsible—based on\neach part’s duty to see justice served in the whole—for\neradicating the incorrigible tyrant. John does not believe that such\naction should be undertaken lightly, specifying a set of conditions\nthat must be met prior to eliminating a tyrant (PC: 209; see\n207–09 for the paradigmatic proper tyrannicide). Following from\nhis naturalistic paradigm, John asserts that “whoever does not\nprosecute [the tyrant] transgresses against himself and against the\nwhole body of the secular republic” (PC: 25). Note that slaying\na tyrant, under the caveats John specifies, falls within the general\nobligation on the part of every member of the political body, without\ndistinction, to pursue justice. Since the health of each depends upon\nthe health of all, John posits a strong link between the organic\nnature of social and political order and the widespread public defense\nof that order, extending even to the act of removing a tyrant (on\nJohn’s use of medical metaphors, see Shogimen and Nederman\n2011). \nJohn’s supposedly non-philosophical works—two substantial\nletter collections, two hagiographies, and a (brief)\nhistory—attest, in various ways, to his central commitment to a\npractical philosophy. John’s contemporary readers shared his\nunderstanding that all of his works both partake in the moral and\nphilosophical and have immediate, real-world relevance. Upon receiving\na copy of John’s first letter collection, his close friend and\nfrequent correspondent Peter of Celle described it as “seasoned\nwith philosophy, clothed in the characters of rhetoric” (quoted\nin JL1, x). In myriad ways within and across his non-theoretical\ntexts, John addresses the nature of philosophy, provides examples of\nmoderate skepticism at work, outlines the parameters of moderation and\nimmoderation as to both virtues and vices, and examines the\nrelationship between the secular body politic and its ecclesiastical\nsoul. \nJohn often drew attention to the practical dimensions of philosophy.\nIn a passage in John’s Life of Saint Anselm, for\ninstance, he expands on his critique of what he viewed as the sterile\napproach to learning—both philosophy for its own sake and for a\npurpose not oriented toward the cultivation of virtue—then\ndominant in the schools. John reports that Anselm, having been perhaps\noverly diligent in his studies, “c[ame] back to his senses and\nwisely examin[ed] his ways”, a pedagogical practice recommended\nin the Metalogicon. He then realized “that a stream of\neloquence or this world’s philosophy does not confer true\nhappiness. These often produce pride …” (A&B: 21). In\nlight of John’s sustained indictment of rampant Epicurean\ntendencies, as well as his judgment that Epicureanism is incapable of\nleading to the summum bonum, it is likely that “this\nworld’s philosophy” represents a retroactive reference to\nJohn’s present. \nA number of the letters John wrote during his Becket-related exile in\nFrance include meditations on the true purpose of philosophy and the\nrole of the true philosopher. In a letter to his fellow churchman\nGerard of Pucelle, John characterizes his exile as “the trial of\nthe purpose of true philosophers … those who suffer in\ninnocence and for the defence of faith and justice” (JL2:\n68–69). In light of the very real constraints on John’s\nfinances, it is not surprising that he found comfort in the\nphilosophic tradition of rejecting worldly possessions, claiming that\n“[n]othing is more fitting for a philosopher than to profess the\ntruth, reverence justice, despise the world, and, when necessary, to\nlove poverty” (JL2: 68–69). In a letter dating to the same\nperiod, John explains to his friend Hugh, abbot of Bury St. Edmunds,\nthat philosophy is the “foster parent of virtues and governess\nof duty … She lays down that the useful and the honourable are\nlinked together by mutual predication …” (JL2:\n264–65), a distinctively Ciceronian theme. To fellow philosopher\nJohn Saracen, John casts his state of exile—in language that\nboth echoes the Policraticus and calls to mind\nBoethius—as conducive to philosophy, writing that he now views\nhis present condition as a  \nfriend, who opened my eyes, formerly dazzled by the absurd fantasies\nof fortune, drove away courtly trifles and alluring pleasures, urged\nme on the path of virtue, and numbered me among the throngs of the\nphilosophers. (JL2: 270–71) \nOccupying the pinnacle of this throng, in John’s estimation, is\nhis former teacher, Gilbert of Poitiers, “the most learned man\nof our day” (HP: 15), whose heresy trial at the 1148 Council of\nRheims John attended and reports at length in his Historia\nPontificalis (for an analysis of John’s account of the\ntrial and its aftermath, see Bollermann and Nederman 2014). Among the\nqualities that single Gilbert—and, hence, the ideal (Christian)\nphilosopher—out, John notes that he possessed  \nthe very keenest intelligence … had read most things and\n… after spending almost sixty years in reading and close study,\nwas so learned in the liberal arts that … he was held to\nsurpass all in every subject … [and was] thoroughly conversant\nwith the [church] doctors. (HP: 16, 27)  \nWhile displaying “the great moderation always habitual to\nhim”, Gilbert “made use of every branch of learning as\noccasion demanded, knowing that all were consistent with each other,\nand mutually illuminating” (HP: 26–27). These sentiments\necho and reinforce the Metalogicon’s lessons on\nscholars and study. \nFinally, in the prologue to the Historia Pontificalis, John\ndelineates a philosophy of history firmly rooted in the practical: A\nchronicle such as his will “profit my contemporaries and future\ngenerations” because it generates a record  \nvaluable for establishing or abolishing customs, for strengthening or\ndestroying privileges; and nothing … teaches the living more\nsurely and soundly than knowledge of the deeds of the departed. (HP:\n3)  \nJohn’s mention of customs and privileges is particularly\nnoteworthy, as he wrote the Historia early in his exile, when\nKing Henry II was insisting that Becket and the English church submit\nto the so-called ancient customs and privileges his royal predecessors\nhad purportedly enjoyed. \nIn sum, John does not embrace the traditional doctrine that\ncontemplation is inherently superior to and more praiseworthy than\naction. Quite to the contrary, he adopts the position that the entire\npoint of philosophical inquiry is to provide guidance in the conduct\nof one’s affairs. John’s principles of philosophical\ninquiry should thus be viewed in the context of his broadly humanistic\nproject, namely, the identification of the features conducive to human\nhappiness. Throughout his writings, he stresses that philosophy ought\nnot to be a specialized, dry, and obscure pursuit, but rather an\nintegral feature of an active, dutiful, and devout life within the\npolitical arena. Philosophical investigation is to be valued because\nknowledge and its by-products (including social order and virtue)\npromote the earthly summum bonum of humanity. In contrast to\nthe Epicureans, whom he observes abounding at court, John’s\nstandard of living well is not found in the physical comfort\nassociated with wealth, power, status, and luxury. Rather, he proposes\nthat wisdom, properly attained, promotes the useful goods of virtue,\nqualities of the human soul that ultimately generate the highest\ndegree of happiness. We should desire to be wise and virtuous, John\nbelieves, because we will thereby fulfill our natural (and divinely\nordained) purpose as human beings. And when we flourish in this way,\nwe cannot fail to become happy in the way God intended. \nThis basic orientation of mind constitutes the core of John’s\nmain contributions to philosophy. The Metalogicon is meant to\nbe a practical guidebook to such happiness through a morally-guided\nquest for knowledge, a goal that John regards to be of far greater\nworth and far more befitting the philosopher than the technical\npursuits too commonly found in the schools. Likewise, in proposing the\npolitical ideas of the Policraticus, he sought to illustrate\nthe principle that philosophy provides invaluable aid in achieving the\ngood life of both the individual and the entire community. The\nvitality of John’s thought consists primarily in its\nconfrontation with the tensions between the demands of everyday life,\nwhether in the classroom or at court, and the requirements of living\nwell in a moral and religious sense. His vision of philosophy is the\nself-consciously practical one of revealing how our moral and\nintellectual characteristics may help us to navigate toward lives that\nare fulfilling on earth, while also attaining the ultimate heavenly\nreward. Much of John’s career proves a testament to his\nconviction that philosophy only possesses value to the extent that it\nshapes our choices and actions. \nTracing the philosophical lineage of John’s thought through his\nlater works illustrates the essential unity of his intellectual\nperspective. He did not discriminate radically between his speculative\nand his practical work. On the contrary, he seems to have\nenthusiastically incorporated philosophical principles into the\nconduct of his everyday life as well as his analysis of contemporary\nevents and personalities. Philosophy for John was not to be left at\nthe schoolhouse door, for it ought to occupy an important place in the\nworld at large. The task of philosophical discourse is to aid in\ndiscerning the good from the evil, the true from the false, and so to\nilluminate the path toward happiness by navigating the tricky by-ways\nof public life.","contact.mail":"nederman@polisci.tamu.edu","contact.domain":"polisci.tamu.edu"}]
