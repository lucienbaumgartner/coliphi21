Giles of Rome was an extremely prolific author and left a\nvery large corpus of writings, encompassing commentaries on Aristotle,\ntheological treatises, questions, and sermons. In the last couple of\ndecades, a research group originally led by Francesco Del Punta\n(Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy; died in 2013) has been\ndevoting a lot of energy to the project of publishing his Opera\nOmnia and deepening our knowledge of his thought. Although this\ngroup has produced extremely significant results, enriched by the\ncontributions of other scholars, an assessment of Giles’ whole work is\nstill in progress. For this reason, the present entry only aims at\nproviding insight into an ongoing process of research.\n\n\n\nBorn in Rome most probably in the fifth decade of the thirteenth\ncentury, Giles was the first outstanding theologian of the relatively\nrecently founded Order of the Augustinian Hermits. Nothing more is\nknown about his origins: the statement that he belonged to the famous\nRoman family of the Colonna seems to go back to Jordan of Saxony’s\nLiber Vitasfratrum (second half of the 14th century), but is\ncompletely missing from contemporary, 13th-century sources. From Giles’\nwill we know that he was sent to Paris to study in the convent of his\nOrder. At the beginning he must have followed the courses either of a\nsecular master or of a theologian belonging to a different Order, as\nthe Augustinian friars did not have a regent master at the time.\nProbably he was a pupil of Aquinas’ in the years 1269–1272. He\ncommented on the Sentences at the beginning of the 1270s. In following\nyears he most probably wrote also a large number of his commentaries on\nAristotle. \n\nThe year 1277 marked a turning-point in his career: Giles was\ninvolved in the condemnation of the heterodox Aristotelianism issued by\nthe Parisian bishop Etienne Tempier, although the process against him\nmust be distinguished from the famous decree of the 7 of March 1277, as\nRobert Wielockx has shown. After 1277 Giles must have abandoned Paris,\nbut his presence is attested in Italy not earlier than 1281. Before\nleaving Paris he completed his De regimine principum, which is\ndedicated to the young Philip, the future Philip the Fair. \n\nBetween 1281 and 1284 Giles played an important role in the\ngovernment of his Order, taking part in various chapters held in Italy.\nAt the provincial chapter of Tuscania (nowadays in Lazio, Italy) in\n1285 he acted as vicar of the prior general of his Order, Clement of\nOsimo. \n\nIn 1285, Giles’ doctrine was examined again; after recanting only a\npart of what had been previously condemned in 1277, he was allowed to\nteach again; by 1287 he is referred to as a master of theology. His\nuniversity quodlibeta go back to this period, from the academic year\n1285/86 to 1292/93 (Pini 2006, Wielockx 2014).  This success enhanced\nGiles of Rome’s authority even more in his Order, whose general\nchapter of Florence decreed that Giles’ works (even future ones)\nshould be considered as the official doctrine of the Order, to be\ndefended by all Augustinian bachelors and masters. In 1292, at the\nGeneral Chapter of Rome he was elected prior general of his Order. \n\nBenedict Caetani’s election to the papal see marked a further\nradical change in his career, as Boniface VIII appointed him archbishop\nof Bourges in 1295. As a matter of fact, Giles was very often absent\nfrom his see, spending extended periods of time at the papal curia. In\nhis De renuntiatione, he defended the legitimacy of\nCelestine’s abdication, and, consequently, of Boniface’ s\nelection. When the contrast between Boniface VIII and Philip IV reached\nits most critical point, he continued to side staunchly with the pope.\nAn important sermon defending the papal position has been\ndiscovered by Concetta Luna, and Giles’ De ecclesiastica\npotestate undoubtedly ranks among the sources of Unam\nSanctam. \n\nGiles’ prestige decreased after Boniface’ death, and even more\nwith the rise of Clement V to the papal throne. Before being elected\npope, Betrand de Got, as archbishop of Bourdeaux, had had serious\nconflicts with Giles. This unfavorable change, however, did not prevent\nGiles from playing a significant role in the debates of his time.\nAround 1305–6 he took part in a commission which examined and condemned\nthe eucharistic doctrine of John of Paris, a former adversary of Giles’\nduring the conflict between Philip the Fair and Boniface. In the\ndiscussions concerning the Templars which eventually led to the\nsuppression of the Order, Giles sided with Philip the Fair, attacking\nthe Templars and devoting a whole tract, Contra exemptos, to\nthe thesis that their exemption from episcopal jurisdiction was the\ncause of their abuses (Jordan 2005). During the Council of Vienne Giles was asked to\ndraw a list of errors extracted from the works of Peter John Olivi:\nthree of them were officially condemned by the Council. On December 22,\n1316 he died at the papal Curia at Avignon (For further details see Del\nPunta-Donati-Luna 1993, Briggs 2016). \nRelying on manuscript evidence and other sources, Giorgio Pini (2005)\ncould identify which kind of theological and philosophical works Giles\nread, studied and had copied for himself during his long intellectual\ncareer. Pini distinguishes three main periods. In the first one,\nbefore 1277, quite unsurprisingly, he reads Aquinas (not only the\nCommentary on the Sentences of the Dominican master, but also his\nlater works), Aristotle (e. g. in these years Giles owns and annotates\na copy of the Nicomachean Ethics), Avicenna and Averroes. He\nis also very well acquainted with the works of Ps. Denis the\nAeropagite. In the second period (1277–1285), when forced to leave the\nacademic milieu, Giles widens his interests. He studies many works of\nAnselm’s (while most theologians of his time were very selective in\ntheir knowledge of this author), and makes acquaintance with works by\nAugustine, such as Confessions and Soliloquia, that were\nquite unusual readings for an academic theologian. In the this period\n(from his return to the Parisian Faculty of Theology [1285] to his\ndeath) Giles studies almost entirely the available works by Augustine\nand acquires also rare treatises by Proclus. Giles’ increasing\nattention for Augustine is mirrored in his mature works and will\ninfluence also the theological orientation of his own Order in the\nfollowing decades (Pini 2012). \n\nAfter René Antoine Gauthier identified in the master Guillaume\nArnauld the real author of the Lectura supra logicam veterem\nattributed to Giles of Rome (Tabarroni 1988), interest in logical\nworks focused mainly on his Commentaries on the Sophistici\nElenchi and on Posterior Analytics. In his treatment of\nthe fallacia figurae dictionis Giles proves to be a brilliant\nand original representative of “modistic logic”, who bases\nhis solutions mainly on the semantics of intentiones\n(Tabarroni 1991). This does not imply, however, that he always agrees\nwith the Modists. One of the most relevant disagreements regards\nsignification. He doesn’t think that signification is the essential\nform of the linguistic sign. On the contrary, sharing a a much more\nwidespread view in his times, to him, the signification of\ne.g. a name is a concept (or more precisely a definition),\nwhich in turn signifies the thing. This signification is not natural,\nbut conventional. The linguistic sign signifies in a natural way only\nits mental image, which is essential to human acts of speech (Marmo\n2016). Alessandro Conti (1992) investigated Giles’ Commentary on\nPosterior Analytics as an example of his theory of truth,\nwhich brings to completion Aquinas’ shift from Augustine’s influence\nto the Aristotelian approach. Bertagna (2002–2004) investigated\nthe structure of this commentary, while Longeway (2002) and Corbini\n(2002) drew scholars’ attention to Giles’ epistemic logic.  Giles of\nRome also authored the most important Commentary on the Rhetoric of\nthe Latin medieval tradition, which earned him the honorific title of\nexpositor of this book and influenced all later medieval\ncommentaries. Costantino Marmo studied Giles’ approach to the\ndifferent translations to which he had access and showed how he\ndeveloped Aquinas’ theory of passions in commenting on the relevant\nportions of Aristotle’s text (Marmo 1991), trying to solve some\nproblems left open by Aquinas. It has been suggested that Giles\nconsiders rhetoric to be a sort of “logic” of ethics and\npolitics: this brilliant interpretation needs, however, further\ndevelopment and articulation (Staico 1992). Janet Coleman (2000) also\nmaintained that Aristotle’s rhetorical method determines the substance\nof Giles’ De regimine principum, but one should also take\ninto account also Lidia Lanza’s (2001) remarks. Marmo (2016) pointed\nout that if rhetoric is the modus sciendi more apt to moral\nsciences, this does not imply that it contributes to moral or\npolitical knowledge, since this is derived from the principles proper\nof ethics or politics. \n\nTraditionally, Giles was described as a “faithful”\ndisciple of Aquinas’. Nowadays such a judgment is not accepted\nby scholars. After Concetta Luna argued persuasively in favor of the\nauthenticity of the Reportatio, it became clear that Giles,\nalready in the first stages of his career, develops his positions\ntaking Aquinas’ teaching as a starting point for his own\nreflection, but criticizes and corrects the doctrines of the Dominican\nmaster in many aspects. Luna could also establish that Giles reworked\nhis Lectura on the Sentences (handed down to us as a\nreportatio) into an ordinatio only for the first two\nbooks. However, while the first book was completed shortly after the\nLectura, that is, during the years 1271–1273, the\nsecond book had to wait for completion until 1309. Luna gathered\nimpressive evidence suggesting that the Ordinatio of the\nthird book that goes under the name of Giles is, in fact,\nspurious. Broadly speaking, Giles’ “philosophical\nproject” tends to discuss critically Aquinas’ position in\norder to improve the solutions he offered, without, however, trying to\ndiscard them radically. Recently, Katherine König-Pralong showed\nthat this is the case for the debate about the natural desire for\nknowledge: although defended in in the context of a discussion with\nHenry of Ghent, Giles’ position does not coincide with that of\nAquinas. According to him, in fact, human beings possess a natural\ndesire for knowledge that is satisfied by a limited understanding of\nseparate substances (König-Pralong 2014). The same holds true\nalso for one of the most famous topics of his discussion with Henry of\nGhent, the distinction between “essence” and\n“existence”. In this case, Giles radicalizes\nAquinas’ doctrine of the real distinction, asserting that\nexistence must be conceived as a “res addita”\n[thing added] to essence (Pickavé 2016). Although the final\nresult of his theory was considered closer to Avicenna’s\nsolution than to that of Aquinas, Giles nevertheless develops it\nstarting from Aquinas’ own position (Wippel 1981), as emerges\nalready from his Questions on the Metaphysics (Conti 2014).  The\nconnection of this issue with the discussion with Henry of Ghent about\nthe concept of “creation” was investigated in depth by\nGiorgio Pini (1992), who could show how Giles, while defending Aquinas\nand thereby the possibility of using some Aristotelian principles in\nan orthodox account of creation, goes beyond the positions of the\nDominican master, e. g. asserting the identity of\n“esse” and “creatio”(see\nalso Porro 2014, Cross 2016). Giles advocated the compatibility of\nAristotelian doctrine with Christian faith also in his commentary on\nthe short treatise De bona fortuna attributed to Aristotle,\nbut in reality consisting in a compilation of passages taken from the\nEthica eudemia and the Magna moralia. The\ninterpretation of the concept of “bona fortuna” in those\ntexts implied problemas connected with contingency, necessity and the\ninterplay between divine causality and natural events. As\nValérie Cordonnier (2104) showed, Giles’ solution was\nattacked by Henry of Ghent as leading to necessitarism. \n\nAs to the debate about the unicity of substantial form, Giles’\nposition evolves during time. If we leave aside the Errores\nphilosophorum, since the authenticity of this work has been\ncontested with serious arguments (Bruni 1935, Koch 1944, Donati 1990b,\nLuna 1990), we can notice that Giles changes his position from the\nContra gradus et pluralitatem formarum (between the end of\n1277 and the beginning of 1278), where he, against Henry of Ghent\ndenies plurality of forms for every compound (Wilson 2014), to later\nworks, where he takes a more cautious stance in particular concerning\nman. The principle of individuation is identified, as in Aquinas, with\n“materia signata quantitate”, that is, matter designated\nby its dimensions.  According to Giles, who criticizes  also Richard of\nMediavilla on this point, matter is pure potentiality and therefore\ncannot be distinguished into different kinds. For this reason, he\ncannot accept Aquinas’ doctrine that the incorruptibility of celestial\nbodies derives from the peculiar nature of their matter (Donati\n1986). In Giles’ opinion celestial bodies are not incorruptible\nbecause their matter is different from the matter of sublunar bodies,\nbut rather because their quantitas materiae cannot change its\ndeterminate dimensions. This is but one application of Giles’ famous\ndoctrine of “indeterminate dimensions”. Modifying\nAverroes’ doctrine in this respect, Giles argues that a portion of\nmatter, in order to be able to receive a form, needs to possess\nalready a sort of quantity. Such quantity, however, should not be\nidentified with the determinate dimensions a body possesses, but is\nrather a quantitas which remains the same during processes\nsuch as rarefaction and condensation. Giles’ notion of\nquantitas materiae, which is not only generically extension\nor three-dimensionality, but seems to represent an unchangeable given\n“amount” of matter pertaining to a body, has been\nconsidered comparable, some differences notwithstanding, to the modern\nnotion of mass (Donati 1988, Donati-Trifogli 2016). \n\nAfter the condemnation of 1277, a significant change can be noticed in\nGiles’ position also in his solution of the problem of the eternity of\nthe world. At the beginning of his career he admitted the theoretical\npossibility of the eternity of the world, although rejecting\nAristotle’s arguments proving the actual eternity of the world. Later\nhe shifted to a more “ Augustinian” stance, rejecting the\nhypothesis of a creation “ab aeterno” and\nadmitting that it is possible to prove the temporality of creation,\nalthough he finds that no conclusive argument has been advanced so far\n(but see also Cross 2016). Giles was much more steadfast in his\nopposition to another major tenet of “Averroistic”\ndoctrine, that is the unicity of the possible intellect. He maintained\nthat the possibility of actual knowledge on the part of the individual\ndepends necessarily on the fact that each body is informed by its own\nintellective soul, which is its form. For the same reasons Giles also\nrejected the unicity of the agent intellect, a doctrine he attributed\nto Avicenna (Del Punta-Donati-Luna 1993, Conolly 2007). \nGiles’ account of knowledge is indebted to Aquinas, but, again,\nreveals many original features. In the first place, he insists on a\nstrictly causal interpretation — be it direct or via a medium\n— of the cognitive process, both at the level of sensory and\nintellectual acts. Secondly, the Augustinian master doesn’t conceive\nof the role of “intelligible species” or formales\nexpressiones as he often writes, as essential to the process of\ncognition in itself. As Giorgio Pini (2016) has shown, the\nintelligible species is necessary only when the object cannot be\npresent in the intellect directly. Admittedly, this direct presence is\npossible only in the beatific vision (after death) and most probably\nin the cognition angels have of themselves. For human knowledge in\nthis life, on the contrary, intelligible species fulfill a necessary\nfunction, as causal proxies, as Pini (2016) writes, mediating between\nthe object and the cognitive power. Difficulties for Giles’ account\nemerge especially when it comes to defining the ontological status of\nthe species. The interpretation of cognition in terms of causation\nseems in fact to imply, according to Giles’ own presuppositions, that\nthe species belongs to the same kind of the thing it represents. On\nthe other hand, the intelligible species is in the intellect, and this\npresence is explained in terms of inherence of an accident (the\nspecies) in a substance. Giles himself is aware of this difficulty,\nsince in one passage he claims that such species are in themselves\nneither substances nor accidents. They can, however, be\n“reduced” to the kind to which the represented thing\nbelongs.  Pini (2016) is right in pointing out that Giles’ answer seems\nto raise more problems than it can solve.  Studies concerning Giles’ natural philosophy focused mainly on his\ntreatment of some pivotal concepts of Aristotle’s Physics.  Cecilia\nTrifogli opened new perspectives in this field, devoting her attention\nto the notions of place and motion (especially in the void, see\nTrifogli 1992), underlining that “Giles’ emphasis on the\nrole of place in the description of motion seems to lead to a\nquantitative and relational notion of place. Giles, however, does not\ncompletely substitute the Aristotelian notion of place for that of\nplace as distance. Place as distance is only one of the two notions of\nplace which appear in his commentary. The other, which is related to\nmaterial place, assumes an intrinsic connection between place and the\nlocated body that cannot be founded on distance alone” (Trifogli\n1990a, 350). Giles’ distinction was referred to as an opposition\nbetween material place (the limit of the containing body) and formal\nplace (distance from the fixed points of the universe)\n(Donati-Trifogli 2016). Trifogli also investigated Giles’ notions of\ntime and infinity, emphasizing that his whole approach to natural\nphilosophy is distinguished by a tendency towards a metaphysical\ninterpretation of Aristotelian concepts, as opposed to a physical and\nquantitative one (Trifogli 1990b, 1991). For example, Giles conceives\nof time not as a quantity pertaining to every kind of motion, but\nrather as the same thing as motion, seen under a different aspect. His\nconcept of time rests in fact essentially on a broad notion of\nsuccession, which allows him on one hand to retain the unity of the\nconcept of time, but, on the other hand, to acknowledge the existence\nof different times (Trifogli 1990b, Donati-Trifogli 2016) Giles\ndistinguishes between two kinds of duration: extrinsic duration is the\ntime of celestial motion, and is obviously one in number. Intrinsic\nduration depends on the different motions taking place in the\nsublunary world and is therefore plural (Donati-Trifogli 2016).  A\nsimilar attitude emerges also from the analysis of Giles’ controversy\non angelic time with Henry of Ghent (Porro 1988, Porro 1991, but see\nalso Faes de Mottoni 1983). Both authors thought that the time in\nwhich angels exist, unlike sublunar time, is a discrete succession of\ninstants. Giles and Henry disagreed, however, on the relationship\nexisting between angelic and sublunar time. In particular, Henry\nrejected Giles’ thesis that more instants of angelic time can\ncorrespond to one and the same instant of sublunar time. This\ndifference of opinion rested in part on diverging concepts of angelic\nmotion, which can be istantaneous according to Henry, but not\naccording to Giles. \n\nIn 2008, Romana Martorelli Vico published the first critical edition\nof Giles’ De formatione corporis humani in utero. With this\nwork, completed between 1285 and 1295, Giles took a stance in the much\ndebated question of the respective roles of male and female parents in\nconception. The Galenist view, going back to Hippocrates, was that\nboth male and female contributed sperm, so that the offspring could\nhave characteristics from both parents. On the contrary, Aristotle had\nheld that only the male alone contributed sperm containing an active\nand formal principle to conception, while the female provided only the\nmatter of the fetus. Giles was well acquainted with these different\npositions and with the efforts to reconcile the diverging approaches\nof medici and philosophi, which could be traced back to\nAvicenna. Leaning on Averroes’ Colliget, however, Giles\nrejected any attempt to attribute a formal role to the female sperm,\neven if it is conceived as subordinate to the male one. On the contrary\nhe maintained that it can contribute only in a passive way to\nconception, while what was called “female sperm”, i.e., the\nvaginal secretion, has a subservient, helpful but by no means necessary\nfunction. It helps the male sperm to inseminate female matter, but does\nnot add anything essential to the new being. In this way, Giles\nintended to stress the superiority of the philosophical, theoretical\napproach to such problems with respect to the traditions of medical\nlearning, even when the latter seemed to be supported by empirical evidence\n(Hewson 1975; Martorelli Vico 1988). Empirical evidence such as the\nresemblance of the offspring to the mother was e.g., explained away as\nan example of stronger resistance of female matter to the action of\nform (Martorelli Vico 2002). After conception the human embryo begins a\ndevelopment which goes through different stages. Comparing these stages\nto the embryos of various animals Giles, like Thomas Aquinas, supported\nan interpretation of the fetal development which would be exploited\nmany centuries later by the so-called “recapitulation\ntheory” (Hewson 1975, 99). Giles maintained, however, that\n“the organic fetal body is not to be called a pig, a bear, or a\nmonkey, but something immediately disposed to becoming man”\n(Hewson 1975, 100). This position apparently implies that human life\ndoes not fully begin at the moment of conception. Although such a\nthesis can be brought to bear on the moral judgment concerning\nabortion, Giles does not seem interested in tackling from this point of\nview an issue which would become central for what nowadays is called\nbioethics. \n\nIn the debate on the respective roles of intellect and will in the\ndetermination of human action Giles’ position underwent an evolution,\nwhile he seems to be in search of an intermediate position, a sort of\ncompromise between the theory of Henry of Ghent and that of Geoffrey\nof Fontaines. Giles maintains, in fact, that will is a passive potency\nand can not “move” itself, but always needs an object, a\n“bonum apprehensum”. This starting point however, does not\nrule out its freedom, because will, even if is moved\n“moved” by its object, can determine itself and other\npotencies with regard to action. This view of Giles’ is consistent\nwith his mature interpretation of the relationship existing between\nknowledge and will in the sinner. Committing a sin implies an\nignorance of the real good, but this ignorance is not the primary\ncause of the wrong behavior, because it is an effect of the will,\nwhich, affected by malicia, corrupts the judgment of the\nreason (Macken 1977, Eardley 2003, Pini 2006, Eardley 2016, but see\nalso Cross 2016). \n\nGiles of Rome exerted considerable influence also in other fields of\nethics, such as the theory of virtues. The most developed expression of\nhis position is not to be found in a Commentary on Aristotle, but\nrather in his De regimine principum, the most successful\n“mirror of princes” of medieval political thought, which is\nstill conserved in more than 300 manuscripts in its original Latin\nversion, to which many translations in European vernaculars must be\nadded. Written most probably between 1277 and 1280 the De\nregimine is acknowledged to be one of the most successful attempts\nat mediating Aristotle’s practical philosophy, and in particular his\n“ethical and political language” to the Latin West. Giles\nwas the first to structure a mirror of princes in three books along the\nlines of a scheme — ethica-oeconomica-politica — which\nplayed an important role in the reception of Aristotle’s moral and\npolitical philosophy in the Middle Ages (Lambertini 1988). The author\ntakes great care to give the impression that he is mainly relying on\nAristotle’s text, providing numerous quotations from the\nNichomachean Ethics, from the Politics and from the\nRethoric. Scholars should not overlook, however, that his\nreception of Aristotle is not as direct as it can seem and that Giles\nis deeply influenced by a tradition in the interpretation of\nAristotle’s practical philosophy. In this tradition Aquinas plays a\nvery important role for Giles, so that, while Aristotle is the\nauthority who is quoted on almost every occasion, it is the unnamed\nAquinas who, with his Sententia libri Politicorum, De\nregno, Summa Theologiae, exerts a really decisive\ninfluence on De regimine. While discussing particular topics,\nGiles skillfully adapts Aristotle to his own purposes. This emerges\nwith clarity in the first book, devoted to ethics, where Giles’\nclassification of virtues is heavily dependent on the Summa\nTheologiae and, therefore, on Aquinas’ reinterpretation of the\nAristotelian heritage. For example, Giles here defines\nprudentia as a virtus media, sharing the nature of\nmoral as well as of intellectual ones, a doctrine which can by no\nmeans be traced back to the Stagirite (Lambertini 1991, 1992, 1995,\n2000). In the second book Giles deals with the ethics of man as head\nof the family, covering many topics, from children rearing and\neducation to the rule over servants. To this purpose, he exploits a\nwide range of sources, and also medicine authors (Lambertini 1988,\nMartorelli Vico 2008). As Giles wrote his De regimine, the\npseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomica were not yet available in\ntraslation to the Latin West; still, he managed to discuss also\neconomic topics, as far as they are relevant for the household of a\nroyal family or for a high-class household in general. Here he condemns\nusury, criticizes other economic practices as not suitable for a\nprince, and insists on the primary role agricolture should play\n(Lambertini 2015)  \n\nThe most famous example of this selective attitude towards\nAristotle’s works, however, belongs rather to the field of political\ntheory. In the third book of De regimine Giles wants to prove\nthat monarchy is the absolutely best form of government. The first\narguments he puts forward in favor of monarchy are not taken from\nAristotle’s Politics, but from Aquinas’ De regno.\nThen some arguments against monarchy which could be read in the\nPolitics are presented as objections that Aristotle puts forth\nfor subsequent refutation. At the end, Giles states squarely that\nAristotle supports monarchy as the absolutely best form of monarchy and\ncorroborates his assertion with an argument, which, in the\nPolitics, actually goes in the opposite direction (Lambertini\n1990). One could provide several other examples to show that\nthe De regimine succeeded in presenting itself as a\nsimplified exposition and explanation of Aristotle’s thought in\npractical philosophy, but at the same time transmitted to Giles’\nreaders a strongly biased interpretation of the Stagirite. The fact\nthat the De regimine was often used as a tool to have easier\naccess to Aristotle’s political theory deeply influenced, therefore,\nthe way the Latin West read and understood\nAristotle’s Politics in the Late Middle Ages (e.g. Lambertini\n2017).  Recent codicological studies on the diffusion of De\nregimine’ manuscripts do in fact show that many possessors\nof the manuscripts most probably used them for study (See Opera\nOmnia I.1/11, Catalogo dei manoscritti, De regimine;\nBriggs 1999). Giles’ De regimine was also translated into\ndifferent vernaculars (Perret 2011, Papi 2016).  Graham McAleer (1999)\npointed to the fact that Giles’ Commentary on the Sentences has been\nalmost neglected as a source for Giles’ political philosophy. Studying\ndistinction 22 and 44 of the II book, he found that in these texts\nGiles’ account of the origin of political authority among human beings\nafter the Fall diverges from what one can read in De regimine\nprincipum and reveals a profound influence by Augustine, while\nAristotle does not play the important role he had in Giles’ mirror for\nprinces. One should also take into consideration that\nGiles’ Ordinatio of the second book was completed in 1309,\nthat is at least 25 years after De regimine and could witness\nto an evolution in Giles’ thought. As a matter of fact, the much\nearlier reportatio does not tackle such issues at all\n(Lambertini 2014). \n\nWhile in the De regimine Giles carefully avoids any\nreference to the thorny problem of the relationship between secular and\necclesiastical power, his later writings which are relevant for\npolitical theory deal first and foremost with ecclesiological problems.\nThis holds true for his treatise De renuntiatione papae\n(1297–1298) where Giles defends the lawfulness of Celestine’s\nabdication against the arguments put forward by the Colonna cardinals\nin their first appeal against Boniface VIII. From the point of view of\nthe history of political thought it is relevant that Giles argues that\npapal power, although of divine origin, is conferred on a particular\nindividual by a human act, namely, by the election of the cardinals.\nHere Giles is countering the Colonna arguments that papal dignity\ncannot cease to reside in a pope until he dies, because the pontificate\ndepends on God’s will, and stresses the fact that divine intention in\nthis case becomes effective through the mediation of human agents, that\nis, through the consent of the electors and of the elected. A\njurisdiction which is given by the consent of men, however, can also be\nremoved by their consent through a reverse procedure. This does not\namount to saying that the pope can be deposed (except in case of\nheresy), because, according to Giles, the pope is above the law and has\nno earthly authority above him. He can however, depose himself, that\nis, abdicate. Just as for his election the consent of his electors and\nof the elected was necessary, so also for the removal of the pope from\noffice his consent is decisive (Eastman 1989, 1990, 1992). In this way\nGiles could dismiss arguments against the validity of Celestine’s\nabdication without admitting the possibility that the pope can be\ndeposed, e. g., by the Council, as Boniface’s adversaries\nmaintained. \n\nMuch better known than De renuntiatione is Giles’ De\necclesiastica potestate, a treatise also composed in defense of\nBoniface VIII. Most probably in 1302, Giles systematically expounded in\nthis work the views on the relationship between regnum and\nsacerdotium he had already put forward in a re-discovered\nsermon held at the papal curia (Luna 1992, Lambertini 2006). The main\ntenet of his fully fledged argumentation is that the pope, supreme\nauthority of the Church but also of the whole of mankind, is the only\nlegitimate origin of every power on earth, be it exercised — as\njurisdiction — on persons, or — as property — on\nthings. In his plenitude of power, the pope possesses an absolute\nsupremacy both in the ecclesiastical and in the temporal sphere, and\ndelegates the exercise of the temporal “sword” to lay\nsovereigns only in order to fulfill most properly his higher religious\nduties. Any authority that does not recognize its dependence on the\npapal power is but usurpation. In Giles’ view, there is no space even\nfor a partially autonomous temporal order. Coherently, Giles maintains\nthat no property rights are valid if they are not legitimated by papal\nauthority.  Interestingly enough, such a claim is also supported by\nhis account of the origin of property, according to which property is\nnot a natural institution, but only the consequence of human\nagreements, which lack any legitimacy unless they are recognized by\nthe supreme religious power (Miethke 2000, Homann 2004, Krüger\n2007). Scholarly discussion about De ecclesiastica potestate\nis still open. Karl Ubl (2004) argues with strong arguments against\nprevious assumptions, that Giles wrote in reaction to John of\nParis’ De regia potestate et papali. While previous\nscholarship stressed the affinity in form and content between De\necclesiastica potestate and the famous Bull Unam\nsanctam, Francisco Bertelloni (2004) holds that one should not\noverlook profound differences between the concepts of papal power that\ninspire the two texts.","contact.mail":"rlambertini@unimc.it","contact.domain":"unimc.it"}]
