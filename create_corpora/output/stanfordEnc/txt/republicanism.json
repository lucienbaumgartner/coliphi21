In the first sense, republicanism refers to a\nloose tradition or family of writers in the history of western\npolitical thought, including especially: Machiavelli and his\nfifteenth-century Italian predecessors; the English republicans\nMilton, Harrington, Sidney, and others; Montesquieu and Blackstone;\nthe eighteenth-century English commonwealthmen; and many Americans of\nthe founding era such as Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. The writers in this\ntradition emphasize many common ideas and concerns, such as the\nimportance of civic virtue and political participation, the dangers of\ncorruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and the rule of law,\netc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw\nheavily on classical examples—from Cicero and the Latin\nhistorians especially—in presenting their arguments. (In light\nof the last point, this is sometimes referred to as the\n‘classical republican’ or ‘neo-roman’\ntradition in political thought.)\n\n\n\nBeyond this brief sketch, there\nexists considerable historiographical controversy—with respect\nto who the tradition’s members are, and their relative significance;\nwith respect to how we should interpret its underlying philosophical\ncommitments; and with respect to its role (especially vis-à-vis\nliberalism) in the historical development of modern political\nthought. This brings us to the second sense of the term\n‘republicanism’. In contemporary political theory and\nphilosophy, it most often refers to a specific (and still contested)\ninterpretation of the classical republican tradition, associated\nespecially with the work of Quentin Skinner; together with a research\nprogram dedicated to developing insights from this tradition into an\nattractive contemporary political doctrine, associated especially with\nthe work of Philip Pettit. According to republicans in this second\nsense (sometimes called ‘civic republicans’ or\n‘neo-republicans’), the paramount republican value is\npolitical liberty, understood as non-domination or independence from\narbitrary power. This entry will primarily discuss republicanism in\nthis second sense.\n\n\n\nIn their interpretation of the classical republicanism tradition,\ncivic republicans are often in debate with civic humanists, with\nwhom they are often confused (see the entry on \n civic humanism).\n Developed as a contemporary political doctrine, civic republicanism\nis broadly speaking progressive and liberal, but not without important\ndistinct features. Some of its policy implications diverge from\nmainstream liberalism in particular ways, and for this reason civic\nrepublicans are sometimes also confused with communitarians (see\nthe entry on \n communitarianism).\n For the strengths or weakness of civic republicanism to be fairly\nassessed, both confusions should be assiduously avoided.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely central to the contemporary civic republican program is\nthe conception of political liberty as non-domination or independence\nfrom arbitrary power, and so it makes good sense to begin with an\nexplication of this idea. \n\nIt is notorious that there are several competing conceptions of\npolitical liberty. The now standard account was laid down most\ninfluentially by Isaiah Berlin in his famous lecture on “Two\nConcepts of Liberty” (Berlin 1969). According to the first,\n‘negative’ conception of liberty, people are free simply to\nthe extent that their choices are not interfered with. There are many\nvariations on this conception, depending on how exactly one wants to\ndefine ‘interference’, but they all have in common the\nbasic intuition that to be free is, more or less, to be left alone to\ndo whatever one chooses. This idea of negative liberty Berlin\nassociates especially with the classic English political philosophers\nHobbes, Bentham, and J. S. Mill, and it is today probably the dominant\nconception of liberty, particularly among contemporary Anglo-American\nphilosophers. In Mill’s well-known words, “the only freedom\nwhich deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own\nway, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs”\n(1859, 17). \n\nThe second, ‘positive’ conception of liberty is not\nquite so easy to define. Roughly speaking, a person or group is free in\nthe positive sense to the extent that they exercise self-control or\nself-mastery. It is not agreed, however, what exactly constitutes this\nself-mastery in the relevant sense. According to one particularly\ninfluential account, to be free in the positive sense is to be able to\nact on one’s second-order desires (Frankfurt 1982). For example,\nthe addicted gambler may be free in the negative sense not to\ngamble—since no one actually forces him to do so—, but he is not\nfree in the positive sense unless he actually succeeds in acting on\nhis presumed second-order desire not to desire gambling. Berlin\nassociates this second conception especially with such continental\nphilosophers as Spinoza, Rousseau, and Hegel. Although it found some\nsupport among English Hegelians like T. H. Green, those who advocate\nthe positive conception of liberty have generally been in the minority,\nparticularly among contemporary Anglo-American philosophers. \n\nThe troubling implications of the positive conception of liberty are\nwell-known, and need not be rehearsed at length here. For the most part, these\nstem from the problem that freedom in the positive sense would seem to\nlicense fairly extensive coercion on behalf of individuals’\nallegedly ‘real’ interests—for example, coercively\nforcing the gambler to quit on the presumption that this is, in fact,\nwhat he really wants to do (even if he doesn’t say so). Regarding\nthis danger, Berlin writes: \n\nLiberals like Berlin have thus understandably rejected the positive,\nand emphatically embraced the negative conception of liberty. The\nquestion remains, however, whether the received view of negative\nliberty as non-interference in particular adequately captures the\npolitical ideal we should be most interested in. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans argue that it does not. \n\nBy way of illustration, consider the following scenarios (both are\nstandard examples in the republican tradition). In the first, imagine\na group of slaves with a generally well-meaning master. While the\nlatter has an institutionally-protected right to treat his slaves more\nor less as he pleases (he might start whipping them just for the heck\nof it, say), let us suppose that this master in particular leaves his\nslaves for the most part alone. Now to the extent that he does not in\nfact interfere with his slaves on a day-to-day basis, we are committed\nto saying—on the non-interference view of liberty—that they\nenjoy some measure of freedom. Some find this conclusion deeply\ncounterintuitive: if there is anything to the idea of political\nliberty, one might think, surely it cannot be found in the condition of\nslavery! \n\nEven if we are willing to accept this conclusion, the\nnon-interference view of liberty commits us to others that are perhaps\neven more paradoxical. For one thing, notice that we are committed to\nsaying that the slaves of our well-meaning master enjoy\ngreater freedom than the slaves of an abusive master down the\nroad. Of course, the former slaves are better off in some respect than\nthe latter, but do we really want to say that they are more\nfree? For another, consider the slave who, over time, comes to\nunderstand his master’s psychological dispositions better and\nbetter. Taking advantage of this improved insight, he manages to keep\non his master’s good side, and is consequently interfered with\nless and less. Thus, on the non-interference view of liberty, we are\ncommitted to saying that his freedom is increasing over time. Again, while\nit is clear that the slave’s greater psychological insight\nimproves his well-being in some respect, do we really want to say that\nit increases his freedom specifically? \n\nNow consider a second scenario. Imagine the colony of a great imperial\npower. Suppose that the colonial subjects have no political rights,\nand thus that the imperial power governs them unilaterally. But\nfurther suppose that the imperial power, for one reason or another,\nchooses not to exercise the full measure of its authority—that\nits policy towards the colony is one of more or less benign neglect.\nFrom the point of view of liberty as non-interference, we must\nconclude that the colonial subjects enjoy considerable freedom with\nrespect to their government for, on a day-to-day basis, their\ngovernment hardly ever interferes with them. Next suppose that the\ncolonial subjects revolt with success, and achieve political\nindependence. The former colony is now self-governing. We may imagine,\nhowever, that the new government is somewhat more active than its\nimperial predecessor, passing laws and instituting policies that\ninterfere with people’s lives to a greater extent than formerly was\nthe case. On the view of liberty as non-interference, we must\ntherefore say that there has been a decline in freedom with\nindependence. As in the first scenario, many find this\ncounterintuitive. Surely, a nation that has secured its independence\nfrom colonial rule must have increased its political\nliberty.  What these examples are driving at is that political liberty might\nbest be understood as a sort of structural relationship that exists\nbetween persons or groups, rather than as a contingent outcome. Whether\na master chooses to whip his slave on any given day, we might say, is\na contingent outcome: it all depends on the master’s mood, the\nslave’s behavior, and so forth. What is not contingent (or at\nleast not in the same way) is the broader configuration of laws,\ninstitutions, and norms that effectively permit masters to treat their\nslaves however they please. As the ex-slave Frederick Douglass said of\nhis former condition, “it was slavery—not its mere\nincidents—that I hated” (1855, 161).  The republican conception of political liberty aims to capture\nthis insight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of\nstructural independence—as the condition of not being subject to\nthe arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master. Pettit, who has done\nmore than anyone else to develop this republican conception of freedom\nphilosophically, puts it thus: a person or group enjoys freedom to the\nextent that no other person or group has “the capacity to\ninterfere in their affairs on an arbitrary basis” (1999, 165;\ncf. Pettit 1996, 1997, 2001, 2012, 2014).  On a plausible rendering of\nthe term ‘domination’ as, roughly speaking, arbitrary or\nuncontrolled power (see Wartenberg 1990; Pettit 1996, 1997, 2012;\nLovett 2001, 2010, 2018), we might equivalently say that freedom in the\nrepublican sense consists in the secure enjoyment of\nnon-domination. This view has since been widely embraced by\nrepublican-minded authors such as Skinner (1998, 2002, 2008), Viroli (2002),\nMaynor (2003, 2015), Laborde (2008, 2010), Costa (2009, 2013, 2016), Honohan (2013, 2014), and Taylor (2017).   Notice that the republican view of freedom is, at least in the\nbroad sense, a negative conception of political liberty. One need not\ndo or become anything in particular to enjoy political liberty in the\nrepublican sense; one need not exercise self-mastery, on any view of\nwhat that entails, nor succeed in acting on one’s second-order\ndesires (Skinner 1984, 1991, 2002; Spitz 1993). Republican freedom merely requires\nthe absence of something, namely, the absence of any structural\ndependence on arbitrary power or domination.  (Also like\nnon-interference, non-domination comes in degrees: on the civic\nrepublican view, one is not either free or unfree, but rather more or\nless free depending on the extent of non-domination one securely\nenjoys.) \n\nDespite these similarities, however, republican freedom is not\nequivalent to the received view of negative liberty as\nnon-interference. In contrast to the non-interference view, it easily\naccounts for our intuitions in the two scenarios described above. The\nslave lacks freedom because he is vulnerable to the arbitrary power of\nhis master; whether his master happens to exercise that power is\nneither here nor there. Likewise, what matters with respect to\npolitical freedom on the republican view is not how much the\nimperial power chooses to govern its colony, but the fact that the\nformer may choose to govern the latter as much and however it\nlikes. Thus Joseph Priestley described the lightly-governed American\ncolonies as nevertheless in a condition of servitude because “by\nthe same power, by which the people of England can compel them to pay\none penny, they may compel them to pay the last penny they have”\n(1769, 140). \n\nMoreover, the republican conception captures in a more intuitively\nsatisfying way what would improve either situation with\nrespect to political liberty. Most people are not inclined to say that\nslaves enjoy increasing freedom just because, with experience, they\nimprove their insight into their master’s psychological\ndispositions. But many would be inclined to say that their\nfreedom is enhanced, other things being equal, if some effective reform\nin the laws, institutions, or norms sharply reduced their\nmaster’s authority over them. (This is not necessarily to\nsay that the slaves will enjoy greater well-being, all things\nconsidered—only that because their domination is lessened, they\nenjoy greater freedom to that extent.) And of course, no matter how\nbenevolent their particular master happens to be, no slave can be\ncompletely free until the institution of slavery itself is\nabolished. \n\nPolitical freedom, in other words, is constituted by rightly-ordered\nlaws, institutions, and norms: “to enjoy such non-domination,\nafter all, is just to be in a position where no one can interfere\narbitrarily in your affairs,” writes Pettit, “and you are\nin that position from the moment that the institutions are in\nplace” inhibiting possible arbitrary interference (1997, 107).\nPolitical freedom is most fully realized, on this view, in a\nwell-ordered self-governing republic of equal citizens under the rule\nof law, where no one citizen is the master of any other (Pettit 1989,\n1997, 2012, 2014; Skinner 1991, 1998; Spitz 1993, 1995; Viroli 2002; Maynor 2003; Lovett 2012a, 2016a). In the classic\nexpression of James Harrington, such a community would be an\n“empire of laws and not of men” (1656, 8).\n\n \n\nThe appeal of the republican conception of political liberty as\nindependence from the arbitrary power of a master is perhaps\nunderstandable. This is not to say, however, that this conception is\nuncontroversial. Before discussing its role in developing contemporary\ncivic republican arguments, we should consider various problems and\ndebates surrounding the republican idea of freedom. \n\nA common objection to the republican idea of freedom is that it fails\nto pick out an distinct conception at all. The suggestion here, first\nnoted perhaps by Paley (1785), is that talking about non-domination is\nreally just another (more obscure) way of talking about security of\nnon-interference (Goodin 2003; Carter 2008; Kramer 2008). Contemporary\ncivic republicans must reject this view. Pettit (1997, 73–4) observes that one might secure a low expected level of\nnon-interference in more than one way, and the republican idea of\nfreedom is by no means indifferent as to the method adopted. For\nexample, to have a master with an exceptionally benevolent disposition\nis to be reasonably secure in one’s expectation that one will not\noften be adversely interfered with—but it is to have a master\nnonetheless. The republican idea of freedom specifically instructs us\nnot to make our master a better person (the goal of the old\n‘mirror for princes’ literature), but to render him less\nof a master (Lovett 2012b). This can only be done by curbing either his arbitrary\npower or his subjects’ dependency on him. \n\nSupposing then that non-domination and non-interference are indeed\ndistinct ideas, one might wonder where this leaves the latter, on the\ncivic republican view of things. Is obtaining freedom from arbitrary\npower the only thing we should care about? Roughly speaking,\nthere are three possible answers civic republicans might give to this\nquestion. \n\nThe first is simply to answer yes. It was a mistake, one\nmight argue, to ever think non-interference important or desirable in\nitself. Of course, as a contingent empirical fact, extensive arbitrary\npower often brings extensive interferences in train (slave masters and\nabsolute monarchs just can’t help meddling in their\nsubjects’ affairs, we might suppose), so it is understandable that\nour distaste for the former should influence our assessment of the\nlatter. There are good reasons for rejecting this first answer,\nhowever. Imagine living in a community where our lives are regulated\ndown to the tiniest detail, but always in strict accordance with\ncommonly-known, non-arbitrary rules and procedures. Although we enjoy\nextensive freedom from arbitrary power, we have hardly any freedom of\nindividual choice. Most would not want to live in such a community, and\nthis suggests that we do indeed place some independent value on\nnon-interference (Larmore 2001; Wall 2001).  This leaves two other possible answers. On the one hand, we might\ntry to incorporate some measure of non-interference into our idea of\nfreedom as non-domination. Something like this approach was initially\ntaken by Pettit (1997, 74–7): there he distinguished between\nfactors that “compromise” liberty, and factors that\n“condition” it. Perhaps my republican freedom is\ncompromised when someone gains arbitrary power over me, but it is\nmerely conditioned when I lack the means or opportunities to make full\nuse of it, and interferences might be one such conditioning factor.\nOn the other hand, we might allow that republican freedom and\nnon-interference are distinct goods, but hold that both are valuable\nin some degree. We might either regard them as having roughly equal\nvalue (Skinner 1998), or we might regard republican liberty as having\ngreater importance than non-interference, other things equal\n(Viroli 2002, Pettit 2012). Each of these options has its advantages\nand disadvantages, and there is no settled view in the contemporary\ncivic republican literature on this point (see Lovett 2018).  \n\nA second major difficulty in developing the republican idea of\nfreedom lies in giving precise meaning to the notion of arbitrariness.\nAccording to what criteria are we to consider power ‘arbitrary’? Not\nsimply when its exercise is random or unpredictable. This view would\nundermine the whole point of the republican conception of political\nliberty. As discussed above, with long experience a slave is better\nable to predict his master’s behavior, and so it appears less\nrandom to him, but (the civic republican wants to argue) the slave does\nnot enjoy greater freedom by that fact alone. Just because one is\nbetter able to cope with arbitrary power, it does not follow that\none’s domination is any less. \n\n‘Discretionary’ is much closer to the relevant meaning\nof arbitrary, but it is not quite right either. Discretionary power\nmight be delegated to a public agency with a view to advancing certain\npolicy goals or ends—as for example Congress has delegated\ndiscretionary authority to the Federal Reserve—but we would not\nwant to say that this reduces our freedom (or, at any rate, not so long\nas that discretionary authority is appropriately answerable to a common\nknowledge understanding of the goals or ends it is meant to serve and\nthe means it is permitted to employ). For reasons explained in\nthe fourth section of this entry, contemporary civic republicans must\nbe able to offer an account of non-arbitrary, yet discretionary\nauthority. \n\nHow then should we characterize arbitrary power? Broadly speaking, two\nanswers have been proposed. The first defines non-arbitrariness procedurally. Power\nis not arbitrary, on this view, to the extent that it is reliably\ncontrolled by effective rules, procedures, or goals that are common\nknowledge to all persons or groups concerned (Lovett 2001, 2010). To\nbe reliable and effective, on this view, constraints must be resilient\nover a wide range of possible changes or modifications in the relevant\ncircumstances (Lovett 2012c). Roughly speaking, the procedural view\nequates republican freedom with the traditional idea of the rule of\nlaw, provided we are willing to extend the latter idea considerably\n(List 2006; Lovett 2016a). \nAlternatively, we might define non-arbitrariness democratically. Power is not arbitrary, on this second view, to the extent that it is directly or indirectly controlled by the concerned persons or groups themselves. In an example offered by Pettit (2012, 57–58), suppose Andrea has given Bob the keys to her alcohol cupboard, with strict instructions that no matter how much she pleads, he is not to return them except on twenty-four hours notice. Since Bob must answer to Andrea for his conduct in this regard, his power over her is not arbitrary. In roughly the same way, the power of the state over its citizens will not be arbitrary provided the people have an equal share in controlling how their state exercises its power. Many authors subscribe to some version of this democratic view (see for example Bohman 2008; Laborde 2008; Forst 2013; McCammon 2015). \nEither way, two caveats are worth noting. The first is that, on either view, arbitrariness  simply means uncontrolled and vice versa. Pettit’s recent preference for the latter term over the former (e.g., Pettit 2012, 2014) is simply due to its superior clarity, and represents neither a real change in view nor the addition of a new condition alongside the old. The second caveat is that, again on either view, arbitrary or uncontrolled power should not be defined along substantive lines as power that is unjust or illegitimate. This was never Pettit’s view, though in earlier work (e.g., Pettit 1997) some passages may have inadvertently suggested otherwise. The well-known problem with a moralized definition of arbitrariness is that it would collapse our conception of republican freedom into a general account of the human good (Larmore 2001; Costa 2007; Carter 2008). \n \n\nSo far we have assumed that, however ultimately defined, republican\nfreedom is always a good thing. Some have wondered whether this is the\ncase, however. This objection is most often expressed via the example\nof benevolent care-giving relationships. On the republican view that\none enjoys freedom only to the extent that one is independent from\narbitrary power, it would seem that children do not enjoy republican\nfreedom with respect to their parents. But surely, one might suppose,\nthe parent-child relationship is (in most cases) an extremely valuable\none, and so we would not want greater republican freedom in such a\ncontext. Republican freedom is, perhaps, not always a good thing\n(Ferejohn 2001).  As stated, this objection rests on a conceptual error, though (as\nwe shall see) it points to an important set of issues as yet\nunder-developed in the contemporary civic republican literature. The\nerror in the above example stems from our confusing the overall\nevaluation of a whole with an evaluation of its parts considered\nseparately. It is undeniable that, at least in the ordinary course of\nthings, parent-child relationships are extremely valuable, considered\nas a whole; it does not follow from this, however, that the\nrelationship is necessarily valuable in each and every part. For the\nobjection to hold, it must be the case—not only that the\nparent-child relationship is valuable overall—but further, that\nthat it would actually be worse if, holding all its other features\nconstant, it involved less arbitrary power. But this is highly\ndoubtful. Clearly, the introduction of children’s rights into\nwestern law was a boon, precisely because it reduced the degree of\narbitrary power to which children are inevitably subject (which is to\nsay, because it increased their republican freedom). That their\nrepublican freedom cannot be increased still further, perhaps, without\ndestroying family life altogether, and thus losing its many other\nbenefits, is neither here nor there. \n\nWhat consideration of this faulty objection does reveal, however, is\nthat republican freedom is simply one good among others, with which it\nmight come into conflict (Markell 2008). The challenge for\ncontemporary civic republicans, therefore, is less to show why non-domination is an important human good\n(for which there are plenty of good arguments in the literature: see\nPettit 1997; Maynor 2003; Laborde 2008; Lovett 2010), but rather to\nshow how it fits into a broader moral framework, and specifically, the comparative weight we should assign\nto republican freedom vis-à-vis other important goods in\nthe achievement of human flourishing (or, if non-domination is regarded as a deontological side-constraint, as suggested by Forst 2013, its relative priority vis-à-vis other side-constraints). Pettit (2005, 2014) sketches a case\nfor the relative priority of republican liberty on more or less\npragmatic grounds: roughly speaking, he argues that political\ndoctrines will be most effective when they concentrate on as few core\nvalues as possible, and accordingly that the best values to\nconcentrate on are those whose promotion will service as wide a range\nof needs as possible. Republican freedom is just such a good, he\nclaims, insofar as our efforts to promote it will necessarily have\nfar-reaching beneficial consequences. It will be more clear why this\nmight be so in light of the discussion in part four below, but\nregardless there remains considerable work to be done developing the\nfoundations of republican theory. \n\nAfter long-standing neglect among historians of political thought,\nthere has been a dramatic revival of interest in the classical republican tradition in the past fifty years or so. For the first few\ndecades of this revival, a particular interpretation of that tradition\nprevailed. According to this view, the classical republicans held what\nwould now be described as a perfectionist political\nphilosophy—that is, a political philosophy centered on the idea\nof promoting a specific conception of the good life as consisting in\nactive citizenship and healthy civic virtue on the one hand, while\ncombating any sort of corruption that would undermine these values on\nthe other. This distinctive vision of the good life is supposed to be\nrooted in the experience of the ancient Greek polis, especially as\nexpressed in the writings of Aristotle. The goods of active political\nparticipation, civic virtue, and so on, are to be understood as\nintrinsically valuable components of human flourishing.  It is now standard to refer to this as the ‘civic\nhumanist’ interpretation of the classical republican tradition, and it is most commonly associated with the writings of Arendt (1958, 1963), Pocock (1975, 1981), and Rahe (1992). These and other civic humanist writings have left such an impression on the field that even today many fail to distinguish their views from those of the civic republicans. As we shall see, however, the two are importantly distinct.\n \nBeginning with Skinner (1984), Sunstein (1988), and Pettit (1989), an alternative interpretation of the tradition began to emerge. Undoubtedly, the classical republicans were committed to the importance of active political participation, civic virtue, combating corruption, and so forth. But\nrather than viewing these as intrinsically valuable components of a particular vision of the good life, these authors argued, they should instead be viewed as\ninstrumentally useful tools for securing and preserving political\nliberty, understood as independence from arbitrary rule. Republicanism, on this view, has its roots not in an Aristotelian vision of the ancient Greek polis, but rather in Roman jurisprudence with its fundamental and categorical distinction between free men and citizens on the one hand, and dependent slaves on the other. This instrumental or ‘neo-Roman’ interpretation of the tradition was cemented in major contributions by Spitz (1995), Pettit (1997), Dagger (1997), and Skinner (1998). There now exists a considerable historiographical literature advancing this new interpretation, including studies of Machiavelli (Skinner 1983, 1984; Viroli 1998), the seventeenth-century English republicans (Dzelzainis 1995; Skinner 1998, 2000; Lovett 2005, 2012a); Rousseau (Viroli 1998); the Americans of the founding era (Sellers 1994); Wollstonecraft (Coffee 2012; Halldenius 2015); and the nineteenth-century American labor republicans (Gourevitch 2015). These and other contemporary civic republicans argue that a careful reading of the classical republican texts firmly rejects the perfectionist interpretation favored by civic humanists. Moreover, the instrumental turn was vital to establishing interest in republicanism as a viable contemporary political doctrine. The difficulty with civic humanism, as many critics have pointed out, is that a perfectionist vision of human flourishing through active political virtue is out of step with modern political and social conditions. There is simply no hope of recreating the experience of the Greek polis in economically complex mass democracies characterized by reasonable pluralism (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003; Brennan and Lomasky 2006). This objection is removed, however, if we regard civic virtue instrumentally, as merely one tool among others for securing political liberty. Insofar as republicans are willing to use that tool, and thus willing to support public policies designed to deliberately cultivate civic virtue, they must perhaps reject stronger doctrines of liberal neutrality; but they will nevertheless be happy to endorse broad principles of toleration (Honohan 2013; Lovett and Whitfield 2016). Thus properly understood, republicanism is fully “compatible with modern pluralistic forms of society” (Pettit 1997, 8).\n\n \n\nThe contemporary civic republican interpretation carries with it\nwhat could be seen as a significant drawback, namely, that it reduces the distance between classical republicanism and the\nmainstream liberal tradition. At one level, this should surprise no\none. After all, classical republicans and classical liberals shared\nmany political commitments (constitutionalism and the rule of law, for\nexample), and many figures are regarded as central to both traditions\n(Montesquieu, for example). The difficulty arises, however, from the\nsuggestion that on the new instrumental interpretation, republicanism\nfor all intents and purposes collapses into liberalism (Larmore 2001; Patten 1996). Indeed, at one point in his\nPolitical Liberalism, Rawls explicitly states that his theory\nhas “no fundamental opposition” with a non-perfectionist,\ninstrumental interpretation of republicanism (1993, 205). What then\nis the advantage of civic republicanism over mainstream liberalism (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003; Brennan and Lomasky 2006)? \n\nThe standard reply among contemporary civic republicans is\nto argue that there is indeed a connection between republicanism and\nliberalism, but that liberalism is “an impoverished or incoherent\nrepublicanism” (Viroli 2002, 61)—a bastard offshoot, so to\nspeak, of what was originally a considerably more appealing political\nphilosophy. The republican critique of liberalism is thus best understood as a critique of various problematic tendencies that developed within the liberal tradition as it increasingly diverged from its republican roots.   The most important of these is the tendency in the liberal tradition, especially beginning with Bentham, Paley, and Constant, to displace the robust conception of liberty as independence from arbitrary or uncontrolled power with a weaker conception of liberty as non-interference. The significance of this substitution will be easier to assess after the discussion below, but in the main it comes down to this: because republican liberty is inherently incompatible with any form of dependency or mastery, its social implications are considerably more radical than those of mere negative liberty. This is precisely why many liberal authors took pains to distance themselves from republicanism in the first place, as they openly admitted: “those definitions of liberty ought to be rejected, which, by making that essential to civil freedom which is unattainable in experience, inflame expectations that can never be gratified,” observed Paley (1785, 315; cf. Pettit 1997). \nWhat is more, on the view of liberty as non-interference, any sort of public law or policy intervention will count as an interference and, ergo, as a reduction in freedom. Liberals committed to the received view of negative liberty will thus tend to be overly hostile to government action (Pettit 1997, 2009). On the republican view, by contrast, public laws or policy interventions need not always count as reductions in freedom. Provided the law or policy is adopted and implemented in an appropriately non-arbitrary manner, the citizens’ freedom remains untouched. Indeed, if the law or policy ameliorates dependency, or curtails the arbitrary powers some in the community exercise over others, freedom may be enhanced. In the classical tradition, this idea was often expressed as the claim that, in the words of Blackstone, “laws, when prudently framed, are by no means subversive but rather introductive of liberty” and thus “where there is no law, there is no freedom” (1765,\n122). The grounds for this claim will be explained further below. \n\nHowever interesting the debates discussed in the\nprevious section, one may still wonder whether republicanism has\nanything valuable to contribute to contemporary normative political\ntheory and philosophy. One reason many people remain skeptical has to\ndo with the fact that the classical republican writings often express\nviews that are decidedly elitist, patriarchal, and militaristic. How\ncould the basis for an appealing contemporary political program be\nfound in such writings (Goldsmith 2000; Maddox 2002; Goodin 2003; McCormick 2003)?  That the classical republicans often expressed these very\nunappealing views is not disputed. But what are we to make of this\nfact? There are two possibilities. On the one hand, the parochialism\nof the classical republicans might reflect logical consequences of\ntheir core value commitments, in which case we cannot adopt the latter\nwithout taking on board the former. On the other hand, it might merely\nreflect the accidental prejudices of their day, in which case it can\neasily be dispensed with as we modernize the republican program. Now\naccording to the civic humanist reading of the tradition, the\nclassical republicans were committed to a perfectionist conception of\nthe human good as active citizenship and civic virtue. On this view,\nit is clear that some individuals will be more successful than others\nin attaining the good so understood—some are more adept at\npolitics than others, some are more capable of heroic displays of\nvirtue than others, and so on. Indeed, political power and public\nhonor are, to some extent, positional goods, meaning that their\ndistribution among the members of a community will necessarily be\nunequal. It follows that, on the civic humanist reading of the\ntradition, the elitist bent of the classical republican writings is a\nconsequence of their core values. As Arendt writes, it is “the\nsign of a well-ordered republic” that only the politically\nvirtuous elite “would have the right to be heard in the conduct\nof the business of the republic” (1963, 279). \n\nThe civic republicans, naturally, reject this view. There is nothing\ninherently elitist about the ideal of freedom when this is understood\nnegatively as independence from arbitrary or uncontrolled power. The classical\nrepublicans, to be sure, typically confined the extension of this ideal\nto a narrow range of propertied, native-born male citizens. But on the\ncivic republican reading of the tradition, this merely reflects an\nunnecessary prejudice we can easily dispense with. The elitism of the tradition long concealed the potentially radical implications of freedom as non-domination; suitably universalized now at last, republicanism is revealed to be a strikingly progressive political doctrine (Pettit 1997, 2014; Maynor 2003; Lovett 2009; Gourevitch 2015). \n\nThe remainder of this section will sketch some of the wide-ranging\napplications of a universalized republicanism, dedicated to the\npromotion of freedom as non-domination. Much of the contemporary\nrepublican program, as one would expect, bares some familial\nrelationship with the political commitments of the classical\nrepublicans. There are also divergences, however. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans draw inspiration from the classical tradition, but they do\nnot aim to anachronistically implement the republicanism of yore for\nits own sake.  Contemporary civic republicans aim to promote freedom, understood\nas independence from arbitrary power. Roughly speaking, there are two\ndirections from which republican freedom might be threatened. First,\nthere is the obvious danger of an autocratic or despotic government\nassuming arbitrary powers over its subjects; this concern, and\nrepublican remedies for it, will be discussed below. But there is a\nsecond danger to republican freedom as well—one that concerns\ncontemporary civic republicans just as much as the first. (Absent this\nsecond concern, republican policy would indeed often seem\n“indeterminate,” as observed by McMahon 2005 and Costa\n2007.)  This is the danger that some individuals or groups within\ncivil society will succeed in assuming arbitrary or uncontrolled\npowers over others. A few examples will help clarify this second\ndanger. \n\nImagine for a moment there were no system of domestic criminal and\ncivil law. In this case, citizens would not know where they stood with\none another; their interrelations would be governed simply by\nforce—which is to say, by the arbitrary whim of the momentarily\nstronger party. In order to enjoy some degree of republican freedom,\ntherefore, it is absolutely essential to introduce a domestic legal\nsystem so as to govern the citizens’ mutual relations (Lovett 2016a). Notice\nthat, on the republican view of freedom, the laws do not merely protect\nsome freedoms at the expense of others (as on the non-interference\nview), but rather themselves actually introduce or enable that freedom.\nOn this view, only when their interrelations are mutually governed by a\nsystem of public and stable rules is it possible for fellow\ncitizens to enjoy some measure of independence from arbitrary rule\n(Pettit 1989, 1997, 2012; Viroli 2002; Dagger 2009). \n\nThis connection between the rule of law and freedom is a common theme\nin the classical republican literature. Contemporary civic republicans\nobserve, however, that even when the rule of law is firmly\nestablished, there remain many other potential dangers of which the\nclassical republicans were less well aware. For example, while markets as such need not involve domination (Pettit 2006), and indeed when well-ordered might reduce it (Taylor 2017), republicans’ enthusiasm for markets will have definite limits. Specifically, there is the danger of basic needs deprivation, which can place the least advantaged\nmembers of society in a position of economic vulnerability (Spitz 1993; Pettit\n1997; Viroli 2002). In order to satisfy their basic needs, individuals\nmay well submit themselves to the arbitrary power of exploitative\nemployers or become dependent on the whims of voluntary charity\n(Dagger 2006; Lovett 2009; Gourevitch 2015). Ensuring the enjoyment of republican\nfreedom will therefore require some public provision for otherwise\nunmet basic needs.  Yet another danger to republican freedom arises in the context of\nfamily life and gender relations. Traditional family law subjected\nboth wives and children to considerable arbitrary power: circumstances\nin the case of the latter, circumscribed opportunities in the case of\nthe former, ensured the nearly complete dependency of both on the\nfamily they happened to be in. The contemporary civic republican\nprogram is thus congenial to both an expansion of children’s\nrights, and the elimination of sex domination (Pettit 1997; Phillips\n2000; Costa 2013; Halldenius 2015). \n\nIt is always important from a civic republican point of view to be on\nguard against the introduction of new forms of dependency and\narbitrary power through those very laws and policies designed to\nenhance individual freedom, however. In the area of criminal and civil\nlaw, for example, freedom might be threatened by legal uncertainty or\nprosecutorial discretion; and, of course, there are grave republican\nconcerns with respect to the existing system of punishment in many\nwestern nations (Braithwaite and Pettit 1990). These dangers might\nsuggest the need for a more democratized system of criminal justice\n(Martí 2009).  Similarly, in the public provision of basic\nneeds, there are republican concerns with respect to dependence on\ngovernment aid and arbitrariness in the distribution of benefits that\nmight point to the introduction of an unconditional basic income\n(Raventos 2007; Lovett 2009; for a contrary view, see Taylor 2017). In many of these areas, however, there remains\nconsiderable work for contemporary civic republicans in determining\nthe appropriate public policy implications of a universalized concern\nfor republican freedom. \n\nTurning from questions of public policy to the form of government,\nwe return to issues more familiar to the writers in the classical\ntradition. Protecting citizens from the arbitrary or uncontrolled power of their\ngovernment through good institutional design represents perhaps the\nsignature classical republican concern. Many of the standard devices\nfor achieving this aim—the rule of law, the separation of powers,\nfederalism, constitutionally entrenched basic rights, and so\non—have been adopted by liberals and others. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans, naturally, remain committed to these institutional devices\nin some measure (Pettit 1997, 2012, 2014; Maynor 2003). \n\nHowever, contemporary civic republicans also recognize that these\nsorts of devices can only go so far. The basic reason for this is that,\nno matter how carefully designed, the operation and functioning of\ngovernment necessarily entails considerable discretion on the part of\npublic authorities (Pettit 1997; Richardson 2002). There are two\nespecially prominent instances of this. First, it is clear that no\nmatter how detailed and carefully-crafted it is, no system of explicit\nrules and regulations can possibly cover all contingencies and\ncircumstances. It follows that discretionary authority must inevitably\nbe left in the hands of courts, public agencies, and administrative\nbureaucracies. Second, even apart from this, there remains extensive\ndiscretion in the hands of legislatures to set public law and policy in\nthe first place. A daily-changing system of rules is no better than\nhaving no rules at all.   \n\nThe standard republican remedy for this problem is enhanced\ndemocracy. It must, however, be democracy of the right sort. Most\ncontemporary civic republicans reject the populist model of democracy\naccording to which all public laws and policies must express the\ncollective will of the people in order to be considered legitimate.\nInstead, they generally endorse some form of “qualified\npopulism” (Richardson 2002) or “contestatory\ndemocracy” (Pettit 1997, 1999, 2001; Maynor 2003). Roughly\nspeaking, the idea is that properly-designed democratic institutions\nshould give citizens the effective opportunity to contest the\ndecisions of their representatives. This possibility of contestation\nwill make government agents wielding discretionary authority\nanswerable to a public understanding of the goals or ends they are\nmeant to serve and the means they are permitted to employ. In this\nway, discretionary power can be subject to popular control in the sense\nrequired for a secure enjoyment of republican liberty (Pettit 2012, 2014; see also Ingham 2016). \n\nNext, of course, we will want to know how popular control might actually be put into practice.\nThe main challenges are commonly addressed under three headings, outlined by Pettit\n(1997, 186–7). The first and most thoroughly discussed is the requirement that\ndiscretionary authority be guided by the norm of deliberative\npublic reasoning. This means that the relevant decision-makers\n(legislatures, courts, bureaucrats, etc.) must be required to present\nreasons for their decisions, and those reasons must be subject to open\npublic debate (see Sunstein 1988, 1993; Pettit 1997; Richardson 2002). So,\nfor example, legislative processes should be designed so as to\ndiscourage back-room bargaining on the basis of sectional interests,\nand instead to encourage open public deliberation. Similarly,\nbureaucratic agencies should not be allowed to merely issue\ndeterminations on the basis of technocratic expertise without offering\nreasons for their decisions that are open to public examination. \n\nThe other two requirements have not received as much attention as the\nfirst, perhaps because both are relatively obvious. The second is that\nof inclusiveness. Opportunities for democratic contestation must be\nequally open to all persons and groups in the society. This\nrequirement follows naturally from a universalized concern for\nrepublican liberty, and it has implications for the design of\nrepresentative institutions, campaign financing, and so on (Pettit\n1997, 2012; Bellamy 2007). And the third requirement is that there exist\ninstitutionalized forums for contestation—impartial\n‘courts of appeal,’ so to speak, where citizens can raise\nobjections to public laws and policies (Pettit 1997, 1999, 2012). Whether\nthese forums should include constitutional courts with strong powers\nof judicial review remains a subject of debate in the republican\nliterature, however (Bellamy 2007; Honohan 2009). \n\nAmong the more salient themes in the classical republican tradition\nare the importance of civic virtue and the dangers of corruption. We\nmay understand the term ‘corruption’ simply to mean the\nadvancement of personal or sectional interest at the expense of the\npublic good, and ‘civic virtue’ as its opposite—that\nis, a willingness to do one’s part in supporting the public\ngood. Critics of republicanism often fear that this implies extensive\nself-sacrifice and frugality, a renunciation of individuality and\nself-identification with the community (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003; Brennan and Lomasky 2006). These fears are\nno doubt encouraged by the civic humanist reading of the classical\ntradition along perfectionist lines. Civic republicans accordingly\nhave been at pains to show the contrary—that civic virtue should\nbe understood as a strictly instrumental good, useful in establishing\nand maintaining republican liberty. Far from calling for the\nsubjection of individual to collective aims, they argue, republican\nliberty is desirable in part because it enables citizens to pursue\ntheir private aims with assurances of security (Skinner 1984, 1991; Spitz 1993; Dagger 1997; \nViroli 2002; Maynor 2003). \n\nBroadly speaking, there are two topics to consider under the heading\nof civic virtue. On the one hand, there is the civic virtue and danger\nof its corruption on the part of public officials; on the other, there\nis the civic virtue and danger of its corruption on the part of\ncitizens in general. With respect to the former, republicans typically\nreject the view (common in the liberal tradition) that public officials\nare by nature corrupt, and instead regard individuals as potentially\ncorruptible, but not necessarily corrupt (Pettit 1997). Working from\nthis assumption, it is strictly a pragmatic and empirical question which\nconfigurations of public laws, institutions, and norms are most likely to\nminimize the danger of corruption, and enhance the civic virtue of\npublic officials. Options here include screening procedures on the\nselection of officials, rules and norms keeping some policy options out\nof bounds, and both positive and negative sanctions. In designing such\ninstitutions, it is important not to assume the worst of people, for\notherwise we might inadvertently encourage (through an evident lack of\ntrust) the very corrupt behavior one aims to guard against. \n\nPromoting civic virtue on the part of the citizens in general,\nhowever, is just as important from a republican point of view. There\nare a variety of possible reasons for this. For the most part, they\nstem from the observation that the widespread enjoyment of republican\nliberty is most likely to be maximized in a community where the\ncitizens are committed to that ideal, and each is willing to do his or\nher part in realizing it. For example, through collective political\naction, citizens can bring instances of domination to public attention;\nthey can support laws and policies that would expand republican\nfreedom; and they can do their part in defending republican\ninstitutions when called upon to do so. Promoting this sort of\ncommitment to republican ideals will require a fairly robust program of\ncivics education, together with a culture that rewards virtue with\npublic esteem (Dagger 1997; Pettit 1997; Brennan and Pettit 2003; Maynor\n2003; Costa 2009). Again, it should be emphasized here that citizens do not enjoy\nrepublican freedom, on the civic republican view, in being\nvirtuous. Indeed, this could not be the case since, as argued earlier,\nthe degree of republican freedom enjoyed is rather a question of how\nthe laws, institutions, and norms of the community are ordered. Civic\nvirtue is, however, instrumentally useful both in bringing\nabout the right sorts of laws, institutions, and norms, and in ensuring\ntheir durability and reliability. \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the connection between civic virtue\n(both on the part of public officials and citizens in general) and the\nrule of law. The significance of the rule of law for republican\nliberty was discussed above; in the classical republican tradition,\nthis was expressed as the “empire of law” ideal—the\nnotion that in a free republic laws, not men, rule. Of course this\ncannot ever be literally true, but it can be approximated in a sort of\nartificial way, so that life can be experienced as if it were\ntrue within a given community. This requires, however, that the law be\nwidely regarded as clear, predictable, and legitimate, and this in\nturn is possible only when there is a generally high level of\ncompliance and when legal rules are embedded in a shared network of\ninformal social norms (Pettit 1997; Lovett 2016a). The classical republicans were fond of extolling the martial valor of Rome and other ancient republics, and they often followed Machiavelli in advocating policies and institutions that would enhance the expansionist capacities of republics. For this they have often been accused of militaristic and imperialistic tendencies (see for example Goodin 2003), but this is not entirely fair. One has to be mindful of the dangerous security environments republics have often faced. The classical republicans rarely advocated conquest for its own sake: “swords were given to men,” writes Sidney, “that none might be slaves,” not that they might enslave others (1698, 343). In a hostile world populated by autocratic rivals, Machiavelli may have been right to believe that a republic’s best defence is a good offense. \nEven so, the classical republicans were sensitive to the particular dangers of territorial expansion. They especially worried that by upsetting the domestic balance of wealth and power, imperial conquest would undermine freedom at home, and accordingly they sought remedies through various cooperative and federal arrangements (Deudney 2007; Bohman 2008). Whether optimally securing republican freedom under modern conditions will ultimately require some sort of global republic, however, remains a topic of debate (see Pettit 2010; Martí 2010; Maynor 2015). \nBeyond narrow security concerns, however, contemporary civic republicans have recently begun to explore the implications of republican freedom for global economic justice. Supposing the ideal is suitably universalized, and thus every human being’s non-domination counts the same, are republicans committed to cosmopolitan policies of global redistribution? Here a wide range of views can be found in the literature. Pettit (2010, 2014) argues no, on the grounds that economic justice is mainly important indirectly for preserving domestic republican institutions, whereas Lovett (2016b) argues yes, on the grounds that poverty and severe inequality directly expose individuals to domination. In between these positions, Laborde (2010), and Laborde and Ronzoni (2016) maintain that our global obligations to promote non-domination are similar but ultimately weaker than our domestic ones. Finally, Bachvarova (2013) suggests that republicanism is best suited to address relational rather than distributive global justice. \nPerhaps the greatest challenge to contemporary civic republican theory, however, is the problem of state borders and global migration. Republicans are in a strong position to advocate for stateless persons, refugees, and resident non-citizens who, in various ways, are clearly vulnerable to avoidable domination (Bohman 2009; Benton 2010). Much less obvious, however, is how to address the issue of international freedom of movement. Traditionally committed to a strong conception of citizenship, the republican ideal of political liberty has often seemed inseparable from the existence of bounded communities of fellow free citizens. Pettit (2012, 161–2) claims that since states have no choice but to maintain borders, the existence of migration controls as such cannot count as dominating, while Costa (2016) disagrees. Honohan (2014) insists that any migration controls a given state does implement should be non-arbitrary, but as Fine (2014) observes, this does not settle the ultimate question of whether freedom of movement can be reconciled with the need to maintain civic community. \n\n \n\nIn many respects, civic republicanism remains a still underdeveloped\npolitical doctrine. Further work is required in all the areas\ndiscussed above, and there are many issues central to the concerns of\ncontemporary political theorists and philosophers that contemporary civic\nrepublicans have only recently begun to examine.  Among the latter,\nthere are now at least initial treatments of multiculturalism (Laborde\n2008; Lovett 2010; Honohan 2013; Bachvarova 2014), education policy (Peterson 2011; Hinchliffe 2014; Macleod 2015), and intergenerational justice (Beckman 2016; Katz 2017) among other topics, though substantial\nwork certainly remains to be done. Nevertheless, civic republicanism\nis a dynamic and growing field, which stands to make continuing\npositive contributions to debate in contemporary social and political\ntheory.","contact.mail":"flovett@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"}]
