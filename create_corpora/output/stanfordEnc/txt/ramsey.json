Whilst he was acknowledged as a\ngenius by his contemporaries, some of his most important ideas were not\nappreciated until decades later; now better appreciated, they continue\nto bear an influence upon contemporary philosophy. His historic\nsignificance was to usher in a new phase of analytic philosophy, which\ninitially built upon the logical atomist doctrines of Bertrand\nRussell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a new level of\nsophistication, but ultimately he became their successor rather than\nremain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey’s contributions except to the discipline\nof economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n  Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare\nEconomics.  Note that all citations beginning solely with a\ndate refer to works by Ramsey; these are listed by date in a\nsubsection of the Bibliography. Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"fraser.macbride@manchester.ac.uk","contact.domain":"manchester.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2019-08-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/","author1":"Fraser MacBride","author2":"Mathieu Marion","author1.info":"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fraser.macbride.html","author2.info":"http://www.edwardjrelliott.com/","entry":"ramsey","body.text":"\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–30) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics. Whilst he was acknowledged as a\ngenius by his contemporaries, some of his most important ideas were not\nappreciated until decades later; now better appreciated, they continue\nto bear an influence upon contemporary philosophy. His historic\nsignificance was to usher in a new phase of analytic philosophy, which\ninitially built upon the logical atomist doctrines of Bertrand\nRussell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a new level of\nsophistication, but ultimately he became their successor rather than\nremain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey’s contributions except to the discipline\nof economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n  Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare\nEconomics.  Note that all citations beginning solely with a\ndate refer to works by Ramsey; these are listed by date in a\nsubsection of the Bibliography. Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"marion.mathieu@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"},{"date.published":"2019-08-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/","author1":"Fraser MacBride","author2":"Mathieu Marion","author1.info":"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fraser.macbride.html","author2.info":"http://www.edwardjrelliott.com/","entry":"ramsey","body.text":"\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–30) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics. Whilst he was acknowledged as a\ngenius by his contemporaries, some of his most important ideas were not\nappreciated until decades later; now better appreciated, they continue\nto bear an influence upon contemporary philosophy. His historic\nsignificance was to usher in a new phase of analytic philosophy, which\ninitially built upon the logical atomist doctrines of Bertrand\nRussell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a new level of\nsophistication, but ultimately he became their successor rather than\nremain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey’s contributions except to the discipline\nof economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n  Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare\nEconomics.  Note that all citations beginning solely with a\ndate refer to works by Ramsey; these are listed by date in a\nsubsection of the Bibliography. Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"frapolli@ugr.es","contact.domain":"ugr.es"},{"date.published":"2019-08-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/","author1":"Fraser MacBride","author2":"Mathieu Marion","author1.info":"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fraser.macbride.html","author2.info":"http://www.edwardjrelliott.com/","entry":"ramsey","body.text":"\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–30) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics.

His historic\nsignificance was to usher in a new phase of analytic philosophy, which\ninitially built upon the logical atomist doctrines of Bertrand\nRussell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a new level of\nsophistication, but ultimately he became their successor rather than\nremain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey’s contributions except to the discipline\nof economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n  Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare\nEconomics.  Note that all citations beginning solely with a\ndate refer to works by Ramsey; these are listed by date in a\nsubsection of the Bibliography. Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"d.edgington@bbk.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bbk.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2019-08-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/","author1":"Fraser MacBride","author2":"Mathieu Marion","author1.info":"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fraser.macbride.html","author2.info":"http://www.edwardjrelliott.com/","entry":"ramsey","body.text":"\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–30) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics.

Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"e.j.r.elliott@leeds.ac.uk","contact.domain":"leeds.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2019-08-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/","author1":"Fraser MacBride","author2":"Mathieu Marion","author1.info":"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fraser.macbride.html","author2.info":"http://www.edwardjrelliott.com/","entry":"ramsey","body.text":"\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–30) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics.

His historic\nsignificance was to usher in a new phase of analytic philosophy, which\ninitially built upon the logical atomist doctrines of Bertrand\nRussell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a new level of\nsophistication, but ultimately he became their successor rather than\nremain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey’s contributions except to the discipline\nof economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n  Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare\nEconomics.

Also, collections of Ramsey’s works\nare cited by two-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in\nthe first subsection of the Bibliography.\n\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was\na mathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women’s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics.  The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father’s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell’s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore’s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach’s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré\nand Hermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by\nRamsey’s philosophical acumen and facility with German that he\ncommissioned Ramsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus into English – in the\nface of Moore’s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed – unfavourably – in Mind\n(1924). Ramsey nonetheless praised “the excellent appendix on\nC.S.  Peirce” and this lead him to study the volume of\nPeirce’s papers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which\nOgden had just published in his book series for Kegan Paul. During\nRamsey’s first year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for\nhim to meet Russell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend\nMoore’s lectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along\nin his second term to Moore’s lectures on “Incomplete\nSymbols and Logical Constructions”. Moore was later to recall\n“In the early twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course\nof my lectures.  I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein,\nthat he was much cleverer than I was” (1944, 35).  \nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the\neconomist. Ramsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles,\nthe secret debating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both\nactive members. Ramsey attended Keynes’ economics lectures and\nthey discussed Keynes’ Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey’s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes’ book for Ogden’s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1923). Ogden had written to Wittgenstein\nsuggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went to Puchberg,\nnear Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with Wittgenstein\nworking through the Tractatus with him. In 1924 Ramsey spent\n6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which time he met\nMoritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna Circle. He\nreturned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been appointed as a\nFellow In Mathematics at King’s College, where Keynes, also a\nFellow, had pushed for Ramsey’s appointment. At a meeting of the\nMoral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his future wife, Lettice\nBaker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters together. \nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing “The Foundations of\nMathematics”, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n“Universals”, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate éclat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting “Truth and Probability” (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey’s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and “Facts and Propositions” (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell’s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey’s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n‘pragmatist tendency’ (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, ‘A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation’ (1927b), later followed by his\n‘Mathematical Theory of Saving’ (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, ‘On a Problem of Formal Logic’\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n‘Ramsey’s Theorems’. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including ‘Theories’ and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with ‘Truth and\nProbability’, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey’s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.  \nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting\nKeynes in 1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929.\nHe was admitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus\nas his thesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during\nwhat was to be the last year of Ramsey’s life. Wittgenstein was\nlater to recall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick and\nhad promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap’s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy’s Hospital\nin London. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n‘His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to grope\nour way in the dark’ (1930, 216).   Mellor’s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978\n(see Other Internet Resources below), features the first hand\ntestimony of Braithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also\nSahlin 1990, 221–9, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey’s\nsister, Margaret Paul, provides a more personal account of\nRamsey’s life, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir\n(2012). Misak (2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey. \n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of\nthe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein\n1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden got all the credit and it has been known\nsince as the ‘Ogden translation’. Ramsey’s\ntranslation is usually considered to be superseded by the\nPears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one should not lose sight of\nthe fact that it was carefully scrutinized by Wittgenstein, who gave\nit his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a searching review of\nthe Tractatus (1923) in which he raised many serious\nobjections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One such\nobjections is the ‘colour-exclusion problem’ (1923, 473),\nagainst Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n“logically impossible” that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of\nthe Tractatus. Wittgenstein’s recognition in 1929 that\nhe could not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus. \n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would “try and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica’s] further development which I\nshall attempt” (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: “He is no good for my work” (Sahlin 1997,\n64). \n\nRamsey’s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica, partly in the hope\nthat his version would meet some of Wittgenstein’s criticisms of\nits axioms and treatment of identity, but also because of some further\ndefects he diagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its\ninability properly to account for the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177–178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica. \n\nRamsey drew a distinction between ‘logical’ and\n‘semantical’ paradoxes, with Russell’s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard’s or\nGrelling’s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP]\n183–184). According to him, the heart of the problem was in the\nway the theory of types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as\nunderstood in terms of the ‘vicious-circle principle’\n(‘whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection’): \nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n‘vicious-circle principle’, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187) \n\nRamsey rightly saw that a ‘simple’ theory of types\n(sometimes called ‘ramseyfied’) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n‘logical’ paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n‘branched’ or ‘ramified’ theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the ‘Axiom of\nReducibility’ according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187–192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.)  Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n‘predicative function’ and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe ‘vicious-circle principle’, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the ‘Axiom of Reducibility’ is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195–205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the ‘extensionality’ of\nmathematics without the need for a ‘ramified’ theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n“Bolshevik menace” of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219). \n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein’s critique (5.53–5.533)\nof the definition of identity in Principia Mathematica\n(∗13.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with F a predicative\nfunction): \n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while\nx = x is empty and showed how to get rid of\nidentity with an ‘exclusive’ reading of the variables\n(Hintikka 1956), (Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception\nof some propositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so\nread, and are thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the\naxiom of choice, which was then called the ‘Multiplicative\nAxiom’), Ramsey introduced ‘functions in extension’\n(including arbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated\nhere with the subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340–341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey\nare preserved ([NP] 342–346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey’s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], § 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.) \n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey’s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein’s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to\nthe Philosophical Investigations, he wrote: \nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his life.[1]\n(Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4]) \n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n“Wittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey”\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein’s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75–76), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4–5; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin\n1997). It is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas,\nand the following, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he\nreasoned along lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began\nshifting his views before 1929. \n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned\nwith Principia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in ‘The Foundations\nof Mathematics’, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein’s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as ‘logical products’ and\n‘sums’, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48–49). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence: \n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts. \n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02–6.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a “ridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics” (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem’s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl’s suggestion in\n‘Über die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik’ (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) – the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, – that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as ‘instructions for\njudgements’, while existence would be a ‘judgment\nabstract’, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97–98). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.  \n\nIn two of his last papers, ‘Principles of Finitist\nMathematics’ and ‘The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics’ ([NP] 197–200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl’s rules, to Skolem’s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n‘Principles of Finitist Mathematics’, he stated that his\nrules provide “all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists” ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n‘intuitionism’, the claim was inaccurate. \n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n‘Mathematical Logic’ (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928–29. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33–34) to ‘Theories’ (1929). According to his\nlater view, a ‘primary system’ of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n‘dictionary’, by a ‘secondary system’ of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112–115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz’s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell’s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl’s expression, as ‘rules\nfor judging’. \n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey’s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce’s\nChance, Love and Logic (Peirce 1923). In ‘Fact and\nPropositions’ (1925) he had already written: “The essence\nof pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would\nlead, or, more vaguely still, by its possible causes and\neffects” (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms part of what Nils-Eric\nSahlin called ‘British Pragmatism’ (Sahlin 1997, 65;\nMarion 2012), and Cheryl Misak ‘Cambridge Pragmatism’\n(Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie logical form with\ncausal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation ¬ p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on ‘Universals’ (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid ‘negative\nfacts’.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: “Feeling belief towards ‘For\nall \\(x\\), \\(fx\\)’ has certain causal properties which\nwe call its expressing agreement only with the possibility that all\nthe values of \\(fx\\) are true” (1927a, [PP] 49). By\n1928–1929, however, his pragmatism finally led him to abandon\nthis suggestion. \n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein’s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas “an important advance” (1923, 469), but he\nassumed the opposite in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1928). In\na passage where he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2),\nhe argued that the human mind “works essentially according to\ngeneral rules or habits” (1926a, [PP] 90): \nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91) \n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: “given a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth” (1926a, [PP] 92). \n\nIn ‘General Propositions and Causality’ (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce’s idea that beliefs “guide our\nactions” (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a “map\nby which we steer” (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very\nreason that he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: “if we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts” (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of ‘variable hypotheticals’ as\nforming the “system with which the speaker meets the\nfuture” and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl: \nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n‘If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a\n\\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated but it can be disagreed with by one who does\nnot adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149) \n… when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159) \n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na ‘finitist’ nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n“So too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n‘infinite collection’ is really nonsense” (1929b,\n[PP] 160). \n\nRamsey’s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl’s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein’s notion of\n‘hypothesis’ had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in\nthe Tractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a “law for forming expectations” (Wittgenstein [PR],\n§228). \n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions.  Ramsey’s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers “Universals” (1925b) and\n“Facts and Propositions” (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10). \nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. “Universals” provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell\nback. According to Russell, “The influence of language on\nphilosophy has, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If\nwe are not to be misled by this influence it is necessary to become\nconscious of it and to ask how far it is legitimate” (Russell\n1924, 330). Russell was specifically concerned that the\nsubject-predicate form common to Indo-European languages had misled\nWestern philosophers, conditioning them to take for granted a\nsubstance-attribute ontology whilst being blind to the existence of\nrelations. Russell proposed to remedy the situation by introducing\nalongside the category of particulars, a broader category of\nuniversals which subsumed both (monadic) attributes and (polyadic)\nrelations. But, in “Universals”, Ramsey argued that\nRussell had not gone far enough, because the particular-universal\ndistinction itself was just a further shadow cast by language. Ramsey\nwrote, “nearly all philosophers, including Mr Russell himself\nhave been misled by language in a far more far-reaching way than\nthat”, i.e. more far-reaching than being led merely to deny the\nexistence of relations, because “the whole theory of particulars\nand universals is due to mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of\nreality, what is merely a characteristic of language” (1925b,\n405). But Ramsey wasn’t aiming to replace the\nparticular-universal distinction with an alternative distinction of\nhis own. Instead he aimed to inculcate in his reader a studied\nindifference, which meant withholding judgment, at least a priori,\nabout the forms or categories of atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had\ndone in the\nTractatus. \n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted “Universals” to arguing it isn’t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn’t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So “Universals” is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is. \n\nRamsey begins ‘Universals’ with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192–202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey’s main\nlines of argument in “Universals”). To persuade us there are serious\nissues to engage here, Ramsey compared \n and,  Whilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree\nthat they say the same about what’s out there even though they\ndiffer in their surface forms. He reflected, ‘Now of one these\nsentences ‘Socrates’ is the subject, of the other\n‘wisdom’; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express\nour proposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language’\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate distinction\nisn’t a semantic or representational distinction at all, hence\nnot in the business of marking a division of things, but rather a\ndistinction which we employ to communicate to conversational partners\nthe focus of our discussion: “If the centre of our interest is\nSocrates we say ‘Socrates is wise’, if we are discussing\nwisdom we may say ‘wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates’; but\nwhichever we say we mean the same thing”. \n\nRamsey’s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same assertion–as\nindeed many of his critics have supposed. What they miss is that to be\nfit for purpose, Ramsey’s argument only had to be strong enough\nto make us seriously entertain the possibility that the\nsubject-predicate distinction doesn’t serve a representational\nfunction, because that’s enough to throw doubt upon the procedure\nof classifying things on the basis of the subject-predicate\ndistinction, hence strong enough to make it evident that “the\nquestion requires a new examination” (1925b, 405). \n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474–5; 1975, 143–4]\nand Dummett [1973, 63–4] have all criticised Ramsey’s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not – although see Anscombe’s\n‘Retractation’ [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40–1] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197–9], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151–2] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey’s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207–10] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey’s challenge.) \n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates –\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He\nargues, reductio ad absurdum, that they don’t. He\nassumes that if two analyses of a proposition invoke different\nconstituents then they are analyses of different\npropositions. Absurdity results when this assumption is combined with\nthe claim that complex predicates are terms for complex universals.\nThis is because more than one complex predicate may be isolated in a\nsentence of the form ‘aRb’ – predicates\nthat may be represented by ‘xRb’,\n‘aRy’ and‘xRy’. If these\npredicates are terms for different universals, then the sentence\n‘aRb’ expresses no less than three propositions.\nThe propositions are distinct because they correspond to the three\ndifferent collections of constituents: (i) xRb, a,\n(ii) aRx, b, and\n(iii) xRy, a, b. But this is absurd because\n‘aRb’ says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, “so the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology” (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn’t spell out, that it’s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too – otherwise particulars would be distinguished from\nuniversals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of Ramsey’s\nargument against complex universals see Oliver 1992; Mellor 1992;\nand MacBride 2005a, 86-94; 2018, 210–220.) \n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject\nand predicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the form\nof the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it’s natural\nto feel that an adjective like ‘wise’ is incomplete in a\nmanner that ‘Socrates’ is not. But, Ramsey argued,\npredicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as ordinary\nlanguage users we overlook relevant data: we routinely distinguish wide\nfrom narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we don’t do the same\nfor subjects even though the same distinction can be drawn for them.\nRamsey cites Russell’s theory of descriptions as the inspiration for\nthe wide-narrow scope distinction, which Ramsey elaborates in terms of\na distinction between more and less encompassing ranges of propositions\nin which an expression figures. Ramsey concludes that to be a\nsubstantive (or adjective) “is not an objective but a subjective\nproperty, in the sense that it depends not indeed on any one mind but\non the common elements in all men’s minds and purposes” (1925b,\n413).  \n\nSince the difference between ‘Socrates’ and\n‘wise’ turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the ‘biassed interest’ of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(xRa ∨ xSb) and atomic expressions which\ndon’t (‘f’ in ‘fa’), because\nthey are only interested in the extensional matter whether these\nexpressions are true or false of the same things. But to avoid\n‘useless complication’ mathematicians treat the latter\nterms as requiring variables for their representation too\n(‘fx’), hence producing the appearance that there\nis some class of atomic terms which are incomplete because they\nrequire variables (1925b, 414–5). But, Ramsey continued, if it\nwere not for the biased interests of the mathematician, we would allow\n‘f’ to stand alone, so removing the appearance of an\nespecially incomplete class of atomic terms. \n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of atomic\nfacts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n“Universals and ‘the Method of Analysis’”\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we cannot\nknow a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet know\nthem a posteriori: “When I wrote my article I was sure\nthat it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by R1(x),\nR2(x,y),\nR3(x,y,z)…. This\nI admit may be found to be the case, but no one can as yet be certain\nwhat atomic propositions there are, it cannot be positively asserted;\nand there is no strong presumption in its favour, for I think that the\nargument of my article establishes that nothing of the sort can be\nknown a priori” (1926b, 31) (see Methven 2018 for\ndiscussion of the relationship between Ramsey 1925b and 1926b). \n\nRamsey’s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey’s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In “Facts and\nPropositions” (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression ‘the fact that…’\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155–7). Indeed, he claimed, ‘the fact\nthat…’ disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):  \nis no different from \n\nBy ‘is no different from’ (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like “semantically equivalent”. So his\nargument is that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and\nbecause (3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it\nfollows that (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither. \n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts.  Since even statements like (3.3) don’t commit us to facts,\nbecause they’re just paraphrases of statements like (3.4), we\ncannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at all. To\ntranspose a remark of Ramsey’s from another context, if you\ncan’t say that facts exist, you can’t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey’s ‘redundancy theory of\nfacts’, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which ‘a has\nR to b is true’ says the same as ‘a\nhas R to b’).  \nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely ‘the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as “that Caesar died\nin his bed” which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood’ (1927a, 153–4). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn’t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition aRb in terms of R’s holdings\nbetween a and b, which is difficult to understand if\nthe proposition is false since then R doesn’t hold\nbetween a and b. Ramsey continued to find objective\nfalsehoods incredible in his later manuscript ‘On Truth’:\n‘it is only the hardiest verbalists who can persuade themselves\n‘that the earth is flat’ is the name of something\nreal’ ([OT] 85). \n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, ‘that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged’ (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they’re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey’s\nown views about truth and belief which don’t require them. In\n‘Facts and Propositions’ Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein’s picture theory according to which a subject\n‘will believe that aRb by having names for a, R, and b connected\nin his mind and accompanied by a feeling of belief’ (1927a, 160)\nbut Ramsey was already pushing in more radical, pragmatist direction\nwhich emphasised the significance of action for understanding the\nnotion of belief, hence shifting attention further away from an\nontology of facts and propositions. (See the section on Belief and\nTruth.) \n\nIt is Ramsey’s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey’s\n“Universals” bore a significant influence on\nRussell’s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey’s “Universals” in historical context, arguing\nthat “Universals” should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between “Universals”\nand Ramsey’s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey’s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view. \nRamsey’s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in\nhis papers ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), ‘Facts\nand Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n‘Universals of Law and of Fact’ (1928b) and ‘General\nPropositions and Causality’ (1929b). \n\nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ Ramsey presents his renowned\nview on the nature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the\ninaugural work of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. The present section, nevertheless, focuses on\nhis semantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities; thus the analysis of partial belief developed in\n‘Truth and Probability’ will be left aside. \n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a)\nand also in ‘Fact and Propositions’ (1927a). In\n‘Truth and Probability’ he explains his approach to\nrationality as ‘a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by\nwhether they work’ (1926a, [PP] 93–94). In ‘Facts\nand Propositions’, in contrast, the issue is meaning: ‘The\nessence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a\nsentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead’ (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, for Russell at that time, the meaning of a word\nwas its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell’s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185–187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey’s pragmatist views, since many themes in Peirce’s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey’s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185–6). Recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey’s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157). \n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. ‘Belief’, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining\nwords. Chickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar,\ndue to systematically connecting it with disagreeable past\nexperiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey’s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce’s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005,  185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich ‘the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey’s] most influential writings on this\ntopic’ (Hookway 2005, 186). \n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey’s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and ‘consciously asserted and denied’\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal belief, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous. \n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal’s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of some relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the\ncaterpillar and the property of being poisonous, with which the mental\nfactor stands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words,\non the other hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those\nwords or symbols ‘spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether’. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as ‘aRb’,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n‘a’, ‘R’ and\n‘b’ in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one’s mind. By\n‘feeling’ Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as ‘“specific quality” or\n“act of assertion” and “act of denial”’\n(loc. cit., n. 2). \n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no\nrole in the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in ‘Truth and Probability’: \n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but probably the\ndefinitive reason has to do with the fact that our most unshakable\nbeliefs come without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002,\n7). As Ramsey puts it: ‘[N]o one feels strongly about things he\ntakes for granted’ (loc. cit.). At this point the similarities\nwith the view that Wittgenstein would hold in his pragmatist period\nare evident (for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nsee §2 above). \n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as ‘not’, ‘and’ and\n‘or’ are more complex. In analyzing them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Ramsey, like\nWittgenstein, thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of ‘not’ and ‘or’ are\ndetermined by the agents’ attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are ‘equivalent occurrences’ (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e.  they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002,\n24). \n\nA specific difficulty of analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time. While considering atomic sentences\none by one, Ramsey says, an agent only needs to consider two mutually\nexclusive feelings, those of full belief and full disbelief. The\n‘intermediate attitudes of partial belief’, which he\nproposes to ‘leave to the theory of probability’ (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in ‘Truth and Probability’. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When\nn atomic sentences are at play, there are\n2n possible combinations of fully believing and\nfully disbelieving. Thus, ‘the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities’ (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n‘a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees’ (op. cit., 47). \n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs are general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words ‘all’ and\n‘some’. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a) and ‘Universals\nof Law and Fact’ (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990,  76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The\nonly difference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the\none hand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was\nthat the arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of\nlaw. One might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n‘our knowledge as a deductive system’ (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic. \n\nThe second view appears in ‘General Propositions and\nCausality’ (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: ‘A belief of the primary\nsort’, i.e. one without quantifiers, ‘is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer’ (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs –\nunderstood as codifying general inferences – should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is ‘no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts’ (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus ‘rules for action or attitudes’\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express ‘an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make’ (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey’s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein’s view of laws as rules of\ninference. \n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, ‘variable\nhypotheticals’ as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at all.\nWith respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared to\nexplicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: ‘[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions’ (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude they\nexpress is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs Ramsey\ncharacterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e. the\nendorsement of a sentence that expresses it – ‘all men are\nmortal’, for instance – and (ii) ‘a habit of singular\nbelief’ (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are connected by the\npsychological law that gives the meaning of ‘all’ (1929b,\n[PP] 149). \n\nThe posthumously-published paper ‘The Nature of Truth’\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’ (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey’s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as ‘an obvious\nfact’ (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n‘there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle’ (1927a, [PP] 38). \n\nIn ‘The Nature of Truth’ Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n‘something or other is so-and-so’ (1929c, 7ff). He\ncalls this ‘so-and-so’ the ‘propositional\nreference’ (loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of\npropositional individuation, in the sense that if ‘two men both\nbelieve that the earth is flat we say they have the same belief’\n(loc. cit.).  Individuating beliefs by their propositional references\nmight seem at odds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes\nand effects that Ramsey used in ‘Facts and\nPropositions’. But this superficial tension is defused if\npropositional references, which are not linguistic but conceptual, are\nindividuated by their consequences (which include actions). Other\nmental states – doubts, desires, fears, regrets, etc. – have\npropositional references too, but only beliefs have ‘affirmative\nor assertive character’ (1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend\nthe ordinary meaning of the term ‘belief’ to cover mental\nstates with any degree of assertive force – from mere conjecture\nto full certainty – and propositional content. The contents of\nbeliefs, in this extended sense, are the bearers of truth:\n‘Truth and falsity are ascribed primarily to\npropositions’, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he substitutes\n‘proposition’ with ‘propositional reference’\n(1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to philosophical\nprecaution than any substantial change in view. \n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is ‘perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress’ (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey’s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56–59; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005,\n56–58), a kind of minimalism or deflationism about truth\nsimilar to the views put forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin\n1990,  56), and later on by Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway\n2005, 57), Field and Horwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106). \n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey’s view than what the\nlabel ‘redundancy’ suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in ‘that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or identified by description, as in ‘what she\nsaid’. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in ‘It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered’, or to a description, as in ‘what she says is\ntrue’. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: ‘it is evident that\n“It is true that Caesar was murdered” means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and “It is false that Caesar was\nmurdered” means that Caesar was not murdered’ (1927a, [PP],\n38–9). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions of the\nsecond kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be dispensed with:\n‘In the second case in which the proposition is described and not\ngiven explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords “true” and “false”’ (loc.\ncit.). \n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish: \n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional\nvariables – ‘p’, ‘q’,\netc., ranging over the set of declarative sentences – and\npropositional quantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes\nand its role is taken over by propositional variables and\nquantifiers. The semi-formal sentences (4.1*)–(4.3*) are\ntranslations of (4.1)–(4.3) into English*: \n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is\nredundant in English*, but not that it is redundant in\nEnglish. \n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in ‘The Nature of\nTruth’ is: ‘A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p’ (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable ‘p’\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the objective\nfactor. This definition is expressed in English*, since ordinary\nEnglish does not have the necessary resources: \n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word “true” wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. […]\n“that” and “what” even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often “is true” and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render “what he believed is true” by “if\np was what he believed, p” (1929c, [OT] 10, his\nemphasis). \n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFrápolli 2005a, 113–138; 2013, 61ff). \n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)–(4.3) as\n(4.1*)–(4.3*).  The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)–(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed.  Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables ‘p’ and\n‘q’ cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in ‘and p’ and ‘then\nq’ would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey’s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n‘p’ and ‘q’, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.). \n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective correspondence\nto the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d, 36). Dokic and\nEngel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist about truth\nconditions and also about truth, but this realism was modulated by his\npragmatism: ‘his kind of realism is distinct from the kind of\nrealism which underlies a full-blown correspondence theory of truth. It\nis a form of pragmatic realism, which associates truth to\nbeliefs-habits and to actions.’ Thus, Ramsey’s take on\ntruth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist view of\ntruth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is realist\nabout truth conditions, and also includes some of the technical\napparatus that prosentential theories developed later on (see Williams\n1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Frápolli 2013). \nIn “General Propositions and Causality” (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote: \n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)” we need to turn to his earlier essay “Truth\nand Probability” (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157).  (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: “The\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not … be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics”\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.)  Here he introduces a\n“very useful new idea – ‘the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)’” (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic laws\nis: \n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey’s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)” with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements. \n\nExplaining “degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, Ramsey\nsays “It roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true”\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a\nconditional degree of belief is to a conditional\nbet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to an unconditional\nbet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely and by\nhow much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)?  For a bet on \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), you\nask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much, \\(p \\:\\&\\:\nq\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\) much\nmore likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have a high degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the hypothesis or\nsupposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that \\(q\\). \n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n“degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)”, which will be\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe main business of “General Propositions and Causality”\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals – and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that “variable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging ‘If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)’. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it” (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says “If I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache” and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites: \n\nLater, with the same example, “it is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree of\nbelief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view” (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage: \nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what\nwill happen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the\nform ‘If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, this\ncan be properly regarded as a material implication or disjunction\n‘Either not \\(p\\), or \\(q\\)’. But it differs, of\ncourse from any ordinary disjunction in that one of its members is not\nsomething of which we are trying to discover the truth, but something\nwithin our power to make true or false. … \nBesides definite answers ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result’, we\noften get ones ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result’ or\n‘\\(q\\) would probably result’. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in ‘Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)’, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246) \n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing “\\(\\bel\\)”\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A) \\neq\n0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\) The\nonly other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so when\n\\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second, it is\nclear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree of\nbelief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above, the\nright-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of a\nconjunction, rather than the other way round. \n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues: \n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the ‘subtle syntactic\nvariations’. For instance, “If he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)”\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn’t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn’t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey’s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented. \n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of “conditional events” or “tri-events”\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)”: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\),\nvoid if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets: won\nif \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off if \\(\\neg\np\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other connectives when\napplied to conditionals, and claims that the probability of a\n“tri-event” is the probability of its truth given that it\nhas a truth value – which, in the case of “if \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)” is just the probability of \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). The results\nfor more complex sentences are controversial, but there has been a\nfair amount of work in this tradition, much of it summarised by Peter\nMilne (1997). It is interesting that this second exposition of\nprobability as degree of belief also connected conditional degree of\nbelief to ordinary conditional judgements, and also recognised that\nthe latter could not then be treated as ordinary propositions. \nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n− the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A\n\\to B\\). But here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low.  (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n  indicative conditionals, \nfor examples and more details). \nRobert Stalnaker’s first paper on the subject, “A\nTheory of Conditionals”, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to\nRamsey. He also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that\nhe will devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the\ntheory. This is his “Probability and Conditionals” (1970),\nand its abstract announces that “conditional propositions are\nintroduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the\nconditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent”.\nThen David Lewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the\nprobability of whose truth can be systematically equated with the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) – a result\nwhich Ramsey and de Finetti appear to have foreseen. \n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams’s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker’s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48–9). \n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey’s suggestion thus: “add the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about the\nconditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under this\ncondition, in the consequent” (1968, 43). \n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter: \nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent); finally,\nconsider whether the consequent is then true. \n… Now we have found an answer to the question, “How do\nwe decide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?”\nthe problem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just what\nwe need to make this transition, since a possible world is the analogue\nof a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of truth\nconditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the account\nthat I shall propose: \nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world.  “If A, then\nB” is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible\nworld. (44–45, italics original) \nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born. \nA consequence of Stalnaker’s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey’s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase “the\nRamsey Test” was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: “Accept ‘if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if and only if the minimum revision of your system\nof beliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting\n\\(B\\)” (1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter Gärdenfors\n(1986, 81) says the same. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says “In\nmodern studies of belief dynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to\n‘presume … some method of revising states of\nbelief’ [quoting Gärdenfors]. Thus ‘If \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\)’ is taken to be believed if and only if\n\\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result from\nrevising the present belief state by \\(p\\)” (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says “Ramsey’s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional ‘If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)’ if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were\nto add \\(A\\) to one’s stock of beliefs” (1995,\n47). \n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey’s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces “degree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)”, Ramsey writes: \n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic\nnotion, not a diachronic one. It is a feature of one’s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one’s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information. \n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn’t now believe “If I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God”! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one black.\nMy conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given that I\npick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would bet on\nRed given King. But if I do pick a king, I won’t have a degree\nof belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis’s “If Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we’ll never find out”. This is something he\nbelieves. But if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then\nbelieve the consequent! As Lewis says, “It might be no easy thing\nto judge what would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of\nthe variety of ways that something might be learned” (1986,\n156). He concludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but\nfallible guide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if\nyou learned \\(A\\). Edgington’s (1995) reply to Read,\n§1, discusses the disparity between what Ramsey himself said,\nand much that goes under the name “the Ramsey Test”. In\nthe famous footnote, Ramsey speaks of people “adding \\(p\\)\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge” – that\nis, supposing that \\(p\\). The consequences of doing so for\none’s conditional beliefs, is not invariably equivalent to the\nconsequences of coming to believe \\(p\\), for one’s\nunconditional beliefs. \n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed – of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences). \nIn ‘Truth and Probability’ (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\nAccording to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual’s subjective degrees\nof confidence, such that two individuals could assign different\nprobabilities to the same proposition even given the same evidence.\nFirst written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time of its\npublication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey’s death), ‘Truth\nand Probability’ was not very widely discussed until after the\npublication of Savage’s The Foundations of Statistics\n(1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence. Many of the key\nideas and arguments original to the essay have reappeared in later\nfoundational works in the subjectivist tradition (e.g., de Finetti\n1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section outlines some of\nRamsey’s major contributions to this tradition. \nRamsey’s central goal in ‘Truth and Probability’ is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a ‘logic of\npartial belief’ – that is, the laws specify general\nnecessary conditions on any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a\nmanner analogous to how the laws of classical logic might be taken to\ngenerate necessary conditions on any consistent set of full beliefs.\nThe argument for this claim is grounded in Ramsey’s novel\napproach to probability, namely subjectivism. The essay begins,\nhowever, with a discussion of the two major approaches to\nunderstanding probabilities at the time in Cambridge: frequentism, and\na version of the logical interpretation put forward by the economist\nJohn Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on Probability (1921). \nRegarding frequentism – according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials – Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey’s\npurposes. (We’ll return to the role of frequencies in\nRamsey’s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes’ theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions – roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes’ assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition – to which Ramsey\nobjects: \n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them… moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161) \nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n‘This is red’ and ‘That is blue’), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n‘we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging’ (1926a, [FM] 162). \nHaving dismissed Keynes’ theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat: \n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169) \nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in ‘Truth and\nProbability,’ in ‘Facts and Propositions’ (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue: \nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken’s behaviour…  Thus any\nset of actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)…  (1927a,\n[FM] 144) \nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs – that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they’re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices. \nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n‘the degree of a belief… has no precise meaning\nunless we specify more exactly how it is to be measured’ (1926a,\n[FM] 167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a\nprocedure for the measurement of partial belief, which includes as a\npart also the measurement of utilities. The procedure takes as input\nthe subject’s preferences (as revealed by her choices) over \nand it outputs precise numerical representations of her partial\nbeliefs and utilities. It can be roughly summarised as follows: \nElicit Preferences:\nElicit the subject’s preferences by offering her a sequence of\nchoices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. \nDetermine Utilities:\nAssuming the subject is an expected utility maximiser, use her\npreferences to determine her numerical utilities. \nDefine Beliefs:\nDefine (a) the subject’s degree of belief towards \\(p\\) in terms\nof her utilities for binary gambles involving \\(p\\), and (b) her\ndegree of belief towards \\(p\\) given \\(q\\) using her utilities for\nbinary and ternary gambles involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). \nThe following paragraphs will briefly discuss these three steps. More\nthorough treatments of Ramsey’s procedure can be found in\n(Sahlin 1990), (Bradley 2001), and (Elliott 2017). \nRegarding the first step, Ramsey says: \n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world… Suppose next that the\nsubject is capable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief\nin different propositions by making him offers of the following kind.\nWould you rather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] if \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is\nfalse? (1926a, [FM] 177) \nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they ‘had the\npower of the Almighty’, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158–60;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255–6; Bradley 2001, §3.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). \nMore prosaically, a measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn’t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured – placing a cold thermometer\ninto a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for example, but for\nmost purposes this effect is negligible. The objection at hand is\ntherefore that merely having the subject come to believe that\nthey have some choice over these worlds and gambles will generally\ninvolve a substantial change to their beliefs – enough to\nundermine the accuracy of Ramsey’s procedure. For example, the\nprocess might alter the subject’s beliefs regarding the claim\n‘Experimenters have the capacity to make it the case that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and \\(\\omega_2\\) obtains\notherwise’, with potentially many ripple on effects through to\nher other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note of a similar\nproblem for an alternative gambling-based measurement procedure\n(1926a, [FM] 170), but for unknown reasons does not discuss the worry\nas it arises for his own proposal. \nThe second step of Ramsey’s procedure is the most complicated,\nand it requires a suite of background assumptions about the partial\nbeliefs, utilities, and preferences of the subject. In his words, \nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person’s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions.\n(1926a, [FM] 174) \nRamsey’s point here is that, given some general assumptions, it\nwill be possible – at least sometimes – to specify\nexactly what a subject’s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey’s statement of the ‘general psychological\ntheory’ in the quoted passage underspecifies the assumptions he\nimplicitly relies on to justify his procedure. We can precisify\nmatters on his behalf, and assume that for the subject in\nquestion, \nWhile these assumptions clearly involve some degree of idealisation,\nRamsey justifies them by noting that the development of any\nmeasurement process ‘cannot be accomplished without introducing\na certain amount of hypothesis or fiction’ (1926a, [FM] 168),\nand that the assumptions come close enough to the truth to render them\nstill useful (1926a, [FM] 173). \nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey’s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas: \nEthical Neutrality:\n\\(p\\) is ethically neutral for a subject iff, for all worlds\n\\(\\omega\\) consistent with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is\nindifferent between \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp\n\\neg{p}\\). \nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey is ultimately able to construct a definition (in terms of\npreferences over gambles) for when the difference in utility\nbetween two worlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[4] \nThis provides Ramsey with the resources needed to sketch a\nrepresentation theorem, which forms the centrepiece of his\npaper. According to this theorem, the subject’s preferences will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions only if there exists at\nleast one function, \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), such that the difference in\nutility between \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as\nthat between \\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) if and only if \nMoreover, this function \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is unique up to positive\nlinear transformation – that is, for any other function\n\\(\\mathcal{U}^*\\) with the same property, \nfor some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\). Given\nRamsey’s background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3), these two points\ntogether entail that the subject’s preferences satisfy\nRamsey’s conditions on preferences only if \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is\nthe function that represents her utilities on an interval scale. Or,\nto put the point more simply: if the subject’s\npreferences satisfy Ramsey’s conditions, then they\ncontain enough information to determine her utilities exactly. \nIncluded amongst Ramsey’s axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive; as well\nas less obvious conditions, e.g., that for every pair of worlds\n\\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there’s a \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility\nis exactly halfway between that of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).\nThere has been very little empirical investigation into Ramsey’s\naxioms, primarily due to the widespread opinion that his\nrepresentation result has been superseded by the results of Savage\n(1954) and later decision theorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981).\nHowever, Ramsey’s assumption that there exists an ethically\nneutral proposition (needed for the definition of equal differences in\nutility to make sense) has attracted substantial critical discussion.\nRamsey provides his readers with no reasons to believe that even one\nethically neutral proposition exists, still less that their existence\nis a precondition for the consistency of partial beliefs. For\ndiscussion, see (Sobel 1998), (Bradley 2001), (Eriksson &\nHájek 2007), and (Elliott 2017).  \nThe third and final stage of Ramsey’s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject’s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief: \nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’], we can define the subject’s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179) \nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition makes sense in\nlight of the background assumptions (6.1)–(6.3) above: the world\n\\(\\omega_2\\) has the same utility as the gamble ‘\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise’ just in case \nWhere \\(\\mathcal{U}(\\omega_1) \\neq \\mathcal{U}(\\omega_3)\\), this\nequality can be rearranged to give a definition of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(p)\\): \nAs Ramsey notes, \nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179–80) \nRamsey’s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n‘laws of probability’ follow: \nThese four conditions then imply that \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) satisfies\nfinite additivity: \nRamsey goes on to say: \nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options… (1926a, [FM] 182) \nIn this passage we find an early version of a representation theorem\nargument for probabilistic norms on partial belief and for expected\nutility theory, of the kind later made popular by Savage. (See also\nSkyrms 1987, and the entry on\n normative theories \n of rational choice: expected utility, §2.2). It is dubious,\n however, that Ramsey\nreally proved that the stated laws must be true of any consistent set\nof partial beliefs. Amongst the axioms of his representation theorem\nfor utilities are several non-necessary conditions, as well as\nconditions (like those regarding the ethically neutral proposition)\nwhich are not plausible as conditions of consistency on\npreferences. More importantly, Ramsey’s ‘proof’ is\ngrounded in strong theoretical assumptions about the connection\nbetween degrees of belief and preferences, which Ramsey admits are\nidealizations. \nIn the same paragraph, Ramsey states that: \nIf anyone’s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182) \nThe reasoning behind the last claim is never made explicit, though it\nis evident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known\nas a Dutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937;\nsee entry the on \n Dutch book arguments). \nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable. He proposes a condition of\ncalibration, or fit with known frequencies: \nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it… And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195) \nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\nInterpretations of Probability, §3.3.4, for more discussion. \nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey’s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993; for criticisms of the approach, see Joyce\n1999, §1.3; Eriksson & Hájek 2007.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology today, the default or orthodox\nway to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of choices, along\nessentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward. \n\nRamsey’s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between (in\nmodern terminology) laws of nature and accidental generalizations. \nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, §2; 1929b, [FM]\n237–38) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152–53) and thus normal\npropositions. In “Universals of Law and Fact”, Ramsey\n(1928b, §12) considers laws of nature to be propositions with a\nspecial status: Thus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (§16).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], §3.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the “Best System” account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, §2). “General Propositions and Causality”, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called ‘variable hypotheticals’) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238). Rather (1929b, [FM] 241): \nThus variable hypotheticals “form the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future” in that “we trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance” exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable\nhypothetical. Simplicity may still play a role, but not as\nconstitutive of laws (as in the earlier, Best System account), rather\nonly as epistemic justification for adopting a rule of judgment\n(1929b, [FM] 242). This allows again for the non-arbitrariness if not\nuniqueness of laws. Unknown laws are those rules of judgment whose\nadoption is justified by unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243–45). In both papers, ‘if … then …’ statements,\ncalled ‘conditionals’, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, §15; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see §5 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent. \nRamsey’s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, §2), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252–53; 254–55, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids “real\nconnections of universals” and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, §15) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245–46). \nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions: \nIn his paper “Theories” (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n‘primary system’. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called ‘secondary system’. The paper is\nthoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content of theories\nconsists only of their primary implications. This is made clear in a\ncomment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229, footnote\nremoved; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260): \nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning. \nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not\ncontain a parameter. \nThe “parameters” here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics\nthat their use does not entail any ontological commitment: To investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary\nsystem, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 215–19) provides a primary system\nfor an agent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or\nnothing. In the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that\ndescribes the movement of the agent among three locations and the\nsometimes changing color of the locations. A dictionary defines the\nprimary terms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent\nsees blue if and only if situated at a blue location with open\neyes. Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 217–19) shows that all the theory’s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to “Russell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap” (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system: The qualifier “simple” is needed to exclude the\nfollowing case: Assume that all the models of the theory and the\ndictionary are finite and all objects have names in the primary\nsystem.  Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each term \\(T_j\\) of the\nsecondary system is co-extensional with a formula \\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in\nthe primary system. If furthermore each model is named by a sentential\nconstant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can define each term\n\\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the material implications\n\\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all models \\(M_i\\)\n(220–21).  However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230) argues, apart from\nbeing cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms actually hinder\nscientific development because they require conceptual decisions based\non fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf. Braithwaite\n1953, 52–76). This criticism was later rediscovered by Carnap\n(1936, 449). To avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a\nway of applying a theory without defining the secondary terms: \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states “There are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms”. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for ‘theory’), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for ‘correspondence rules’), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the ‘Ramsey\nsentence’ \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as ‘Ramseyfication’ or\n‘Ramsification’. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote “Theories”, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256).  Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342–43). Since all of \\(TC\\)’s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344–47). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n“at two removes” from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260). \nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey’s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of\n\\(x\\). ‘Blue’ (\\(B\\)), ‘red’ (\\(R\\)), and\n‘open eyes’ (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The\ncorrespondence rules define the observational terms ‘perceiving\nblue’ as ‘being at a blue location with open eyes’,\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly\n‘perceiving red’ \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge\nOx)\\). The Ramsey sentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\). While sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special case in which\naxioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey sentence is of\nsecond order. In this case, the class of models of the observational first-order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper superset of the class of models\nof \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at least since 1941 as the difference\nbetween elementary and pseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207,\n260) and is regularly rediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011,\n179). It entails that \\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though\nall the first order implications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically,\n\\(TC\\) may only have tautological observational implications even\nthough the Ramsey sentence is not logically true; this situation is\none version of the distinction between syntactic and semantic\nconservativeness known from definition theory (Gupta 2015, §2.3;\nPrzełęcki 1969, 52–53). \nCarnap (1963, §24.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, §3.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, §4.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, §4.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, §2.3). \nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary terms\nif and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the secondary\nterms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Przełęcki 1969,\nch. 6; Andreas 2017, §4.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, §2.2.1; Stegmüller 1976, 88–89). Maxwell (1970,\n186–88) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, §3.2). \nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though\ntwo ideas he introduced in his more philosophical papers\n(1926a, 1929b), also led eventually to new lines\nof mathematical research. Each of these three contributions has proved\nseminal and they are now rightly associated with his name. \nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n“Truth and Probability” (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio  \n when, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \nand the option \nare equally preferable. \nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain\nbelief) “This amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief\nin \\(p\\) by the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet\nbeing conducted in terms of differences of value as defined”. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n“old-established” idea of measuring one’s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate\nfurther on this connection it is implicit in the derivations that\nfollow that Ramsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that\nfor any option \\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative),\n\\(\\xi\\) for certain is equivalent to: \nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the options: \nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n“diminishing marginal utility”.) \nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given \\(q\\),\nfor which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a subject’s\ndegrees of belief are consistent in the sense of obeying these Laws of\nPreference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply states, do not allow a\n[Dutch] book to be made against him by which he would lose in any\nevent) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the “fundamental laws of\nprobable belief (degrees of belief between 0 and 1)”, which he\ngives as: \nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183): \nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you. \nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955). \nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey’s\nwriting. \nUnaware of Ramsey’s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject’s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such a\nsubject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would later\nbecome know as Kolmogorov’s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone. \nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016. \nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical\npaper General Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM]\n247): \nIf two people are arguing ‘If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?’ and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically\nto their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\nso that in a sense ‘If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)’ and\n‘If \\(p\\), not \\(q\\)‘ are contradictories. \nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such\nas if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent’s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\). \nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey’s Test: \nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q\n\\in K*p\\) \nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as\na test of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely. \nNot surprisingly then Ramsey’s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence. \nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey’s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with Gärdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey’s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey’s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to: \nRamsey Test (RT):\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K * p\\)\n \nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\). \nRamsey’s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities. \nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems,\nrespectively. They can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet’s\nmuch earlier Schubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole\nPrinciple (1832). \nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform  \n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley’s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977). \nThis result of Ramsey’s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Schönfinkel (1928) and solves the\nprospective Spectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of\nthe above form, now referred to as the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey\nClass. That is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the\nclass of cardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be\nsatisfied. As a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if\na sentence in this class is satisfiable in\nsome structure. However it seems clear from the accompanying\ndiscussion that Ramsey was aware that there was also a direct and\nsimple proof of this fact. \nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey’s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to\nHilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem though it is possible\nthat the aim he actually had in mind was the related Spectrum\nProblem. Hilbert’s goal was later shown to be not achievable by\nthe undecidability results of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently\nAlan Turing (1937). In fact Ramsey’s positive contribution\nturned out to be the best possible in the sense that decidability\nfails once the order of the blocks of existential and universal\nquantifiers is reversed, see Kalmár & Surányi\n1950, and Mortimer 1975. \nRamsey’s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erdős and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNešetřil & Rödl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990. \nRamsey’s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC. \nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell’s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.","contact.mail":"sebastian.lutz@gmx.net","contact.domain":"gmx.net"}]
