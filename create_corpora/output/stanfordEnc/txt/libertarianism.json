Thus,\nlibertarians insist that justice poses stringent limits to coercion.\nWhile people can be justifiably forced to do certain things (most\nobviously, to refrain from violating the rights of others) they cannot\nbe coerced to serve the overall good of society, or even their own\npersonal good. As a result, libertarians endorse strong rights to\nindividual liberty and private property; defend civil liberties like\nequal rights for homosexuals; endorse drug decriminalization, open\nborders, and oppose most military interventions.\n\n\nLibertarian positions are most controversial in the realm of\ndistributive justice. In this context, libertarians typically endorse\nsomething like a free-market economy: an economic order based on\nprivate property and voluntary market relationships among agents.\nLibertarians usually see the kind of large-scale, coercive wealth\nredistribution in which contemporary welfare states engage as\ninvolving unjustified coercion. The same is true of many forms of\neconomic regulation, including licensing laws. Just as people have\nstrong rights to individual freedom in their personal and social\naffairs, libertarians argue, they also have strong rights to freedom\nin their economic affairs. Thus, rights of freedom of contract and\nexchange, freedom of occupation, and private property are taken very\nseriously.\n\n\nIn these respects, libertarian theory is closely related to (indeed,\nat times practically indistinguishable from) the classical liberal\ntradition, as embodied by John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and\nImmanuel Kant. It affirms a strong distinction between the public and\nthe private spheres of life; insists on the status of individuals as\nmorally free and equal, something it interprets as implying a strong\nrequirement of individuals sovereignty; and believes that a respect\nfor this status requires treating people as right-holders, including\nas holders of rights in property.\n\n\nIt is popular to label libertarianism as a right-wing doctrine. But\nthis is mistaken. For one, on social (rather than economic) issues,\nlibertarianism implies what are commonly considered left-wing views.\nAnd second, there is a subset of so-called\n“left-libertarian” theories. While all libertarians\nendorse similar rights over the person, left-libertarians differ from\nother libertarians with respect to how much people can appropriate in\nterms of unowned natural resources (land, air, water, minerals, etc.).\nWhile virtually all libertarians hold that there is some constraint on\nhow resources can be appropriated, left-libertarians insist that this\nconstraint has a distinctively egalitarian character. It might\nrequire, for instance, that people who appropriate natural resources\nmake payments to others in proportion to the value of their\npossessions. As a result, left-libertarianism can imply certain kinds\nof egalitarian redistribution.\n\nThe family of views making up libertarianism includes many different\nmembers. Philosophically most distinctive, perhaps, offers a\nparticular moral theory. This theory is organized around the view that\nagents initially fully own themselves and have certain moral powers to\nacquire property rights in external things. This theory sees\nlibertarian policy conclusions as the result of not merely empirical\ntruths or real-world feasibility constraints, but as following from\nthe only defensible (and restrictive) moral principles. \nSome libertarians of this kind consider freedom the paramount value.\nThey hold, for example, that each person has a right to maximum equal\nnegative liberty, which is understood as the absence of forcible\ninterference from other agents (e.g., Narveson 1988; Steiner 1994;\nNarveson & Sterba 2010). This is sometimes called\n“Spencerian Libertarianism” (after Herbert Spencer). \nMost, however, focus more on the idea of self-ownership. Famously,\nthis view is attributed to Robert Nozick (Cohen 1995; but see the\ndiscussion below). On this view, the key libertarian starting point is\nthat people have a very stringent (perhaps the most stringent\npossible) set of rights over their persons, giving them the kind of\ncontrol over themselves that one might have over possessions they own.\nThis includes (1) rights to control the use of the entity: including a\nliberty-right to use it as well as a claim-right that others not use\nit without one's consent, (2) rights to transfer these rights to\nothers (by sale, rental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the\nnon-consensual loss of these rights, (4) compensation rights in case\nothers use the entity without one’s consent, and (5) enforcement\nrights (e.g. rights to restrain persons about to violate these\nrights). \nThe idea of self-ownership is attractive for many reasons. We\nrecognize people as self-owners when we recognize that there are\nthings that may not be done to a person without their consent, but\nwhich may be done with consent. Thus, we consider rape wrong because\nit involves a body being used against the will of the person to whom\nit belongs, but not because there’s something inherently wrong\nwith sexual intercourse. We consider assault wrong for similar\nreasons, but allow voluntary boxing matches. There are also more\ntheoretical reasons for self-ownership’s attraction. The\nprinciple is a strong endorsement of the moral importance and\nsovereignty of the individual, and it expresses the refusal to treat\npeople as mere things to use or trade off against each other. \nSome libertarians hold that people enjoy full self-ownership. We can\ndefine full self-ownership as a logically strongest set of ownership\nrights one might have over oneself. The notion has some indeterminacy,\nas there can be more than one strongest set of such rights. Still,\nthere is a determinate core set of rights. Central to this idea are\nfull control rights, the right to determine the use of one’s\nperson. Control rights are central to self-ownership in order to\ndistinguish between certain things (like physical contact) that may be\ndone to a person with, and may not be done to a person without her\nconsent. Full-self ownership, in other words, offers protections\nagainst others doing things to us against our will. \nObviously, full self-ownership offers the strongest possible version\nof the benefits of self-ownership more generally. And in many\ncontexts, this is highly attractive. Full self-ownership, for\ninstance, offers a straightforward and unequivocal defense of\nwomen’s rights over their bodies, including the right to\nterminate unwanted pregnancies. It explains why it’s wrong to\nsacrifice the rights and freedoms of minorities (even a minority of\none) for the sake of protecting the interests of the majority. It\noffers a principled objection to clearly objectionable forms of\npaternalism or legal moralism. And so on. \nAt the same time, full self-ownership does can out other moral\nconsiderations, including ones that are often thought relevant to\njustice. Consider the view, made famous (or infamous) by Robert Nozick\n(1974), that people have a right against being forced to assist\nothers, except as a result of their agreement or wrongdoing. Such a\nview rules out redistributive taxation aimed at reducing material\ninequality or raising the standards of living for the poor. Since\ntaxation siphons off part of people’s earnings, which represent\npeople’s labor, and people initially have the right not to be\nforced to work for certain ends, Nozick argued, redistributive\ntaxation is morally on a par with forced labor. \nNozick’s point was that theories of justice face a choice. One\ncan (a) respect people as the primary controllers of their lives,\nlabor, and bodies. But in that case, people must also be free to work,\nand not work, as they choose (so long as they don’t violate the\nrights of others). This means working for whomever they want, on the\nterms they want, and keeping the gains. Recognizing this leaves little\nroom for redistributive taxation. Or one can (b) endorse the\nenforcement of certain distributions. But in that case, the theory\nmust endorse taking what people innocently produce through their own\nlabor, redirecting their work to purposes they did not freely choose.\nThis latter option is unacceptable to anyone endorsing the idea of\nfull self-ownership. As Nozick wrote, it involves claiming a kind of\ncontrol over the lives of others that is similar to a claim of\nownership in them. And this is unacceptable (1974, p. 172). \nIn part because it seems to lead to conclusions like these, the idea\nof full self-ownership is very controversial. And it’s\nundeniable that full self-ownership has counter-intuitive\nimplications. A related, but different, worry concerns not duties of\nassistance, but cases in which a person in extreme need can be greatly\nbenefitted as a result of using another person. Even if one has no\nduty to assist in those cases, may others use one’s person,\nwithout consent, to assist someone in need? Suppose, to use an extreme\nexample, we can save ten innocent lives by gently pushing an innocent\nperson to the ground. Full self-ownership asserts that this would not\nbe permissible. Again, the idea is roughly that since individuals are\nnormatively separate, they cannot permissibly be used to benefit\nothers without their consent. \nA third worry is that full self-ownership may permit voluntary\nenslavement. Just as people have, on this view, the right to control\nuses of their persons, they also have the right to transfer their\nrights over their persons to others, for example through sale or git.\nHowever, this is controversial among libertarians, some of whom deny\nthat these kinds of transfers are possible because it's morally\nimpossible for others to control one’s will (Rothbard 1982;\nBarnett 1998, pp. 78–82), because such transfers undermine our\nautonomy (Grunebaum 1987), or because of theological reasons (Locke\n1690). Theorists who endorse the possibility usually argue that\nlibertarian self-ownership is about giving people control over the\npermissible uses of their person, not about the necessity of some\npsychological capacity to control their person. As a result, the right\nto exercise one’s autonomy is what matters here, even if one\nexercises it in (otherwise) problematic ways, not the protection or\npromotion of autonomy. (See e.g. Vallentyne 1998; Steiner 1994.) \nA fourth concern about the counter-intuitive nature of full\nself-ownership points out its restrictive implications. Full\nself-ownership might seem to condemn as wrongful even very minor\ninfringements of the personal sphere, such as when tiny bits of\npollution fall upon an unconsenting person. Prohibiting all acts that\ncan lead to such minor infringements poses an unacceptable limit to\nour liberty. But from the point of view of self-ownership, there is no\nprincipled difference between minor infringements and major\ninfringements. Thus, this objection goes, self-ownership theory must\nbe rejected (Railton 2003; Sobel\n 2012).[1] \nThis objection, however, is of dubious force as it presupposes an\n(even more) implausible conception of full self-ownership than its\ndefenders have reason to endorse. Suppose we understand the moral\nbenefits that self-ownership confers along two dimensions: protections\nfrom unwanted uses of our bodies, and liberties to use our bodies. As\nthe objection points out, it is not possible to simultaneously\nmaximize the value of both dimensions: our protections restrict our\nliberties by restricting the possible uses of one’s body, and\nvice versa. Since maximizing the protection-dimension implausibly\nrestricts the use-dimension, the correct response is not to reject\nself-ownership, but rather to loosen the protection-dimension somewhat\nin order to enhance the use-dimension. Doing this would allow minor\ninfringements for the sake of self-ownership. As Eric Mack (2015) puts\nit, a good theory of self-ownership offers people some “elbow\nroom.” (For more discussion, see Brennan & Van der Vossen\n2017) \nNevertheless, many libertarians do reject full self-ownership.\nIt’s possible to weaken the principle along any of the\ndimensions above in order to avoid the objections, while holding on to\nthe general spirit of the self-ownership view. Thus, one could accept\nlimited non-consensual duties of assistance, say, and accept some\nreduction in the control-dimension of self-ownership. Others, as we\nhave already seen, reject the idea that self-owners have the power of\ntransfer themselves into (voluntary) slavery. Either way, the result\nwill not be a theory of full self-ownership, but one that approximates\nthat idea. \nWeakened conceptions of self-ownership, however, raise important\nquestions. For one, if self-ownership turns out to have multiple\ndimensions that can be weakened in light of competing considerations,\nit loses some of its theoretic appeal. After all, part of that appeal\nwas the idea’s relative simplicity, which seemed to make it a\ngood starting point for a theory of justice. Once we start trading off\nthe idea against other considerations, those considerations are\nthereby admitted into the libertarian moral universe. This raises\ncomplicated questions about their relative weights, appropriate\ntrade-off rules, and so on. \nMoreover, if trade-offs are possible between these dimensions, we will\nwant to know why we should sacrifice one in favor of the other. And in\norder to answer that question, we may need to invoke some further,\nunderlying value. This threatens the status of self-ownership as a\nfoundational principle in libertarian theory. Presumably, foundational\nprinciples are not based on underlying values. For many libertarians,\nthis is not much of a concession, however. If few endorse full\nself-ownership, even fewer endorse it as a foundational principle. \nSuch a move would also avoid a final kind of objection, this one more\ntheoretical in nature. This objection holds that, upon inspection, the\nidea of self-ownership is neither as simple nor as clear-cut as it\ninitially appeared. One version of this objection points to the\nindeterminacy of the idea of ownership. Positive law recognizes a wide\nvariety of ownership arrangements, including ones that consist of very\ndifferent kinds of rights than the self-ownership theorist defends.\nThere may be no clear general notion of ownership to which one can\nappeal to defend self-ownership. Instead, ownership claims may be\nconclusions of intricate moral (or legal) arguments (Fried 2004,\n2005). However, if self-ownership is understood to be importantly\nanalogous to ownership in general, this poses no objection. Instead,\nit shows a more fruitful way for theorizing our rights over our\npersons are more fruitfully (Russell 2018). \nWhile Nozick (1974) is typically read as someone who treats full\nself-ownership as a premise or foundational principle (see especially\nthe influential discussion in Cohen 1995), it is far from clear that\nthis is correct. One obvious problem is that Nozick invokes the idea\nof self-ownership only once in Anarchy, State, and Utopia. And while\nthat passage is oft-quoted, in terms of his arguments, the idea as\nsuch does little work in the book. Part II of Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia develops a large number of arguments against redistributive\nconceptions of justice which do not invoke or rely on the idea of full\nself-ownership. \nNozick also invoked ideas that contradict reading him as a proponent\nof full self-ownership as a foundational principle. He argued that\nself-ownership is an expression of the Kantian requirement that we\ntreat people only as ends in themselves (suggesting that the Kantian\nidea, and not self-ownership as such, is foundational). And he\ndidn’t wish to rule out that any plausible theory of rights must\nallow that they can be overridden in order to prevent\n“catastrophic moral horror” (Nozick 1974, p. 30). It\nseems, then, that self-ownership is the view at which Nozick arrives,\non the combined strength of all the arguments that he provides\n(Brennan & Van der Vossen 2017). \nThat said, it’s important to note that not all libertarians\naccept that the idea of full self-ownership should be weakened or\ntreated as non- foundational. Some remain committed to the idea and\nhave offered responses to all the objections above. For one prominent\nreply to worries about indeterminacy and related theoretical\nobjections, see Vallentyne, Steiner, & Otsuka 2005. \nJust as Nozick may have seen libertarianism as the best way to express\na host of moral considerations in the realm of justice, so too many\nother libertarians embrace different principles as the foundation of\ntheir theories. Such authors seek to honor people as rights-holders or\nsovereign individuals, whom we need to treat as the primary claimants\nof their lives and bodies. But they also seek to avoid some of the\nimplausible elements of full self-ownership. Views like this treat\nself-ownership neither as necessary maximally strong, nor as\nself-evident or foundational. \nLibertarian theory can thus be defended in many different ways. This\nis true both of theories that give pride of place to self-ownership\nand of theories that don’t. Examples of the former include Eric\nMack (2002, 2010) who sees self-ownership rights as among several\nnatural rights grounded in our nature as purposive beings. In\nMack’s view, the protections and freedoms offered by the idea\nare justified in order to grant to all individuals a separate sphere\nin which they can act in accordance to their self-chosen purposes.\nSimilarly, Loren Lomasky (1987) derives rights from a related,\nalthough slightly different, conception of people as project pursuers.\nJohn Tomasi (2012) argues that strong rights over our bodies are\nrequired by the ideal of democratic legitimacy. According to Daniel\nRussell (2018), self-ownership rights provide the only way that people\nwho live together can all genuinely live their own lives. \nMany libertarian theories invoke insights from economics. An\ninfluential strand of thinking in this tradition, closely related to\nF. A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, argues that libertarian or classical\nliberal political conclusions follow from human epistemic limitations.\nFree societies, and in particular free market systems, best utilize\nthe available information in society by allowing and incentivizing\nindividuals to act on the partial information they possess, including\ninformation about their local circumstances, needs, and desires, as\nwell as their productive abilities and the trade-offs that those might\npresent. Any society that wants to deviate from the decentralized\ndecision-making represented by market exchange, the argument goes,\nwill have to collect, process, and fully understand all this dispersed\nand complex information, aggregate it into some kind of social welfare\nfunction, and assign goods accordingly. This latter process is simply\nbeyond our capabilities. Free societies thus will predictably\noutperform other societies on important metrics (Hayek 1960, 1973; Von\nMises 1949). \nAnother example follows the work of Adam Smith, claiming that\nlibertarian ideas are inherent in our ordinary moral psychology. Smith\nfamously considered justice to be strictly negative in nature:\nsomething we satisfy simply through abstaining from theft, coercion,\nand other violations of libertarian rights. Thus, in The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments, Smith wrote that the rules that “call loudest\nfor vengeance and punishment are the laws which guard the life and\nperson of our neighbour; the next are those which guard his property\nand possessions; and last of all come those which guard what are\ncalled his personal rights, or what is due to him from the promises of\nothers” (Smith 1759 [1976], p. 84). These are the only acts that\nare generally disapproved of in a way calling for punishment (1759\n[1976], p. 78). Human rule following of this kind is desirable because\nit’s conducive to the stability and effectiveness of society\n(1976 [1759], p. 86). \nNone of this means that people don’t have obligations to assist\nothers. Smith grounds his view in a deeply social view of moral\npsychology. Thus, benevolence along with justice is a pillar of\nsociety. However, we cannot expect or force people to care for distant\nstrangers in the same way as they care for themselves. And trying to\norganize a society along these lines would lead to disaster. Smith was\nextremely skeptical about government officials, writing about how they\nseek fame and power, think themselves morally superior, and are more\nthan willing to serve their own interests and those of well-connected\nbusinessmen rather than the public good (Smith 1776 [1976], pp.\n266–7). And, perhaps foreshadowing Hayek, Smith argued that\ngovernments are generally incapable of knowing enough to guide large\nnumbers of people. Human beings make their own decisions and respond\nto circumstances, thus thwarting any systematic plans the government\nmight lay out for them. Thus, as a rule, it’s more promising to\nappeal to people’s self-interest through market exchange than to\nuse state coercion. \nLibertarian arguments of this kind cast the state as an arbitrator, an\nimpartial agent that makes fair and productive cooperation between\ncitizens possible, much like a referee enables fair play by\nadministering the rules of the game. It’s crucial, then, for the\nstate to remain impartial and not choose sides in society or the\neconomy. Once governments begin benefiting one party over another,\nwhether this be certain groups in society or business interests, such\ninvolvement is in principle off-limits and likely to backfire as it\nwill favor whoever is politically well-connected or favored at the\ntime. The minimal state, then, is the only state capable of\nstructuring complex and deeply interdependent societies in ways that\nare mutually beneficial. \nOf course, this discussion still omits many other members of the\nlibertarian or classical liberal family of views. Some theorists\ndepart from consequentialist or teleological principles, which they\nsee as best served by these policies (Epstein 1995, 1998; Friedman\n1962; Rasmussen & Den Uyl 2005; Shapiro 2007). Others adopt a\nRawlsian framework, either claiming that the spirit of John\nRawls’ theory of justice (particularly a concern for the least\nwell off) calls for a far greater respect for individual freedom than\nis usually thought (Tomasi 2012). Yet others see classically liberal\nrequirements flowing from a public reason or justificatory approach\n(Gaus 2010,\n 2012).[2] \nLibertarian and classical liberal theories conceive of distributive\njustice as largely (sometimes exclusively) historical in nature. To\nask whether justice obtains in the world is mainly to ask whether\npeople have been justly treated, principally whether their rights to\ntheir persons and possessions have been respected. Even though\ndistributional issues can be relevant for assessing the justice of a\nsociety (see the next section), libertarians generally see\npeople’s rightful possessions as whatever they acquired in\nlegitimate (i.e., rights-respecting) ways. As a result, they reject\ntheories that look merely at outcomes or end-state distributions. \nThe most common mode of just acquisition is through the legitimate\ntransfer of prior just holdings. This is why libertarians generally\ndefend noncoerced, nondeceptive market relations as just. Of course,\nnot all modes of legitimate acquisition can depend on prior just\nholdings—there must be a starting point, an original\nacquisition. In Nozick’s “entitlement theory”\ndistributive justice consists entirely of these two modes of\nacquisition and a principle of rectification for their violation. \nThe broader point is that libertarians generally accept that\nindividuals can carry out such acts of original acquisition. More\nprecisely, they accept that individuals can acquire unowned goods\nunilaterally, without having to ask the consent of approval of other\npeople, some governing body, or anything else. The argument for not\nneeding the permission of others to use and appropriate the external\nworld is relatively straightforward. The moral benefits of private\nownership are important, and if there is a good justification for\nhaving a system of private property, it should be possible to derive a\njustification for acts that begin to bring about such rights as well.\nAny view that would require the consent of others, or some kind of\ngovernment legitimation, creates barriers to acquisition and thus\nthreatens these moral benefits (Van der Vossen 2009, 2015; Mack\n2010). \nThe most famous account of how unilateral original acquisition is\npossible remains Locke’s labor theory. According to Locke, when\npeople work on previously unowned objects, subject to certain\nprovisos, they turn those objects into their private property. The\nprecise nature of Locke’s argument, the relation between labor\nand acquisition, as well as the nature of the provisos, are hotly\ncontested. The most famous interpretation, again, seeks to ground\nproperty in the (prior) rights of self-ownership. On this view, when\npeople labor they quite literally extend their claims of\nself-ownership over external objects, thus drawing them into their\nrights-protected sphere. As Locke (1690 [1988], chapter V) put it,\nsince laboring mixes one’s labor, which one owns, with something\nthat is unowned, the previously unowned thing becomes owned. \nThis argument suffers from well-known problems. For instance, since\nlaboring is an activity, the idea of mixing it with an object seems at\nbest a metaphor for something else. But in that case, the argument is\nincomplete: we still need to know what really grounds property rights\n(Waldron 1988). More importantly, it simply is not true that mixing\nsomething owned with something unowned is sufficient for\nappropriation. As Nozick pointed out, if I pour a can of tomato juice\nthat I own into the unowned ocean, I lose my tomato juice—I do\nnot gain an ocean (Nozick 1974, pp. 174–5). Third, if\nlabor-mixing really were sufficient for generating claims in objects,\nwhy should this be restricted to unowned goods? Why not say that\nmixing my labor with something already owned generates a claim of\ncoownership (Thomson 1990, pp. 326–327)? \nIn light of these and other objections, many have offered different\ndefenses of private property. These justifications depend neither on\naccepting a prior thesis of self-ownership, nor on the affiliated\nthesis that self-ownership rights can be extended outwardly through\nlabor. Instead, these arguments point to the moral importance of\npeople having security over external resources, whether this is\nunderstood in terms of support for political and civil liberties (Gaus\n2010), our ability to be project pursuers or purposive agents (Lomasky\n1987; Mack 2010), or the ability to be the authors of our lives\n(Tomasi 2012). \nAn influential line of argument ties the justification of property to\nthe material prosperity and well-being that it brings about. Rights of\nprivate property serve to divide the external world into a number of\ndiscrete, individual parts, each exclusively controlled by its\nparticular owner. Organizing the social world in this way is\npreferable to collective use or ownership because it helps avoid\ncollective action problems. When things remain held in open-access\ncommons, we all have an incentive to use as much as we can, leading to\na general pattern of use that ends up depleting the resource, to\neveryone’s detriment. Rights to private property not only avoid\nsuch a “tragedy of the commons,” they also incentivize\npeople to preserve their parts, increase their productivity, and\nexchange what they own with others on mutually beneficial terms\n(Schmidtz 1994; Buchanan 1993). \nSince these justifications of property do not rest on a prior\nprinciple of self-ownership, they are not committed to seeing property\nrights as in any way absolute, immune to just regulation, or even\nprecluding any and all forms of taxation. Despite what is sometimes\nsuggested (Freeman 2001), virtually all libertarians that reject\nself-ownership as a starting point also accept that property rights\nneed specification, can be instantiated in quite different, yet\nmorally acceptable forms, and might be overridden by other moral\nconsiderations. Such views do not entail the impossibility of\nunilateral original appropriation either. \nLibertarians and their critics are concerned with the issue of\noriginal appropriation primarily because it demarcates a major fault\nline in political philosophy. The libertarian’s historical\nconception of justice, and the accompanying insistence that\ngovernments refrain from redistributive projects, require that\nproperty rights do not depend on the government, positive law, or the\nconsent of others for their moral validity. Such a view is viable if\none can establish the possibility of unilateral appropriation, without\nessential reference to the existence of the state or law. \nLibertarianism is committed to a strong guarantee of basic liberty of\naction. However, even views that endorse the strongest possible form\nof self-ownership do not guarantee such liberty. For if the rest of\nthe world (natural resources and artifacts) is fully owned by others,\none is not permitted to do anything without their consent—since\nthat would involve the use of their property. Since agents must use\nnatural resources (occupy space, breathe air, etc.), free people\nrequire rights to use parts of the external world. \nThe question arises, then, what constraints (if any) exist on\nownership and appropriation. Libertarian theories can be put on a\ncontinuum from right-libertarianism to left-libertarianism, depending\non the stance taken on how natural resources can be owned. Simply\nstated, a libertarian theory moves from “right” to\n“left” the more it insists on constraints aimed at\npreserving some kind of equality. \nAt one end of the spectrum sits the maximally permissive view of\noriginal appropriation. This view denies there are any constraints on\nuse or appropriation (Rothbard 1978, 1982; Narveson 1988, ch. 7, 1999;\nFeser 2005). Thus, agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy\nwhatever resources they want (assuming, of course, that they violate\nno one’s self-ownership in the process). As a result, this view\nsees natural resources as initially unprotected. However, this is not\na very popular view, as it simply ignores the problem above: property\nrelations can threaten people’s liberty and even self-ownership,\nirrespective of their own voluntary choices or wrongdoing. Such a\ntheory does not live up to libertarian ideals very well. \nMost libertarians, then, accept something like what’s come to be\nknown as the Lockean proviso. This proviso holds that appropriation is\npermissible if “enough and as good” be left for others.\nThere’s an extensive debate over how exactly this proviso is to\nbe understood. Nozick interprets the proviso to require that no one\ncan be made worse off as a result of use or appropriation, compared\nwith a baseline of non-use or non-appropriation. But this\ninterpretation is problematic for at least two reasons. First, this\nsuch a welfare-based constraint on the exercise of people’s\nnatural right to appropriate seems ill-motivated within Nozick’s\ntheory. In general, the exercise of our rights isn’t usually\nconstrained by a non-worsening requirement. Second, Nozick’s\nproviso is vulnerable to the objection (raised by Cohen 1995) that, as\nlong as property owners compensate non-owners only slightly over the\npre-appropriation baseline (which is likely quite low), non-owners are\nnot wronged. This would be true even if the owners extracted almost\nall of the benefits of cooperation, and that seems unfair. \nOthers interpret the Lockean proviso as requiring something like a\nsufficientarian requirement, such that people must have access to an\nadequate share of natural resources (Lomasky 1987; Wendt 2017). This\nview might invoke differing conceptions of adequacy, such as\nwell-being or the ability to be self-governing (as in Simmons 1992,\n1993). Or one might see the proviso as ensuring the ability to\nexercise one’s rights of self-ownership (Mack 1995). \nAt the other end of the spectrum, left-libertarians think it\nimplausible that people who first use or claim natural resources\nthereby become entitled to unequal benefits. Since natural resources\nare not created or produced as such, left-libertarians claim that the\nvalue of these resources belongs in some sense to everyone, This\ncommon ownership of the world supports some egalitarian constraints on\nappropriation and use. \nWhat we might call equal share left-libertarianism—advocated by\nHenry George (1879) and Hillel Steiner (1994), for\nexample—interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring equally\nvaluable shares of natural resources for everyone. Thus, while\nindividuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources,\nthose who thereby acquire more than their share (understood in terms\nof per capita value) owe compensation to others. This constraint is\nenduring significance. It applies at the moment of appropriation, and\nencumbers subsequent through time. Others claim that the equality\nrequirement is supposed to also compensate for disadvantages that\nresult from different natural abilities (such as the effects of\ngenetic differences). Thus, Otsuka (2003) claims that the Lockean\nproviso prohibits appropriations that diminish the opportunities of\nothers for well-being beyond the opportunity obtained by appropriating\nor using a natural resource. \nAs an interpretation of Locke’s requirement that appropriators\nleave “enough and as good”, however, left-libertarian\nviews are implausible. In his discussion of appropriation, Locke\ninvokes the idea of distributive shares only three times (sections 31,\n37, and 46). All appear in the context of the (quite different)\nprohibition on letting things spoil. In these cases, and in these\ncases alone, Locke sees appropriation as taking what belongs to\nothers. His point is clear: when we take but don’t use, we\nremove things for others to take and use—which was the point of\nallowing unilateral appropriation in the first place. \nAt this point, left-libertarians often claim intuitive support for an\negalitarian proviso. When multiple people are presented with a\npreviously undivided resource, equal division is the intuitively fair\napproach. An objection, however, is that such intuitions apply only to\ncircumstances that ignore relevant conditions. For instance, while\nOtsuka (2018) is correct to claim that if two persons are stranded\ntogether on an island, equal division is the intuitive solution, this\nmay not be true if one person arrived earlier, already cultivated,\nsay, two-thirds of the island, while leaving more than enough for the\nsecond person to independently make a living, is willing to cooperate,\ntrade, and so on. In that case, the latecomer insisting that she has a\nright to half the island is not only counter-intuitive, but probably\njust wrong. The intuition of equal division becomes even less\nappealing if we imagine more than two parties, capable of production,\ntrade, and cooperation, arriving at different times. It remains true,\nof course, that such latecomers will be entitled to something like an\nequally good shot at making use of the world’s resources. What\nsuch an equally good shot comes to, however, is much less clear. \nWhatever interpretation of the proviso one accepts, however,\nlibertarians left and right agree that once persons enjoy legitimate\nrights over their property, these are more or less immune to other\nclaims of distributive justice. There is little room in the theory for\nthinking that certain distributions or material outcomes are morally\nsignificant as such. To the libertarian, concerns such as material\nequality are inconsistent with an appropriate concern for\npeople’s equality. (See, e.g., Schmidtz 2006.) Thus, Nozick\n(1974) argues in his famous discussion How Liberty Upsets Patterns\nthat because any system of property must allow gifts and other\nvoluntary transfers, and because these will significantly upset\nwhatever distribution is put in place, there is very limited room for\nconcerns with distributional equality. Since treating people as moral\nequals means respecting them as the holders of these rights, and since\nsuch rights will be exercised in ways that will not equalize material\noutcomes, forced redistribution counts as unjust. \nNone of this is to say that libertarians are not concerned with\noutcomes at all. John Tomasi (2012, p. 127) argues that many\nlibertarians and classical liberals are committed to a kind of\ndistributive condition requiring that societies must be expected to\nwork to the benefit of the least well-off. This seems to overstate the\nmatter considerably, but it is certainly true that many libertarians\nsee their policies as promoting the general good, and this plays an\nimportant role in their justification. Hence, libertarians are wont to\npoint out that being poor in a free society is much better than being\npoor elsewhere, that markets in general do not work to the detriment\nof the poor, and so on. \nLibertarians are highly skeptical of political authority and state\nlegitimacy. Since people are, quite simply, independent and equal\nbeings, with none naturally subordinated to any other, states (like\nall other agents) ought to respect the moral rights of individuals,\nincluding their rights over their persons and their legitimate\npossessions. For this reason, libertarians typically require something\nlike voluntary consent or acceptance for legitimate state authority.\n \nUnfortunately, all states fail to satisfy this requirement for many of\ntheir subjects. As a result, they use massive amounts of force in ways\nthat are morally impermissible. States violate the rights of citizens\nby punishing people for self-regarding conduct (e.g. taking drugs,\nrefusing to purchase health insurance, or engaging in consensual sex\nin private). Similarly, states violate the rights of their subjects by\nforcibly transferring their legitimate possessions to preferred others\n(e.g. to bail out large companies, to provide for pensions, or pay for\npublic parks). States violate the rights of citizens when they\nforcibly prevent them from innocently contracting and associating with\nothers, exercising their religion, occupy certain professions because\nof their ethnic background, gender, or sexual orientation, and much,\nmuch more. \nA standard objection here is that, since so much of modern life seems\nto require a state, libertarianism’s anarchist stance is\nproblematic. In reply, libertarians typically argue that many of the\neffects of states are extremely negative. States wage devastating wars\nabroad, restrict migration with devastating results for the\nworld’s poor, and oppress and violate the rights of many of\ntheir own citizens. Moreover, many of the positive effects that states\ncan bring about can also be obtained through voluntary mechanisms.\nLibertarians tend to be more hopeful about the possibility of anarchic\nprovision of order, public goods, as well as charitable giving. (See,\ne.g., Huemer 2012; Chartier 2012.) \nEven though libertarians are generally quite hostile to state\nauthority, this does not mean that the state cannot permissibly\nundertake certain minimal activities. This includes most obviously the\nenforcement of individual rights and freedoms. These activities do not\npresuppose state authority since such activities are permissible with\nor without people’s prior consent (unless, of course, such\nactivities involve the violation of rights themselves). \nSome theorists, such as Hayek (1960), argue that it can be permissible\nfor people to be forced to pay for basic police services. But this\nargument seems problematic within libertarian theory. If people do not\nagree to their legitimate possessions being used for these purposes,\nit would be unjust to force them to pay for these services, even if\nthey clearly benefit a benefit as a result. After all, libertarians\ngenerally deny that merely receiving a benefit suffices to justify\nenforceable requirements to pay. \nSome left-libertarians endorse further “state-like”\nactivities for the state, which other libertarians would reject. Since\nmost left-libertarians recognize enforceable duties to compensate\nothers in proportion to the value of the natural resources they\npossess, the state might forcibly collect and disburse these payments.\nSome hold that even various public goods can be forcibly provided,\nincluding basic police services, national defense, a basic system of\nroads, etc. The underlying justification here is that the provision of\nthese public goods will increase the value of natural resources,\nmaking the taxed amounts a case of self-financing. (Vallentyne\n2007) \nOne popular argument for state authority holds that states can be\nlegitimate if they are democratic. Libertarians tend to be very\nskeptical about this view. A large body of empirical findings has\nshown that voters tend to be radically uninformed, ignorant, and\nindeed biased about political issues. And democratic deliberation does\nlittle, if anything, to improve this. Indeed, it seems like it is\nrational for people to remain ignorant about politics. Given that\none’s causal influence on the quality of political decisions is\nnegligible, and it is costly in terms of time and effort to become\ninformed, it is rational for people to remain ignorant. Most people\nthus vote in ways that have more to do with signaling their\nideological allegiance or virtues, and less with the merits of the\nissues (Caplan 2008; Somin 2016; Brennan 2016; Pincione &\nTesón 2011). \nIn addition to voter ignorance, many libertarians fear the more\ngeneral dynamics of state power. Public choice theory points out that\nsince the best way to understand the behavior of political agents is\nalong roughly maximizing lines, there is little reason to think that\nthe state will generally behave in the public interest (Tullock &\nBuchanan 1962). Thus, many government policies impose widely dispersed\ncosts on the populace to confer localized benefits on a few, often\npolitically well-connected elites. Examples include the large-scale\nbailouts of financial companies and agricultural subsidies.","contact.mail":"bvanderv@chapman.edu","contact.domain":"chapman.edu"}]
