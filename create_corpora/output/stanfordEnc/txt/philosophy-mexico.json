The result has been a rich\nand original tradition that is more than 500 years old and that,\ntogether with Peruvian philosophy, is the oldest of the Americas.\n\n\nAlthough Mexican philosophy has been concerned with every manner of\ntheoretical inquiry, it might be characterized by a particular concern\nwith ethical and political issues and the concrete consequences of\nphilosophical inquiry. The questions concerning human nature and the\nrelation between power and reason have been central to the development\nof Mexican philosophy, from early reflections on the justification of\nthe Spanish conquest to recent debates about democratic reform or the\nIndian insurgence in Chiapas. The critique of philosophical\neurocentrism is another central feature of Mexican philosophy.\n\n\nThe bibliography includes all the books and articles mentioned in this\narticle and a selection of secondary texts in English.\n\n\nThroughout Latin America, philosophers have raised metaphilosophical\nquestions about the originality and peculiarity of their own\nphilosophy. Likewise, it is often claimed that philosophy in\nMexico is not the same as Mexican philosophy, and that\nwhile philosophy in Mexico has a long and distinguished history, it is\nwrong to speak of Mexican philosophy, defined by the originality or\nauthenticity of its debates or theses, the distinctness of its\nschools, or the uniqueness of its style or terminology (see Romanell\n1975). Other scholars disagree and argue that there are indeed\nsubstantive, thematic, or stylistic continuities that underlie much of\nthe philosophy produced in Mexico and that allow us to speak of\nMexican philosophy as an original and authentic tradition. Still\nothers believe that although philosophy in Mexico does not constitute\na unified and distinct tradition yet, it has the potential to\nbecome one. (For an extended discussion of the difference between\n“Mexican philosophy” and “Philosophy in\nMexico”, see Hurtado 2007, particularly chapter 2.) \nTo complicate the metaphilosophical discussion further, while\nphilosophy has been produced in Mexico for over 500 years, it is\nmisleading to speak of “Mexican philosophy” before Mexico\nwon its independence from Spain in 1821. That is, with few exceptions\ndid Mexican thinkers and philosophers living under colonial rule or\nbefore think of themselves or their work as Mexican. Even\ntoday, given that the development of Mexican philosophy is emerging\nlargely as a collaborative effort among Mexican and Latinx\nphilosophers, it is perhaps more accurate to speak of\ntrans-Mexican philosophy—again, as a tradition not\nneatly defined by political borders. What we call trans-Mexican\nphilosophy should not be confused with Mexican-American or\nChicanx philosophy, although they are closely related (see\nthe related entry on\n Latinx philosophy).\n Instead, it refers to a field of inquiry that focuses on the\nextension and application of Mexican philosophy outside of Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, and on the way in which the current\ndevelopments in Mexican philosophy both in Mexico and the United\nStates are mutually supportive. \nEven allowing for a certain flexibility in how we define Mexican\nphilosophy, not all philosophers in Mexico think that cultivating\nMexican philosophy as a distinct tradition is a worthy goal. Many\nbelieve that we ought to leave the pursuit of national philosophies in\nthe past. So, like Roger Bartra, who coined the phrase the\npost-Mexican condition (see Bartra 2002), we might speak of a\npost-Mexican philosophy, that is, of a philosophy that is\nproduced in Mexico but which does not aim to represent Mexican culture\nat all. \nWe will not discuss these metaphilosophical issues further (see the\nrelated entry on\n Latin American philosophy: metaphilosophical foundations).\n Our primary concern is to provide a sketch of the history of\nphilosophy in Mexico. \nDuring the early years following the Conquest, Spaniards quickly\nrealized that pre-Conquest Mexicans possessed a complex and\nsophisticated system of beliefs about human beings and the universe.\nIn his Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva\nEspaña (1585 [1950–1982]), the Franciscan missionary\nBernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) reproduced the ancient\nMexican worldview through documents and testimonials. Centuries later,\nwith the discovery of new documents and a deeper knowledge of\nindigenous languages, we have improved our understanding of how the\noriginal inhabitants of Mesoamerica viewed the world. \nThe first historians of Mexican philosophy recognized the richness and\nsophistication of native cosmology, but they did not consider it\nphilosophy per se. However, in 1955, Miguel\nLeón-Portilla (1926–2019) challenged the received view\nand renewed our interest in Mesoamerican thought by publishing his\ninfluential La filosofía náhuatl—emphasis\non filosofía—a collection of recovered texts\ntranslated into Spanish that deal with cosmology, metaphysics,\nanthropology, ethics, and aesthetics. In his book,\nLeón-Portilla argues that the Mexica (i.e., how the Aztecs\nreferred to themselves) in fact did philosophy, and he does so by\nreconstructing their philosophical tradition and comparing it to\nAncient Greek philosophy. Years later, other authors followed his\nexample and wrote extensive commentaries on Mayan texts such as\nPopol Vuh, which provide a deeper understanding of classical\nMayan cosmology and anthropology. \nThe use of the term “philosophy” to speak of Mesoamerican\nthought has been applauded by those who believe that it is necessary\nto de-center the Western concept of philosophy. But it has been\ncriticized by those who believe that calling pre-Hispanic thought\n“philosophy” fails to appreciate what distinguishes\nWestern philosophy as an achievement from a worldview or body of\nbeliefs, which of course all peoples possess. Thus, some scholars have\nclaimed that to interpret pre-Conquest texts as philosophy is to\nretroactively attribute to them something that wasn’t there,\nspecifically a certain level of self-consciousness, rational\nreflection, and critique. Others have even questioned the authenticity\nof historical sources. \nFor instance, Quetzalcóatl, a deity of Mesoamerican culture who\nwas also the putative leader of the pre-Aztec Toltec people,\nchallenges traditional religious mythology and offers an original\nconception of divinity, the universe, and human nature. According to\nQuetzalcóatl, the supreme god is Ometéotl, the god of\nduality. Ometéotl was masculine and feminine, the creator of\nall things, and played an active role in all aspects of reality.\nHowever, since it is not clear whether Quetzalcóatl was a\nhistorical or mythical figure, it is also not clear what to make of\nthe ideas that we normally attribute to him and which have been\nfundamental in the development of our understanding of Náhuatl\nphilosophy. \nAmong the tlamatinime—wise men who followed the\nintellectual tradition of Quetzalcóatl—Tezcoco’s\nKing Nezahualcóyotl (1402–1472) was the most prominent.\nTezcoco was a small kingdom and a military ally of the Aztecs. King\nNezahualcóyotl developed a line of thought that has been\npreserved in his poetry and narrative prose, according to which he\ndoubted the permanence of human life in a world defined by change and\ndeath. If gold and jade can splinter, he mused, then human beings must\naccept that their passage on earth is transitory. However, our\nfinitude should not overwhelm us with sadness; instead, the human\nheart can find meaning in flor y canto (songs and flowers),\nwhich is how Nezahualcóyotl referred to art and beauty. Poetry\nand song persevere even as flowers wither and die, and it is our job\nto learn how to be patient and humble in the face of all that is\nbeyond our ken, such as the gods’ plans, which will forever\nremain a mystery. Though his texts are fragmentary and poetic, we\nmight consider Nezahualcóyotl a philosopher because he\nquestions mythological and religious responses to traditional\nphilosophical problems, such as essence, change, and the meaning of\nlife. In fact, we might we might compare his thought and style to that\nof Heraclitus or Parmenides. \nThe connection between pre-Hispanic thought and Mexican philosophy has\ndeepened in recent years. One example of this is the concept of\nnepantla, which Emilio Uranga (1921–1988) reintroduces\nin his book Análisis del ser del mexicano (1952).\nAccording to Uranga, nepantla refers to an ontological\ncondition of existence that captures both the specific nature of\nMexican being and the human condition more generally. Nepantla means\nto be in between two opposites without fully rejecting or adopting\neither. Several authors from both Mexico and the United States have\nsince employed the concept of nepantla in novel ways to\ndescribe various aspects of our existence (e.g., Gloria\nAnzaldúa). \nOther authors have recovered categories coined by the survivors of\nindigenous peoples and have proposed alternatives to Western\nphilosophy. For example, Carlos Lenkesdorf’s (1926–2010)\nUna filosofía en clave tojolabal (2002) offers a\nphilosophical reconstruction of beliefs and practices of the Tojolabal\nnatives who live in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Lenkesdorf studies\nthe language and everyday practices of the Tojolabal people to propose\nan entirely different way of understanding the relationship between\npersons, community, and nature. We can also find key concepts of\nindigenous Mexicans in the political thought of the members of the\nZapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). \nOne recent effort to reconstruct pre-Hispanic thought is James\nMaffie’s Aztec Philosophy (2015). Using a broad\nselection of sources, old and new, Maffie offers a reconstruction of\nAztec metaphysics that employs categories and concepts of Western\nmetaphysics to demonstrate the originality of Nahuatl thinking. \nThe conquest of the Americas and, in particular, of the Aztec Empire,\nwas an event of global significance that immediately challenged\nSpanish-language philosophers and theologians to reflect on what it\nmeans to be human, whether war, colonization, and slavery are ever\njustified and under what conditions, as well as the meaning of and\nrelationship between “America” and\n“Europe”. \nA professor at the University of Salamanca, Francisco de Vitoria\n(1483–1546) questioned whether the Spanish colonization of the\nAmerican continent constituted “just war”. Unlike other\nauthors who had witnessed the cruelty of Spanish colonization\nfirsthand and who doubted whether conquest and colonization could ever\nbe rationally justified, Vitoria never traveled to America and thus\nhad no direct experience in the matter. \nFather Bartolomé de las Casas (1484–1566) did have\nextensive experience in Mexico and objected to Spanish colonization.\nIn 1550–1551, he engaged in a famous debate with Juan\nGinés de Sepúlveda about whether the indigenous people\nwere fully human. Las Casas claimed that the natives were rational\nbeings, not unlike Europeans, and should be considered fully human\nwith the same right to be protected under natural law, to choose their\nown form of government, and to be free. Consequently, Las Casas\nbelieved that Spaniards did not have the right to enslave or otherwise\nrule them. The ideas of Las Casas proved crucial in the Laws of the\nIndies (1542), which required certain protections of indigenous people\nof the Americas. \nIn the middle of the 16th century, the influence of\nErasmus’ humanism was manifest in authors who wanted to return\nto the doctrinal simplicity and moral purity of early Christianity, a\nneo-stoic reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle that emphasized human\ndignity. We can also trace the influence of Thomas More’s\nUtopia, which inspired social experiments conducted in New\nSpain. \nFather Juan de Zumárraga (1468–1548) founded El Colegio\nde Tlatelolco, a school in which the natives were instructed in\nChristian theology and philosophy. He also helped install the first\npress in 1539, and he conceived the creation of the Royal and\nPontifical University of Mexico (the predecessor to the National\nUniversity of Mexico today). Zumárraga wrote several books that\nexhibit the influence of Erasmus and of the Spanish humanist\nConstantino Ponce, who was a chaplain in Charles I’s court and\nlater accused by the Inquisition of being a Protestant. \nVasco de Quiroga (died 1565) founded hospital-towns in\nMichoacán that were inspired by the communities described in\nThomas More’s Utopia. According to Vasco de Quiroga,\nthe natives lived in a golden age as described by Lucian of Samosata\nin his Saturnalia. \nPhillip II of Spain sent Francisco Hernández (died 1578) to\nstudy the flora and fauna of New Spain. Once in Mexico,\nHernández wrote several philosophical works with commentaries\non Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. \nOf course European intellectuals were not alone in thinking about the\npolitical and intellectual consequences of conquest and colonization.\nTo represent the native perspective on conquest and colonization,\nMiguel León Portilla published La visión de los\nvencidos (The Broken Spears in its English translation)\nin 1959. And in 1958, Edmundo O’Gorman (1906–1995)\npublished La invención de América, which\nchallenges the assumption that Europeans “discovered”\nAmerica, that is, that America was an undiscovered location that\nColumbus both knew of and went in search of. Instead, as O’\nGorman points out, Columbus went in search of Asia and only\naccidentally happened upon what Europeans would later call\n“America” ex post facto, making both the idea of\nAmerica, its so-called discovery, and European attitudes toward it and\nits inhabitants, a construction based entirely on European assumptions\nand beliefs. \nBecause the Spanish Empire was characterized by its Catholic zeal, it\ndid not allow Protestant, pagan, or “modern” philosophies\nto be studied in New Spain. Instead, Scholasticism was the only school\nof philosophy that was approved by colonial authorities and the\nCatholic Church. Nevertheless, a number of prominent philosophers in\nMexico made lasting and original contributions to the Scholastic\ntradition. \nFriar Alonso de la Veracruz (1507–1584) was the first\nphilosopher of New Spain. A student of Vitoria, he was one of the\nfirst to teach Scholastic philosophy in the New World and was the\nfirst published philosopher of New Spain. He wrote several\ncommentaries on Aristotle, such as Recognitio summularum\n(1554a), Dialectica resolutio (1554b), and Physica\nspeculatio (1557), which were used as textbooks. Like Vitoria,\nAlonso also questioned the justification of the Conquest, but he was\neven more sympathetic toward the indigenous population. Alonso argued\nthat the natives did not lose their right to their lands because they\nwere pagans, and he claimed that the Spanish Crown had stolen them\nfrom their lawful owners. He also sustained that sovereignty\nultimately belongs to the people, not the king. \nThe Jesuit priest Antonio Rubio stands out among the philosophers of\nthe 16th century. Born in Spain, he established himself in\nNew Spain from 1576 to 1600 and wrote a famous treatise of logic\ntitled Lógica mexicana (1603). The University of\nAlcalá adopted Lógica mexicana as its primary\nlogic textbook and many editions of an abridged version were printed\nin Europe. We know, for instance, that Descartes studied Rubio’s\nLógica as a pupil in La Fleche. Rubio wrote other\nbooks in which he offered a complete course in philosophy but, while\nhis works on natural philosophy were published, his work on\nmetaphysics was not, perhaps due to the popularity of Francisco\nSuárez’s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597). \nAnother notable philosopher in New Spain from the 16th\ncentury is Tomás Mercado, who wrote several studies on logic\nand the philosophy of economics, specifically on the rationality and\njustice of commercial trade. \nIn the 17th century, the Dominicans, the Augustinians, the\nJesuits, and the Franciscans continued to cultivate Scholastic\nphilosophy, in accordance with their specific religious orientation.\nHowever, the practice of philosophy was almost always lacking in\ninnovation or critique. A paradigmatic representative of this\ntraditional view of philosophy is Francisco Naranjo, a scholar who was\nknown for his ability to recite the entirety of Thomas Aquinas’\nSumma Theologica by heart. Other philosophers from that same\nperiod include Diego Basalenque, Juan de Rueda, Alonso Guerrero, and\nDiego Martín Alcázar. \nIn Europe, the 17th century is known as the Spanish Golden\nAge, producing figures such as Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de\nGóngora in literature, and Diego Velázquez and\nBartolomé Murillo in painting. Likewise, we can speak of a\nGolden Age in New Spain. Three extraordinary figures of the\n17th century’s Mexican baroque period cannot be\nomitted from a history of Mexican philosophy: Father Miguel\nSánchez, Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, and Sister\nJuana Inés de la Cruz. All three of them were born in Mexico,\nwrote in Spanish, and were familiar with the Náhuatl language\nand culture. \nFather Miguel Sánchez (1594–1674) studied at the\nUniversity of Mexico, but was eventually not accepted as a member of\nits faculty. Sánchez is the author of Imagen de la Virgen\nMaría (1648) in which he offers a theological and\nphilosophical interpretation of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Even though\nthe influence of Saint Augustine is dominant in his analysis,\nSánchez was one of the first intellectuals to approach human\nhistory from a Latin American perspective. \nCarlos Sigüenza y Góngora (1645–1700) was a\nremarkable scientist, historian, and philosopher. He taught astronomy\nand mathematics at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, and\nhe became known for his opposition to the belief that comets were\nharbingers of catastrophes. In his book, Libra astronómica\ny filosófica (1690 [1984]), Sigüenza y Góngora\nwas one of the first intellectuals in New Spain to examine the\nadvancements of Galileo Galilei, Descartes, and Kepler with scientific\nrigor. He was also well versed in pre-Columbian thought and culture,\nand rescued the moral and political practices and beliefs of the\nancient Aztecs, presenting them as an example to live by. \nSister Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695) was not allowed\nto enroll in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico because she\nwas a woman. However, she became world-renowned for her wisdom and\nliterary talent. Although Juana Inés de la Cruz was not a\nphilosopher by trade, her writings contain elements of philosophy,\nfrom stoicism and hermeticism to post-Cartesian philosophy. Her long\npoem Primero sueño (1692) is an erudite reflection on\nepistemology and theology based on several classical and contemporary\nworks. Juana Inés de la Cruz is also well-known as an early\nfeminist who described the unfavorable conditions under which women\nwere forced to produce their own philosophy. Her “Respuesta a\nSor Filotea de la Cruz” (1691) is a feminist reflection\navant la lettre in which she argues that men and women should\nbe allowed to develop fully under the same conditions. In that\nbrilliant and erudite text, she famously claims that “if\nAristotle would have been a cook, he would have written even\nmore”. \nIn both the 17th and 18th centuries, it was\nresponsibility of the main religious orders to teach philosophy in New\nSpain, in accordance with their specific doctrinal orientation.\nFranciscans adopted the philosophy of Duns Scotus; Dominicans, that of\nThomas Aquinas; and the Jesuits were more receptive to modern\nphilosophy. However, in the 18th century, the most\ninfluential philosophers struggled to reconcile the apparent tension\nbetween religion and science and between the modern and Scholastic\ntradition. \nIn the 18th century, the Jesuits were leaders in education\nand culture in New Spain. Their work is of central importance, not\nonly because they adapted modern European thought to their own\ncircumstances, but also because they helped to instill a sense of\nnational identity that would result in political independence from\nSpain in the 19th century. However, in 1767, at the height\nof their influence (and precisely because of their influence), the\nSpanish Crown expelled the Jesuits from its territories. This was a\nheavy blow to the development of modern philosophy in Mexico, and it\nfueled a nascent sense of Mexican national identity among the subjects\nof Spanish colonial rule. \nAmong the main Jesuits of New Spain who were forced to leave their\nhomeland were two prominent philosophers: Diego José Abad and\nFrancisco Javier Clavijero. Diego José Abad taught a complete\ncourse on philosophy in which he studied modern philosophers such as\nDescartes and Gassendi. Abad tried to reconcile modern philosophy and\nScholasticism by trying, for example, to reconcile atomism and\nAristotelian hylomorphism. Francisco Javier Clavijero\n(1731–1787) wrote Storia antica del Messico (1780\n[2006]) in which he examines pre-Columbian history using the model of\nGreco-Roman classical history. He also wrote a Cursus\nphilosophicus, of which only one section has been preserved:\nPhysica particularis (1765). \nOther influential philosophers, educators, and students of\ncontemporary philosophy are Juan Benito Díaz de Gamarra\n(1745–1783), author of Elementa recentioris\nphilosophiae (1774); the polymath José Antonio Alzate\n(1737–1799), a ferocious critic of Aristotle; and José\nMariano Mociño (1757–1820), a distinguished expert in\nbotany. All three proved influential in challenging the Colonial rule\nof Spain by challenging the dominance of tradition for the sake of\ntradition. \nThe 19th century was a time of upheaval in Mexico. In 1808\nNapoleon invaded Spain and King Ferdinand VII abdicated the throne,\nforcing the citizens of Spanish America to re-examine the concept of\nsovereignty. Specifically, they wondered whether, in the absence of a\nmonarch, the colonies possessed the right to govern themselves until\nthe monarch returned to the throne. \nAppealing to the philosophy of the Enlightenment—though not\nalways explicitly—several Mexican thinkers and political\nactivists argued that the colonies did possess the right to\nself-government. Such was the case of Miguel Hidalgo\n(1753–1811), one of the fathers of Mexican Independence. Hidalgo\nwas well known for his predilection for French ideas and for his\nopposition to Scholastic theology, as is demonstrated in his\nDisertación sobre el verdadero método de estudiar\nteología escolástica (1784). Francisco Severo\nMaldonado (1775–1832) was another philosophically-minded priest\nwho wrote in favor of independence and about the philosophical\nfoundations of nationalism. \nAfter Mexico won its independence in 1821, and throughout the\n19th century, an intense debate took place regarding the\ntenets of liberal philosophy and its application to Mexican reality.\nLiberals wanted the Mexican Constitution to resemble the Constitution\nof the United States, which defended individual rights, freedom of\nspeech, and freedom of press. They also believed in the separation of\nchurch and state, and argued that the wealth and land owned by the\nMexican Church should be expropriated to promote economic development.\nLiberals believed that everyone is equal before the law and they tried\nto erase the racial and cultural inequality that prevailed in the\nnation, particularly the position of indigenous communities. Among the\nauthors who defended liberal ideas were José María Luis\nMora (1794–1850), Melchor Ocampo (1814–1851), Ignacio\nRamírez (1818–1879), and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano\n(1834–1893). (See the related entry on\n liberalism in Latin America.) \nThere were also influential conservatives who believed that Mexico\nought to preserve its Spanish heritage, such as Lucas Alamán\n(1792–1853). While conservatives also promoted legislation to\nprotect indigenous peoples and local industry, many argued that the\nCatholic tradition was needed to maintain national cohesion. So, while\nEnlightenment philosophy began to spread throughout the Americas in\nthe 19th century, some notable Scholastics remained, such\nas Clemente de Jesús Munguía (1810–1868), author\nof Del pensamiento y su enunciación (1852). \nIn the middle of the 19th century, the debate between\nliberals and conservatives had important political ramifications. On\nthe one hand, Mexican liberals had elected the first president of\nindigenous ancestry, Benito Juarez, who helped establish liberal\nreform throughout Mexico in the 1850s. On the other hand, from 1862 to\n1867, conservatives supported the pro-French Mexican monarchy, headed\nby Maximilian of Hapsburg, ousting Juarez for a time. After the\ncollapse of the Empire and the execution of Maximilian, the\nConservative Party lost most of its influence as it was associated\nwith supporting foreign powers. \nThroughout the 19th century, Mexican intellectuals\nentertained a wide variety of philosophical schools, including\nliberalism, utilitarianism, sensualism, materialism, and socialism.\nSome also developed anarchist and romantic ideas, such as Juan\nNepomuceno Adorno, a romantic whose La armonía del\nuniverso (1862) proposes a deistic philosophy and a utopian\nconception of human nature and society. But the main school of\nphilosophy that dominated the second half of the century was\npositivism, understood broadly to encompass authors as varied as\nAuguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Hyppolite Taine, and John Stuart\nMill. \nThe main representative of positivism in Mexico was Gabino Barreda\n(1818–1881). In his “Oración\ncívica”(1867), Barreda offers an interpretation of\nMexican history inspired by Comte’s philosophy of history,\naccording to which history develops in three stages—the\nreligious, the metaphysical, and the scientific. Barreda believed that\nthe victory of the Liberal Party was ultimately grounded in positivist\ntheses. He also believed that national reform should not be founded on\nreligion or speculative metaphysics, but on the experimental methods\nof science. With this in mind, he promoted education reform that\neliminated theology and speculative philosophy from the curriculum in\npublic schools, thus initiating a long debate on the role of\nphilosophy in public education that continues today. \nFor Mexican positivists the challenge was to reconcile freedom and\norder, both moral and natural. In his essay “De la\neducación moral” (1863), Barreda sustained that freedom\ndoes not amount to the freedom to do whatever one wants (i.e., freedom\nfrom constraint). True freedom is always constrained by the law, just\nas a free falling object falls according to the laws of\nnature. Likewise, moral freedom and progress is constrained by\nthe moral law and must be consistent with the laws of science. \nIn addition to Comte’s philosophy, Mexican intellectuals applied\nSpencer’s social evolutionism to theories about Mexican history\nand society, as can be seen in the works of Justo Sierra\n(1848–1912) and Francisco Bulnes (1847–1924). According to\nsocial evolutionism, nations are like animal species: their organs\nhave evolved to fulfill specific purposes, primarily survival. In his\nbook El porvenir de las naciones hispanoamericanas (1899),\nBulnes claimed that Mexico would have to make major changes to survive\nin its struggle against the Anglo-Saxons. From a political point of\nview, Spencer’s social evolutionism was the foundation of the\nview that progress in Mexico would result from a slow, deliberately\nplanned evolution, not another revolution. For instance, Justo\nSierra’s Evolución política del pueblo\nmexicano (1902) was used by some to justify the ongoing\ndictatorship of General Porfirio Díaz, who ruled Mexico for\nalmost three decades leading up to the Mexican Revolution of 1910. \nIn the fields of logic and epistemology, Mill’s influence was\nwidely accepted. Perhaps most influential in these areas was Porfirio\nParra’s (1845–1912) Nuevo sistema de lógica\ninductiva y deductiva (1903), in which he defends an idealist\nversion of empiricism. \nThe Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was the most significant\nevent in modern Mexican history. While it was primarily a military\ncampaign in defense of political democracy and equality, comprehensive\nagrarian reform, and workers’ rights, some argue that it was\ndeeply influenced by a “climate of ideas”, including\nclassical and social liberalism, the social doctrine of the Catholic\nChurch, socialism, anarchism, spiritism, Bergsonism, and pragmatism.\nSome of the Revolution’s most influential intellectuals were\nactivists first and foremost, such as Ricardo Flores Magón and\nFrancisco Madero, both of whom fought against the dictatorship of\nPorfirio Díaz. From 1904 until his death in 1922, Flores\nMagón lived in the United States, first as an exile and then as\na prison inmate. In many of his writings, distributed through the\nclandestine journal Regeneración, he developed a\nconception of society based on socialist and anarchist philosophy. And\nMadero, who was elected President of Mexico and who is perhaps best\nknown for his La sucesión presidencial en 1910 (1908),\nwas also an important defender of Allen Kardec’s branch of\nspiritism. \nIf some revolutionaries were primarily activists, others were\nprimarily artists and intellectuals who became the voice of their\ngeneration. Such was the case of a young group of students who\ngathered in Mexico City and referred to themselves as the\n“Ateneo de la Juventud”. Antonio Caso (1883–1946)\nand José Vasconcelos (1882–1959) were two of its most\nprominent members, both of whom criticized the predominance of\npositivism, which they found culturally demoralizing. In particular,\nthey rejected the positivist view that humanity is moved by selfish\ncalculation, that morality is accountable to the laws of nature, and\nthat the universe is governed by deterministic laws. The members of\nthe Ateneo stated that humans are free, creative, and spiritual,\ncapable of using intuition to understand the world, and inspired by\nmoral feelings that transcend the laws of nature. This conception of\nhuman beings and the world can also be considered an essential part of\nthe climate of ideas surrounding the Mexican Revolution. \nAntonio Caso was the leading figure of Mexican philosophy in the first\ndecades of the 20th century, and was most influential as a\ncharismatic professor who inspired generations of students to pursue\nphilosophy. Caso also created the Department of Philosophy at the\nNational University of Mexico and helped to introduce Mexicans to\ncontemporary European philosophers and schools of thought. His most\nimportant work, Existencia como economía, como\ndesinterés y como caridad (1919), was a challenge to\nDarwin’s theory of biology, Spencer’s social evolutionism,\nNietzsche’s doctrine of the Übermensch, and Max\nStirner’s radical egoism, and it drew inspiration from sources\nas diverse as Bergson, Tolstoy, and Christianity. \nAccording to Caso, human existence has three levels: the biological or\neconomic, the disinterested or aesthetic, and the charitable. Caso\nconsidered this last level the highest expression of human dignity and\napplied this distinction to other moral, political, and aesthetic\nproblems. In the 1930s, Caso defended academic freedom and the\nautonomy of the university and decried the changes to the 1933 Mexican\nConstitution that would reform public education along the lines of\nhistorical materialism. For example, he famously debated with the\nMexican Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano (1894–1968) about\ncongress’s plan to make public education socialist. In La\npersona humana y el estado totalitario (1941), Caso defends\ndemocracy against fascism and communism. For a comprehensive overview\nof Caso’s philosophy, see Mexican philosopher Rosa Krauze de\nKolteniuk’s (1923—2003) La filosofía de Antonio\nCaso (1961). \nJosé Vasconcelos was one of the most influential thinkers and\npromoters of Mexican culture in the 20th century. His\nreputation as an intellectual, politician, and writer is stronger than\nhis reputation as a philosopher. However, he cannot be passed over in\na history of Mexican philosophy. His theoretical works can be divided\ninto two groups. The first group includes the writings in which he\ndeveloped a philosophical system, from Estética (1936)\nto Lógica (1945), specifically an overarching\nmetaphysical view that he had sketched out as early as 1916 in his\nPitágoras, una teoría del ritmo. Vasconcelos\nbelieved that his main contribution to philosophy was the notion of an\naesthetic a priori, as well as a list of metaphysical\ncategories based on music rather than logic or science. According to\nhim, the universe is more like a symphony than a logical treatise, and\nunderstanding requires the emotions as much as the intellect. \nUnfortunately, his philosophical legacy was compromised by his\nabrasive personality and self-imposed isolation, and because he was\nnot, like Caso, a professor of philosophy. Vasconcelos considered his\nwriting on Latin American history and culture—the second group\nof writings—secondary to his philosophical work. Nevertheless,\nhis account of Latin American history and culture have been more\ninfluential than his work on philosophy. His most influential work,\nLa raza cósmica (1925), is a prophetic essay in which\nhe considers Latin America the fountain of a mixed, cosmic race that\nwill synthesize the four human races and lead humanity to the height\nof its development: the aesthetic. Although Vasconcelos believed that\nphilosophy should be studied for its own sake, and for the\nuniversality of its ideas, he also claimed that Latin American nations\nshould use philosophy to resist political, economic, and intellectual\ndomination of the countries to the north (see his\nÉtica, 1932). \nIn the late 1920s the pedagogical and social ideas of John Dewey were\ninfluential in Mexican education. Vasconcelos believed that\nDewey’s philosophy was a vehicle for US imperialism and wrote a\ncriticism of Dewey titled De Robinson a Odiseo (1935). \nThe intellectual atmosphere of the 1930s underwent dramatic changes:\nthe new generation of students, many of whom were\nprotégés of Caso and Vasconcelos, were not interested in\nthe debate between determinism and freedom or materialism and spirit.\nTo them, values, objectivity, and social responsibility were the\ncentral issues of the day. They rejected the intuitionism and the\nirrationalism of Caso and Vasconcelos and favored a renewed\nrationalism and universalism. Critical reflection on what it means to\nbe Mexican also started to gain importance, although it was not until\nthe end of the 1940s that it reached full prominence. \nAt the time, Mexican philosophers also gained confidence in their role\non the international stage. On the one hand, post-revolutionary\nMexican culture was enjoying something of a golden age of creativity,\nparticularly concerning its own authentic national identity. On the\nother hand, the two world wars convinced many intellectuals that the\nfuture of Western Civilization was to be found in America. The\nconstruction of an American philosophy and, in particular, of Mexican\nphilosophy, was seen as the only way the philosophical tradition of\nAncient Greece could be rescued from European decadence and\nsavagery. \nIn the 1930s and 1940s, former students of Caso, such as José\nRomano Muñoz (1890–1967), Samuel Ramos (1897–1959),\nAdalberto García de Mendoza (1900–1963), Oswaldo Robles\n(1905–1969), Edmundo O’Gorman (1906–1995), Francisco\nLarroyo (1908–1981), Eduardo García Máynez\n(1908–1993), Antonio Gómez Robledo (1908–1994) and\nGuillermo Héctor Rodríguez (1910–1988) adopted and\npromoted philosophical currents from Germany, such as Neo-Kantianism\nof the Marburg and Baden schools, Dilthey’s historicism,\nHusserl’s phenomenology, Heidegger’s existentialism,\nKelsen’s legal positivism and, above all, the philosophy of\nvalues of Scheler and Hartmann. José Ortega y Gasset,\nspecifically his journal Revista de Occidente, also\ninfluenced that generation. \nSome philosophers, such as Samuel Ramos, employed European models and\nideals to reflect inwardly on what Ramos referred to as “the\nMexican psyche”. Ramos was a famous critic of Caso’s\nphilosophical style and defense of irrationalism, and he believed that\nthe country needed a new philosophy that could diagnose the flaws in\nthe Mexican character, specifically one that committed Mexicans to\nuniversal values, especially the use of reason. Thus, although Ramos\nphilosophized about the Mexican character, he ultimately believed that\nMexican philosophy ought to be dedicated to the rigorous study of\nbeing human and the objective field of values. Ramos also became\ninterested in aesthetics and promoted the professionalization of\nphilosophy. Some of his most important works are: Perfil del\nhombre y la cultura en México (1934), Hacia un nuevo\nhumanismo (1940), and Filosofía de la vida\nartística (1950). \nNot all philosophers were enthusiastic about applying philosophy to\nMexican themes. For example, Francisco Larroyo was the main\nrepresentative of Neo-Kantianism in Mexico, and wrote many books in\ndefense of Neo-Kantian views on philosophy, science, and education,\nincluding La filosofía de los valores (1936) and\nLa lógica de las ciencias (1938). Larroyo claimed that\nMexico’s progress required a rigorous, rationalist, and\nscientific philosophy. Another well-known Neo-Kantian and Kelsenian\nwas Guillermo Héctor Rodríguez. \nAside from defending neo-Kantianism, some philosophers defended and\nrefined neo-Thomism, such as Oswaldo Robles, who sought to reconcile\nNeo-Thomism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis. Among his books we\nmight mention La teoría de la idea en Malebranche y la\ntradición filosófica (1937) and Esquema de\nantropología filosófica (1942). \nFinally, a complete history of the first half of the 20th\ncentury Mexican philosophy would be remiss if it did not discuss the\ndevelopment of Marxism in Mexico, particularly the work of Vicente\nLombardo Toledano. Like many of the intellectuals in our survey, the\nphilosophical contribution of Lombardo Toledano is complicated by the\nfact that he was, perhaps first and foremost, a labor leader and a\npolitician—a scholar-activist—and because he developed\nmany of his ideas through public debate and discourse (cf. the debate\nbetween Caso and Lombardo mentioned above). Nevertheless, Lombardo\nwrote one of the first philosophical analyses of the Mexican\nRevolution and his works are essential reading for those interested in\nMarxist interpretations of Mexican themes in the first half of the\n20th century. \nSome philosophers stretched the concept of philosophy to combine\nhistorical, philosophical, and literary analysis to both Mexican and\nuniversal themes. For instance, in his essay “Del arte o de la\nmonstruosidad” (1940), the distinguished historian and\nphilosopher Edmundo O’Gorman maintained that the study of\nPre-Columbian art should be based on different categories from those\nused to evaluate European art. In Crisis y porvenir de la ciencia\nhistórica (1947), he criticized positivist historiography\nfrom the point of view of historicism and existentialism, and set the\ntheoretical foundations for his subsequent notion of “the\ninvention of America”. Likewise, while Alfonso Reyes\n(1889–1959) and Octavio Paz (1914–1998) were not\nprofessional philosophers, they authored texts that should not be\nexcluded from a history of Mexican philosophy. In El deslinde\n(1944), Reyes offered a theory of literature using tools of\nphenomenology and in El arco y la lira (1956), Paz wrote a\nliterary theory that used elements from existentialism and\nstructuralism. \nConcerning the professionalization of philosophy in Mexico, Eduardo\nGarcía Máynez stands out both for his philosophical and\nfor his administrative contributions. In 1940–41, García\nMáynez founded and was the first director of the Centro de\nEstudios Filosóficas, which was eventually renamed the\nInstituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas, and he\nfounded the influential journal Filosfía y Letras,\nwhich continued to be published until 1958. His book Los\nprincipios de la ontología formal del derecho y su\nexpresión simbólica (1953) marked the beginning of\nthe logical turn in Mexican philosophy, anticipating the linguistic\nturn of analytic philosophy in Mexico a decade later. Some of his\nother works include: La definición del derecho. Ensayo de\nperspectivismo jurídico (1948) and Filosofía\ndel derecho (1974). García Máynez claimed that the\nvalidity of the law depends on the existence of objective values, but\nhe added that, in spite of their objectivity, values are subject to\nseveral forms of relativism in relation to culture, concrete practice,\nand geography. Like Ramos, García Máynez believed Mexico\nneeded an objectivist axiology to progress socially. He also claimed\nthat legal freedom was a “second order” right, that is, a\nnormative right to exercise certain independent faculties through\nchoice. The development of this thesis forced him to sustain that any\nsystem of normativity that is axiomatic and formal contains a\npriori principles. His “theory of the three circles”\nmaintains that the definitions of law as formally valid, as\nintrinsically valid, and as a positive right are not theoretically\ncompatible, though they are compatible in practice. \nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) forced some of the most\nprominent Spanish philosophers to move to Mexico. Joaquín Xirau\n(1895–1946), José Gallegos Rocafull (1895–1963),\nWenceslao Roces (1897–1992), José Gaos (1900–1969),\nLuis Recasens Siches (1903–1977), Eugenio Ímaz\n(1900–1951) and Eduardo Nicol (1907–1990), would live,\nspend their careers, and die in Mexico. Juan David García Bacca\n(1901–1992) and María Zambrano (1907–1991) spent\npart of their exile in Mexico. Adolfo Sánchez Vázquez\n(1915–2011), Ramón Xirau (1924–2017), and Carmen\nRovira (b. 1923) arrived in Mexico at a young age, and completed their\nstudies in their newly adopted country. All of them left a valuable\nimprint on Mexican philosophy through their creativity, teaching, and\ntranslations. \nJoaquín Xirau wrote several books on metaphysics, the history\nof philosophy, and the philosophy of education. After arriving in\nMexico, he wrote Amor y mundo (1940), a reflection on love\nunderstood as Eros and caritas. His ontology is\ndialectical, and he claims that being and value, as well as subject\nand object, are merely abstract ideas if they are considered static\nrealities outside change. His premature death at the age of 50\nprevented him from being more influential than he should have\nbeen. \nJosé Gaos wrote the majority of his published material in\nMexico, and he is remembered, above all, for his extraordinary\ninfluence as a professor and mentor. For his own part, Gaos defended a\nradical version of perspectivism: for Gaos, philosophy is a personal\nconfession, so no philosophy is better or worse than another since\neach is, in the end, the expression of an individual. His most\nimportant works are: Del hombre (1970) and De la\nfilosofía (1962). His research in the history of ideas in\nMexico and Latin America were also extremely influential. His ideas on\nhow to teach philosophy were included in the curricula of several\ndepartments of philosophy throughout the country. Among his students\nwere some of the most important philosophers of the second half of the\n20th century. \nLuis Recasens Siches, a philosopher of law, wrote many books in which\nthe influence of José Ortega y Gasset was apparent. Among them\nis Vida humana, sociedad y derecho (1940). \nEduardo Nicol founded the Metaphysics Seminar at the Department of\nPhilosophy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he\ntaught with rigor and brilliance, and in 1955 he founded the\ninfluential journal Dianoia, still published today. For\nNicol, philosophy ought to recover its place as the primary science.\nHis metaphysics, dialectical in essence, wanted to reconcile being and\nrepresentation, and truth and history. All of his works were written\nin Mexico, including: La idea del hombre (1946),\nMetafísica de la expresión (1957), and Los\nprincipios de la ciencia (1965). \nIn 1934, Samuel Ramos published one of the most important books on\nMexican culture, Perfil del hombre y la cultura en\nMéxico, an analysis of history, culture, and the Mexican\ncharacter, which he believed suffered from an inferiority complex.\nAccording to Ramos, Mexicans had set goals that were impossible to\naccomplish, particularly because they had tried to imitate more\ndeveloped nations, and this had instilled in them a feeling of\ninferiority that explains their individual and collective behavior, as\nwell as many of the problems of Mexican society and politics.\nRamos’s book was very controversial and prompted similar studies\nof Mexican being, such as Octavio Paz’s El laberinto de la\nsoledad (1950). \nThe Hyperion Group was a group of young philosophers from the National\nAutonomous University of Mexico that included Leopoldo Zea\n(1912–2006), Jorge Portilla (1918–1963), Ricardo Guerra\n(1928–2007), Emilio Uranga (1921–1988), and Luis Villoro\n(1922–2014). It was active between 1948 and 1952, and its\npurpose was to employ the categories of existentialism to analyze\nMexico and Mexican being, an analysis that was meant to reveal the\nreality of Mexico and Mexican being and encourage Mexicans to\ntransform their reality. \nJorge Portilla’s posthumously\npublished Fenomenología del relajo (1966) is a\nphenomenological study of the complexity of Mexican morality and\nbehavior. \nArguably the most important work of the Hyperion group was\nAnálisis del ser del mexicano (1952) by Emilio Uranga.\nThis book proposes an ontology of mexicanidad and a\nphilosophy of Mexican culture. According to Uranga, the negative\ntraits that characterize the Mexican, such as resentment, melancholy,\nand zozobra, are expressions of a constitutive mode of\nMexican existence that he calls “accidentality”. (Here\nUranga is employing the Scholastic distinction between accident and\nsubstance.) Uranga argues further that although Mexicans had been made\nto feel inferior throughout their history—specifically, although\nEuropeans had argued that Mexicans were less than fully\nhuman—Mexicans were in fact closer to the essence of being\nhuman, defined as accidentality. As a result, it was the European who\nhad a lesson to learn from the Mexican, not the other way around. If\nthe Conquest of Mexico tried to assimilate Mexican culture to European\nculture, what Uranga did was try to assimilate the whole of what it\nmeans to be human to the Mexican experience of humanity, that is, to\nmake humanity recognize and value its repressed accidentality. By\nidentifying mexicanidad with accidentality, Uranga transforms\nMexican being into an ontological category. \nThe filosofía de lo mexicano (the philosophy of\nMexicanness) was a creative and original movement that impacted other\nareas of culture. However, after the 1960s the desire to treat Mexico\nas the object of philosophical inquiry declined, and it is only in the\nlast few years that a small group of Mexican and Mexican-American\nphilosophers have, in collaboration, attempted to rescue elements of\nthat movement to think about Mexico from a philosophical point of view\nand to think about philosophy from a Mexican point of view. \nLeopoldo Zea was the most influential Mexican philosopher in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, particularly in Latin\nAmerica and the former Soviet Bloc. Some of his books are: El\npositivismo en México (1943), América en la\nhistoria (1957), La filosofía americana como\nfilosofía sin más (1969), and Discurso desde la\nmarginación y la barbarie (1988). \nIn his essay “En torno a una filosofía americana”\n(1945), Zea sustained that Latin American philosophy should devote\nitself to topics that are specifically Latin American, in addition to\nthe universal problems of any other philosophy. In “La\nfilosofía como compromiso” (1948), he claims that Latin\nAmerican philosophy should aim to transform the reality of the\nphilosopher, not just understand it. From that point forward,\nZea’s work adopts a clearly defined ideological and political\npurpose of emancipating Latin America and the “Third\nWorld”. \nIn a word, Zea considers philosophy an instrument of liberation. He\nstrongly objected to a Eurocentric account of human nature, history,\nand reason—a critique that would evolve more fully decades later\nwith postmodernism and post-colonialism. During most of the second\nhalf of the 20th century, Zea promoted “Latin\nAmerican philosophy”, understood as an academic discipline that\ncombines the interdisciplinary study of society, thought, and history\nin this region of the world. \nOther Mexican philosophers who have contributed to the development of\nLatin American philosophy are Joaquín Sánchez McGregor\n(1925–2008), Abelardo Villegas (1934–2001), Mario\nMagallón Anaya (b. 1946) and Horacio Cerutti (b. 1950). \nLuis Villoro was a diligent student of the most important\nphilosophical currents of the second half of the 20th\ncentury: existentialism, phenomenology, Marxism, analytic philosophy,\nand multiculturalism. However, in his reflections one can observe a\ncommon thread of lasting questions concerning the metaphysical\nunderstanding of alterity, the limits and boundaries of reason, the\nrelationship between knowledge and power, community, an ethical\nreflection of injustice, a defense of and respect for cultural\ndiversity, and a critical examination of the role of philosophy. Some\nof his books are: Los grandes momentos del indigenismo en\nMéxico (1950), Creer, saber, conocer (1982),\nEl concepto de ideología (1985), and El poder y el\nvalor (1997). \nIn Creer, saber, conocer, a book that belongs to the\nanalytical tradition, Villoro develops an epistemology that eliminates\ntruth from the definition of knowledge in order to make sense of the\nhistorical and political dimensions of epistemology in practice. For\nVilloro, “to know p” is “to believe p\nwith sufficiently objective reasons”. And one’s reasons\nfor believing that p are sufficiently objective if they are\nconclusive, complete, and coherent, regardless of who\nsustains p.  However, one’s reasons can be sufficiently\nobjective in one epistemic community but not another. This leads to an\nepistemic relativism accepted by Villoro as the only way to respond to\nthe challenge of skepticism (see related entry on\n epistemology in Latin America).\n In “Filosofía y dominación” (1978), he\nsustained that philosophy must always critique inherited and imposed\nbeliefs by exercising the independent use of reason, that is, without\nbecoming ideological. \nIn El poder y el valor, Villoro reflects on the nature of\npolitical power and moral values. After a comprehensive and insightful\nanalysis, Villoro sustains that we should give priority to the values\nthat bind individuals to their community, without, of course,\nundermining either individual freedom or social order. Ultimately,\nVilloro defends a form of radical democracy according to which\npolitical power is concentrated in the hands of ordinary people\nimmersed in concrete social networks. Villoro believed that indigenous\ncommunities of Mexico are a living model of the variety of social and\npolitical egalitarianism he endorsed, and any intellectual biography\nof Villoro would be incomplete without mentioning that Villoro was a\nsecret member of The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and had a\nphilosophically rich correspondence with Subcomandante Marcos. \nIn the 20th century, several Mexican philosophers developed\nforms of humanism and metaphysics from perspectives as dissimilar as\nHellenism, Thomism, and existentialism. \nAntonio Gómez Robledo (1908–1994) was a distinguished\nhumanist and jurist who studied and defended the value of Greco-Latin\nand Christian cultures elegantly and non-dogmatically. Among his works\nare: Ensayo sobre las virtudes intelectuales (1957),\nMeditación sobre la justicia (1963), and\nSócrates y el socratismo (1966). He also translated\nPlato’s Republic, Aristotle’s Politics,\nMarcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and other classics. His\nstudies of the principles of international law and the Spanish\ntradition of law should also be included in the history of Mexican\nphilosophy. \nRamón Xirau wrote philosophy, literary criticism, and poetry,\nand combined them in enriching ways. Xirau wrote about the\nrelationship between philosophy and poetry as two different forms of\nknowledge, and about the ontological nature of being human,\nunderstanding ser and estar as different categories.\nAmong his best-known books are: Introducción a la historia\nde la filosofía (1964), Poesía y\nconocimiento (1979), and El tiempo vivido (1985). \nJuliana González (b. 1936) was a student of Eduardo Nicol. She\nhas taught and written about the main problems of philosophical and\nmoral anthropology as well as about Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger.\nGonzález’s ethics are grounded in a complex vision of the\nhuman being, which emphasizes our capacity to choose. González\nhas also dealt with the ethical and metaphysical dimension of\npsychoanalysis and genomics. Some of her books include\nÉtica y libertad (1989a), El malestar en la\nmoral (1989b), and El poder del Eros (1999). \nCarmen Rovira (b. 1923) was a student of Gaos. Over the course of her\nlong academic career, she has labored to introduce and analyze the\nhistory of ideas in Mexico, particularly medieval philosophy in\nMexico. In addition to all her edited collections, Rovira authored\nEclécticos portugueses del siglo XVIII y algunas de sus\ninfluencias en América (1958) and Francisco de\nVitoria. España y América. El poder y el\nhombre (2004). \nElsa Cecilia Frost (1928–2005) was also a student of Gaos, as\nwas O’Gorman and Leon-Portilla. Her main interests lay with the\nhistory of colonial philosophy and the processes of acculturation that\ncreated modern Mexican culture. Her text Categorias de la cultura\nmexicana (1972) is a widely studied and well-regarded text in the\nphilosophy of Mexican culture. \nJosé Sánchez Villaseñor (1911–1961),\nFernando Sodi Pallares (1917–1980), Héctor\nGonzález Uribe (1918–1988), José Sanabria\n(1924–2002) and Miguel Mansur (1928–1993) all taught\nNeo-Thomism at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Carlos Llano\n(1932–2010), Virginia Aspe (b. 1952), Héctor Zagal (b.\n1963) and Luis Xavier López Farjeat (b. 1973) all studied the\nAristotelian tradition at the Universidad Panamericana. In Monterrey,\nAgustín Basave Fernández del Valle (1923–2006),\ndeveloped what he called an integralismo metafísico\nantroposófico. Among his many books we can single out\nTratado de metafísica. Teoría de la habencia\n(1982). \nSocialist and Marxist thought was a popular ideology during the\nMexican Revolution. In addition to the work of Lombardo Toledano who\nemployed a Marxist framework to explain Mexico’s situation,\nJosé Revueltas (1914–1976) was an unorthodox Marxist who\ndiscussed philosophical themes in his literary and political writings.\nDespite the influence of Lombardo and Revueltas, however, academics\ndidn’t take Marxism seriously until the 1970s. Two central\nfigures of Marxism in the Mexican academy during that period were Eli\nde Gortari (1918–1991) and Adolfo Sánchez\nVázquez. \nDe Gortari was one of the first academic philosophers of science in\nMexico. He studied the foundation of dialectical logic and the\napplications of logic to science, and worked on the philosophy of\nmathematics and physics, the mechanization of propositional calculus,\nand the history of science in Mexico. In 1955 he founded the Seminar\nof Scientific and Philosophical Problems. Among his books are La\nciencia de la lógica (1950) and Dialéctica de\nla Física (1964). \nAdolfo Sánchez Vázquez was very young when he arrived in\nMexico and he began his philosophical studies in Mexico. He produced a\nsolid body of work dealing with the concepts of Marxist ethics and\naesthetics. One contribution to Marxist philosophy was his critical\nreflection on the concept of praxis, and he was critical of\nthe aesthetic doctrine of Socialist realism. Among his main books we\ncan mention: Las ideas estéticas de Marx (1965),\nUna filosofía de la praxis (1967), and\nÉtica (1969). Many Mexican Marxist philosophers of\nsubsequent generations studied under him, and there was an important\ndebate between Sánchez Vazquez and Villoro concerning the\nconcept of ideology. \nThe Cuban Revolution had a profound impact among many Latin American\nintellectuals. After the 1960s, the number of Marxists increased\nexponentially, both at and outside the university, and Marxism became\nthe dominant school of thought in some Mexican universities. The books\nof Gramsci, Marcuse, and Althusser were read by many young students,\nas were the writings of José Martí, José\nCarlos Mariáteguí and Paolo Freire. The main Mexican\nMarxist philosophers of that period were: Porfirio Miranda\n(1924–2001), author of Marx y la Biblia (1971); Enrique\nGonzález Rojo (b. 1928); Cesáreo Morales (b. 1936);\nJaime Labastida (b. 1940), author of Producción, ciencia y\nsociedad: de Descartes a Marx (1969); Gabriel Vargas Lozano (b.\n1947), author of Más allá del derrumbre (1994);\nand Aureliano Ortega (b. 1952). Carlos Pereyra (1940–1988) was a\nphilosopher of history and a well-known left-wing intellectual. His\nphilosophical papers were collected in Filosofía, historia\ny política (2010). Bolívar Echeverría\n(1941–2010) wrote La modernidad de lo barroco (1998),\nin which he offers a critique of capitalist modernity from a Latin\nAmerican perspective. \nMentioned above, Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente (b.\n1957), also known as “Subcomandante Marcos” of the EZLN,\nhas been a very influential post-Marxist thinker who has put his ideas\ninto action. His correspondence with Luis Villoro is included in\nLa alternativa. Perspectiva y posibilidades de cambio\n(Villoro 2015). \nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall there was an abrupt decline in\nMarxist philosophy. As intellectuals debated how best to reform the\nMexican state, they began to read other foreign political\nphilosophers, such as Weber, Arendt, Rawls, Bobbio and Habermas. Some\nof the philosophers who have focused on the nature of democracy,\njustice, and poverty include: Luis Aguilar Villanueva (b. 1938);\nPaulette Dieterlen (b. 1947), author of La pobreza: un estudio\nfilosófico (2003); Luis Salazar (b. 1949); León\nOlivé (1950–2017); Griselda Gutiérrez (1951);\nMaría Pía Lara (b. 1954), author of Moral\ntextures (1998); Ambrosio Velasco (b. 1954); Rodolfo\nVázquez (b. 1956), author of Entre la libertad y la\nigualdad (2006); Mario Teodoro Ramírez (b. 1958), author\nof De la razón a la praxis (2003); and Enrique Serrano\n(b. 1958). \nMexican political philosophy played an important role in two public\ndebates of that period. One concerned the extent to which leftist\npolitical groups were willing accept electoral democracy as opposed to\narmed revolution, like that of Cuba. Another concerned whether Mexico\nwas better described as a homogenous mestizo nation or a racially and\nculturally diverse country. \nThe philosophy of liberation was a movement that originated in South\nAmerica in the early 1970s. In the beginning, it mixed elements of\nliberation theology, dependency theory, and Latin American philosophy.\nEnrique Dussel (b. 1934 in Argentina) is the main representative of\nthe philosophy of liberation in Mexico. Among his numerous works,\nwhich have been translated widely into other languages, are\nFilosofía de la liberación (1977 [2003]) and\nÉtica de la liberación en la edad de la\nglobalización y la exclusión (1998 [2013]). Dussel\nhas offered a comprehensive critique of Western history and philosophy\nfrom the point of view of the poor and the excluded, particularly in\nLatin America. The Dusselian branch of the filosofía de la\nliberación is a vigorous movement with students all over\nthe world. (See the related entry on\n the philosophy of liberation) \nBeginning in the early 1960s, philosophers began to study analytic\nphilosophy, particularly authors such as Russell, Carnap,\nWittgenstein, Strawson, and Quine. At the time, it was claimed that a\nphilosophy inspired by science was required to modernize Mexico, not\nunlike the positivist turn in the second half of the 19th\ncentury. The creation of the journal Crítica in 1967\naccelerated the popularity of analytic philosophy in Mexico. At the\nend of the 1960s, the Institute for Philosophical Research of the\nNational Autonomous University of Mexico became the main center of\nanalytic philosophy in the country and in Latin America. The main\npromoters of analytic philosophy during that period were Alejandro\nRossi (1932–2009), author of Lenguaje y significado\n(1969), and Fernando Salmerón (1925–1997), who also wrote\nextensively on the history of Mexican philosophy. \nBy the end of the 1970s, a group of analytic philosophers had\ndistinguished themselves: Enrique Villanueva (b. 1938), José\nAntonio Robles (1938–2014), Margarita Valdés (b. 1941),\nHugo Margáin (1942–1978), and Olbeth Hansberg (b. 1943),\nauthor of La diversidad de las emociones (b. 1996). In the\n1980s, more analytic philosophers joined the Institute of\nPhilosophical research, among them: Raúl Orayen\n(1942–2003), who wrote Lógica, significado y\nontología (1989); Ulises Moulines (b. 1946), a\nstructuralist philosopher of science; Mark Platts (b. 1947), author of\nWays of Meaning (1979); León Olivé\n(1950–2017), who wrote several books of philosophy of science\nand culture; and Adolfo García de la Sienra (b. 1951), a\ntheologian and philosopher of economics. \nMexican analytic philosophy has followed the dominant trends of\nanalytic philosophy since the 1960s. In the beginning, it had strong\nties to Oxford, but today it has developed working relationships with\nother philosophical departments around the world. Some Mexican\nanalytic philosophers have studied abroad and have remained outside\nMexico, such as Agustín Rayo (b. 1973). Others work in Mexico\nbut publish most of their work in English, such as Mario Gómez\nTorrente (b. 1967). Others write in both English and Spanish, such as\nMayté Ezcurdia (1966–2018). Still others write mainly in\nSpanish, like Alejandro Tomasini Bassols (b. 1952), who has written a large\nnumber of books that develop an original interpretation of\nWittgenstein’s philosophy. \nCarlos Pereda (b. 1944) has also written several important books,\nincluding Vértigos argumentales (1994),\nCrítica de la razón arrogante (1999), and\nSobre la confianza (2009). He develops Aristotle’s\nnotion of phronesis and Kant’s view that practical\nreason is universal to recommend strategies to help navigate the\ntemptations and ambiguities of life. Pereda offers a peculiar\ndiagnosis of the entanglements and pathologies of reason, including\nwhat he calls argumentative vertigo, that is, a kind of\nintellectual or moral dizziness that blinds us to other points of view\nor that makes us stubborn and insensitive to the feelings of\nothers. \nThe main exponent of philosophical hermeneutics, Mauricio Beuchot (b.\n1950), distinguished himself early as a historian and a translator of\nthe philosophy of New Spain and medieval philosophy (e.g., La\nfilosofía del lenguaje en la Edad Media, 1981), as well as\nfor his synthesis of Thomism and analytic philosophy (e.g.,\nLógica y ontología, 1986). In the 1990s,\nhowever, he turned to hermeneutics. In his Tratado de\nhermenéutica analógica (1997), he developed a\nsystem that he called “analogical hermeneutics”. His\nthesis is that, to avoid the excesses of positivist\n“univocalism” or postmodern “equivocalism”,\none must adopt analogy as the primary method of interpretation.\nBeuchot’s analogical hermeneutics has inspired a philosophical\nmovement with hundreds of students around the world. \nAlthough Mexican women have had full legal access to higher education\nsince the beginning of the 20th century, they were\ndiscouraged from pursuing advanced degrees or careers as professors of\nphilosophy. With a few notable exceptions, it wasn’t until after\n1960—not incidentally, the year birth control was made widely\navailable—that women began to publish their own philosophy more\nregularly. In addition to several of the women mentioned above (e.g.,\nKrauze, Frost, Rovira), Vera Yamuni Tabush (1917–2003), another\nstudent of Gaos, wrote about philosophy in the Spanish language,\nArabic philosophy, and feminism. See, for example, her highly-regarded\nConceptos e imágenes en pensadores de lengua\nespañola (1951). \nAs women started to pursue advanced degrees in philosophy, they began\nto philosophize about the role of women in Mexican culture and the\nchallenges facing aspiring female intellectuals and artists. The long\nlist of Mexican feminists, which stretches back as far as Sor Juana,\nincludes Paula Gómez Alonso (1896–1972), the first\ngraduate of philosophy of the University of México, whose\nmaster’s thesis was titled La cultura femenina (1933);\nRosario Castellanos (1925–1974), a famous author, who wrote a\nphilosophical essay called Sobre cultura femenina (1950); and\nGraciela Hierro (1928–2003), the main proponent of feminist\nphilosophy and founder of the Centro de Estudios de Género of\nthe National Autonomous University of Mexico. Two of her books are\nÉtica y feminismo (1985), and De la\ndomesticación a la educación de las mexicanas\n(1989). \nAs in other Latin American countries, the history of philosophy is a\npopular area of research, largely because most philosophy departments\ntend to teach the discipline from a historical rather than thematic or\nanalytic perspective. The most popular periods of philosophy are\nancient philosophy, modern philosophy, phenomenology, and German\nexistentialism. Among the historians of philosophy today, we can\nmention: Laura Benitez (b. 1944), Alberto Constante (b. 1949), Antonio\nZirión (b. 1950), Enrique Hülsz (1954–2019), Gustavo\nLeyva (b. 1959), Pedro Stepanenko (b. 1960), Efraín Lazos (b.\n1962), Ernesto Priani (b. 1962), Ricardo Salles (b. 1965), Faviola\nRivera (b. 1967), and Ángel Xolocotzi (b. 1969). \nNot unlike other areas of Mexican culture, the production of\nphilosophy has been concentrated in Mexico City. However, today dozens\nof philosophy departments throughout the Mexican Republic are growing\nin size and influence. Many universities now offer graduate degrees\nand some publish their own journals and books, such as the state\nuniversities of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Puebla, Veracruz, and\nZacatecas. \nThere are several philosophical associations in Mexico, though the\nAsociación filosófica de México is the\nlargest. Since 1975, the AFM (which serves a role similar to the\nAmerican Philosophical Association (in the United States) hosts a\nlarge biannual conference that plays an essential role in forming a\nnational philosophical community (see\n Other Internet Resources below). \nPhilosophy also continues to play an important role in Mexican\nsecondary education. Although philosophy has been taught in public\nhigh schools since the 19th century, in 2009 the Mexican\ngovernment tried to eliminate philosophical instruction from public\neducation (not unlike the second half of the 19th century\nunder the guidance of Barreda’s positivist curriculum, and\nCardenas’s attempt to make education in Mexico socialist in\n1933). However, in response, a group of academics founded the\nObservatorio Filosófico de México, which\neventually thwarted government interference (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The Observatorio’s defense of philosophy in Mexico was\nso successful that in 2019, the government made a constitutional\namendment recognizing philosophical instruction as the right of all\nMexicans. \nThis official commitment to the value of philosophy is not without\nprecedent; it represents a long history of questioning and reaffirming\nthe role of philosophy in Mexican life. Other events in this history\n(discussed above) include the war for Mexican independence, guided by\nEnlightenment philosophy; Gabino Barreda’s effort to define\nMexican national identity through positivist education; the\nAteneo’s critique of positivism during the Mexican\nRevolution; amendments to the 1933 Constitution, which sought to make\npublic education socialist; and the philosophy of lo\nmexicano, a philosophical expression and critique of\n20th century Mexican nationalism. \nOne challenge to studying Mexican philosophy outside Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, has been the lack of resources in\nEnglish. However, over the past several years, a group of scholars\nhave begun to produce translations of and commentaries on canonical\ntexts. One notable example is Mexican Philosophy in the\n20th Century: Essential Readings, edited by Carlos\nAlberto Sánchez and Robert Eli Sanchez, Jr. (For future\nprojects related to making Mexican philosophy more widely available in\nEnglish, and related to building a binational community dedicate to\nthe development of Mexican philosophy, see\n 20th Century Mexican Philosophy in Other Internet Resources.)\n The APA’s Newsletter on Hispanic and Latino Issues in\nPhilosophy is another valuable source of information and research\n(see\n Other Internet Resources). \nToday, Mexican philosophy is a professional, pluralistic, and growing\nfield of study. Thanks in large part to the collaboration among\nphilosophers in Mexico and United States, the resources required to\nadvance research are now easily accessible in both Spanish and\nEnglish. And with the ongoing emergence of new translations,\ncommentaries, and histories, as well as regular binational meetings,\nit is now reasonable to expect that the philosophy produced in Mexico\nand about the Mexican (or Mexican-American) experience will continue\nto attract new scholars and will soon be recognized for its impressive\ncontribution to world philosophy.","contact.mail":"gmhp@unam.mx","contact.domain":"unam.mx"},{"date.published":"2016-01-20","date.changed":"2020-11-13","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mexico/","author1":"Guillermo Hurtado","author2":"Robert Eli Sanchez, Jr.","entry":"philosophy-mexico","body.text":"\n\n\nMexican philosophy has been influenced by a variety of traditions of\nthought, which have been combined and transformed to meet the specific\ndemands and circumstances of Mexican life. The result has been a rich\nand original tradition that is more than 500 years old and that,\ntogether with Peruvian philosophy, is the oldest of the Americas.\n\n\nAlthough Mexican philosophy has been concerned with every manner of\ntheoretical inquiry, it might be characterized by a particular concern\nwith ethical and political issues and the concrete consequences of\nphilosophical inquiry. The questions concerning human nature and the\nrelation between power and reason have been central to the development\nof Mexican philosophy, from early reflections on the justification of\nthe Spanish conquest to recent debates about democratic reform or the\nIndian insurgence in Chiapas. The critique of philosophical\neurocentrism is another central feature of Mexican philosophy.\n\n\nThe bibliography includes all the books and articles mentioned in this\narticle and a selection of secondary texts in English.\n\n\nThroughout Latin America, philosophers have raised metaphilosophical\nquestions about the originality and peculiarity of their own\nphilosophy. Likewise, it is often claimed that philosophy in\nMexico is not the same as Mexican philosophy, and that\nwhile philosophy in Mexico has a long and distinguished history, it is\nwrong to speak of Mexican philosophy, defined by the originality or\nauthenticity of its debates or theses, the distinctness of its\nschools, or the uniqueness of its style or terminology (see Romanell\n1975). Other scholars disagree and argue that there are indeed\nsubstantive, thematic, or stylistic continuities that underlie much of\nthe philosophy produced in Mexico and that allow us to speak of\nMexican philosophy as an original and authentic tradition. Still\nothers believe that although philosophy in Mexico does not constitute\na unified and distinct tradition yet, it has the potential to\nbecome one. (For an extended discussion of the difference between\n“Mexican philosophy” and “Philosophy in\nMexico”, see Hurtado 2007, particularly chapter 2.) \nTo complicate the metaphilosophical discussion further, while\nphilosophy has been produced in Mexico for over 500 years, it is\nmisleading to speak of “Mexican philosophy” before Mexico\nwon its independence from Spain in 1821. That is, with few exceptions\ndid Mexican thinkers and philosophers living under colonial rule or\nbefore think of themselves or their work as Mexican. Even\ntoday, given that the development of Mexican philosophy is emerging\nlargely as a collaborative effort among Mexican and Latinx\nphilosophers, it is perhaps more accurate to speak of\ntrans-Mexican philosophy—again, as a tradition not\nneatly defined by political borders. What we call trans-Mexican\nphilosophy should not be confused with Mexican-American or\nChicanx philosophy, although they are closely related (see\nthe related entry on\n Latinx philosophy).\n Instead, it refers to a field of inquiry that focuses on the\nextension and application of Mexican philosophy outside of Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, and on the way in which the current\ndevelopments in Mexican philosophy both in Mexico and the United\nStates are mutually supportive. \nEven allowing for a certain flexibility in how we define Mexican\nphilosophy, not all philosophers in Mexico think that cultivating\nMexican philosophy as a distinct tradition is a worthy goal. Many\nbelieve that we ought to leave the pursuit of national philosophies in\nthe past. So, like Roger Bartra, who coined the phrase the\npost-Mexican condition (see Bartra 2002), we might speak of a\npost-Mexican philosophy, that is, of a philosophy that is\nproduced in Mexico but which does not aim to represent Mexican culture\nat all. \nWe will not discuss these metaphilosophical issues further (see the\nrelated entry on\n Latin American philosophy: metaphilosophical foundations).\n Our primary concern is to provide a sketch of the history of\nphilosophy in Mexico. \nDuring the early years following the Conquest, Spaniards quickly\nrealized that pre-Conquest Mexicans possessed a complex and\nsophisticated system of beliefs about human beings and the universe.\nIn his Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva\nEspaña (1585 [1950–1982]), the Franciscan missionary\nBernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) reproduced the ancient\nMexican worldview through documents and testimonials. Centuries later,\nwith the discovery of new documents and a deeper knowledge of\nindigenous languages, we have improved our understanding of how the\noriginal inhabitants of Mesoamerica viewed the world. \nThe first historians of Mexican philosophy recognized the richness and\nsophistication of native cosmology, but they did not consider it\nphilosophy per se. However, in 1955, Miguel\nLeón-Portilla (1926–2019) challenged the received view\nand renewed our interest in Mesoamerican thought by publishing his\ninfluential La filosofía náhuatl—emphasis\non filosofía—a collection of recovered texts\ntranslated into Spanish that deal with cosmology, metaphysics,\nanthropology, ethics, and aesthetics. In his book,\nLeón-Portilla argues that the Mexica (i.e., how the Aztecs\nreferred to themselves) in fact did philosophy, and he does so by\nreconstructing their philosophical tradition and comparing it to\nAncient Greek philosophy. Years later, other authors followed his\nexample and wrote extensive commentaries on Mayan texts such as\nPopol Vuh, which provide a deeper understanding of classical\nMayan cosmology and anthropology. \nThe use of the term “philosophy” to speak of Mesoamerican\nthought has been applauded by those who believe that it is necessary\nto de-center the Western concept of philosophy. But it has been\ncriticized by those who believe that calling pre-Hispanic thought\n“philosophy” fails to appreciate what distinguishes\nWestern philosophy as an achievement from a worldview or body of\nbeliefs, which of course all peoples possess. Thus, some scholars have\nclaimed that to interpret pre-Conquest texts as philosophy is to\nretroactively attribute to them something that wasn’t there,\nspecifically a certain level of self-consciousness, rational\nreflection, and critique. Others have even questioned the authenticity\nof historical sources. \nFor instance, Quetzalcóatl, a deity of Mesoamerican culture who\nwas also the putative leader of the pre-Aztec Toltec people,\nchallenges traditional religious mythology and offers an original\nconception of divinity, the universe, and human nature. According to\nQuetzalcóatl, the supreme god is Ometéotl, the god of\nduality. Ometéotl was masculine and feminine, the creator of\nall things, and played an active role in all aspects of reality.\nHowever, since it is not clear whether Quetzalcóatl was a\nhistorical or mythical figure, it is also not clear what to make of\nthe ideas that we normally attribute to him and which have been\nfundamental in the development of our understanding of Náhuatl\nphilosophy. \nAmong the tlamatinime—wise men who followed the\nintellectual tradition of Quetzalcóatl—Tezcoco’s\nKing Nezahualcóyotl (1402–1472) was the most prominent.\nTezcoco was a small kingdom and a military ally of the Aztecs. King\nNezahualcóyotl developed a line of thought that has been\npreserved in his poetry and narrative prose, according to which he\ndoubted the permanence of human life in a world defined by change and\ndeath. If gold and jade can splinter, he mused, then human beings must\naccept that their passage on earth is transitory. However, our\nfinitude should not overwhelm us with sadness; instead, the human\nheart can find meaning in flor y canto (songs and flowers),\nwhich is how Nezahualcóyotl referred to art and beauty. Poetry\nand song persevere even as flowers wither and die, and it is our job\nto learn how to be patient and humble in the face of all that is\nbeyond our ken, such as the gods’ plans, which will forever\nremain a mystery. Though his texts are fragmentary and poetic, we\nmight consider Nezahualcóyotl a philosopher because he\nquestions mythological and religious responses to traditional\nphilosophical problems, such as essence, change, and the meaning of\nlife. In fact, we might we might compare his thought and style to that\nof Heraclitus or Parmenides. \nThe connection between pre-Hispanic thought and Mexican philosophy has\ndeepened in recent years. One example of this is the concept of\nnepantla, which Emilio Uranga (1921–1988) reintroduces\nin his book Análisis del ser del mexicano (1952).\nAccording to Uranga, nepantla refers to an ontological\ncondition of existence that captures both the specific nature of\nMexican being and the human condition more generally. Nepantla means\nto be in between two opposites without fully rejecting or adopting\neither. Several authors from both Mexico and the United States have\nsince employed the concept of nepantla in novel ways to\ndescribe various aspects of our existence (e.g., Gloria\nAnzaldúa). \nOther authors have recovered categories coined by the survivors of\nindigenous peoples and have proposed alternatives to Western\nphilosophy. For example, Carlos Lenkesdorf’s (1926–2010)\nUna filosofía en clave tojolabal (2002) offers a\nphilosophical reconstruction of beliefs and practices of the Tojolabal\nnatives who live in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Lenkesdorf studies\nthe language and everyday practices of the Tojolabal people to propose\nan entirely different way of understanding the relationship between\npersons, community, and nature. We can also find key concepts of\nindigenous Mexicans in the political thought of the members of the\nZapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). \nOne recent effort to reconstruct pre-Hispanic thought is James\nMaffie’s Aztec Philosophy (2015). Using a broad\nselection of sources, old and new, Maffie offers a reconstruction of\nAztec metaphysics that employs categories and concepts of Western\nmetaphysics to demonstrate the originality of Nahuatl thinking. \nThe conquest of the Americas and, in particular, of the Aztec Empire,\nwas an event of global significance that immediately challenged\nSpanish-language philosophers and theologians to reflect on what it\nmeans to be human, whether war, colonization, and slavery are ever\njustified and under what conditions, as well as the meaning of and\nrelationship between “America” and\n“Europe”. \nA professor at the University of Salamanca, Francisco de Vitoria\n(1483–1546) questioned whether the Spanish colonization of the\nAmerican continent constituted “just war”. Unlike other\nauthors who had witnessed the cruelty of Spanish colonization\nfirsthand and who doubted whether conquest and colonization could ever\nbe rationally justified, Vitoria never traveled to America and thus\nhad no direct experience in the matter. \nFather Bartolomé de las Casas (1484–1566) did have\nextensive experience in Mexico and objected to Spanish colonization.\nIn 1550–1551, he engaged in a famous debate with Juan\nGinés de Sepúlveda about whether the indigenous people\nwere fully human. Las Casas claimed that the natives were rational\nbeings, not unlike Europeans, and should be considered fully human\nwith the same right to be protected under natural law, to choose their\nown form of government, and to be free. Consequently, Las Casas\nbelieved that Spaniards did not have the right to enslave or otherwise\nrule them. The ideas of Las Casas proved crucial in the Laws of the\nIndies (1542), which required certain protections of indigenous people\nof the Americas. \nIn the middle of the 16th century, the influence of\nErasmus’ humanism was manifest in authors who wanted to return\nto the doctrinal simplicity and moral purity of early Christianity, a\nneo-stoic reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle that emphasized human\ndignity. We can also trace the influence of Thomas More’s\nUtopia, which inspired social experiments conducted in New\nSpain. \nFather Juan de Zumárraga (1468–1548) founded El Colegio\nde Tlatelolco, a school in which the natives were instructed in\nChristian theology and philosophy. He also helped install the first\npress in 1539, and he conceived the creation of the Royal and\nPontifical University of Mexico (the predecessor to the National\nUniversity of Mexico today). Zumárraga wrote several books that\nexhibit the influence of Erasmus and of the Spanish humanist\nConstantino Ponce, who was a chaplain in Charles I’s court and\nlater accused by the Inquisition of being a Protestant. \nVasco de Quiroga (died 1565) founded hospital-towns in\nMichoacán that were inspired by the communities described in\nThomas More’s Utopia. According to Vasco de Quiroga,\nthe natives lived in a golden age as described by Lucian of Samosata\nin his Saturnalia. \nPhillip II of Spain sent Francisco Hernández (died 1578) to\nstudy the flora and fauna of New Spain. Once in Mexico,\nHernández wrote several philosophical works with commentaries\non Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. \nOf course European intellectuals were not alone in thinking about the\npolitical and intellectual consequences of conquest and colonization.\nTo represent the native perspective on conquest and colonization,\nMiguel León Portilla published La visión de los\nvencidos (The Broken Spears in its English translation)\nin 1959. And in 1958, Edmundo O’Gorman (1906–1995)\npublished La invención de América, which\nchallenges the assumption that Europeans “discovered”\nAmerica, that is, that America was an undiscovered location that\nColumbus both knew of and went in search of. Instead, as O’\nGorman points out, Columbus went in search of Asia and only\naccidentally happened upon what Europeans would later call\n“America” ex post facto, making both the idea of\nAmerica, its so-called discovery, and European attitudes toward it and\nits inhabitants, a construction based entirely on European assumptions\nand beliefs. \nBecause the Spanish Empire was characterized by its Catholic zeal, it\ndid not allow Protestant, pagan, or “modern” philosophies\nto be studied in New Spain. Instead, Scholasticism was the only school\nof philosophy that was approved by colonial authorities and the\nCatholic Church. Nevertheless, a number of prominent philosophers in\nMexico made lasting and original contributions to the Scholastic\ntradition. \nFriar Alonso de la Veracruz (1507–1584) was the first\nphilosopher of New Spain. A student of Vitoria, he was one of the\nfirst to teach Scholastic philosophy in the New World and was the\nfirst published philosopher of New Spain. He wrote several\ncommentaries on Aristotle, such as Recognitio summularum\n(1554a), Dialectica resolutio (1554b), and Physica\nspeculatio (1557), which were used as textbooks. Like Vitoria,\nAlonso also questioned the justification of the Conquest, but he was\neven more sympathetic toward the indigenous population. Alonso argued\nthat the natives did not lose their right to their lands because they\nwere pagans, and he claimed that the Spanish Crown had stolen them\nfrom their lawful owners. He also sustained that sovereignty\nultimately belongs to the people, not the king. \nThe Jesuit priest Antonio Rubio stands out among the philosophers of\nthe 16th century. Born in Spain, he established himself in\nNew Spain from 1576 to 1600 and wrote a famous treatise of logic\ntitled Lógica mexicana (1603). The University of\nAlcalá adopted Lógica mexicana as its primary\nlogic textbook and many editions of an abridged version were printed\nin Europe. We know, for instance, that Descartes studied Rubio’s\nLógica as a pupil in La Fleche. Rubio wrote other\nbooks in which he offered a complete course in philosophy but, while\nhis works on natural philosophy were published, his work on\nmetaphysics was not, perhaps due to the popularity of Francisco\nSuárez’s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597). \nAnother notable philosopher in New Spain from the 16th\ncentury is Tomás Mercado, who wrote several studies on logic\nand the philosophy of economics, specifically on the rationality and\njustice of commercial trade. \nIn the 17th century, the Dominicans, the Augustinians, the\nJesuits, and the Franciscans continued to cultivate Scholastic\nphilosophy, in accordance with their specific religious orientation.\nHowever, the practice of philosophy was almost always lacking in\ninnovation or critique. A paradigmatic representative of this\ntraditional view of philosophy is Francisco Naranjo, a scholar who was\nknown for his ability to recite the entirety of Thomas Aquinas’\nSumma Theologica by heart. Other philosophers from that same\nperiod include Diego Basalenque, Juan de Rueda, Alonso Guerrero, and\nDiego Martín Alcázar. \nIn Europe, the 17th century is known as the Spanish Golden\nAge, producing figures such as Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de\nGóngora in literature, and Diego Velázquez and\nBartolomé Murillo in painting. Likewise, we can speak of a\nGolden Age in New Spain. Three extraordinary figures of the\n17th century’s Mexican baroque period cannot be\nomitted from a history of Mexican philosophy: Father Miguel\nSánchez, Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, and Sister\nJuana Inés de la Cruz. All three of them were born in Mexico,\nwrote in Spanish, and were familiar with the Náhuatl language\nand culture. \nFather Miguel Sánchez (1594–1674) studied at the\nUniversity of Mexico, but was eventually not accepted as a member of\nits faculty. Sánchez is the author of Imagen de la Virgen\nMaría (1648) in which he offers a theological and\nphilosophical interpretation of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Even though\nthe influence of Saint Augustine is dominant in his analysis,\nSánchez was one of the first intellectuals to approach human\nhistory from a Latin American perspective. \nCarlos Sigüenza y Góngora (1645–1700) was a\nremarkable scientist, historian, and philosopher. He taught astronomy\nand mathematics at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, and\nhe became known for his opposition to the belief that comets were\nharbingers of catastrophes. In his book, Libra astronómica\ny filosófica (1690 [1984]), Sigüenza y Góngora\nwas one of the first intellectuals in New Spain to examine the\nadvancements of Galileo Galilei, Descartes, and Kepler with scientific\nrigor. He was also well versed in pre-Columbian thought and culture,\nand rescued the moral and political practices and beliefs of the\nancient Aztecs, presenting them as an example to live by. \nSister Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695) was not allowed\nto enroll in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico because she\nwas a woman. However, she became world-renowned for her wisdom and\nliterary talent. Although Juana Inés de la Cruz was not a\nphilosopher by trade, her writings contain elements of philosophy,\nfrom stoicism and hermeticism to post-Cartesian philosophy. Her long\npoem Primero sueño (1692) is an erudite reflection on\nepistemology and theology based on several classical and contemporary\nworks. Juana Inés de la Cruz is also well-known as an early\nfeminist who described the unfavorable conditions under which women\nwere forced to produce their own philosophy. Her “Respuesta a\nSor Filotea de la Cruz” (1691) is a feminist reflection\navant la lettre in which she argues that men and women should\nbe allowed to develop fully under the same conditions. In that\nbrilliant and erudite text, she famously claims that “if\nAristotle would have been a cook, he would have written even\nmore”. \nIn both the 17th and 18th centuries, it was\nresponsibility of the main religious orders to teach philosophy in New\nSpain, in accordance with their specific doctrinal orientation.\nFranciscans adopted the philosophy of Duns Scotus; Dominicans, that of\nThomas Aquinas; and the Jesuits were more receptive to modern\nphilosophy. However, in the 18th century, the most\ninfluential philosophers struggled to reconcile the apparent tension\nbetween religion and science and between the modern and Scholastic\ntradition. \nIn the 18th century, the Jesuits were leaders in education\nand culture in New Spain. Their work is of central importance, not\nonly because they adapted modern European thought to their own\ncircumstances, but also because they helped to instill a sense of\nnational identity that would result in political independence from\nSpain in the 19th century. However, in 1767, at the height\nof their influence (and precisely because of their influence), the\nSpanish Crown expelled the Jesuits from its territories. This was a\nheavy blow to the development of modern philosophy in Mexico, and it\nfueled a nascent sense of Mexican national identity among the subjects\nof Spanish colonial rule. \nAmong the main Jesuits of New Spain who were forced to leave their\nhomeland were two prominent philosophers: Diego José Abad and\nFrancisco Javier Clavijero. Diego José Abad taught a complete\ncourse on philosophy in which he studied modern philosophers such as\nDescartes and Gassendi. Abad tried to reconcile modern philosophy and\nScholasticism by trying, for example, to reconcile atomism and\nAristotelian hylomorphism. Francisco Javier Clavijero\n(1731–1787) wrote Storia antica del Messico (1780\n[2006]) in which he examines pre-Columbian history using the model of\nGreco-Roman classical history. He also wrote a Cursus\nphilosophicus, of which only one section has been preserved:\nPhysica particularis (1765). \nOther influential philosophers, educators, and students of\ncontemporary philosophy are Juan Benito Díaz de Gamarra\n(1745–1783), author of Elementa recentioris\nphilosophiae (1774); the polymath José Antonio Alzate\n(1737–1799), a ferocious critic of Aristotle; and José\nMariano Mociño (1757–1820), a distinguished expert in\nbotany. All three proved influential in challenging the Colonial rule\nof Spain by challenging the dominance of tradition for the sake of\ntradition. \nThe 19th century was a time of upheaval in Mexico. In 1808\nNapoleon invaded Spain and King Ferdinand VII abdicated the throne,\nforcing the citizens of Spanish America to re-examine the concept of\nsovereignty. Specifically, they wondered whether, in the absence of a\nmonarch, the colonies possessed the right to govern themselves until\nthe monarch returned to the throne. \nAppealing to the philosophy of the Enlightenment—though not\nalways explicitly—several Mexican thinkers and political\nactivists argued that the colonies did possess the right to\nself-government. Such was the case of Miguel Hidalgo\n(1753–1811), one of the fathers of Mexican Independence. Hidalgo\nwas well known for his predilection for French ideas and for his\nopposition to Scholastic theology, as is demonstrated in his\nDisertación sobre el verdadero método de estudiar\nteología escolástica (1784). Francisco Severo\nMaldonado (1775–1832) was another philosophically-minded priest\nwho wrote in favor of independence and about the philosophical\nfoundations of nationalism. \nAfter Mexico won its independence in 1821, and throughout the\n19th century, an intense debate took place regarding the\ntenets of liberal philosophy and its application to Mexican reality.\nLiberals wanted the Mexican Constitution to resemble the Constitution\nof the United States, which defended individual rights, freedom of\nspeech, and freedom of press. They also believed in the separation of\nchurch and state, and argued that the wealth and land owned by the\nMexican Church should be expropriated to promote economic development.\nLiberals believed that everyone is equal before the law and they tried\nto erase the racial and cultural inequality that prevailed in the\nnation, particularly the position of indigenous communities. Among the\nauthors who defended liberal ideas were José María Luis\nMora (1794–1850), Melchor Ocampo (1814–1851), Ignacio\nRamírez (1818–1879), and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano\n(1834–1893). (See the related entry on\n liberalism in Latin America.) \nThere were also influential conservatives who believed that Mexico\nought to preserve its Spanish heritage, such as Lucas Alamán\n(1792–1853). While conservatives also promoted legislation to\nprotect indigenous peoples and local industry, many argued that the\nCatholic tradition was needed to maintain national cohesion. So, while\nEnlightenment philosophy began to spread throughout the Americas in\nthe 19th century, some notable Scholastics remained, such\nas Clemente de Jesús Munguía (1810–1868), author\nof Del pensamiento y su enunciación (1852). \nIn the middle of the 19th century, the debate between\nliberals and conservatives had important political ramifications. On\nthe one hand, Mexican liberals had elected the first president of\nindigenous ancestry, Benito Juarez, who helped establish liberal\nreform throughout Mexico in the 1850s. On the other hand, from 1862 to\n1867, conservatives supported the pro-French Mexican monarchy, headed\nby Maximilian of Hapsburg, ousting Juarez for a time. After the\ncollapse of the Empire and the execution of Maximilian, the\nConservative Party lost most of its influence as it was associated\nwith supporting foreign powers. \nThroughout the 19th century, Mexican intellectuals\nentertained a wide variety of philosophical schools, including\nliberalism, utilitarianism, sensualism, materialism, and socialism.\nSome also developed anarchist and romantic ideas, such as Juan\nNepomuceno Adorno, a romantic whose La armonía del\nuniverso (1862) proposes a deistic philosophy and a utopian\nconception of human nature and society. But the main school of\nphilosophy that dominated the second half of the century was\npositivism, understood broadly to encompass authors as varied as\nAuguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Hyppolite Taine, and John Stuart\nMill. \nThe main representative of positivism in Mexico was Gabino Barreda\n(1818–1881). In his “Oración\ncívica”(1867), Barreda offers an interpretation of\nMexican history inspired by Comte’s philosophy of history,\naccording to which history develops in three stages—the\nreligious, the metaphysical, and the scientific. Barreda believed that\nthe victory of the Liberal Party was ultimately grounded in positivist\ntheses. He also believed that national reform should not be founded on\nreligion or speculative metaphysics, but on the experimental methods\nof science. With this in mind, he promoted education reform that\neliminated theology and speculative philosophy from the curriculum in\npublic schools, thus initiating a long debate on the role of\nphilosophy in public education that continues today. \nFor Mexican positivists the challenge was to reconcile freedom and\norder, both moral and natural. In his essay “De la\neducación moral” (1863), Barreda sustained that freedom\ndoes not amount to the freedom to do whatever one wants (i.e., freedom\nfrom constraint). True freedom is always constrained by the law, just\nas a free falling object falls according to the laws of\nnature. Likewise, moral freedom and progress is constrained by\nthe moral law and must be consistent with the laws of science. \nIn addition to Comte’s philosophy, Mexican intellectuals applied\nSpencer’s social evolutionism to theories about Mexican history\nand society, as can be seen in the works of Justo Sierra\n(1848–1912) and Francisco Bulnes (1847–1924). According to\nsocial evolutionism, nations are like animal species: their organs\nhave evolved to fulfill specific purposes, primarily survival. In his\nbook El porvenir de las naciones hispanoamericanas (1899),\nBulnes claimed that Mexico would have to make major changes to survive\nin its struggle against the Anglo-Saxons. From a political point of\nview, Spencer’s social evolutionism was the foundation of the\nview that progress in Mexico would result from a slow, deliberately\nplanned evolution, not another revolution. For instance, Justo\nSierra’s Evolución política del pueblo\nmexicano (1902) was used by some to justify the ongoing\ndictatorship of General Porfirio Díaz, who ruled Mexico for\nalmost three decades leading up to the Mexican Revolution of 1910. \nIn the fields of logic and epistemology, Mill’s influence was\nwidely accepted. Perhaps most influential in these areas was Porfirio\nParra’s (1845–1912) Nuevo sistema de lógica\ninductiva y deductiva (1903), in which he defends an idealist\nversion of empiricism. \nThe Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was the most significant\nevent in modern Mexican history. While it was primarily a military\ncampaign in defense of political democracy and equality, comprehensive\nagrarian reform, and workers’ rights, some argue that it was\ndeeply influenced by a “climate of ideas”, including\nclassical and social liberalism, the social doctrine of the Catholic\nChurch, socialism, anarchism, spiritism, Bergsonism, and pragmatism.\nSome of the Revolution’s most influential intellectuals were\nactivists first and foremost, such as Ricardo Flores Magón and\nFrancisco Madero, both of whom fought against the dictatorship of\nPorfirio Díaz. From 1904 until his death in 1922, Flores\nMagón lived in the United States, first as an exile and then as\na prison inmate. In many of his writings, distributed through the\nclandestine journal Regeneración, he developed a\nconception of society based on socialist and anarchist philosophy. And\nMadero, who was elected President of Mexico and who is perhaps best\nknown for his La sucesión presidencial en 1910 (1908),\nwas also an important defender of Allen Kardec’s branch of\nspiritism. \nIf some revolutionaries were primarily activists, others were\nprimarily artists and intellectuals who became the voice of their\ngeneration. Such was the case of a young group of students who\ngathered in Mexico City and referred to themselves as the\n“Ateneo de la Juventud”. Antonio Caso (1883–1946)\nand José Vasconcelos (1882–1959) were two of its most\nprominent members, both of whom criticized the predominance of\npositivism, which they found culturally demoralizing. In particular,\nthey rejected the positivist view that humanity is moved by selfish\ncalculation, that morality is accountable to the laws of nature, and\nthat the universe is governed by deterministic laws. The members of\nthe Ateneo stated that humans are free, creative, and spiritual,\ncapable of using intuition to understand the world, and inspired by\nmoral feelings that transcend the laws of nature. This conception of\nhuman beings and the world can also be considered an essential part of\nthe climate of ideas surrounding the Mexican Revolution. \nAntonio Caso was the leading figure of Mexican philosophy in the first\ndecades of the 20th century, and was most influential as a\ncharismatic professor who inspired generations of students to pursue\nphilosophy. Caso also created the Department of Philosophy at the\nNational University of Mexico and helped to introduce Mexicans to\ncontemporary European philosophers and schools of thought. His most\nimportant work, Existencia como economía, como\ndesinterés y como caridad (1919), was a challenge to\nDarwin’s theory of biology, Spencer’s social evolutionism,\nNietzsche’s doctrine of the Übermensch, and Max\nStirner’s radical egoism, and it drew inspiration from sources\nas diverse as Bergson, Tolstoy, and Christianity. \nAccording to Caso, human existence has three levels: the biological or\neconomic, the disinterested or aesthetic, and the charitable. Caso\nconsidered this last level the highest expression of human dignity and\napplied this distinction to other moral, political, and aesthetic\nproblems. In the 1930s, Caso defended academic freedom and the\nautonomy of the university and decried the changes to the 1933 Mexican\nConstitution that would reform public education along the lines of\nhistorical materialism. For example, he famously debated with the\nMexican Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano (1894–1968) about\ncongress’s plan to make public education socialist. In La\npersona humana y el estado totalitario (1941), Caso defends\ndemocracy against fascism and communism. For a comprehensive overview\nof Caso’s philosophy, see Mexican philosopher Rosa Krauze de\nKolteniuk’s (1923—2003) La filosofía de Antonio\nCaso (1961). \nJosé Vasconcelos was one of the most influential thinkers and\npromoters of Mexican culture in the 20th century. His\nreputation as an intellectual, politician, and writer is stronger than\nhis reputation as a philosopher. However, he cannot be passed over in\na history of Mexican philosophy. His theoretical works can be divided\ninto two groups. The first group includes the writings in which he\ndeveloped a philosophical system, from Estética (1936)\nto Lógica (1945), specifically an overarching\nmetaphysical view that he had sketched out as early as 1916 in his\nPitágoras, una teoría del ritmo. Vasconcelos\nbelieved that his main contribution to philosophy was the notion of an\naesthetic a priori, as well as a list of metaphysical\ncategories based on music rather than logic or science. According to\nhim, the universe is more like a symphony than a logical treatise, and\nunderstanding requires the emotions as much as the intellect. \nUnfortunately, his philosophical legacy was compromised by his\nabrasive personality and self-imposed isolation, and because he was\nnot, like Caso, a professor of philosophy. Vasconcelos considered his\nwriting on Latin American history and culture—the second group\nof writings—secondary to his philosophical work. Nevertheless,\nhis account of Latin American history and culture have been more\ninfluential than his work on philosophy. His most influential work,\nLa raza cósmica (1925), is a prophetic essay in which\nhe considers Latin America the fountain of a mixed, cosmic race that\nwill synthesize the four human races and lead humanity to the height\nof its development: the aesthetic. Although Vasconcelos believed that\nphilosophy should be studied for its own sake, and for the\nuniversality of its ideas, he also claimed that Latin American nations\nshould use philosophy to resist political, economic, and intellectual\ndomination of the countries to the north (see his\nÉtica, 1932). \nIn the late 1920s the pedagogical and social ideas of John Dewey were\ninfluential in Mexican education. Vasconcelos believed that\nDewey’s philosophy was a vehicle for US imperialism and wrote a\ncriticism of Dewey titled De Robinson a Odiseo (1935). \nThe intellectual atmosphere of the 1930s underwent dramatic changes:\nthe new generation of students, many of whom were\nprotégés of Caso and Vasconcelos, were not interested in\nthe debate between determinism and freedom or materialism and spirit.\nTo them, values, objectivity, and social responsibility were the\ncentral issues of the day. They rejected the intuitionism and the\nirrationalism of Caso and Vasconcelos and favored a renewed\nrationalism and universalism. Critical reflection on what it means to\nbe Mexican also started to gain importance, although it was not until\nthe end of the 1940s that it reached full prominence. \nAt the time, Mexican philosophers also gained confidence in their role\non the international stage. On the one hand, post-revolutionary\nMexican culture was enjoying something of a golden age of creativity,\nparticularly concerning its own authentic national identity. On the\nother hand, the two world wars convinced many intellectuals that the\nfuture of Western Civilization was to be found in America. The\nconstruction of an American philosophy and, in particular, of Mexican\nphilosophy, was seen as the only way the philosophical tradition of\nAncient Greece could be rescued from European decadence and\nsavagery. \nIn the 1930s and 1940s, former students of Caso, such as José\nRomano Muñoz (1890–1967), Samuel Ramos (1897–1959),\nAdalberto García de Mendoza (1900–1963), Oswaldo Robles\n(1905–1969), Edmundo O’Gorman (1906–1995), Francisco\nLarroyo (1908–1981), Eduardo García Máynez\n(1908–1993), Antonio Gómez Robledo (1908–1994) and\nGuillermo Héctor Rodríguez (1910–1988) adopted and\npromoted philosophical currents from Germany, such as Neo-Kantianism\nof the Marburg and Baden schools, Dilthey’s historicism,\nHusserl’s phenomenology, Heidegger’s existentialism,\nKelsen’s legal positivism and, above all, the philosophy of\nvalues of Scheler and Hartmann. José Ortega y Gasset,\nspecifically his journal Revista de Occidente, also\ninfluenced that generation. \nSome philosophers, such as Samuel Ramos, employed European models and\nideals to reflect inwardly on what Ramos referred to as “the\nMexican psyche”. Ramos was a famous critic of Caso’s\nphilosophical style and defense of irrationalism, and he believed that\nthe country needed a new philosophy that could diagnose the flaws in\nthe Mexican character, specifically one that committed Mexicans to\nuniversal values, especially the use of reason. Thus, although Ramos\nphilosophized about the Mexican character, he ultimately believed that\nMexican philosophy ought to be dedicated to the rigorous study of\nbeing human and the objective field of values. Ramos also became\ninterested in aesthetics and promoted the professionalization of\nphilosophy. Some of his most important works are: Perfil del\nhombre y la cultura en México (1934), Hacia un nuevo\nhumanismo (1940), and Filosofía de la vida\nartística (1950). \nNot all philosophers were enthusiastic about applying philosophy to\nMexican themes. For example, Francisco Larroyo was the main\nrepresentative of Neo-Kantianism in Mexico, and wrote many books in\ndefense of Neo-Kantian views on philosophy, science, and education,\nincluding La filosofía de los valores (1936) and\nLa lógica de las ciencias (1938). Larroyo claimed that\nMexico’s progress required a rigorous, rationalist, and\nscientific philosophy. Another well-known Neo-Kantian and Kelsenian\nwas Guillermo Héctor Rodríguez. \nAside from defending neo-Kantianism, some philosophers defended and\nrefined neo-Thomism, such as Oswaldo Robles, who sought to reconcile\nNeo-Thomism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis. Among his books we\nmight mention La teoría de la idea en Malebranche y la\ntradición filosófica (1937) and Esquema de\nantropología filosófica (1942). \nFinally, a complete history of the first half of the 20th\ncentury Mexican philosophy would be remiss if it did not discuss the\ndevelopment of Marxism in Mexico, particularly the work of Vicente\nLombardo Toledano. Like many of the intellectuals in our survey, the\nphilosophical contribution of Lombardo Toledano is complicated by the\nfact that he was, perhaps first and foremost, a labor leader and a\npolitician—a scholar-activist—and because he developed\nmany of his ideas through public debate and discourse (cf. the debate\nbetween Caso and Lombardo mentioned above). Nevertheless, Lombardo\nwrote one of the first philosophical analyses of the Mexican\nRevolution and his works are essential reading for those interested in\nMarxist interpretations of Mexican themes in the first half of the\n20th century. \nSome philosophers stretched the concept of philosophy to combine\nhistorical, philosophical, and literary analysis to both Mexican and\nuniversal themes. For instance, in his essay “Del arte o de la\nmonstruosidad” (1940), the distinguished historian and\nphilosopher Edmundo O’Gorman maintained that the study of\nPre-Columbian art should be based on different categories from those\nused to evaluate European art. In Crisis y porvenir de la ciencia\nhistórica (1947), he criticized positivist historiography\nfrom the point of view of historicism and existentialism, and set the\ntheoretical foundations for his subsequent notion of “the\ninvention of America”. Likewise, while Alfonso Reyes\n(1889–1959) and Octavio Paz (1914–1998) were not\nprofessional philosophers, they authored texts that should not be\nexcluded from a history of Mexican philosophy. In El deslinde\n(1944), Reyes offered a theory of literature using tools of\nphenomenology and in El arco y la lira (1956), Paz wrote a\nliterary theory that used elements from existentialism and\nstructuralism. \nConcerning the professionalization of philosophy in Mexico, Eduardo\nGarcía Máynez stands out both for his philosophical and\nfor his administrative contributions. In 1940–41, García\nMáynez founded and was the first director of the Centro de\nEstudios Filosóficas, which was eventually renamed the\nInstituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas, and he\nfounded the influential journal Filosfía y Letras,\nwhich continued to be published until 1958. His book Los\nprincipios de la ontología formal del derecho y su\nexpresión simbólica (1953) marked the beginning of\nthe logical turn in Mexican philosophy, anticipating the linguistic\nturn of analytic philosophy in Mexico a decade later. Some of his\nother works include: La definición del derecho. Ensayo de\nperspectivismo jurídico (1948) and Filosofía\ndel derecho (1974). García Máynez claimed that the\nvalidity of the law depends on the existence of objective values, but\nhe added that, in spite of their objectivity, values are subject to\nseveral forms of relativism in relation to culture, concrete practice,\nand geography. Like Ramos, García Máynez believed Mexico\nneeded an objectivist axiology to progress socially. He also claimed\nthat legal freedom was a “second order” right, that is, a\nnormative right to exercise certain independent faculties through\nchoice. The development of this thesis forced him to sustain that any\nsystem of normativity that is axiomatic and formal contains a\npriori principles. His “theory of the three circles”\nmaintains that the definitions of law as formally valid, as\nintrinsically valid, and as a positive right are not theoretically\ncompatible, though they are compatible in practice. \nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) forced some of the most\nprominent Spanish philosophers to move to Mexico. Joaquín Xirau\n(1895–1946), José Gallegos Rocafull (1895–1963),\nWenceslao Roces (1897–1992), José Gaos (1900–1969),\nLuis Recasens Siches (1903–1977), Eugenio Ímaz\n(1900–1951) and Eduardo Nicol (1907–1990), would live,\nspend their careers, and die in Mexico. Juan David García Bacca\n(1901–1992) and María Zambrano (1907–1991) spent\npart of their exile in Mexico. Adolfo Sánchez Vázquez\n(1915–2011), Ramón Xirau (1924–2017), and Carmen\nRovira (b. 1923) arrived in Mexico at a young age, and completed their\nstudies in their newly adopted country. All of them left a valuable\nimprint on Mexican philosophy through their creativity, teaching, and\ntranslations. \nJoaquín Xirau wrote several books on metaphysics, the history\nof philosophy, and the philosophy of education. After arriving in\nMexico, he wrote Amor y mundo (1940), a reflection on love\nunderstood as Eros and caritas. His ontology is\ndialectical, and he claims that being and value, as well as subject\nand object, are merely abstract ideas if they are considered static\nrealities outside change. His premature death at the age of 50\nprevented him from being more influential than he should have\nbeen. \nJosé Gaos wrote the majority of his published material in\nMexico, and he is remembered, above all, for his extraordinary\ninfluence as a professor and mentor. For his own part, Gaos defended a\nradical version of perspectivism: for Gaos, philosophy is a personal\nconfession, so no philosophy is better or worse than another since\neach is, in the end, the expression of an individual. His most\nimportant works are: Del hombre (1970) and De la\nfilosofía (1962). His research in the history of ideas in\nMexico and Latin America were also extremely influential. His ideas on\nhow to teach philosophy were included in the curricula of several\ndepartments of philosophy throughout the country. Among his students\nwere some of the most important philosophers of the second half of the\n20th century. \nLuis Recasens Siches, a philosopher of law, wrote many books in which\nthe influence of José Ortega y Gasset was apparent. Among them\nis Vida humana, sociedad y derecho (1940). \nEduardo Nicol founded the Metaphysics Seminar at the Department of\nPhilosophy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he\ntaught with rigor and brilliance, and in 1955 he founded the\ninfluential journal Dianoia, still published today. For\nNicol, philosophy ought to recover its place as the primary science.\nHis metaphysics, dialectical in essence, wanted to reconcile being and\nrepresentation, and truth and history. All of his works were written\nin Mexico, including: La idea del hombre (1946),\nMetafísica de la expresión (1957), and Los\nprincipios de la ciencia (1965). \nIn 1934, Samuel Ramos published one of the most important books on\nMexican culture, Perfil del hombre y la cultura en\nMéxico, an analysis of history, culture, and the Mexican\ncharacter, which he believed suffered from an inferiority complex.\nAccording to Ramos, Mexicans had set goals that were impossible to\naccomplish, particularly because they had tried to imitate more\ndeveloped nations, and this had instilled in them a feeling of\ninferiority that explains their individual and collective behavior, as\nwell as many of the problems of Mexican society and politics.\nRamos’s book was very controversial and prompted similar studies\nof Mexican being, such as Octavio Paz’s El laberinto de la\nsoledad (1950). \nThe Hyperion Group was a group of young philosophers from the National\nAutonomous University of Mexico that included Leopoldo Zea\n(1912–2006), Jorge Portilla (1918–1963), Ricardo Guerra\n(1928–2007), Emilio Uranga (1921–1988), and Luis Villoro\n(1922–2014). It was active between 1948 and 1952, and its\npurpose was to employ the categories of existentialism to analyze\nMexico and Mexican being, an analysis that was meant to reveal the\nreality of Mexico and Mexican being and encourage Mexicans to\ntransform their reality. \nJorge Portilla’s posthumously\npublished Fenomenología del relajo (1966) is a\nphenomenological study of the complexity of Mexican morality and\nbehavior. \nArguably the most important work of the Hyperion group was\nAnálisis del ser del mexicano (1952) by Emilio Uranga.\nThis book proposes an ontology of mexicanidad and a\nphilosophy of Mexican culture. According to Uranga, the negative\ntraits that characterize the Mexican, such as resentment, melancholy,\nand zozobra, are expressions of a constitutive mode of\nMexican existence that he calls “accidentality”. (Here\nUranga is employing the Scholastic distinction between accident and\nsubstance.) Uranga argues further that although Mexicans had been made\nto feel inferior throughout their history—specifically, although\nEuropeans had argued that Mexicans were less than fully\nhuman—Mexicans were in fact closer to the essence of being\nhuman, defined as accidentality. As a result, it was the European who\nhad a lesson to learn from the Mexican, not the other way around. If\nthe Conquest of Mexico tried to assimilate Mexican culture to European\nculture, what Uranga did was try to assimilate the whole of what it\nmeans to be human to the Mexican experience of humanity, that is, to\nmake humanity recognize and value its repressed accidentality. By\nidentifying mexicanidad with accidentality, Uranga transforms\nMexican being into an ontological category. \nThe filosofía de lo mexicano (the philosophy of\nMexicanness) was a creative and original movement that impacted other\nareas of culture. However, after the 1960s the desire to treat Mexico\nas the object of philosophical inquiry declined, and it is only in the\nlast few years that a small group of Mexican and Mexican-American\nphilosophers have, in collaboration, attempted to rescue elements of\nthat movement to think about Mexico from a philosophical point of view\nand to think about philosophy from a Mexican point of view. \nLeopoldo Zea was the most influential Mexican philosopher in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, particularly in Latin\nAmerica and the former Soviet Bloc. Some of his books are: El\npositivismo en México (1943), América en la\nhistoria (1957), La filosofía americana como\nfilosofía sin más (1969), and Discurso desde la\nmarginación y la barbarie (1988). \nIn his essay “En torno a una filosofía americana”\n(1945), Zea sustained that Latin American philosophy should devote\nitself to topics that are specifically Latin American, in addition to\nthe universal problems of any other philosophy. In “La\nfilosofía como compromiso” (1948), he claims that Latin\nAmerican philosophy should aim to transform the reality of the\nphilosopher, not just understand it. From that point forward,\nZea’s work adopts a clearly defined ideological and political\npurpose of emancipating Latin America and the “Third\nWorld”. \nIn a word, Zea considers philosophy an instrument of liberation. He\nstrongly objected to a Eurocentric account of human nature, history,\nand reason—a critique that would evolve more fully decades later\nwith postmodernism and post-colonialism. During most of the second\nhalf of the 20th century, Zea promoted “Latin\nAmerican philosophy”, understood as an academic discipline that\ncombines the interdisciplinary study of society, thought, and history\nin this region of the world. \nOther Mexican philosophers who have contributed to the development of\nLatin American philosophy are Joaquín Sánchez McGregor\n(1925–2008), Abelardo Villegas (1934–2001), Mario\nMagallón Anaya (b. 1946) and Horacio Cerutti (b. 1950). \nLuis Villoro was a diligent student of the most important\nphilosophical currents of the second half of the 20th\ncentury: existentialism, phenomenology, Marxism, analytic philosophy,\nand multiculturalism. However, in his reflections one can observe a\ncommon thread of lasting questions concerning the metaphysical\nunderstanding of alterity, the limits and boundaries of reason, the\nrelationship between knowledge and power, community, an ethical\nreflection of injustice, a defense of and respect for cultural\ndiversity, and a critical examination of the role of philosophy. Some\nof his books are: Los grandes momentos del indigenismo en\nMéxico (1950), Creer, saber, conocer (1982),\nEl concepto de ideología (1985), and El poder y el\nvalor (1997). \nIn Creer, saber, conocer, a book that belongs to the\nanalytical tradition, Villoro develops an epistemology that eliminates\ntruth from the definition of knowledge in order to make sense of the\nhistorical and political dimensions of epistemology in practice. For\nVilloro, “to know p” is “to believe p\nwith sufficiently objective reasons”. And one’s reasons\nfor believing that p are sufficiently objective if they are\nconclusive, complete, and coherent, regardless of who\nsustains p.  However, one’s reasons can be sufficiently\nobjective in one epistemic community but not another. This leads to an\nepistemic relativism accepted by Villoro as the only way to respond to\nthe challenge of skepticism (see related entry on\n epistemology in Latin America).\n In “Filosofía y dominación” (1978), he\nsustained that philosophy must always critique inherited and imposed\nbeliefs by exercising the independent use of reason, that is, without\nbecoming ideological. \nIn El poder y el valor, Villoro reflects on the nature of\npolitical power and moral values. After a comprehensive and insightful\nanalysis, Villoro sustains that we should give priority to the values\nthat bind individuals to their community, without, of course,\nundermining either individual freedom or social order. Ultimately,\nVilloro defends a form of radical democracy according to which\npolitical power is concentrated in the hands of ordinary people\nimmersed in concrete social networks. Villoro believed that indigenous\ncommunities of Mexico are a living model of the variety of social and\npolitical egalitarianism he endorsed, and any intellectual biography\nof Villoro would be incomplete without mentioning that Villoro was a\nsecret member of The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and had a\nphilosophically rich correspondence with Subcomandante Marcos. \nIn the 20th century, several Mexican philosophers developed\nforms of humanism and metaphysics from perspectives as dissimilar as\nHellenism, Thomism, and existentialism. \nAntonio Gómez Robledo (1908–1994) was a distinguished\nhumanist and jurist who studied and defended the value of Greco-Latin\nand Christian cultures elegantly and non-dogmatically. Among his works\nare: Ensayo sobre las virtudes intelectuales (1957),\nMeditación sobre la justicia (1963), and\nSócrates y el socratismo (1966). He also translated\nPlato’s Republic, Aristotle’s Politics,\nMarcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and other classics. His\nstudies of the principles of international law and the Spanish\ntradition of law should also be included in the history of Mexican\nphilosophy. \nRamón Xirau wrote philosophy, literary criticism, and poetry,\nand combined them in enriching ways. Xirau wrote about the\nrelationship between philosophy and poetry as two different forms of\nknowledge, and about the ontological nature of being human,\nunderstanding ser and estar as different categories.\nAmong his best-known books are: Introducción a la historia\nde la filosofía (1964), Poesía y\nconocimiento (1979), and El tiempo vivido (1985). \nJuliana González (b. 1936) was a student of Eduardo Nicol. She\nhas taught and written about the main problems of philosophical and\nmoral anthropology as well as about Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger.\nGonzález’s ethics are grounded in a complex vision of the\nhuman being, which emphasizes our capacity to choose. González\nhas also dealt with the ethical and metaphysical dimension of\npsychoanalysis and genomics. Some of her books include\nÉtica y libertad (1989a), El malestar en la\nmoral (1989b), and El poder del Eros (1999). \nCarmen Rovira (b. 1923) was a student of Gaos. Over the course of her\nlong academic career, she has labored to introduce and analyze the\nhistory of ideas in Mexico, particularly medieval philosophy in\nMexico. In addition to all her edited collections, Rovira authored\nEclécticos portugueses del siglo XVIII y algunas de sus\ninfluencias en América (1958) and Francisco de\nVitoria. España y América. El poder y el\nhombre (2004). \nElsa Cecilia Frost (1928–2005) was also a student of Gaos, as\nwas O’Gorman and Leon-Portilla. Her main interests lay with the\nhistory of colonial philosophy and the processes of acculturation that\ncreated modern Mexican culture. Her text Categorias de la cultura\nmexicana (1972) is a widely studied and well-regarded text in the\nphilosophy of Mexican culture. \nJosé Sánchez Villaseñor (1911–1961),\nFernando Sodi Pallares (1917–1980), Héctor\nGonzález Uribe (1918–1988), José Sanabria\n(1924–2002) and Miguel Mansur (1928–1993) all taught\nNeo-Thomism at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Carlos Llano\n(1932–2010), Virginia Aspe (b. 1952), Héctor Zagal (b.\n1963) and Luis Xavier López Farjeat (b. 1973) all studied the\nAristotelian tradition at the Universidad Panamericana. In Monterrey,\nAgustín Basave Fernández del Valle (1923–2006),\ndeveloped what he called an integralismo metafísico\nantroposófico. Among his many books we can single out\nTratado de metafísica. Teoría de la habencia\n(1982). \nSocialist and Marxist thought was a popular ideology during the\nMexican Revolution. In addition to the work of Lombardo Toledano who\nemployed a Marxist framework to explain Mexico’s situation,\nJosé Revueltas (1914–1976) was an unorthodox Marxist who\ndiscussed philosophical themes in his literary and political writings.\nDespite the influence of Lombardo and Revueltas, however, academics\ndidn’t take Marxism seriously until the 1970s. Two central\nfigures of Marxism in the Mexican academy during that period were Eli\nde Gortari (1918–1991) and Adolfo Sánchez\nVázquez. \nDe Gortari was one of the first academic philosophers of science in\nMexico. He studied the foundation of dialectical logic and the\napplications of logic to science, and worked on the philosophy of\nmathematics and physics, the mechanization of propositional calculus,\nand the history of science in Mexico. In 1955 he founded the Seminar\nof Scientific and Philosophical Problems. Among his books are La\nciencia de la lógica (1950) and Dialéctica de\nla Física (1964). \nAdolfo Sánchez Vázquez was very young when he arrived in\nMexico and he began his philosophical studies in Mexico. He produced a\nsolid body of work dealing with the concepts of Marxist ethics and\naesthetics. One contribution to Marxist philosophy was his critical\nreflection on the concept of praxis, and he was critical of\nthe aesthetic doctrine of Socialist realism. Among his main books we\ncan mention: Las ideas estéticas de Marx (1965),\nUna filosofía de la praxis (1967), and\nÉtica (1969). Many Mexican Marxist philosophers of\nsubsequent generations studied under him, and there was an important\ndebate between Sánchez Vazquez and Villoro concerning the\nconcept of ideology. \nThe Cuban Revolution had a profound impact among many Latin American\nintellectuals. After the 1960s, the number of Marxists increased\nexponentially, both at and outside the university, and Marxism became\nthe dominant school of thought in some Mexican universities. The books\nof Gramsci, Marcuse, and Althusser were read by many young students,\nas were the writings of José Martí, José\nCarlos Mariáteguí and Paolo Freire. The main Mexican\nMarxist philosophers of that period were: Porfirio Miranda\n(1924–2001), author of Marx y la Biblia (1971); Enrique\nGonzález Rojo (b. 1928); Cesáreo Morales (b. 1936);\nJaime Labastida (b. 1940), author of Producción, ciencia y\nsociedad: de Descartes a Marx (1969); Gabriel Vargas Lozano (b.\n1947), author of Más allá del derrumbre (1994);\nand Aureliano Ortega (b. 1952). Carlos Pereyra (1940–1988) was a\nphilosopher of history and a well-known left-wing intellectual. His\nphilosophical papers were collected in Filosofía, historia\ny política (2010). Bolívar Echeverría\n(1941–2010) wrote La modernidad de lo barroco (1998),\nin which he offers a critique of capitalist modernity from a Latin\nAmerican perspective. \nMentioned above, Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente (b.\n1957), also known as “Subcomandante Marcos” of the EZLN,\nhas been a very influential post-Marxist thinker who has put his ideas\ninto action. His correspondence with Luis Villoro is included in\nLa alternativa. Perspectiva y posibilidades de cambio\n(Villoro 2015). \nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall there was an abrupt decline in\nMarxist philosophy. As intellectuals debated how best to reform the\nMexican state, they began to read other foreign political\nphilosophers, such as Weber, Arendt, Rawls, Bobbio and Habermas. Some\nof the philosophers who have focused on the nature of democracy,\njustice, and poverty include: Luis Aguilar Villanueva (b. 1938);\nPaulette Dieterlen (b. 1947), author of La pobreza: un estudio\nfilosófico (2003); Luis Salazar (b. 1949); León\nOlivé (1950–2017); Griselda Gutiérrez (1951);\nMaría Pía Lara (b. 1954), author of Moral\ntextures (1998); Ambrosio Velasco (b. 1954); Rodolfo\nVázquez (b. 1956), author of Entre la libertad y la\nigualdad (2006); Mario Teodoro Ramírez (b. 1958), author\nof De la razón a la praxis (2003); and Enrique Serrano\n(b. 1958). \nMexican political philosophy played an important role in two public\ndebates of that period. One concerned the extent to which leftist\npolitical groups were willing accept electoral democracy as opposed to\narmed revolution, like that of Cuba. Another concerned whether Mexico\nwas better described as a homogenous mestizo nation or a racially and\nculturally diverse country. \nThe philosophy of liberation was a movement that originated in South\nAmerica in the early 1970s. In the beginning, it mixed elements of\nliberation theology, dependency theory, and Latin American philosophy.\nEnrique Dussel (b. 1934 in Argentina) is the main representative of\nthe philosophy of liberation in Mexico. Among his numerous works,\nwhich have been translated widely into other languages, are\nFilosofía de la liberación (1977 [2003]) and\nÉtica de la liberación en la edad de la\nglobalización y la exclusión (1998 [2013]). Dussel\nhas offered a comprehensive critique of Western history and philosophy\nfrom the point of view of the poor and the excluded, particularly in\nLatin America. The Dusselian branch of the filosofía de la\nliberación is a vigorous movement with students all over\nthe world. (See the related entry on\n the philosophy of liberation) \nBeginning in the early 1960s, philosophers began to study analytic\nphilosophy, particularly authors such as Russell, Carnap,\nWittgenstein, Strawson, and Quine. At the time, it was claimed that a\nphilosophy inspired by science was required to modernize Mexico, not\nunlike the positivist turn in the second half of the 19th\ncentury. The creation of the journal Crítica in 1967\naccelerated the popularity of analytic philosophy in Mexico. At the\nend of the 1960s, the Institute for Philosophical Research of the\nNational Autonomous University of Mexico became the main center of\nanalytic philosophy in the country and in Latin America. The main\npromoters of analytic philosophy during that period were Alejandro\nRossi (1932–2009), author of Lenguaje y significado\n(1969), and Fernando Salmerón (1925–1997), who also wrote\nextensively on the history of Mexican philosophy. \nBy the end of the 1970s, a group of analytic philosophers had\ndistinguished themselves: Enrique Villanueva (b. 1938), José\nAntonio Robles (1938–2014), Margarita Valdés (b. 1941),\nHugo Margáin (1942–1978), and Olbeth Hansberg (b. 1943),\nauthor of La diversidad de las emociones (b. 1996). In the\n1980s, more analytic philosophers joined the Institute of\nPhilosophical research, among them: Raúl Orayen\n(1942–2003), who wrote Lógica, significado y\nontología (1989); Ulises Moulines (b. 1946), a\nstructuralist philosopher of science; Mark Platts (b. 1947), author of\nWays of Meaning (1979); León Olivé\n(1950–2017), who wrote several books of philosophy of science\nand culture; and Adolfo García de la Sienra (b. 1951), a\ntheologian and philosopher of economics. \nMexican analytic philosophy has followed the dominant trends of\nanalytic philosophy since the 1960s. In the beginning, it had strong\nties to Oxford, but today it has developed working relationships with\nother philosophical departments around the world. Some Mexican\nanalytic philosophers have studied abroad and have remained outside\nMexico, such as Agustín Rayo (b. 1973). Others work in Mexico\nbut publish most of their work in English, such as Mario Gómez\nTorrente (b. 1967). Others write in both English and Spanish, such as\nMayté Ezcurdia (1966–2018). Still others write mainly in\nSpanish, like Alejandro Tomasini Bassols (b. 1952), who has written a large\nnumber of books that develop an original interpretation of\nWittgenstein’s philosophy. \nCarlos Pereda (b. 1944) has also written several important books,\nincluding Vértigos argumentales (1994),\nCrítica de la razón arrogante (1999), and\nSobre la confianza (2009). He develops Aristotle’s\nnotion of phronesis and Kant’s view that practical\nreason is universal to recommend strategies to help navigate the\ntemptations and ambiguities of life. Pereda offers a peculiar\ndiagnosis of the entanglements and pathologies of reason, including\nwhat he calls argumentative vertigo, that is, a kind of\nintellectual or moral dizziness that blinds us to other points of view\nor that makes us stubborn and insensitive to the feelings of\nothers. \nThe main exponent of philosophical hermeneutics, Mauricio Beuchot (b.\n1950), distinguished himself early as a historian and a translator of\nthe philosophy of New Spain and medieval philosophy (e.g., La\nfilosofía del lenguaje en la Edad Media, 1981), as well as\nfor his synthesis of Thomism and analytic philosophy (e.g.,\nLógica y ontología, 1986). In the 1990s,\nhowever, he turned to hermeneutics. In his Tratado de\nhermenéutica analógica (1997), he developed a\nsystem that he called “analogical hermeneutics”. His\nthesis is that, to avoid the excesses of positivist\n“univocalism” or postmodern “equivocalism”,\none must adopt analogy as the primary method of interpretation.\nBeuchot’s analogical hermeneutics has inspired a philosophical\nmovement with hundreds of students around the world. \nAlthough Mexican women have had full legal access to higher education\nsince the beginning of the 20th century, they were\ndiscouraged from pursuing advanced degrees or careers as professors of\nphilosophy. With a few notable exceptions, it wasn’t until after\n1960—not incidentally, the year birth control was made widely\navailable—that women began to publish their own philosophy more\nregularly. In addition to several of the women mentioned above (e.g.,\nKrauze, Frost, Rovira), Vera Yamuni Tabush (1917–2003), another\nstudent of Gaos, wrote about philosophy in the Spanish language,\nArabic philosophy, and feminism. See, for example, her highly-regarded\nConceptos e imágenes en pensadores de lengua\nespañola (1951). \nAs women started to pursue advanced degrees in philosophy, they began\nto philosophize about the role of women in Mexican culture and the\nchallenges facing aspiring female intellectuals and artists. The long\nlist of Mexican feminists, which stretches back as far as Sor Juana,\nincludes Paula Gómez Alonso (1896–1972), the first\ngraduate of philosophy of the University of México, whose\nmaster’s thesis was titled La cultura femenina (1933);\nRosario Castellanos (1925–1974), a famous author, who wrote a\nphilosophical essay called Sobre cultura femenina (1950); and\nGraciela Hierro (1928–2003), the main proponent of feminist\nphilosophy and founder of the Centro de Estudios de Género of\nthe National Autonomous University of Mexico. Two of her books are\nÉtica y feminismo (1985), and De la\ndomesticación a la educación de las mexicanas\n(1989). \nAs in other Latin American countries, the history of philosophy is a\npopular area of research, largely because most philosophy departments\ntend to teach the discipline from a historical rather than thematic or\nanalytic perspective. The most popular periods of philosophy are\nancient philosophy, modern philosophy, phenomenology, and German\nexistentialism. Among the historians of philosophy today, we can\nmention: Laura Benitez (b. 1944), Alberto Constante (b. 1949), Antonio\nZirión (b. 1950), Enrique Hülsz (1954–2019), Gustavo\nLeyva (b. 1959), Pedro Stepanenko (b. 1960), Efraín Lazos (b.\n1962), Ernesto Priani (b. 1962), Ricardo Salles (b. 1965), Faviola\nRivera (b. 1967), and Ángel Xolocotzi (b. 1969). \nNot unlike other areas of Mexican culture, the production of\nphilosophy has been concentrated in Mexico City. However, today dozens\nof philosophy departments throughout the Mexican Republic are growing\nin size and influence. Many universities now offer graduate degrees\nand some publish their own journals and books, such as the state\nuniversities of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Puebla, Veracruz, and\nZacatecas. \nThere are several philosophical associations in Mexico, though the\nAsociación filosófica de México is the\nlargest. Since 1975, the AFM (which serves a role similar to the\nAmerican Philosophical Association (in the United States) hosts a\nlarge biannual conference that plays an essential role in forming a\nnational philosophical community (see\n Other Internet Resources below). \nPhilosophy also continues to play an important role in Mexican\nsecondary education. Although philosophy has been taught in public\nhigh schools since the 19th century, in 2009 the Mexican\ngovernment tried to eliminate philosophical instruction from public\neducation (not unlike the second half of the 19th century\nunder the guidance of Barreda’s positivist curriculum, and\nCardenas’s attempt to make education in Mexico socialist in\n1933). However, in response, a group of academics founded the\nObservatorio Filosófico de México, which\neventually thwarted government interference (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The Observatorio’s defense of philosophy in Mexico was\nso successful that in 2019, the government made a constitutional\namendment recognizing philosophical instruction as the right of all\nMexicans. \nThis official commitment to the value of philosophy is not without\nprecedent; it represents a long history of questioning and reaffirming\nthe role of philosophy in Mexican life. Other events in this history\n(discussed above) include the war for Mexican independence, guided by\nEnlightenment philosophy; Gabino Barreda’s effort to define\nMexican national identity through positivist education; the\nAteneo’s critique of positivism during the Mexican\nRevolution; amendments to the 1933 Constitution, which sought to make\npublic education socialist; and the philosophy of lo\nmexicano, a philosophical expression and critique of\n20th century Mexican nationalism. \nOne challenge to studying Mexican philosophy outside Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, has been the lack of resources in\nEnglish. However, over the past several years, a group of scholars\nhave begun to produce translations of and commentaries on canonical\ntexts. One notable example is Mexican Philosophy in the\n20th Century: Essential Readings, edited by Carlos\nAlberto Sánchez and Robert Eli Sanchez, Jr. (For future\nprojects related to making Mexican philosophy more widely available in\nEnglish, and related to building a binational community dedicate to\nthe development of Mexican philosophy, see\n 20th Century Mexican Philosophy in Other Internet Resources.)\n The APA’s Newsletter on Hispanic and Latino Issues in\nPhilosophy is another valuable source of information and research\n(see\n Other Internet Resources). \nToday, Mexican philosophy is a professional, pluralistic, and growing\nfield of study. Thanks in large part to the collaboration among\nphilosophers in Mexico and United States, the resources required to\nadvance research are now easily accessible in both Spanish and\nEnglish. And with the ongoing emergence of new translations,\ncommentaries, and histories, as well as regular binational meetings,\nit is now reasonable to expect that the philosophy produced in Mexico\nand about the Mexican (or Mexican-American) experience will continue\nto attract new scholars and will soon be recognized for its impressive\ncontribution to world philosophy.","contact.mail":"sanchezjr.robert@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
