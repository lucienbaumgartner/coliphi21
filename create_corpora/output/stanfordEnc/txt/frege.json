Frege essentially reconceived the discipline of logic by\nconstructing a formal system which, in effect, constituted the first\n‘predicate calculus’. In this formal system, Frege\ndeveloped an analysis of quantified statements and formalized the\nnotion of a ‘proof’ in terms that are still accepted\ntoday. Frege then demonstrated that one could use his system to\nresolve theoretical mathematical statements in terms of simpler\nlogical and mathematical notions. One of the axioms that Frege later\nadded to his system, in the attempt to derive significant parts of\nmathematics from logic, proved to be inconsistent. Nevertheless, his\ndefinitions (e.g., of the predecessor relation and of the\nconcept of natural number) and methods (e.g., for deriving\nthe axioms of number theory) constituted a significant advance. To\nground his views about the relationship of logic and mathematics,\nFrege conceived a comprehensive philosophy of language that many\nphilosophers still find insightful.  However, his lifelong project, of\nshowing that mathematics was reducible to logic, was not\nsuccessful. \n\n\nAccording to the curriculum vitae that the 26-year old Frege\nfiled in 1874 with his Habilitationsschrift, he was born on\nNovember 8, 1848 in Wismar, a town then in Mecklenburg-Schwerin but\nnow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  His father, Alexander, a headmaster of\na secondary school for girls, and his mother, Auguste (nee\nBialloblotzky), brought him up in the Lutheran faith. Frege attended\nthe local Gymnasium for 15 years, and after graduation in 1869,\nentered the University of Jena (see Frege 1874, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.) 1984, 92). At Jena, Frege attended lectures by Ernst Karl Abbe, who\nsubsequently became Frege’s mentor and who had a significant\nintellectual and personal influence on Frege’s life.  Frege\ntransferred to the University of Göttingen in 1871, and two years\nlater, in 1873, was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics, having written a\ndissertation under Ernst Schering titled Über eine\ngeometrische Darstellung der imaginären Gebilde in der Ebene\n(“On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in the\nPlane”). Frege explains the project in his thesis as follows:\n“By a geometrical representation of imaginary forms in the plane\nwe understand accordingly a kind of correlation in virtue of which\nevery real or imaginary element of the plane has a real, intuitive\nelement corresponding to it” (Frege 1873, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.)  1984, 3).  Here, by ‘imaginary\nforms’, Frege is referring to imaginary points, imaginary curves\nand lines, etc.  Interestingly, one section of the thesis concerns the\nrepresentation of complex numbers by magnitudes of angles in the\nplane. In 1874, Frege completed his Habilitationsschrift,\nentitled Rechnungsmethoden, die sich auf eine Erweiterung\ndes Grössenbegriffes gründen (“Methods of\nCalculation Based on an Extension of the Concept of Quantity”).\nImmediately after submitting this thesis, the good offices of\nAbbe led Frege to become a Privatdozent (Lecturer) at\nthe University of Jena.  Library records from the University of Jena\nestablish that, over the next 5 years, Frege checked out texts in\nmechanics, analysis, geometry, Abelian functions, and elliptical\nfunctions (Kreiser 1984, \n 21).[1] \n No doubt, many of these texts helped him to\nprepare the lectures he is listed as giving by the University of Jena\ncourse bulletin, for these lectures are on topics that often match the\ntexts, i.e., analytic geometry, elliptical and Abelian functions,\nalgebraic analysis, functions of complex variables, etc. (Kratzsch\n1979).[2] This course of Frege’s reading and lectures during the period of\n1874–1879 dovetailed quite naturally with the interests he\ndisplayed in his Habilitationsschrift. The ‘extension\nof the concept of quantity’ referred to in the title concerns\nthe fact that our understanding of quantities (e.g., lengths,\nsurfaces, etc.)  has to be extended in the context of complex\nnumbers.[3] He\nsays, right at the beginning of this work: Here we can see the beginning of two lifelong interests of Frege,\nnamely, (1) in how concepts and definitions developed for one domain\nfare when applied in a wider domain, and (2) in the contrast between\nlegitimate appeals to intuition in geometry and illegitimate appeals\nto intuition in the development of pure number theory. Indeed, some\nrecent scholars have (a) shown how Frege’s work in logic was informed\nin part by his understanding of the analogies and disanalogies between\ngeometry and number theory (Wilson 1992), and (b) shown that Frege was\nintimately familiar with the division among late 19th century\nmathematicians doing complex analysis who split over whether it is\nbetter to use the analytic methods of Weierstrass or the intuitive\ngeometric methods of Riemann (Tappenden 2006). Weierstrass’s 1872\npaper, describing a real-valued function that is continuous\neverywhere but differentiable \n nowhere,[4]\n was well known and provided an example of an ungraphable functions\nthat places limits on intuition. Yet, at the same time, Frege clearly\naccepted Riemann’s practice and methods derived from taking functions\nas fundamental, as opposed to Weierstrass’s focus on functions that\ncan be represented or analyzed in terms of other mathematical objects\n(e.g., complex power series). In 1879, Frege published his first book Begriffsschrift, eine\nder arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens\n(Concept Notation: A formula language of pure thought, modelled\nupon that of arithmetic) and was promoted\nto außerordentlicher Professor (Extraordinarius Professor)\nat Jena.  Although the Begriffsschrift constituted a major\nadvance in logic, it was neither widely understood nor well-received.\nSome scholars have suggested that this was due to the facts that the\nnotation was 2-dimensional instead of linear and that he didn’t build\nupon the work of others but rather presented something radically new\n(e.g., Mendelsohn 2005, 2).  Though our discussion below is framed\nprimarily with an eye towards the system Frege developed in his\ntwo-volume work of 1893/1903 (Grundgesetze der Arithmetik),\nthe principal elements of this later system can be found already in\nthe Begriffsschrift of 1879. Frege’s next really significant work was his second book,\nDie Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logisch mathematische\nUntersuchung über den Begriff der Zahl, published in\n1884. Frege begins this work with criticisms of previous attempts to\ndefine the concept of number, and then offers his own\nanalysis. The Grundlagen contains a variety of insights still\ndiscussed today, such as: (a) the claim that a statement of number\n(e.g., ‘there are eight planets’) is a higher-order\nassertion about a concept (see Section 2.5 below); (b) his famous\nContext Principle (“never ask for the meaning of a word in\nisolation, but only in the context of a proposition”), and (c)\nthe formulation of a principle (now called ‘Hume’s\nPrinciple’ in the secondary literature) that asserts the\nequivalence of the claim “the number of Fs is equal to\nthe number of Gs” with the claim that “there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the objects falling under F\nand the objects falling under G” (see Section 2.5 below).\nMore generally, Frege provides in the Grundlagen a\nnon-technical philosophical justification and outline of the ideas\nthat he was to develop technically in his two-volume\nwork Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893/1903). In the years 1891–1892, Frege published three of his most\nwell-known papers, ‘Function and Concept’ (1891),\n‘On Sense and Reference’ (1892a), and ‘On Concept\nand Object’ (1892b). Immediately after that, in 1893, he\npublished the first volume of the technical work previously\nmentioned, Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.  In 1896, he was\npromoted to ordentlicher Honorarprofessor (regular honorary\nprofessor).  Six years later (on June 16, 1902), as he was preparing\nthe proofs of the second volume of the Grundgesetze, he\nreceived a letter from Bertrand Russell, informing him that one could\nderive a contradiction in the system he had developed in the first\nvolume.  Russell’s letter frames the paradox first in terms of\nthe predicate P = ‘being a predicate which cannot be predicated\nof itself’, and then in terms of the class of all those classes\nthat are not members of themselves.  Frege, in the Appendix to\nthe second volume, rephrased the paradox in terms of his own \nsystem.  \nFrege never fully recovered from the fatal flaw discovered in the\nfoundations of his Grundgesetze.  His attempts at salvaging\nthe work by restricting Basic Law V were not successful. However, he\ncontinued teaching at Jena, and from 1903–1917, he published six\npapers, including ‘What is a Function?’ (1904) and\n‘On the Foundations of Geometry’ (Frege 1903b and 1906).\nIn the latter, Frege criticized Hilbert’s understanding and use of the\naxiomatic method (see the entry on the\n  Frege-Hilbert controversy). From\nthis time period, we have the lecture notes that Rudolf Carnap took as\na student in two of his courses (see Reck and Awodey 2004). In 1917,\nhe retired from the University of Jena. In the last phase of Frege’s life, from 1917–1925, Frege\npublished three philosophical papers, in a series, with the titles\n‘The Thought’, ‘Negation’, and ‘Compound\nThoughts’ (Frege 1918a, 1918b, and 1923, respectively).  After\nthat, however, we have only fragments of philosophical works.\nUnfortunately, his last years saw him become more than just\npolitically conservative and right-wing – his diary for a brief\nperiod in 1924 show sympathies for fascism and anti-Semitism (see\nFrege 1924 [1996], translated by R. Mendelsohn).  He died on July 26,\n1925, in Bad Kleinen (now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). \n\nFrege provided a foundations for the modern discipline of logic by\ndeveloping a more perspicuous method of formally representing the\nlogic of thoughts and inferences. He did this by developing: (a) a\nsystem allowing one to study inferences formally, (b) an analysis of\ncomplex sentences and quantifier phrases that showed an underlying\nunity to certain classes of inferences, (c) an analysis\nof proof and definition, (d) a theory of extensions\nwhich, though seriously flawed, offered an intriguing picture of the\nfoundations of mathematics, (e) an analysis of statements about number\n(i.e., of answers to the question ‘How many?’), (f)\ndefinitions and proofs of some of the basic axioms of number theory\nfrom a limited set of logically primitive concepts and axioms, and (g)\na conception of logic as a discipline which has some compelling\nfeatures. We discuss these developments in the following\nsubsections. \n\nIn an attempt to realize Leibniz’s ideas for a universal formal\nlanguage and a rational calculus, Frege developed a formal notation\nfor regimenting thought and reasoning. Though this notation was first\noutlined in his Begriffsschrift (1879), the most mature\nstatement of Frege’s system was in his 2-volume Grundgesetze der\nArithmetik (1893/1903). Frege’s two systems are best\ncharacterized as term logics, since all of the complete expressions\nare denoting terms. Frege analyzed ordinary predication in these\nsystems, and so they can also be conceived as predicate calculi. A\npredicate calculus is a formal system (a formal language and a method\nof proof) in which one can represent valid inferences among\npredications, i.e., among statements in which properties are\npredicated of objects. \n\nIn this subsection, we shall examine the most basic elements of\nFrege’s 1893/1903 term logic and predicate calculus. These are the\nstatements involving function applications and the simple predications\nwhich fall out as a special case. \n\nIn Frege’s term logic, all of the terms and well-formed formulas\nare denoting expressions. These include: (a) simple names of objects,\nlike ‘\\(2\\)’ and ‘\\(\\pi\\)’, (b) complex terms\nwhich denote objects, like ‘\\(2^2\\)’ and ‘\\(3 +\n1\\)’, and (c) sentences (which are also complex terms). The\ncomplex terms in (b) and (c) are formed with the help of\n‘incomplete expressions’ which signify functions, such as\nthe unary squaring function ‘\\((\\:)^2\\)’ and the binary\naddition function ‘\\((\\:) + (\\:)\\)’. In these functional\nexpressions, ‘\\((\\:)\\)’ is used as a placeholder for what\nFrege called the arguments of the function; the placeholder\nreveals that the expressions signifying function are, on Frege’s\nview, incomplete and stand in contrast to complete expressions such as\nthose in (a), (b), and (c). (Though Frege thought it inappropriate to\ncall the incomplete expressions that signify functions\n‘names’, we shall sometimes do so in what follows, though\nthe reader should be warned that Frege had reasons for not following\nthis practice.) Thus, a mathematical expression such as\n‘\\(2^2\\)’ denotes the result of applying the\nfunction \\((\\:)^2\\) to the number \\(2\\) as argument, namely, the\nnumber \\(4\\). Similarly, the expression ‘\\(7 + 1\\)’ denotes the\nresult of applying the binary function \\(+((\\:),(\\:))\\) to the\nnumbers \\(7\\) and \\(1\\) as arguments, in that order. \n\nEven the sentences of Frege’s mature logical system are\n(complex) denoting terms; they are terms that\ndenote truth-values. Frege distinguished two truth-values,\nThe True and The False, which he took to be objects. The basic\nsentences of Frege’s system are constructed using the expression\n‘\\((\\:) = (\\:)\\)’, which signifies a binary function that\nmaps a pair of objects x and\ny to The True if x is identical to y and\nmaps x and y to The False otherwise. A sentence such\nas ‘\\(2^2 = 4\\)’ therefore denotes the truth-value The\nTrue, while the sentence ‘\\(2^2 = 6\\)’ denotes The\nFalse. \n\nAn important class of these identity statements are statements of the\nform ‘\\(f(x) = y\\)’, where \\(f(\\:)\\) is any unary function\n(i.e., function of a single variable), \\(x\\) is the argument of the\nfunction, and \\(f(x)\\) is the value of the function for the argument\n\\(x\\). Similarly, \\(f(x,y) = z\\) is an identity statement involving a\nbinary function of two variables. And so on, for functions of\nmore than two variables. \n\nIf we replace a complete name appearing in a sentence by a\nplaceholder, the result is an incomplete expression that signifies a\nspecial kind of function which Frege called a concept.\nConcepts are functions which map every argument to one of the\ntruth-values. Thus, ‘\\((\\:) > 2\\)’ denotes the concept\nbeing greater than \\(2\\), which maps every object greater\nthan \\(2\\) to The True and maps every other object to The\nFalse. Similarly, ‘\\((\\:)^2 = 4\\)’ denotes the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). Frege\nwould say that any object that a concept maps to The True falls\nunder the concept. Thus, the number \\(2\\) falls under the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). In\nwhat follows, we use lower-case expressions like \\(f(\\:)\\) to talk\ngenerally about functions, and upper-case expressions like \\(F(\\:)\\)\nto talk more specifically about those functions which are\nconcepts. \n\nFrege supposed that a mathematical claim such as ‘\\(2\\) is\nprime’ should be formally represented as\n‘\\(P(2)\\)’. The verb phrase ‘is prime’ is\nthereby analyzed as denoting the concept \\(P(\\:)\\) which maps\nprimes to The True and everything else to The False. Thus, a simple\npredication like ‘\\(2\\) is prime’ becomes\nanalyzed in Frege’s system as a special case of functional\napplication. \n\nThe preceding analysis of simple mathematical predications led Frege\nto extend the applicability of this system to the representation of\nnon-mathematical thoughts and predications. This move formed the basis\nof the modern predicate calculus. Frege analyzed a non-mathematical\npredicate like ‘is happy’ as signifying a function of one\nvariable which maps its arguments to a truth-value. Thus, ‘is\nhappy’ denotes a concept which can be represented in the formal\nsystem as ‘\\(H(\\:)\\)’. \\(H(\\:)\\) maps those arguments\nwhich are happy to The True, and maps everything else to The\nFalse. The sentence ‘John is happy’, represented as\n‘\\(H(j)\\)’, is thereby analyzed as: the object denoted by\n‘John’ falls under the concept signified by\n‘\\((\\:)\\) is happy’. Thus, a simple predication is\nanalyzed in terms of falling under a concept, which in turn, is\nanalyzed in terms of functions which map their arguments to truth\nvalues. By contrast, in the modern predicate calculus, this last step\nof analyzing predication in terms of functions is not assumed;\npredication is seen as more fundamental than functional application.\nThe sentence ‘John is happy’ is formally represented as\n‘\\(Hj\\)’, where this is a basic form of predication\n(‘the object \\(j\\) instantiates or exemplifies the property\n\\(H\\)’). In the modern predicate calculus, functional\napplication is analyzable in terms of predication, as we shall soon\nsee. \n\nIn Frege’s analysis, the verb phrase ‘loves’\nsignifies a binary function of two variables: \\(L((\\:),(\\:))\\). This\nfunction takes a pair of arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and maps them to\nThe True if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) and maps all other pairs of arguments to\nThe False. Although it is a descendent of Frege’s system, the\nmodern predicate calculus analyzes loves as a two-place\nrelation (written: \\(Lxy\\)) rather than a function; some objects stand\nin the relation and others do not. The difference between\nFrege’s understanding of predication and the one manifested by\nthe modern predicate calculus is simply this: in the modern predicate\ncalculus, relations are taken as basic, and functions are defined as a\nspecial case of relation, namely, those relations \\(R\\) such that for\nany objects \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), if \\(Rxy\\) and \\(Rxz\\), then\n\\(y=z\\). By contrast, Frege took functions to be more basic than\nrelations. His logic is based on functional application rather than\npredication; a binary relation is analyzed as a binary function that\nmaps a pair of arguments to a truth-value.  Thus, a 3-place relation\nlike gives would be analyzed in Frege’s logic as a\nfunction that maps arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) gives \\(y\\) to \\(z\\); the\n4-place relation buys would be analyzed as a function that\nmaps the arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and \\(u\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) buys \\(y\\) from \\(z\\) for\namount \\(u\\); etc. \n So far, we have been discussing Frege’s analysis of\n‘atomic’ statements. To complete the basic logical\nrepresentation of thoughts, Frege added notation for representing more\ncomplex statements (such as negated and conditional statements) and\nstatements of generality (those involving the expressions\n‘every’ and ‘some’). Though we no longer use\nhis notation for representing complex and general statements, it is\nimportant to see how the notation in Frege’s term logic already\ncontained all the expressive power of the modern predicate calculus.\n \n\nThere are four special functional expressions which are used in\nFrege’s system to express complex and general statements: \n\nThe best way to understand this notation is by way of some tables,\nwhich show some specific examples of statements and how those are\nrendered in Frege’s notation and in the modern predicate\ncalculus. \n The first table shows how Frege’s logic can express the\ntruth-functional connectives such as not, if-then, and, or, and\nif-and-only-if.  \n\nAs one can see, Frege didn’t use the primitive connectives\n‘and’, ‘or’, or ‘if and only if’,\nbut always used canonical equivalent forms defined in terms of\nnegations and conditionals. Note the last row of the table —\nwhen Frege wants to assert that two conditions are materially\nequivalent, he uses the identity sign, since this says that they\ndenote the same truth-value. In the modern sentential calculus, the\nbiconditional does something equivalent, for a statement of the form\n\\(\\phi \\equiv \\psi\\) is true whenever \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are both\ntrue or both false. The only difference is, in the modern sentential\ncalculus \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are not construed as terms denoting\ntruth-values, but rather as sentences having truth conditions. Of\ncourse, Frege could, in his notation, use the sentence ‘\\((\\phi\n\\to \\psi) \\amp (\\psi \\to \\phi)\\)’ to assert \\(\\phi \\equiv\n\\psi\\). \n\nThe table below compares statements of generality in Frege’s notation\nand in the modern predicate calculus. Frege used a special typeface\n(Gothic) for variables in general statements. \n\nNote the last line. Here again, Frege uses the identity sign to help\nstate the material equivalence of two concepts. He can do this because\nmaterially equivalent concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are such that \\(F\\)\nmaps an object \\(x\\) to The True whenever \\(G\\) maps \\(x\\) to The\nTrue; i.e., for all arguments \\(x\\), \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) map \\(x\\) to the\nsame truth-value. \n\nIn the modern predicate calculus, the symbols\n‘\\(\\forall\\)’ (‘every’) and\n‘\\(\\exists\\)’ (‘some’) are called the\n‘universal’ and ‘existential’ quantifier,\nrespectively, and the variable ‘\\(x\\)’ in the sentence\n‘\\(\\forall xMx\\)’ is called a ‘quantified\nvariable’, or ‘variable bound by the quantifier’. We\nwill follow this practice of calling statements involving one of these\nquantifier phrases ‘quantified statements’. As one can see\nfrom the table above, Frege didn’t use an existential\nquantifier. He was aware that a statement of the form ‘\\(\\exists\nx\\phi \\)’ could always be defined as ‘\\(\\neg \\forall x\n\\neg \\phi\\)’, where \\(\\phi\\) is any formula. \n\nIt is important to mention here that the predicate calculus\nformulable in Frege’s logic is a ‘second-order’ predicate\ncalculus. This means it allows quantification over functions as well as\nquantification over objects; i.e., statements of the form ‘Every\nfunction \\(f\\) is such that …’ and ‘Some function\n\\(f\\) is such that …’ are allowed. Thus, the statement\n‘objects a and b fall under the same\nconcepts’ would be written as follows in Frege’\nnotation: \n and in the modern second-order predicate calculus, we write this\nas:  \nReaders interested in learning more about Frege’s notation can\nconsult Beaney (1997, Appendix 2), Furth (1967), Reck & Awodey\n(2004, 26–34), and Cook (2013). In what follows, however, we\nshall continue to use the notation of the modern predicate calculus\ninstead of Frege’s notation. In particular, we adopt the\nfollowing conventions: \n\nFrege’s functional analysis of predication coupled with his\nunderstanding of generality freed him from the limitations of the\n‘subject-predicate’ analysis of ordinary language sentences\nthat formed the basis of Aristotelian logic and it made it possible for\nhim to develop a more general treatment of inferences involving\n‘every’ and ‘some’. In traditional Aristotelian\nlogic, the subject of a sentence and the direct object of a verb are\nnot on a logical par. The rules governing the inferences between\nstatements with different but related subject terms are different from\nthe rules governing the inferences between statements with different\nbut related verb complements. For example, in Aristotelian logic, the\nrule which permits the valid inference from ‘John loves\nMary’ to ‘Something loves Mary’ is different from the\nrule which permits the valid inference from ‘John loves\nMary’ to ‘John loves something’. The rule governing\nthe first inference is a rule which applies only to subject terms\nwhereas the rule governing the second inference governs reasoning\nwithin the predicate, and thus applies only to the transitive verb\ncomplements (i.e., direct objects). In Aristotelian logic, these\ninferences have nothing in common. \n\nIn Frege’s logic, however, a single rule governs both the\ninference from ‘John loves Mary’ to ‘Something loves\nMary’ and the inference from ‘John loves Mary’ to\n‘John loves something’. That’s because the subject\nJohn and the direct object Mary are both considered on a logical par,\nas arguments of the function loves. In effect, Frege saw no\nlogical difference between the subject ‘John’ and the\ndirect object ‘Mary’. What is logically important is that\n‘loves’ denotes a function of two arguments. No matter\nwhether the quantified expression ‘something’ appears as\nsubject (‘Something loves Mary’) or within a predicate\n(‘John loves something’), it is to be resolved in the same\nway. In effect, Frege treated these quantified expressions as\nvariable-binding operators. The variable-binding operator ‘some\n\\(x\\) is such that’ can bind the variable ‘\\(x\\)’ in\nthe open sentence ‘\\(x\\) loves Mary’ as well as the\nvariable ‘\\(x\\)’ in the open sentence ‘John loves\n\\(x\\)’. Thus, Frege analyzed the above inferences in the\nfollowing general way: \n\nBoth inferences are instances of a single valid inference rule. To\nsee this more clearly, here are the formal representations of the above\ninformal arguments: \n\nThe logical axiom which licenses both inferences has the form: \n where \\(R\\) is a relation that can take \\(n\\) arguments, \\(a_1,\n\\ldots , a_n\\) are any constants (names), and \\(1 \\leq i \\leq\nn\\). This logical axiom tells us that from a simple predication\ninvolving an \\(n\\)-place relation, one can existentially generalize on\nany argument, and validly derive a existential statement.  \n\nIndeed, this axiom can be made even more general. If \\(\\phi (a)\\) is\nany statement (formula) in which a constant (name) \\(a\\) appears, and\n\\(\\phi (x)\\) is the result of replacing one or more occurrences of\n\\(a\\) by \\(x\\), then the following is a logical axiom: \n The inferences which start with the premise ‘John loves\nMary’, displayed above, both appeal to this axiom for\njustification. This axiom is actually derivable as a theorem from\nFrege’s Basic Law IIa (1893, §47). Basic Law IIa is\nformulated as \\(\\forall x\\phi (x) \\to \\phi (a)\\), where \\(\\phi(a)\\) is\nthe result of substituting \\(a\\) for one or more variables \\(x\\) bound\nby the quantifier (though see below for a more careful discussion of\nthis axiom). So the axiom displayed above for the existential\nquantifier can be derived from IIa using the rules governing\nconditionals, negation, and the definition of \\(\\exists x\\phi\\)\ndiscussed above.  \n\nThere is one other consequence of Frege’s logic of\nquantification that should be mentioned. Frege took claims of the form\n\\(\\exists x\\phi\\) to be existence claims. He suggested that\nexistence is not a concept under which objects fall but\nrather a second-level concept under which first-level concepts fall. A\nconcept \\(F\\) falls under this second-level concept just in case \\(F\\)\nmaps at least one object to The True. So the claim ‘Martians\ndon’t exist’ is analyzed as an assertion about the\nconcept martian, namely, that nothing falls under it.  Frege\ntherefore took existence to be that second-level concept\nwhich maps a first-level concept \\(F\\) to The True just in case\n\\(\\exists xFx\\). Some philosophers have thought that this analysis\nvalidates Kant’s view that existence is not a (real)\npredicate. \n\nFrege’s system (i.e., his term logic/predicate calculus) consisted\nof a language and an apparatus for proving statements. The latter\nconsisted of a set of logical axioms (statements considered to be\ntruths of logic) and a set of rules of inference that lay out the\nconditions under which certain statements of the language may be\ncorrectly inferred from others. Frege made a point of showing how every\nstep in a proof of a proposition was justified either in terms of one\nof the axioms or in terms of one of the rules of inference or justified\nby a theorem or derived rule that had already been proved. \n\nThus, as part of his formal system, Frege developed a strict\nunderstanding of a ‘proof’. In essence, he defined a proof\nto be any finite sequence of statements such that each statement in the\nsequence either is an axiom or follows from previous members by a valid\nrule of inference. Thus, a proof of a theorem of logic, say φ, is\ntherefore any finite sequence of statements (with φ the final\nstatement in the sequence) such that each member of the sequence: (a)\nis one of the logical axioms of the formal system, or (b) follows from\nprevious members of the sequence by a rule of inference. These are\nessentially the definitions that logicians still use today. \n\nFrege was extremely careful about the proper description and\ndefinition of logical and mathematical concepts. He developed powerful\nand insightful criticisms of mathematical work which did not meet his\nstandards for clarity. For example, he criticized mathematicians who\ndefined a variable to be a number that varies rather than an expression\nof language which can vary as to which determinate number it may take\nas a value. More importantly, however, Frege was the first to claim that a\nproperly formed definition had to have two important metatheoretical\nproperties.  Let us call the new, defined symbol introduced in a\ndefinition the definiendum, and the term that is used to\ndefine the new term the definiens.  Then Frege was the first\nto suggest that proper definitions have to be both eliminable\n(a definendum must always be replaceable by its definiens in any\nformula in which the former occurs) and conservative (a\ndefinition should not make it possible to prove new relationships\namong formulas that were formerly unprovable).  Concerning one of his\ndefinitions in the Begriffsschrift (§24), Frege\nwrites:  \nFrege later criticized those mathematicians who developed\n‘piecemeal’ definitions or ‘creative’\ndefinitions. In the Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, II (1903,\nSections 56–67) Frege criticized the practice of defining a\nconcept on a given range of objects and later redefining the concept\non a wider, more inclusive range of objects. Frequently, this\n‘piecemeal’ style of definition led to conflict, since the\nredefined concept did not always reduce to the original concept when\none restricts the range to the original class of objects. In that same\nwork (1903, Sections 139–147), Frege criticized the mathematical\npractice of introducing notation to name (unique) entities without\nfirst proving that there exist (unique) such entities. He pointed out\nthat such ‘creative definitions’ were simply unjustified.\nCreative definitions fail to be conservative, as this was explained\nabove.  \n\nFrege’s ontology consisted of two fundamentally different types of\nentities, namely, functions and objects (1891, 1892b, 1904). Functions\nare in some sense ‘unsaturated’; i.e., they are the kind of\nthing which take objects as arguments and map those arguments to a\nvalue. This distinguishes them from objects. As we’ve seen, the domain\nof objects included two special objects, namely, the truth-values The\nTrue and The False. \n\nIn his work of 1893/1903, Frege attempted to expand the domain of\nobjects by systematically associating, with each function \\(f\\), an\nobject which he called the course-of-values of \\(f\\). The\ncourse-of-values of a function is a record of the value of the function\nfor each argument. The principle Frege used to systematize\ncourses-of-values is Basic Law V (1893/§20;): \n\nFrege used the a Greek epsilon with a smooth breathing mark above it\nas part of the notation for signifying the course-of-values of\nthe function \\(f\\): \n\nwhere the first occurrence of the Greek \\(\\varepsilon\\) (with the\nsmooth breathing mark above it) is a ‘variable-binding\noperator’ which we might read as ‘the course-of-values\nof’. To avoid the appearance of variable clash, we may also use\na Greek \\(\\alpha\\) (also with a smooth breathing mark above) as a\nvariable-binding operator. Using this notation, Frege formally\nrepresented Basic Law V in his system as: \n\n(Actually, Frege used an identity sign instead of the biconditional\nas the main connective of this principle, for reasons described\nabove.) \n\nFrege called the course-of-values of a concept \\(F\\) its\nextension. The extension of a concept \\(F\\) records just\nthose objects which \\(F\\) maps to The True. Thus Basic Law V applies\nequally well to the extensions of concepts. Let\n‘\\(\\phi(x)\\)’ be an open sentence of any complexity with\nthe free variable \\(x\\) (the variable \\(x\\) may have more than one\noccurrence in \\(\\phi(x)\\), but for simplicity, assume it has only one\noccurrence). Then Frege would use the expression: \nwhere the second epsilon replaces \\(x\\) in \\(\\phi (x)\\), to denote the\nextension of the concept \\(\\phi\\).  Where ‘\\(n\\)’ is the\nname of an object, Frege could define ‘object \\(n\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept \\(\\phi\\)’ in the\nfollowing simple terms: ‘the concept \\(\\phi\\) maps \\(n\\) to The\nTrue’, i.e., \\(\\phi(n)\\). For example, the number \\(3\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept\nodd number greater than \\(2\\) if and only if this concept\nmaps \\(3\\) to The True. \n\nUnfortunately, Basic Law V implies a contradiction, and this was\npointed out to Frege by Bertrand Russell just as the second volume of\nthe Grundgesetze was going to press. Russell recognized that\nsome extensions are elements of themselves and some are not; the\nextension of the concept extension is an element of itself,\nsince that concept would map its own extension to The True. The\nextension of the concept spoon is not an element of itself,\nbecause that concept would map its own extension to The False (since\nextensions aren’t spoons). But now what about the\nconcept extension which is not an element of itself?  Let\n\\(E\\) represent this concept and let \\(e\\) name the extension of\n\\(E\\). Is \\(e\\) an element of itself? Well, \\(e\\) is an element of\nitself if and only if \\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True (by the definition\nof ‘element of’ given at the end of the previous\nparagraph, where \\(e\\) is the extension of the concept \\(E\\)). But\n\\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True if and only if \\(e\\) is an extension\nwhich is not an element of itself, i.e., if and only if \\(e\\) is not\nan element of itself. We have thus reasoned that \\(e\\) is an element\nof itself if and only if it is not, showing the incoherency in\nFrege’s conception of an extension. \n\nFurther discussion of this problem can be found in the entry on\n Russell’s Paradox,\n and a more complete\nexplanation of how the paradox arises in Frege’s system is presented in\nthe entry on\n Frege’s theorem and foundations for arithmetic. \n\nBefore he became aware of Russell’s paradox, Frege attempted to\nconstruct a logical foundation for mathematics. Using the logical\nsystem containing Basic Law V (1893/1903), he attempted to demonstrate\nthe truth of the philosophical thesis known as logicism, i.e.,\nthe idea not only that mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of\npurely logical concepts but also that mathematical principles can be\nderived from the laws of logic alone. But given that the crucial\ndefinitions of mathematical concepts were stated in terms of\nextensions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V undermined Frege’s attempt\nto establish the thesis of logicism. Few philosophers today believe\nthat mathematics can be reduced to logic in the way Frege had in mind.\nMathematical theories such as set theory seem to require some\nnon-logical concepts (such as set membership) which cannot be defined\nin terms of logical concepts, at least when axiomatized by certain\npowerful non-logical axioms (such as the proper axioms of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory). Despite the fact that a contradiction\ninvalidated a part of his system, the intricate theoretical web of\ndefinitions and proofs developed in the Grundgesetze\nnevertheless offered philosophical logicians an intriguing conceptual\nframework. The ideas of\n Bertrand Russell\n and\n Alfred North Whitehead\n in\n Principia Mathematica\n owe\na huge debt to the work found in Frege’s Grundgesetze. \n\nDespite Frege’s failure to provide a coherent systematization of the\nnotion of an extension, we shall make use of the notion in what follows\nto explain Frege’s theory of numbers and analysis of number statements,\nwithout assuming Basic Law V. It suffices to use our\ninformal understanding of the notion, though extensions can be\nrehabilitated in various ways, either axiomatically as in modern set\ntheory or as in the various ways logicians have found to weaken\nFrege’s system. (See T. Parsons 1987, Burgess 1998, Heck 1996, Wehmeier\n1999, Ferreira & Wehmeier 2002, Fine 2002, Anderson & Zalta\n2004, Ferreira 2005, and Antonelli & May 2005.) \n\nIn what has come to be regarded as a seminal treatise, Die\nGrundlagen der Arithmetik (1884), Frege began work on the idea of\nderiving some of the basic principles of arithmetic from what he\nthought were more fundamental logical principles and logical concepts.\nPhilosophers today still find that work insightful. The leading idea\nis that a statement of number, such as ‘There are eight\nplanets’ and ‘There are two authors of Principia\nMathematica’, is really a statement about a concept. Frege\nrealized that one and the same physical phenomena could be\nconceptualized in different ways, and that answers to the question\n‘How many?’ only make sense once a concept \\(F\\) is\nsupplied. Thus, one and the same physical entity might be\nconceptualized as consisting of \\(1\\) army, \\(5\\) divisions, \\(20\\)\nregiments, \\(100\\) companies, etc., and so the question ‘How\nmany?’ only becomes legitimate once one supplies the concept\nbeing counted, such as\narmy, division, regiment, or\ncompany (1884, §46). \n\nUsing this insight, Frege took true statements like ‘There are\neight planets’ and ‘There are two authors of Principia\nMathematica’ to be “second level” claims about\nthe concepts planet and author of Principia Mathematica,\nrespectively. In the second case, the second level claim asserts that\nthe first-level concept being an author of Principia\nMathematica falls under the second-level concept being a\nconcept under which two objects fall. This sounds circular, since\nit looks like we have analyzed \n\nwhich involves the concept two, as: \n\nwhich also involves the concept two. But despite\nappearances, there is no circularity, since Frege analyzes the\nsecond-order concept being a concept under which two objects\nfall without appealing to the concept two. He did this by\ndefining ‘\\(F\\) is a concept under which two objects\nfall’, in purely logical terms, as any concept \\(F\\) that\nsatisfies the following condition: \n\nIn the notation of the modern predicate calculus, this is formalized\nas: \n\nNote that the concept being an author of Principia\nMathematica satisfies this condition, since there are distinct\nobjects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), namely, Bertrand Russell and Alfred\nNorth Whitehead, who authored Principia Mathematica and who\nare such that anything else authoring Principia Mathematica is\nidentical to one of them. In this way, Frege analyzed a statement of\nnumber (‘there are two authors of Principia\nMathematica’) as higher-order logical statements about\nconcepts. \n\nFrege then took his analysis one step further. He noticed that each\nof the conditions in the following sequence of conditions defined a\nclass of ‘equinumerous’ concepts, where\n‘F’ in each case is a variable ranging over\nconcepts: \n\nNotice that if concepts \\(P\\)  and \\(Q\\) are both concepts\nwhich satisfy one of these conditions, then there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the objects which fall under \\(P\\) and the\nobjects which fall under \\(Q\\). That is, if any of the above\nconditions accurately describes both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), then\nevery object falling under \\(P\\) can be paired with a unique and\ndistinct object falling under \\(Q\\) and, under this pairing, every\nobject falling under \\(Q\\) gets paired with some unique and\ndistinct object falling under \\(P\\). (By the logician’s\nunderstanding of the phrase ‘every’, this last claim even\napplies to those concepts \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) which satisfy\nCondition (0).) Frege would call such \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nequinumerous concepts (1884, §72). Indeed, for each\ncondition defined above, the concepts that satisfy the condition are\nall pairwise equinumerous to one another. \n\nWith this notion of equinumerosity, Frege defined ‘the number of\nthe concept \\(F\\)’ to be the extension consisting of all\nthe concepts that are equinumerous with \\(F\\) (1884, §68).\nTo get started, Frege then defined Zero to be the number of the\nconcept being non-self-identical (1884, §74).  If we use\nthe notation \\(\\#F\\) to represent the number of the concept F,\nand use the \\(\\lambda\\)-notation \\([\\lambda x \\: \\phi]\\) to name the\ncomplex concept being an object x such that \\(\\phi\\), Frege’s\ndefinition of Zero becomes: \nThus, the number 0 becomes defined as the extension of all the\nconcepts equinumerous to the concept not being\nself-identical.  This extension contains all the concepts that\nsatisfy Condition (0) above, and so the number of all such concepts is\n0. For example, the number of the concept being a square\ncircle is \\(0\\), since nothing falls under it. Similarly, one\ncould define the number \\(1\\) as the extension consisting of all the\nconcepts that satisfy Condition (1) above, and define the number \\(2\\)\nas the extension of all the concepts that satisfy Condition (2) above,\nand so on.  But though this would define a sequence of entities which\nare numbers, this procedure doesn’t actually define the\nconcept natural number (finite number).  Frege,\nhowever, had a deep idea about how to do this. \n\nIn order to define the concept of natural number, Frege first\ndefined, for every \\(2\\)-place relation \\(R\\), the general concept\n‘\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the \\(R\\)-series’. This\nnew relation is called ‘the ancestral of the relation\n\\(R\\)’. The ancestral of the relation \\(R\\) was first defined in\nFrege’s Begriffsschrift (1879, §26, Proposition\n76; 1884, §79). The intuitive idea is easily grasped if we\nconsider the relation \\(x\\) is the father of \\(y\\). Suppose that \\(a\\)\nis the father of \\(b\\), that \\(b\\) is the father of \\(c\\), and that\n\\(c\\) is the father of \\(d\\). Then Frege’s definition of\n‘\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the fatherhood-series’\nensures that \\(a\\) is an ancestor of \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) in this\nseries, that \\(b\\) is an ancestor of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in this series,\nand that \\(c\\) is an ancestor of \\(d\\) in this series. \n\nMore generally, if given a series of facts of the form \\(aRb\\),\n\\(bRc\\), \\(cRd\\), and so on, Frege showed how to define the relation\n\\(R^*\\), i.e., x is an ancestor of y in the R-series, which\nFrege referred to as: \\(y\\) follows \\(x\\) in the \\(R\\)-series. To\nexploit this definition in the case of natural numbers, Frege had to\ndefine both the relation \\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) and the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) is an ancestor of\n\\(y\\) in the predecessor-series. He first defined the\nrelational concept \\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) as follows (1884,\n§76): \n\nIf we again use the notation \\(\\#F\\) to denote the number of \\(F\\)s\nand the \\(\\lambda\\)-notation \\([\\lambda u \\: \\phi]\\) to name the\ncomplex concept being an object \\(u\\) such that\n\\(\\phi\\), Frege’s definition becomes: \n\nTo see the intuitive idea behind this definition, consider how the\ndefinition is satisfied in the case of the number 1 preceding the\nnumber \\(2\\): there is a concept \\(F\\) (e.g., let \\(F\\) =\nbeing an author of Principia Mathematica) and an object \\(z\\)\n(e.g., let \\(z\\) = Alfred North Whitehead) such that: \n\nNote that the last conjunct is true because there is exactly 1\nobject (namely, Bertrand Russell) that falls under the concept\nauthor of Principia Mathematica other than Whitehead. \n\nThus, Frege has a definition of precedes which applies to the\nordered pairs \\(\\langle 0,1\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle \\),\n\\(\\langle 2,3\\rangle\\), … . Frege then defined the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) is an ancestor of\n\\(y\\) in the predecessor-series, or\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\). Though the exact definition will not be given\nhere, we note that it has the following consequence: from the facts\nthat \\(10\\) precedes \\(11\\) and \\(11\\) precedes \\(12\\), it follows\nthat \\(10\\) precedes\\(^*\\) \\(12\\) in the\npredecessor-series. Note, however, that although\n\\(10\\) precedes\\(^*\\) \\(12\\), \\(10\\) does not\nprecede \\(12\\), for the notion of precedes is that\nof immediately precedes. Note also that by defining the\nancestral of the precedence relation, Frege had in effect defined\n\\(x\\) < \\(y\\) relative to the predecessor-series. \n\nRecall that Frege defined the number \\(0\\) as the number of the concept\nbeing non-self-identical, and that \\(0\\) thereby becomes\nidentified with the extension of all concepts which fail to be\nexemplified. Using this definition, Frege then defined (1884,\n§83) natural number as follows: which we might represent formally as: \n\nIn other words, a natural number is any member of the\npredecessor-series beginning with 0. \n\nUsing this definition as a basis, Frege later derived many important\ntheorems of number theory. Philosophers appreciated the importance of\nthis work only relatively recently (C. Parsons 1965, Smiley 1981,\nWright 1983, and Boolos 1987, 1990, 1995). Wright 1983 in particular\nshowed how the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number might be derived from\none of the consistent principles that Frege discussed in 1884, now\nknown as Hume’s Principle (“The number of \\(F\\)s is equal\nto the number of \\(G\\)s if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the \\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s”). It was\nrecently shown by R. Heck [1993] that, despite the logical\ninconsistency in the system of Frege 1893/1903, Frege himself validly\nderived the Dedekind/Peano axioms from Hume’s\nPrinciple. Although Frege used Basic Law V (which yields an\ninconsistency when added to his second-order logic) to establish\nHume’s Principle, once Hume’s Principle was established,\nthe subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms make no\nfurther essential appeals to Basic Law V.  Following the lead of\nGeorge Boolos, philosophers today call the derivation of the\nDedekind/Peano Axioms from Hume’s Principle ‘Frege’s\nTheorem’. For a comprehensive introduction to the subtle and\ncomplex logical reasoning involved in this theorem, see the entry\n Frege’s theorem and foundations for arithmetic. \n\nBefore receiving the famous letter from Bertrand Russell informing him\nof the inconsistency in his system, Frege thought that he had shown\nthat arithmetic is reducible to the truths of logic. It is recognized\ntoday, however, that at best Frege showed that arithmetic is reducible\nto second-order logic extended only by Hume’s Principle. Some\nphilosophers think Hume’s Principle is analytically true (i.e., true\nin virtue of the very meanings of its words), while others resist the\nclaim, and there is an interesting debate on this issue in the\nliterature (see, e.g., Boolos 1997, Wright 1999). However, for the purposes of this introduction to Frege’s work,\nthere are prior questions on which it is more important to\nfocus. Whereas Frege thought that the truths of arithmetic are\nderivable from analytic truths of logic, Kant thought arithmetic\nprinciples are synthetic, in which case they wouldn’t be derivable\nfrom analytic truths.  Their different conceptions of logic helps to\nexplain why these two philosophers came to such different conclusions.\nIn this section, we therefore turn to the following questions: \nAn answer to the first question sets the stage for answering the\nsecond.  \nOne of the most important differences between Kant and Frege concerns\nthe resources available to logic. Kant’s logic is limited to (a)\nAristotelian term logic with a simple theory of disjunctive and\nhypothetical propositions, and (b) representing inclusion relations\namong concepts (MacFarlane 2002, 26). By contrast, Frege’s logic\nincludes (a) a term-forming operator\nε’,\nwhich allows one to form the singular term \n ε’ƒ(ε)\nfrom the function expression ƒ(ξ), and (b) a Rule of\nSubstitution, which allows one to substitute complex open formulas for\nfree second-order variables in theorems of logic but also allows one\nto define, and assert the existence of, complex concepts, including\nconcepts defined in terms of quantifiers over concepts.  We’ll\ndiscuss both of these resources below, but first, the discussion needs\nsome context. \nThe differences concerning the resources available to logic revolve\naround a key issue, namely, whether the additional resources Frege\nassigns to logic require an appeal to non-logical constructions,\nspecifically to a faculty of ‘intuition’, that is, an\nextralogical source which presents our minds with phenomena about\nwhich judgments can be formed.  (Recall the discussion above about\nFrege’s early interest in appeals to intuition.)  The debate\nover which resources do and do not require an appeal to intuition is\nan important one. Frege continued a trend started by Bolzano (1817),\nwho eliminated the appeal to intuition in the proof of the\nIntermediate Value Theorem in the calculus (which in its simplest form\nasserts that a continuous function having both positive and negative\nvalues must cross the origin). Bolzano proved this theorem from the\ndefinition of continuity, which had recently been given in terms\nsimilar to the definition of a limit (see Coffa 1991, 27). A Kantian\nmight simply draw a graph of a continuous function which takes values\nabove and below the origin, and thereby ‘demonstrate’ that\nsuch a function must cross the origin.  But appeal to a graph involves\nan appeal to intuition, and both Bolzano and Frege saw such appeals to\nintuition as potentially introducing logical gaps into a proof. There\nare reasons to be suspicious about such appeals: (1) there are\nfunctions which we can’t graph or otherwise construct for\npresentation to our intuitive faculty, e.g., the function \\(f\\) which\nmaps rational numbers to \\(0\\) and irrational numbers to \\(1\\), or the\nfunctions noted by Weierstrass, which are everywhere continuous but\nnowhere differentiable; (2) once we take certain intuitive notions and\nformalize them in terms of explicit definitions, the formal definition\nmight imply counterintuitive results; and (3) the rules of inference\nfrom statements to constructions and back are not always clear. \nFrege dedicated himself to the idea of eliminating appeals to\nintuition in the proofs of the basic propositions of arithmetic.  He\nexplicitly remarked upon this fact in a number of works throughout his\ncareer (1879, Preface/5, Part III/§23; 1884, §§62, 87;\n1893, §0; and 1903, Appendix). Thus, he would deny Kant’s\ndictum (A51 [B75]), ‘Without sensibility, no object would be\ngiven to us’, and claim instead that \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) are objects\nbut that they ‘can’t be given to us in sensation’\n(1884, 101). Frege’s view is that we can understand or grasp\nthem as objects if we (a) define them as extensions of concepts, and\n(b) show that singular terms of the form\n ε’ƒ(ε))\ncan be axiomatized by an analytic proposition. (The latter was to be\naccomplished by Basic Law V, and so the collapse of this law in light\nof Russell’s paradox undermined this part of his plan for\navoiding appeals to intuition.) \nMoreover, philosophers have questioned whether Frege’s Rule of\nSubstitution (Grundgesetze I, 1893, §48, item 9) also\nrequired an appeal to intuition. The Rule of Substitution allows one\nto substitute complex formulas for free second-order variables in\nlogical theorems to produce new logical theorems. Boolos argued (1985,\n336–338) that since Frege’s Rule of Substitution is\nequivalent to a Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it is\nextralogical in character. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts \\(\\exists F \\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\phi)\\), provided \\(\\phi\\)\ndoesn’t have a free variable \\(F\\); the proviso blocks the\ninstance \\(\\exists F\\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\neg Fx)\\), from which one can\nquickly derive a contradiction. Thus, the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts asserts the existence of a concept corresponding to every\nexpressible condition on objects. From Kant’s point of view,\nsuch existence claims were thought to be synthetic and in need of\njustification by the faculty of intuition. So, although it was one of\nFrege’s goals to avoid appeals to the faculty of intuition,\nthere is a question as to whether his system of second-order logic\n(minus Basic Law V), which implies a principle asserting the existence\nof a wide range of concepts, really is limited in its scope to purely\nlogical laws of an analytic nature. \nIf we now put aside their differences about logic’s resources\nand the appeal to intuition, there are other ways in which the Kantian\nand Fregean conceptions of logic differ.  Both MacFarlane (2002) and\nLinnebo (2003) point out that one of Kant’s central views about\nlogic is that its axioms and theorems are purely formal in nature\n(i.e., abstracted from all semantic content and concerned only with\nthe forms of judgments) and are applicable across all the\nphysical and mathematical sciences (1781 [1787], A55 [B79], A56 [B80],\nA70 [B95]; and 1800, 15).  And Kant takes the laws of logic to be\nnormative and prescriptive (something one can get wrong), and not just\ndescriptive (1800, 16); they provide constitutive norms of\nthought (MacFarlane 2002, 35; Tolley 2008).  Indeed, Linnebo takes two\ntheses, that logic is formal and provides laws that are constitutive\nnorms of thought, to be distinctive of Kant’s conception\n(Linnebo 2003, 240). \nBy contrast, Frege rejects the idea that logic is a purely formal\nenterprise (MacFarlane 2002, 29; Linnebo 2003, 243). He took logic to\nhave its own unique subject matter, which included not only facts\nabout concepts (concerning negation, subsumption, etc.) and identity,\nbut also facts about relations (e.g., their properties and\nancestrals). Frege (1906, 428 [1984, 338]) says: \nAnd, of course, as we’ve seen, Frege supposed that there is a domain\nof special logical objects (courses of values), among which\nhe defined, and – until confronted by Russell’s paradox –\ntook himself to have proved facts about, extensions\nand natural numbers (1884, 1893/1903).  Logic, then, is not\npurely formal, from Frege’s point of view, but rather can provide\nsubstantive knowledge of concepts and objects. \nThere is some question, however, as to the extent to which Frege took\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought.  Linnebo suggests that\nFrege eventually rejected this idea. Though he offers various\narguments for thinking that Frege moved away from the constitutivity\nthesis, his [Linnebo’s] main argument concerns the fact that Frege\nwanted to position Basic Law V as a logical claim, but that Basic Law\nV doesn’t seem to be a constitutive norm of thought (Linnebo 2003,\n247).  This is a persuasive reason, though it does make one wonder\nwhat Frege could have meant, in the second volume\nof Grundgesetze (§147), when he said, concerning Basic\nLaw V: \nGiven Frege’s commitment to logical objects as part of the\ncontent of logic, the above passage suggests that he might have\nregarded the law which transformed an equality holding generally into\nan equation as a constitutive norm of thought. \nBut many Frege scholars are convinced that Frege took the laws of\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought (MacFarlane 2002,\nTaschek 2008, Steinberger 2017).  MacFarlane, in particular, argues\nthat Kant and Frege may have agreed that one of the most important\ncharacteristics of logic is its generality, and that this generality\nconsists in the fact that it provides normative rules and\nprescriptions. He notes that “[t]he generality of logic, for\nFrege as for Kant, is a normative generality: logic is\ngeneral in the sense that it provides constitutive norms for\nthought as such, regardless of its subject matter”\n(2002, 35). So, though they may differ as to which principles are\nlogical, there may be at least one point of reconciliation concerning\nhow Kant and Frege conceived of logic.  \nGiven the constraints of the present entry, we shall not attempt to\ndiscuss this question in any detail; instead, we present only the\nbarest of outlines. After all, modern logicians and philosophers of\nlogic have not yet come to agreement about the proper conception of\nlogic.  Many have a conception of logic that is yet different from\nboth Kant’s and Frege’s, one that was, to some extent,\nanticipated by Bolzano, namely, that logical concepts and laws remain\ninvariant under reinterpretation of the non-logical constants or under\npermutations of the domain of quantification. But since this modern\nconception is still a matter of debate, it may be that elements of\nFrege’s conception will yet play a role in our understanding of\nwhat logic is. It is important to recognize just how much Frege took himself to be\nfocusing on the content, as opposed to the form, of\nthoughts. His concern to more precisely represent the content of\nthoughts is stated explicitly in an 1882 lecture before Jena’s\nSociety for Medicine and Natural Science, where he distinguished his\n1879 system from Boole’s logic by saying: \nSo Frege was not just trying to develop an abstract reasoning system\nfor the precise derivations of theorems from axioms (see van\nHeijenoort 1967 for discussion).  Frege was at least as interested in\nformalizing the content of reasoning as he was in formulating\nthe rules for deriving a given thought from some group of\nthoughts. Frege would not have regarded the logical axioms of\nhis formal systems as axiom schemata, i.e., as a\nmetalinguistic sentence patterns whose instances (i.e., the sentences\nof the object language that match the pattern) are axioms (see\nGoldfarb 2001 for discussion). Nor would he have agreed that the\nlogical axioms of his system were uninterpreted sentences. His unease\nwith the modern conception of an uninterpreted formal system was\nexpressed in his reaction to Hilbert’s Foundations of\nGeometry (Frege 1906, 384 [1984, 315]): \nInstead, Frege thought that his logical axioms are (a) fundamental\ntruths governing negation, conditionalization, quantification,\nidentity, and description, and (b) principles from which other such\nfundamental truths could be derived. Indeed, even though Frege\nsometimes introduces methods for abbreviating these truths, he takes\ngreat pains to insist that these abbreviations are to be understood in\nterms of the full content being expressed.  For example, he summarizes\nthe law of universal instantiation (Basic Law IIa) in 1893/§47\nusing a formula that we would write nowadays as: \nBut closer inspection of §20, where this principle is first\ndiscussed, and of §17, where he introduces some notational\nconventions used in §20, makes it clear that the above is\nshorthand for: \nThis latter is a sentence; it is not a schema, nor an open formula\nwith a free variable, nor an uninterpreted sentence.  Rather it\nasserts something that Frege takes to be fundamental law, namely: for\nany property \\(F\\) and for any object \\(y\\), if everything\nfalls under \\(F\\), then \\(y\\) falls under \\(F\\). \nFrege’s understanding of, and attitude towards, the formulas of\nhis formal language goes a long way towards explaining why his\nposition, in the now famous debate with Hilbert about the status of\nthe axioms in a formal system, is not an unreasonable one. At first\nglance, it looks as if Frege has mistakenly challenged Hilbert’s\nmethod of relative interpretability, whereby one can prove the\nconsistency and independence of axiom systems by re-intepreting, and\nthereby reducing, them to systems assumed to be\nconsistent. Frege’s objections about what exactly has been\nestablished by these relative consistency proofs may seem misguided to\na modern ear.  But since Frege and Hilbert understood the notions\nof consistency and independence differently, they\ndidn’t always directly engage with the other’s ideas.\nBlanchette nicely shows, both in the entry on the\n  Frege-Hilbert controversy and in her\nbook (2012, Ch. 5), that if the notions of consistency and\nindependence are understood Hilbert’s way, then Hilbert’s\nmethods do establish what he says they do, but that if these notions\nare understood Frege’s way, they don’t. The reader should pursue\nthese works for a more detailed explanation and nuanced discussion of\nthe disagreement. \nOne can appreciate how Frege and Hilbert might have failed to engage\nwith one another by considering a simple analogy.  Consider the\ninference from “\\(x\\) had a nightmare” to “\\(x\\) had\na dream” and ask the question, is the latter a logical\nconsequence of the former? If one examines the inference purely\nformally, as Hilbert might, then the sentences have the form\n‘\\(Fx\\)’ and ‘\\(Gx\\)’ and the question\nbecomes, does \\(Fx\\) logically imply \\(Gx\\)?  The answer for Hilbert\nwould be ‘No’, because one can interpret\n‘\\(F\\)’ and ‘\\(G\\)’ in such a way that the\ninference fails, e.g., just assign the standard meaning of\n‘dream’ to ‘\\(F\\)’ and assign the standard\nmeaning of ‘nightmare’ to ‘\\(G\\)’, i.e.,\ninterpret ‘\\(F\\)’ as the property having a dream\nand interpret ‘\\(G\\)’ as the property having a\nnightmare. This shows that, from this purely formal point of\nview, “\\(x\\) had a nightmare” doesn’t logically\nimply “\\(x\\) had a dream”. (From this purely formal\nviewpoint, one additionally needs the premise \\(\\forall y(Fy \\to Gy)\\)\nto infer \\(Gx\\) from \\(Fx\\).) \nAlthough Frege had a formal system in which the open sentence \\(Fx\\)\ndoesn’t logically imply \\(Gx\\), he takes logical consequence to\nbe a relation among thoughts. He wouldn’t answer the\nquestion, of whether one thought is a logical consequence of another,\nsolely by looking at the form of the sentences that express them, but\nrather by looking at the content of those sentences. Given the meaning\n(content) that ‘nightmare’ and ‘dream’ in fact\nhave, “\\(x\\) had a dream” is a logical consequence of\n“\\(x\\) had a nightmare”, for having a nightmare,\ni.e., having a bad dream, logically implies having a\ndream. So, for Frege, this would clearly be a case of logical\nconsequence. \nThis analogy might help one to see how Frege and Hilbert might differ\nin their approach to questions of consistency and interpretation.  On\nFrege’s view, the consistency of a group of axioms depends on\ncontent, and if the form of these axioms, under logical analysis,\nsufficiently captures their content, this consistency will be\ninherited by their formal representations as well.  Of course, in\nproving consistency, Hilbert was concerned primarily to determine\nwhether an axiom system entailed a contradiction having the form\n\\(\\phi \\amp \\neg \\phi\\).  So, given this formal goal,\nHilbert’s methods are useful and immune to criticism. \nBut this brings us to one final issue that is crucial to Frege’s\nconception of logic, namely, the extent to which his formal\nrepresentations capture the content of the claims being\nanalyzed. This issue is relevant because Frege’s primary tool for\nanalyzing the content of a mathematical or philosophical claim is by\nway of representing the content in a system that axiomatizes\nthe fundamental concepts that are needed for the analysis.  This issue\nis the subject of the first half of Blanchette 2012. To see what is at\nstake, we vary the example from the one used in Blanchette 2012\n(24). Frege would represent the arithmetical law: in the first instance, as: Then if we substitute Frege’s definitions of\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\), \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\), and \\(0\\), as\ndescribed in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 above, his representation of the\narithmetical law becomes: \nThough the formal representation could be taken further, if we expand\nthe definitions of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\), \\(\\#F\\), and \\(\\#[\\lambda\nu \\: Fu \\amp u \\!\\neq\\! z]\\), enough has been said to pose the\nquestion: why think that by deriving the formal representation from\nmore fundamental principles, Frege has derived the arithmetic law that\nno natural number precedes Zero?  This question is tackled in some\ndetail in in the early part of Blanchette 2012, which investigates\nFrege’s understanding of conceptual analysis. Her answer\n(Chapter 4) is that the formal representation of the arithmetic law\nhas to be (self-evidently) logically equivalent to a good analysis of\nthe original. If it is, then notwithstanding Frege’s failed\nreduction of numbers to extensions, a derivation of the formal\nrepresentation from more general logical laws of the kind represented\nin his system would have in fact achieved the goal of reducing\narithmetic to logic. The reader is directed to her work for discussion\nof this important point. \n\nWhile pursuing his investigations into mathematics and logic (and\nquite possibly, in order to ground those investigations), Frege was\nled to develop a philosophy of language. His philosophy of language\nhas had just as much, if not more, impact than his contributions to\nlogic and mathematics. Frege’s seminal paper in this field\n‘Über Sinn und Bedeutung’ (‘On Sense and\nReference’, 1892a) is now a classic. In this paper, Frege\nconsidered two puzzles about language and noticed, in each case, that\none cannot account for the meaningfulness or logical behavior of\ncertain sentences simply on the basis of the denotations of the terms\n(names and descriptions) in the sentence. One puzzle concerned\nidentity statements and the other concerned sentences with subordinate\nclauses such as propositional attitude reports. To solve these\npuzzles, Frege suggested that the terms of a language have both a\nsense and a denotation, i.e., that at least two semantic relations are\nrequired to explain the significance or meaning of the terms of a\nlanguage. This idea has inspired research in the field for over a\ncentury and we discuss it in what follows.  (See Heck and May 2006 for\nfurther discussion of Frege’s contribution to the philosophy of\nlanguage.) \n\nHere are some examples of identity statements: \n\nFrege believed that these statements all have the form\n‘\\(a=b\\)’, where ‘\\(a\\)’ and\n‘\\(b\\)’ are either names or descriptions that\ndenote individuals. He naturally assumed that a sentence of\nthe form ‘\\(a=b\\)’ is true if and only if the object \\(a\\)\njust is (identical to) the object \\(b\\). For example, the sentence\n‘\\(117+136 = 253\\)’ is true if and only if the number \\(117+136\\)\njust is the number \\(253\\). And the statement ‘Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens’ is true if and only if the person Mark Twain just is\nthe person Samuel Clemens. \n\nBut Frege noticed (1892a) that this account of truth can’t be\nall there is to the meaning of identity statements. The statement\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ has a cognitive significance (or meaning) that\nmust be different from the cognitive significance of\n‘\\(a=b\\)’. We can learn that ‘Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain’ is true simply by inspecting it; but we can’t learn\nthe truth of ‘Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens’ simply by\ninspecting it — you have to examine the world to see whether the\ntwo persons are the same. Similarly, whereas you can learn that\n‘\\(117+136 = 117+136\\)’ and ‘the morning star is\nidentical to the morning star’ are true simply by inspection,\nyou can’t learn the truth of ‘\\(117+136 = 253\\)’ and\n‘the morning star is identical to the evening star’ simply\nby inspection. In the latter cases, you have to do some arithmetical\nwork or astronomical investigation to learn the truth of these\nidentity claims. Now the problem becomes clear: the meaning of\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ clearly differs from the meaning of\n‘\\(a=b\\)’, but given the account of the truth described in\nthe previous paragraph, these two identity statements appear to have\nthe same meaning whenever they are true! For example, ‘Mark\nTwain = Mark Twain’ is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Mark Twain. And ‘Mark Twain = Samuel\nClemens’ is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Samuel Clemens. But given that Mark Twain\njust is Samuel Clemens, these two cases are the same case, and that\ndoesn’t explain the difference in meaning between the two\nidentity sentences. And something similar applies to all the other\nexamples of identity statements having the forms\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ and ‘\\(a=b\\)’. \n\nSo the puzzle Frege discovered is: how do we account for the\ndifference in cognitive significance between ‘\\(a=b\\)’ and\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ when they are true? \n\nFrege is generally credited with identifying the following puzzle\nabout propositional attitude reports, even though he didn’t quite\ndescribe the puzzle in the terms used below. A propositional attitude\nis a psychological relation between a person and a proposition. Belief,\ndesire, intention, discovery, knowledge, etc., are all psychological\nrelationships between persons, on the one hand, and propositions, on\nthe other. When we report the propositional attitudes of others, these\nreports all have a similar logical form: \n\nIf we replace the variable ‘\\(x\\)’ by the name of a person\nand replace the variable ‘\\(p\\)’ with a sentence that\ndescribes the propositional object of their attitude, we get specific\nattitude reports. So by replacing ‘\\(x\\)’ by\n‘John’ and ‘\\(p\\)’ by ‘Mark Twain\nwrote Huckleberry Finn’ in the first example, the\nresult would be the following specific belief report: \n\nTo see the problem posed by the analysis of propositional attitude\nreports, consider what appears to be a simple principle of reasoning,\nnamely, the Principle of Identity Substitution (this is not to be\nconfused with the Rule of Substitution discussed earlier). If a name,\nsay \\(n\\), appears in a true sentence \\(S\\), and the identity sentence\n\\(n=m\\) is true, then the Principle of Identity Substitution tells us\nthat the substitution of the name \\(m\\) for the name \\(n\\) in \\(S\\)\ndoes not affect the truth of \\(S\\). For example, let \\(S\\) be the true\nsentence ‘Mark Twain was an author’, let\n\\(n\\) be the name ‘Mark Twain’, and let \\(m\\) be\nthe name ‘Samuel Clemens’. Then since the identity\nsentence ‘Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens’ is true, we can\nsubstitute ‘Samuel Clemens’ for ‘Mark Twain’\nwithout affecting the truth of the sentence. And indeed, the resulting\nsentence ‘Samuel Clemens was an author’ is true. In other\nwords, the following argument is valid: \n\nSimilarly, the following argument is valid. \n\nIn general, then, the Principle of Identity Substitution seems to take\nthe following form, where \\(S\\) is a sentence, \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are\nnames, and \\(S(n)\\) differs from \\(S(m)\\) only by the fact\nthat at least one occurrence of \\(m\\) replaces \\(n\\): \n\nThis principle seems to capture the idea that if we say something\ntrue about an object, then even if we change the name by which we refer\nto that object, we should still be saying something true about that\nobject. \n\nBut Frege, in effect, noticed the following counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Identity Substitution. Consider the following\nargument: \n\nThis argument is not valid. There are circumstances in which the\npremises are true and the conclusion false. We have already described\nsuch circumstances, namely, one in which John learns the name\n‘Mark Twain’ by reading Huckleberry Finn but\nlearns the name ‘Samuel Clemens’ in the context of learning\nabout 19th century American authors (without learning that the name\n‘Mark Twain’ was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens). John may\nnot believe that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry\nFinn. The premises of the above argument, therefore, do not\nlogically entail the conclusion. So the Principle of Identity\nSubstitution appears to break down in the context of propositional\nattitude reports.  The puzzle, then, is to say what causes the\nprinciple to fail in these contexts. Why aren’t we still saying\nsomething true about the man in question if all we have done is\nchanged the name by which we refer to him? \n\nTo explain these puzzles, Frege suggested (1892a) that in addition to\nhaving a denotation, names and descriptions also express a\n sense.[5] \n The sense of an expression accounts for its\ncognitive significance—it is the way by which one conceives of\nthe denotation of the term. The expressions ‘\\(4\\)’ and\n‘\\(8/2\\)’ have the same denotation but express\ndifferent senses, different ways of conceiving the same number. The\ndescriptions ‘the morning star’ and ‘the evening\nstar’ denote the same planet, namely Venus, but express\ndifferent ways of conceiving of Venus and so have different\nsenses. The name ‘Pegasus’ and the description ‘the\nmost powerful Greek god’ both have a sense (and their senses are\ndistinct), but neither has a denotation. However, even though the\nnames ‘Mark Twain’ and ‘Samuel Clemens’ denote\nthe same individual, they express different senses. (See May 2006b for\na nice discussion of the question of whether Frege believed that the\nsense of a name varies from person to person.) Using the distinction\nbetween sense and denotation, Frege can account for the difference in\ncognitive significance between identity statements of the form\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ and those of the form\n‘\\(a=b\\)’. Since the sense of ‘\\(a\\)’ differs\nfrom the sense of ‘\\(b\\)’, the components of the sense of\n‘\\(a=a\\)’ and the sense of ‘\\(a=b\\)’ are\ndifferent.  Frege can claim that the sense of the whole expression is\ndifferent in the two cases. Since the sense of an expression accounts\nfor its cognitive significance, Frege has an explanation of the\ndifference in cognitive significance between ‘\\(a=a\\)’ and\n‘\\(a=b\\)’, and thus a solution to the first puzzle. \n\nMoreover, Frege proposed that when a term (name or description)\nfollows a propositional attitude verb, it no longer denotes what it\nordinarily denotes. Instead, Frege claims that in such contexts, a\nterm denotes its ordinary sense. This explains why the Principle of\nIdentity Substitution fails for terms following the propositional\nattitude verbs in propositional attitude reports. The Principle\nasserts that truth is preserved when we substitute one name for\nanother having the same denotation. But, according to Frege’s\ntheory, the names ‘Mark Twain’ and ‘Samuel\nClemens’ denote different senses when they occur in the\nfollowing sentences: \n\nIf they don’t denote the same object, then there is no reason to\nthink that substitution of one name for another would preserve\ntruth. \n\nFrege developed the theory of sense and denotation into a\nthoroughgoing philosophy of language. This philosophy can be\nexplained, at least in outline, by considering a simple sentence such\nas ‘John loves Mary’. In Frege’s view, the words\n‘John’ and ‘Mary’ in this sentence are names,\nthe expression ‘loves’ signifies a function, and,\nmoreover, the sentence as a whole is a complex name. Each of these\nexpressions has both a sense and a denotation. The sense and\ndenotation of the names are basic; but sense and denotation of the\nsentence as a whole can be described in terms of the sense and\ndenotation of the names and the way in which those words are arranged\nin the sentence alongside the expression ‘loves’. Let us\nrefer to the denotation and sense of the words as follows: \n\nWe now work toward a theoretical description of the denotation of the\nsentence as a whole. On Frege’s view, \\(d[j]\\) and\n\\(d[m]\\) are the real individuals John and Mary,\nrespectively. \\(d[L]\\) is a function that maps\n\\(d[m]\\) (i.e., Mary) to the function ( )\nloves Mary. This latter function serves as the denotation of\nthe predicate ‘loves Mary’ and we can use the notation\n\\(d[Lm]\\) to refer to it semantically. Now the function \\(d[Lm]\\) maps\n\\(d[j]\\) (i.e., John) to the denotation of the sentence ‘John\nloves Mary’.  Let us refer to the denotation of the sentence as\n\\(d[jLm]\\). Frege identifies the denotation of a sentence as one of\nthe two truth values.  Because \\(d[Lm]\\) maps objects to truth values,\nit is a concept. Thus, \\(d[jLm]\\) is the truth value The True if John\nfalls under the concept \\(d[Lm]\\); otherwise it is the truth value The\nFalse. So, on Frege’s view, the sentence ‘John loves\nMary’ names a truth \nvalue.[6] \n\nThe sentence ‘John loves Mary’ also expresses a sense.\nIts sense may be described as follows. Although Frege doesn’t\nappear to have explicitly said so, his work suggests that \\(s[L]\\)\n(the sense of the expression ‘loves’) is a function. This\nfunction would map \\(s[m]\\) (the sense of the name ‘Mary’)\nto the sense of the predicate ‘loves Mary’. Let us refer\nto the sense of ‘loves Mary’ as \\(s[Lm]\\). Now again,\nFrege’s work seems to imply that we should regard \\(s[Lm]\\) as a\nfunction which maps \\(s[j]\\) (the sense of the name\n‘John’) to the sense of the whole sentence. Let us call\nthe sense of the entire sentence\n \\(s[jLm]\\).[7]\n Frege calls the sense of a sentence a\nthought, and whereas there are only two truth values, he\nsupposes that there are an infinite number of thoughts. \n\nWith this description of language, Frege can give a general account of\nthe difference in the cognitive significance between identity\nstatements of the form ‘\\(a=a\\)’ and\n‘\\(a=b\\)’. The cognitive significance is not accounted for\nat the level of denotation. On Frege’s view, the sentences\n‘\\(4=8/2\\)’ and ‘\\(4=4\\)’ both denote\nthe same truth value. The function \\((\\:)=(\\:)\\) maps \\(4\\) and\n\\(8/2\\) to The True, i.e., maps \\(4\\) and \\(4\\) to The\nTrue. So \\(d[4=8/2]\\) is identical to \\(d[4=4]\\); they are\nboth The True. However, the two sentences in question express\ndifferent thoughts. That is because \\(s[4]\\) is different from\n\\(s[8/2]\\). So the thought \\(s[4=8/2]\\) is distinct\nfrom the thought \\(s[4=4]\\). Similarly, ‘Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain’ and ‘Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens’ denote the\nsame truth value. However, given that \\(s\\)[Mark Twain] is distinct\nfrom \\(s\\)[Samuel Clemens], Frege would claim that the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Mark Twain] is distinct from the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens]. \n\nFurthermore, recall that Frege proposed that terms following\npropositional attitude verbs denote not their ordinary denotations but\nrather the senses they ordinarily express. In fact, in the following\npropositional attitude report, not only do the words ‘Mark\nTwain’, ‘wrote’ and ‘Huckleberry Finn\n’ denote their ordinary senses, but the entire sentence\n‘Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn’ also denotes\nits ordinary sense (namely, a thought): \n\nFrege, therefore, would analyze this attitude report as follows:\n‘believes that’ denotes a function that maps the denotation\nof the sentence ‘Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn’ to a concept. In this case, however, the denotation of\nthe sentence ‘Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn’\nis not a truth value but rather a thought. The thought it denotes is\ndifferent from the thought denoted by ‘Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn’ in the following propositional\nattitude report: \n\nSince the thought denoted by ‘Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn’ in this context differs from the\nthought denoted by ‘Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn’ in the same context, the concept denoted by\n‘believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn’\nis a different concept from the one denoted by ‘believes that\nSamuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn’. One may\nconsistently suppose that the concept denoted by the former predicate\nmaps John to The True whereas the concept denoted by the latter\npredicate does not. Frege’s analysis therefore preserves our\nintuition that John can believe that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn without believing that Samuel Clemens did. It also preserves\nthe Principle of Identity Substitution—the fact that one cannot\nsubstitute ‘Samuel Clemens’ for ‘Mark Twain’\nwhen these names occur after propositional attitude verbs does not\nconstitute evidence against the Principle. For if Frege is right,\nnames do not have their usual denotation when they occur in these\ncontexts.","contact.mail":"zalta@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
