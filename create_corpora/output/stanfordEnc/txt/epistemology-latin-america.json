The touchstone for inclusion\nwas not whether they were born in Latin America—although all but\none of those who will be mentioned were born there—but whether\nthey are of Latin American origin, earned a degree from a Latin\nAmerican university, and worked for at least some time in Latin\nAmerica, thus receiving (part of) their philosophical education in\nsuch a milieu. For this reason, there will be no mention of, e.g.,\nErnest Sosa’s and Linda Martín Alcoff’s extensive\nand influential work in\n epistemology.[1]\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThere is a growing interest in epistemological topics and problems\namong members of what may be called, somewhat artificially, “the\nLatin American philosophical community”. However, it should be\nnoted from the start that, despite the large size of that community\nand its connections with philosophers and research groups particularly\nfrom the United States and the United Kingdom, on the whole\nepistemological investigation in Latin America significantly differs\nin approach, breadth, and originality from mainstream Anglophone\nepistemology—which at present can reasonably be taken as\nemblematic owing to its depth, precision, innovation, and\nfecundity. \nWithin Latin America, epistemology has traditionally been approached\nfrom a historico-exegetical rather than systematic perspective. Even\ntoday, it is not uncommon for an epistemology course in the philosophy\ndepartment of a Latin American university to focus (almost)\nexclusively on the views on the nature and possibility of knowledge\nfound in the works of Descartes, Hume, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger,\nMerleau-Ponty, or Ricoeur rather than on the main epistemological\npositions adopted in contemporary analytic philosophy. The reason is,\nat least in part, that most professors in charge of courses on the\ntheory of knowledge have traditionally been historians of modern\nphilosophy or phenomenologists influenced by the way philosophy has\ncustomarily been practiced in France, Germany, and Spain, thus\nfollowing the tradition of so-called continental philosophy. In the\nLatin American academic milieu, philosophy in general has\npredominantly been approached either through the exegesis of\nphilosophical texts or through the history of philosophical ideas,\nboth with a markedly continental orientation. \nEven though the history of analytic philosophy in Latin America starts\nin the 1950s–1960s (see Pérez & Ortiz-Millán\n2010), one had to wait until the last two decades of the twentieth\ncentury for a strong and widespread trend of analytic philosophy to\nemerge. The seminal impetus for the production and dissemination in\nLatin America (particularly in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico) of new\nwork within the analytic tradition was the founding of research\ncenters taking a distinctly analytic approach and the subsequent\nlaunches of their respective journals: the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filosóficas (IIF, 1967), at the Universidad\nAutónoma de México (UNAM), with its journal\nCrítica (1967); the Sociedad Argentina de\nAnálisis Filosófico (SADAF, 1972) with its journal\nAnálisis Filosófico (1981); and the Centro de\nLógica, Epistemologia e História da Ciência (CLE,\n1976), at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil,\nwith its journal Manuscrito (1977). The founding in 2007 of\nthe Asociación Latinoamericana de Filosofía\nAnalítica (ALFA) reflects the sustained development of analytic\nphilosophy in Latin American countries. The recent unprecedented\nimpetus in what may be regarded as the analytic way of doing\nphilosophy explains why, since the turn of the millennium, the\nprimarily historico-exegetical and continental approach to\nepistemology has slowly started to be replaced by a systematic and\nanalytic one. \nAs for the breadth of Latin American studies in epistemology, a\nconsiderable number of the subjects discussed in present-day analytic\nepistemology have not received the slightest attention, others have\nbeen addressed only superficially, and still others have been tackled\nby but a few researchers. This situation is not limited to relatively\nnew areas such as the epistemology of testimony, the epistemology of\ndisagreement, or collective epistemology (all falling within so-called\nsocial epistemology), but is a more general phenomenon. This may be\ndue to the fact that, for some reason, in analytic-style Latin\nAmerican philosophy, epistemology has received less attention than\nlogic, philosophy of science, or philosophy of language. \nFinally, even though original positions and arguments with regard to\nspecific topics have been developed by Latin American scholars, it is\nsafe to say that there is not a distinctively Latin American\nepistemology. The epistemological issues and problems currently\nexamined in the work of those Latin American authors who adopt a\nsystematic approach either have been discussed throughout the history\nof philosophy or have been “imported” from Anglophone\nscholarship. Nor is there a particular way of doing epistemology that\ncould be identified as Latin American. For this reason, one may talk\nof “epistemology in Latin America” or “epistemology\ndone by Latin Americans” rather than of “Latin American\nepistemology”. \nA caveat is in order: the above is intended as a general\ndescription of the current situation in the Latin American\nphilosophical community. The academic collaboration between research\ngroups within and outside Latin America, the growing number of\nvisiting scholars from Latin American countries at philosophy\ndepartments of North America and Europe where the best epistemological\ninvestigation is carried out, and the increase of financial resources\nin some of those countries will, one can reasonably expect, change the\nsituation in the years to come by building on what has already been\ndone in the field and opening up further research and debate. Within\nthe next few decades, there will probably be a consolidated Latin\nAmerican community working on epistemological issues, and one will\nperhaps even be able to start talking of a distinctively Latin\nAmerican epistemology. \nIt is safe to say that skepticism is the main issue discussed by Latin\nAmerican scholars working in epistemology, judging by the number of\nworks devoted to it. In addition, in certain Latin American countries\nthere is a short but strong tradition of scholarship on both the\nhistory and the philosophical significance of skepticism. This is why\nit is the first topic to be addressed in this entry. \nAs Cresto (2010a: 468) points out, the study of the history of\nskepticism is one of the lines of research to be considered when\nproviding an overview of epistemological investigation in Latin\nAmerica. But contrary to what she claims, it is hard to find any\nsystematic epistemological discussion of skepticism in the numerous\nworks in which Latin American scholars have dealt with the history of\nancient or modern skepticism. Still, it is primarily in connection\nwith the study of ancient Pyrrhonism that the field has seen the\nemergence of systematic discussions of the nature of skepticism and\nthe epistemic challenges it raises. Pyrrhonism is the variety of\nskepticism most commonly dealt with in the works of Latin American\nacademics, both in general and in connection with epistemological\nissues. \nThe Latin American tradition of scholarship on the history of ancient\nand modern skepticism started in the 1970s with Oswaldo Porchat\nPereira (1933–2017) in Brazil and Ezequiel de Olaso\n(1932–1996) in Argentina, who were in close contact and\nco-organized two conferences on skepticism: one in Campinas (Brazil)\nin 1986 and one in Buenos Aires (Argentina) in 1992. Porchat pursued\nhis undergraduate and graduate studies in philosophy at the\nUniversidade de São Paulo (USP), obtaining a Ph.D. with a\ndissertation on Aristotle’s conception of science. He also spent\nresearch periods in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France,\nwhere he was heavily influenced by French historians of philosophy. He\nwas professor at USP and the founder of both the philosophy department\nand the Centro de Lógica, Epistemologia e História da\nCiência (on which see\n Section 1)\n at UNICAMP. \nDe Olaso obtained his B.A. (Licenciatura) in philosophy from\nthe University of Buenos Aires and his Ph.D. in the same field from\nBryn Mawr College, with a dissertation on Leibniz and ancient\nskepticism. He taught at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, the\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires, and the Universidad de San Andrés,\nall in Argentina. He was also a researcher at the Consejo Nacional de\nInvestigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) of\nArgentina, and a founding member of the Centro de Investigaciones\nFilosóficas (CIF, 1965) and its journal Revista\nLatinoamericana de Filosofía (RLF, 1975). He also seems to\nhave helped Porchat in the foundation of CLE. \nWhile Porchat’s studies on skepticism (all but one, Porchat\nPereira 2013, collected in his 2007 book) bear almost exclusively on\nthe Pyrrhonism expounded in the extant works of the second-century\nphysician Sextus Empiricus, de Olaso’s are concerned not only\nwith Sextus’s Pyrrhonism (de Olaso 1983, 1988, 1992), but also\nwith Hume’s and Leibniz’s discussions of skepticism,\nparticularly in its Pyrrhonian variety (de Olaso 1974, 1977, 1978,\n1980, 1984). Towards the very end of his life, de Olaso’s\nwritings focused on epistemology as practiced in the analytic\ntradition: e.g., he offered an analysis of the concepts of certainty,\nknowledge, and skepticism, and of their relations, in both modern and\ncontemporary philosophy (de Olaso 1999), but without making an\noriginal contribution to the present-day debates on those issues.\nWhile Porchat considered himself a skeptic, de Olaso did not, adopting\na much more critical approach to skepticism. We will here focus on\nPorchat both because he claimed to adopt a neo-Pyrrhonian stance and\nparticularly because it has been said that his writings offer\nsignificant epistemological reflections on skepticism. However, first,\nwhen discussing ancient Pyrrhonism in his published work, he seldom\ntouches on, or proposes solutions to, the most complex interpretive\nand philosophical questions posed by Sextus’s presentation of\nPyrrhonism, and he cursorily engages with only a tiny part of the vast\nspecialist literature. We make this remark because some of those\nquestions extensively discussed in the secondary literature concern\nintriguing epistemological problems: e.g., the epistemic challenge\nposed by the Five Modes of Agrippa, the attack on the criterion of\ntruth, the Pyrrhonist’s stance on the standards of justification\nand norms of rationality, and the possibility of skeptical inquiry.\nAnd secondly, when proposing his neo-Pyrrhonism, he completely\ndisregards the hundreds of epistemological studies on skepticism in\ngeneral or on Pyrrhonism in particular published especially since the\nlate 1970s. The reason is simply that Porchat does not engage in any\nsystematic discussion of epistemological matters. (For a different\nappraisal of Porchat’s work, see Smith & Bueno 2016 and\nSmith 2018.) \nIt must nonetheless be observed that, unlike de Olaso’s,\nPorchat’s teaching and writings exerted a strong influence on\nhis students, to the extent that several of them devoted their own\nwork to the study of skepticism, creating in Brazil a relatively large\ncommunity of academics interested in that philosophical movement. The\nwork of those Brazilian scholars influenced by Porchat has been\nprimarily exegetical and historical, with special focus on ancient and\nmodern skepticism. A clear exception is Otávio Bueno (b. 1970),\nwho after completing his B.A. and M.A. studies at USP, did his Ph.D.\nat the University of Leeds and is at present a professor at the\nUniversity of Miami. Although Bueno’s main areas of research are\nthe philosophy of science, the philosophy of mathematics, and logic,\nhe has also discussed epistemological issues in connection with\nskepticism, particularly of a Pyrrhonian stripe. He has argued that it\nis mistake to claim that the Pyrrhonist is in the end committed to\nepistemic internalism, given that the latter’s arguments against\nepistemic externalism are merely dialectical (Bueno 2011). He has also\nrejected the view that the Pyrrhonist cannot induce the state of\nsuspension of judgment on the basis of the Agrippan mode from\ndisagreement alone (Bueno 2013). In other articles in which Pyrrhonism\nis also taken into account, Bueno has critically assessed Donald\nDavidson’s and Ernest Sosa’s responses to skepticism\n(Bueno 2005 and 2009, respectively). It is finally worth mentioning\nthat he has defended a Pyrrhonian approach to contemporary science, in\nconnection with Bas van Fraassen’s (1980) constructive\nempiricism (Bueno 2015). \nRegarding Brazilian scholarship on epistemological skepticism, three\nother researchers may be mentioned: Plínio Junqueira Smith (b.\n1964), Waldomiro José da Silva Filho (b. 1966), and Claudio\nGonçalves de Almeida (1960). \nSmith, who pursued his undergraduate and graduate studies in\nphilosophy at USP, is probably the Brazilian scholar most influenced\nby Porchat’s teaching and writings. He is currently a professor\nat the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) and the\neditor of the Brazilian journal Sképsis\n(2007)—one of the two journals devoted to skepticism (co-)edited\nin Latin America. Although his work bears mainly on the history of\nmodern skepticism, Smith has recently written somewhat more\nepistemologically oriented papers devoted to Porchat’s skeptical\nstance (Smith 2015) and to what he regards as Barry Stroud’s\nneo-Pyrrhonism (Smith 2016). \nDa Silva Filho obtained his B.A. in philosophy from the Universidade\nEstadual de Santa Cruz and his M.A. and Ph.D. in communication and\ncontemporary culture from the Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA).\nCurrently a professor at UFBA, he works in the fields of philosophy of\nmind and epistemology. In some of his publications, he has examined\ncertain skeptical difficulties concerning self-knowledge (da Silva\nFilho 2007, 2008). Even though he was not one of Porchat’s\nstudents, he has also been influenced by Porchat’s skeptical\nstance. \nDe Almeida obtained his B.A. in social communication from the\nPontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul\n(PUCRS), his M.A. in philosophy from USP, and his Ph.D. in philosophy\nfrom McMaster University (Canada). Currently a professor at PUCRS, his\nmain area of research is epistemology. He has written on epistemic\nclosure and skepticism, arguing inter alia that neither\nknowledge nor epistemic justification are closed under logical\nimplication and that this closure-failure does not affect Cartesian\nskepticism (de Almeida 2007, 2012), and on Stroud’s influential\ninterpretation of Cartesian skepticism, which de Almeida claims is\ncrippled by a level confusion (de Almeida 2016). \nAs regards Argentina, one finds several researchers exploring\nskepticism in the context of contemporary epistemology, among whom one\nmay mention Eleonora Cresto (b. 1971), Juan Comesaña (b. 1972),\nand Diego Machuca (b. 1976). \nCresto’s initial interest in skepticism arose under the\ninfluence of de Olaso, who supervised her B.A. thesis at the\nUniversidad de Buenos (UBA). She later on pursued her M.A, M.Phil.,\nand Ph.D. at Columbia University. Currently a researcher at CONICET\nand a professor at the Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero in\nArgentina, she works primarily in formal epistemology (on which see\n Section 4).\n In her first published papers, she critically examined both\nreliabilist and naturalistic anti-skeptical responses proposed in the\nliterature, finding them unsatisfactory (Cresto 1996a, 1996b), but\nalso put forward a reliabilist reply of her own to skepticism (Cresto\n1997). \nAfter pursuing his undergraduate studies at UBA, Comesaña\nobtained his Ph.D. from Brown University under Sosa’s\nsupervision, and is at present a professor at the University of\nArizona. In Buenos Aires, he was a founding member of the influential\nbut now-defunct Grupo de Acción Filosófica (GAF). Having\npublished on various epistemological issues (on which see\n Section 3),\n he has devoted some studies to skepticism. He has offered useful\noverviews of both the so-called Pyrrhonian problematic and skepticism\nin general (Comesaña 2006a and 2009a, respectively). He has\nalso explored whether the contemporary theories of contextualism and\ncontrastivism can help Pyrrhonists offer a philosophically\nsatisfactory reply to the traditional objection according to which\nthey are reduced to inactivity because action requires belief and they\nclaim to suspend judgment regarding either philosophico-scientific\nbeliefs or all beliefs whatsoever. Comesaña’s verdict is\nnegative (Comesaña 2011). \nMachuca, who pursued his undergraduate and graduate studies in\nArgentina, obtaining his Ph.D. at UBA, is currently a researcher at\nCONICET and the editor (with Duncan Pritchard) of the\nInternational Journal for the Study of Skepticism (2011).\nHaving initially devoted himself to examining Sextus’s\nPyrrhonism and moral skepticism, he has more recently focused also on\na systematic discussion of skepticism in relation to epistemological\nissues. He has looked at the relevance of Pyrrhonism to contemporary\ntheories of knowledge and justification and, in particular, to the\npresent-day debate over the epistemic significance of disagreement,\ndefending a neo-Pyrrhonian stance (Machuca 2013b, 2015a, 2017a,\nforthcoming). He has also examined the connection between disagreement\nand skepticism in general, arguing inter alia that a radical\ndisagreement-based skepticism cannot be dismissed out of hand as being\npatently untenable or absurd (Machuca 2015b, 2017b). \nIn other Latin American countries, one finds some epistemological\nstudies on skepticism, and Pyrrhonism in particular, but interest in\nthis topic is much more sporadic. We will here summarize the works of\nPedro Stepanenko (Mexico) and Mauricio Zuluaga (Colombia) that are\nmore epistemological in nature. \nStepanenko (b. 1960), a specialist on Kant, obtained a Ph.D. in\nphilosophy at the Universidad Autónoma de México, where\nhe is currently a professor and a member of the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filosóficas (on which see\n Section 1).\n In Stepanenko (2011), he argues that, by using either a conditional or\na disjunctivist interpretation of his appearance-statements, the\nPyrrhonian skeptic can report on his own experiences without being\nepistemically committed to the beliefs one usually accepts when\nascribing mental states to oneself. \nZuluaga obtained his B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from the Universidad\nde los Andes and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, respectively,\nand his Ph.D. in the same field from the\nLudwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Germany). He is\ncurrently a professor at the Universidad del Valle (Colombia). Zuluaga\nhas looked at Agrippa’s trilemma in the context of contemporary\nepistemological discussions of the regress argument, but his approach\nis merely expository: he limits himself to providing an overview of\npart of the literature on the trilemma and on the problems faced by\nfoundationalism and coherentism (Zuluaga 2005). He has also written\nabout contemporary reconstructions of Cartesian skepticism that are\nbased on the closure principle (Zuluaga 2012), but his approach is\nagain entirely expository. \nCore epistemology is concerned basically with the systematic analysis\nof knowledge and justified belief. So, in this section we will refer\nto works that examine fundamental epistemological concepts—such\nas knowledge, truth, and justification—or that defend or attack\ncertain general epistemological theories—such as reliabilism and\nfallibilism. \nThe Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas is where Luis\nVilloro (1922–2014) spent the bulk of his academic career. Born\nin Barcelona (Spain) to a Mexican mother and a Spanish father, and\nraised in Spain and Belgium, he settled in Mexico at the outbreak of\nthe Second World War and became a Mexican citizen. He did his\nundergraduate and graduate studies at the Universidad Autónoma\nde México and spent research periods in France and Germany. In\n1982, he published the first analytically oriented book on\nepistemology written in Spanish: Creer, saber, conocer\n(Villoro 1982), translated into English as Belief, Personal, and\nPropositional Knowledge (Villoro 1998). Villoro examined\nfundamental concepts such as belief, knowledge, truth, objectivity,\nand epistemic communities. He distinguished between saber and\nconocer, which roughly correspond to what may be called\n“propositional” and “personal knowledge”,\nrespectively, the latter consisting in having direct experiences of a\ngiven object. S can assert that he has personal knowledge of\nx provided that he has the relevant personal experiences, but\nif S wants to justify to someone else the claim that he has\nsuch knowledge of x, S must show that he has\npropositional knowledge of his personal knowledge. Villoro seems to\nhave defended a form of epistemic relativism inasmuch as he claimed\nthat to know (in the sense of saber) that p is to\nbelieve that p, and to have objectively sufficient reasons to so\nbelieve—an objectively sufficient reason being one that is\nconclusive, coherent, and complete—but also maintained that what\nis considered as an objectively sufficient reason in one epistemic\ncommunity may not be so considered in another. For this reason, he\nclaimed that empirical knowledge is fallible: on the basis of the\nreasons that are objectively sufficient for any member of his\nepistemic community, S knows that p, but he cannot rule\nout the possibility that there might be contrary reasons available to\na different epistemic community that would undermine his knowledge\nthat p. Objectively sufficient reasons are our best guarantee\nof empirical truths, but they do not of necessity imply such truths\n(Villoro 1982: 180, 192). Villoro held that the view that all\nknowledge is socially conditioned is the only valid alternative to\nskepticism (1982: 164). He also proposed a surprising reform of the\ntraditional concept of knowledge: the notion of truth should not be\nincluded in the definition of knowledge because, even though the\nnotion of an objectively sufficient reason cannot be\nunderstood without the notion of truth, one may know that\np even if p is not true, for truth is not a necessary\ncondition for a reason to be objectively sufficient (1982: ch. 8).\n(For a fuller overview of Villoro’s book, see Cresto 2010a:\n474–477.) \nVilloro’s position has been criticized by Guillermo Hurtado (b.\n1962), a professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Mexico who\nobtained a B.A. in philosophy at this university as well as a B.A. and\na Ph.D. in the same field at the University of Oxford. Hurtado (2003)\nargues that Villoro’s epistemic relativism and his redefinition\nof the concept of knowledge are the result of the fact that Villoro\ngrants the skeptic the unacceptable view that, in order to be able to\nclaim that one knows that p, one must have an infallible\ncriterion for knowing that one knows. \nEleonora Cresto (on whom see\n Section 2)\n has devoted some papers to examining core epistemological issues. For\ninstance, adopting a moderately Peircean perspective, she has called\ninto question the traditional picture of knowledge attribution\naccording to which one can attribute knowledge of p to S\nonly if p is true and S is epistemically justified in\nbelieving in p. Cresto maintains that epistemic justification\n(understood either in internalist or externalist terms) is not\nalways viewed as a necessary condition for knowledge, and\nhence as a necessary condition for making a correct knowledge\nattribution, according to our pre-theoretical usage of standard\nepistemic terms (Cresto forthcoming a; cf. Cresto 2012:\n928–929). \nThere has also been some discussion of the concept of knowledge in\nterms of both reliability and fallibility. Let us begin with the\nformer. Succinctly put, reliabilism holds that a belief is knowledge\nif it is true and if it was produced, or is sustained, by a reliable\nprocess that yields mostly true beliefs. Reliabilist theories of\nknowledge require a reliable mechanism for belief formation, but do\nnot require that the epistemic agent be aware or have evidence of the\nmechanism’s reliability. For this reason, reliabilism is a form\nof externalism. Juan Comesaña (on whom see the previous\nsection) has proposed an original theory of epistemic justification\nthat combines elements of both reliabilism and\nevidentialism—which represent two competing approaches in\ncontemporary analytic epistemology. This theory, which he calls\n“evidentialist reliabilism”, is intended to incorporate\nthe best aspects of both positions while avoiding the most serious\nproblems they face (Comesaña 2010). Comesaña has also\nargued that reliabilism is able to successfully deal with the\nso-called “generality problem” (Comesaña 2006b),\nand that the epistemological problems stemming from lotteries either\nare not peculiar to reliabilism or can be solved by appealing to a\nprobabilistic account of reliability (Comesaña 2009b). He has\nas well referred to reliability in his discussion of\n“safety”. Several epistemologists (such as Ernest Sosa,\nTimothy Williamson, and Duncan Pritchard) have defended the view that\nsafety is a necessary condition for knowledge. Roughly put, what that\ncondition says is that S knows that p if and only if\nS would believe that p only if p were true. On\nthe basis of a counterexample, Comesaña (2005) has argued that\nsafety, as this notion has been defined by Sosa, is not actually a\nnecessary condition for knowledge. The reason is that, whereas\nreliability is plausibly a necessary condition for knowledge, reliable\nreliability is not, and whereas knowledge is compatible with\nunreliably reliable beliefs, safety is not. Hence, one can have\n“unsafe” knowledge. Comesaña’s more recent\nwork in collaboration with Matthew McGrath and Stewart Cohen has\nfocused on the part played by false beliefs in epistemology. He has\nargued that false propositions can be part of one’s evidence or\ncan be reasons to do something (Comesaña & McGrath 2014,\n2016) and, against Williamson, that one can have rational or justified\nfalse beliefs (Cohen & Comesaña 2013a, 2013b,\nforthcoming). \nAs regards fallibilism, it is safe to say that nearly all present-day\nepistemologists are fallibilists: we sometimes make\nmistakes—occasionally even about those things we deem to be most\nevident—despite having good justification for our beliefs. More\nprecisely, S fallibly knows that p in case, despite the\ngood justification underlying one’s knowledge, S’s\nbelief that p might have been false or might have been\naccidentally true (cf. Reed 2002). Hurtado (2000) rejects such a\nvirtually unanimous position—which he defines as “the\ndoctrine that any of our beliefs might turn out to be\nfalse”—on the grounds both that it is revisionist and that\nwe lack good reasons to accept it. Fallibilism is revisionist because,\nhe argues, it runs counter to common sense both by erasing the\nordinary distinction between those beliefs that cannot be false and\nthose that can, and by claiming that no evidence or no reasons can\nguarantee the truth of a given belief. And there are no good reasons\nto accept fallibilism because Hurtado claims to be able to refute what\nhe describes as the historico-pragmatic, epistemological, and ethical\narguments in its favor, and because he believes that fallibilism is\ndialectically weak against both skepticism and dogmatism. \nIt is also worth mentioning that Claudio de Almeida (on whom see\n Section 2)\n has devoted part of his work to the so-called Moore’s paradox,\narguing that none of the most influential analyses of the paradox\nprovides a successful solution to it, and proposing a solution of his\nown (de Almeida 2001, 2009). More recently, he has published on the\ndefeasibility theory of knowledge, arguing that a fallibilistic\nversion of this theory provides the correct solution to the Gettier\nproblem (de Almeida & Fett 2016, de Almeida 2017). \nWe should finally refer to the work of Carlos Pereda (b. 1944), even\nthough epistemology has not been the focus of his research. Born in\nUruguay, he obtained a B.A. in philosophy and educational sciences\nfrom the Universidad de la República in his home country, as\nwell as a M.A. and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Universität\nKonstanz (Germany). He pursued most of his academic career in Mexico,\nfirst at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana and then at\nUNAM’s Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas. His work\nis mainly concerned with the nature and purpose of argumentation\n(Pereda 1994a, 1994b), and it is in this context that he deals with\ncertain epistemological subjects. For instance, he calls the rules\nthat govern the way in which the argumentative game is to be played\n“epistemic virtues”, which are character traits or\ndispositions of those involved in a debate, such as coherence, rigor,\nand willingness to consider one’s rival theses. The exercise of\nthe epistemic virtues is what makes argumentation possible and what\nallows us to resolve conflicts of beliefs. Pereda also discusses what\nhe calls “the trilemma of knowledge” (el trilema del\nsaber), which arises from the following three claims: \nThe trilemma emerges because, given that (3) formulates the concept of\nknowledge as infallible knowledge, only two of (1), (2), and (3) can\nbe held together: if (1) and (2) are true, then (3) is false (there is\nfallible knowledge); if (1) and (3) are true, then (2) is false (there\nis infallible knowledge); and if (2) and (3) are true, then (1) is\nfalse (there is no knowledge). Pereda maintains that the solution to\nthe trilemma is not to abandon one of the claims, but to recognize\nthat there is both a strong and a weak sense of the concept of\nknowledge. Pereda’s view has been criticized by Guillermo\nHurtado (1996), who contends that the trilemma results from\nincorrectly analyzing (2), which should be understood not as the claim\nthat any of our beliefs may turn out to be false, but as the\nclaim that some of our beliefs may turn out to be false. \nFormal epistemology is concerned with the examination of traditional\nepistemological questions using the formal tools of logic and\nprobability. There has been a small but important group of Latin\nAmerican researchers working within this subfield of\nepistemology—sometimes in close collaboration with scholars from\nthe United States, Europe, and Australia—particularly on such\ntopics as belief change, Bayesian epistemology, and theory choice. \nArgentina has been the main center of development of the subfield of\nformal epistemology in Latin America, beginning in the mid-1980s. The\nfirst central figure was the Argentinian Carlos Alchourrón\n(1931–1996), who obtained his B.A. in law and his Ph.D. in law\nand social sciences at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), where he\ntaught until his death. He was one of the founders of the Sociedad\nArgentina de Análisis Filosófico (on which see\n Section 1).\n He also founded, at UBA’s philosophy department, a logic group\nthat would eventually incorporate researchers working on artificial\nintelligence at UBA’s computer science department. The\ninterdisciplinary group became a hotbed of formal epistemology. \nAlchourrón’s main line of research concerned the theory\nof belief change, which basically deals with the question of how a\nbelief set is to be updated in light of new information. In 1985 he\npublished, together with Peter Gändenfors and David Makinson, a\nseminal article in which they advanced an axiomatic theory that has\ncome to be known as “the AGM theory of belief change”,\n“the AGM account of the logic of belief change”, or\n“the AGM theory of belief revision” (Alchourrón,\nGändenfors, & Makinson 1985; cf. Alchourrón &\nMakinson 1982, 1985, 1986). The AGM theory identifies three types of\nbelief change: expansion, contraction, and revision, focusing on the\nlast two. Roughly put, expansion consists in adding to a given belief\nset a new belief that does not conflict with the current beliefs of\nthe set; contraction involves removing a belief from the set; and\nrevision amounts to adding a new belief to the set and removing others\nfrom it so that the resulting set stays consistent. The AGM theory\nproposes six basic and two supplementary postulates for each of the\ntwo operations of contraction and revision that every appropriate\nbelief-change method must satisfy. Since its appearance in 1985, the\nAGM theory has had a tremendous impact on subsequent discussions of\nbelief change, becoming the predominant paradigm, even though some of\nits main assumptions have been questioned and several modifications or\nextensions of it have been proposed (for an overview, see\nArló-Costa & Fermé 2010 and Hansson 2011; see also\nFermé & Hansson 2011, which is a special issue on the\noccasion of the 25 years of the AGM theory). The theory has also had a\nconsiderable influence on research on artificial intelligence (on\nwhich see Carnota & Rodríguez 2010). Towards the end of his\nlife, Alchourrón’s work focused on the logic of\ndefeasible conditionals (Alchourrón 1993, 1995, 1996; see\nFermé & Rodríguez 2006 for an analysis of his theory\nof conditionals). \nA second key contributor to the development of formal epistemology,\nnot only in Latin America but worldwide, was Horacio Arló-Costa\n(1956–2011). Born in Montevideo (Uruguay), he pursued his\nundergraduate studies at UBA, obtaining his B.A. in philosophy under\nthe supervision of Alchourrón, and was a member of\nAlchourrón’s logic group since its founding. He later on\nobtained his Ph.D. in philosophy at Columbia University under the\nsupervision of Isaac Levi, with whom he would collaborate in a number\nof publications. From 1997 until his death, he worked at Carnegie\nMellon University, where he helped found the Center for Formal\nEpistemology. Arló-Costa made significant contributions to the\nstudy of the logic of belief change (Arló-Costa 1990, 2006;\nArló-Costa & Levi 2006), conditionals (Arló-Costa\n1995, 1999; Arló-Costa & Levi 1996), Bayesian epistemology\n(Arló-Costa 2001, Arló-Costa & Thomason 2001,\nArló-Costa & Parikh 2005, Arló-Costa & Pedersen\n2012), and rationality and decision theory (Arló-Costa 1996;\nArló-Costa, Collins, & Levi 1995; Arló-Costa &\nHelzner 2010; Arló-Costa & Pedersen 2011, 2013). (For a\nbrief presentation of Arló-Costa’s original contributions\nto those subjects as well as to modal logic, see Cresto 2011.) \nAnother former student of Alchourrón to be mentioned is the\nArgentinian Eduardo Fermé (b. 1964), who was also a member of\nAlchourrón’s group when it became interdisciplinary.\nCurrently a professor at the Universidad de Madeira (Portugal), he\nobtained his B.A. and Ph.D. in computer science at UBA, and his Ph.D.\nin philosophy at the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden).\nFermé’s research has focused mainly on theory contraction\nand on epistemic entrenchment, extending or modifying in several of\nhis publications the AGM theory (Fermé 1998, 2000, 2001;\nFermé & Hansson 1999; Fermé & Reis 2013). \nA leading international specialist in database theory, the Argentinian\nAlberto Mendelzon (1951–2005), also deserves a mention because\nof his key contribution to the theory of belief change. He obtained a\nB.Sc. from UBA as well as a M.S.E., a M.A., and a Ph.D. from Princeton\nUniversity. From 1980 until his death, he taught at the University of\nToronto. He also contributed to the creation of UBA’s computer\nscience department in the early 1980s. In 1992 he published, together\nwith Hirofumi Katsuno, a highly influential paper that addresses the\nissue of updating knowledge bases (Katsuno & Mendelzon 1992). They\ndistinguished between two kinds of modification to a knowledge base:\nupdate and revision. While the former consists in\nbringing the knowledge base up to date when the world it describes\nchanges, the latter consists in modifying the knowledge base when new\ninformation about a static world is acquired. Mendelzon and Katsuno\nclaimed that the AGM postulates describe only revision and\nhence that, in order to describe update, the AGM theory\nshould be considerably modified by adding new postulates. (On\nMendelzon’s work on belief change, see also Katsuno &\nMendelzon 1989 and 1991.) \nRegarding formal epistemology in Argentina, one may finally refer to a\nnumber of works by Eleonora Cresto, who completed her Ph.D. under the\nsupervision of Isaac Levi. Her first publications in the field were\nconcerned with formal belief-revision theories (Cresto 2008, 2010b).\nShe later on offered a defense of a moderate version of the so-called\nKK principle—according to which if S knows that p,\nthen S knows that she knows that p—as a normative\nrather than descriptive epistemic principle. Her defense of such a\nprinciple of epistemic transparency is different from that\ntraditionally proposed by epistemic internalists inasmuch as her\nargument is a formal one that appeals to lower- and higher-order\nprobabilities (Cresto 2012). Cresto’s more recent research in\nthe subfield of formal epistemology focuses on such topics as group\nknowledge and probability aggregation (Cresto 2015a, 2016, forthcoming\nb). \nResearch in formal epistemology has also been important in Brazil,\nwhere several researchers from artificial intelligence and computer\nscience have examined the application of belief-change theory to\nvarious areas. Among them one may mention Odinaldo Rodrigues (b. 1968)\nand Renata Wassermann (b. 1971). \nRodrigues, who has been teaching at King’s College London since\n1998, obtained his B.Sc. in computer science at the Universidade de\nFortaleza, his MSc in computer science at the Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, and his Ph.D. in computing at Imperial College London.\nHe has applied the principles of belief change to non-classical\nlogics, software engineering, and social choice theory (Gabbay &\nRodrigues 1996; Gabbay, Pigozzi, & Rodrigues 2006, 2007; Gabbay,\nRodrigues, & Russo 2008; Gabbay, Rodrigues, & Pigozzi\n2009). \nWassermann obtained her B.Sc. in computer science and her M.Sc. in\napplied mathematics at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and\nher Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Amsterdam. She is\nat present a professor at USP’s computer science department and\na member of the research group “Lógica,\nInteligência Artificial e Métodos Formais” (LIAMF),\nwhich was founded in 2000 at USP and is one of the most active Latin\nAmerican groups working on belief change. Wassermann has published\nextensively in this field, examining local belief change and applying\nthe AGM theory to non-classical logics and to computer science\n(Wassermann 1999; Chopra, Parikh, & Wassermann 2001; Hansson &\nWassermann 2002; Ribeiro, Wassermann, Flouris, & Antoniou 2013;\nWassermann & Ribeiro 2015). \nAnother line of epistemological research in Latin America concerns\nLudwig Wittgenstein’s thought. The first scholar to be mentioned\nis Alejandro Tomassini Bassols (b. 1952). A member of the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filosóficas at the Universidad Autónoma\nde México, he has devoted a considerable part of his work to\ninterpreting Wittgenstein’s thought and endorses what he\ndescribes as “a radical Wittgensteinism”. Although from\nthe vantage point of the numerous Anglophone specialists on\nWittgenstein his writings might not offer original insights, they have\ncontributed to the dissemination of the Austrian philosopher’s\nthought in Spanish. In his 2001 book, Tomassini Bassols examines the\nconcept of knowledge, the problem of skepticism, and various issues\nconcerning perception, memory, self-knowledge, personal identity, and\ntruth by contrasting the “classical” and the\nWittgensteinian approaches to each of those questions. Availing\nhimself primarily of the epistemological considerations found in\nOn Certainty, his main contention is that the type of\ngrammatical analysis proposed by Wittgenstein shows that the\ntraditional problems that classical epistemology intended to solve\nthrough the construction of elaborate theories are nothing but\npseudo-problems arising from conceptual misunderstandings. For this\nreason, he contends, it is not longer possible to continue to practice\nepistemology the way it was practiced before Wittgenstein. \nIn Colombia, one finds several scholars interested in\nWittgenstein’s philosophy, among whom one should mention\nMagdalena Holguín (b. 1950) and Raúl Meléndez (b.\n1964). Holguín obtained her B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from\nGeorgetown University, her M.A. in law from the Universidad de los\nAndes (Colombia), and her Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia\nUniversity. She taught at the Universidad de los Andes and the\nUniversidad Nacional de Colombia. In her short 1997 book, she explores\nWittgenstein’s stance on certain skeptical problems. After\npresenting Wittgenstein’s view that philosophy is not a theory\nor a doctrine but an activity, as well as the changes in his\nconception of philosophy over the different phases of his thought,\nHolguín examines the distinction between appearance and\nreality, the distinction between subjective and objective, and the\nidea, shared by skeptics and dogmatists but rejected by Wittgenstein\nas being based on confusion, that knowledge requires an ultimate\nfoundation. (It should be noted that skeptics of a Pyrrhonian stripe\nsuspend judgment about whether knowledge requires an ultimate\nfoundation.) \nMeléndez is a professor at the Universidad Nacional de\nColombia, where he also obtained his Ph.D. in philosophy. In his 1998\nbook, he explores the notion of truth from the vantage point of\nWittgenstein’s later philosophy, although he also takes into\naccount the conception of truth defended in the Tractatus.\nMeléndez’s main aim is to call into question the attempts\nto construct a general theory of truth that would make it rest on an\nultimate and unshakable foundation. In a later publication, he\ndiscusses Wittgenstein’s examination of the notions of\njustification, persuasion, and world-picture (Weltbild) in\nOn Certainty, focusing on whether world-pictures are taken to\nbe incommensurable and hence on whether Wittgenstein endorses a form\nof epistemic relativism (Meléndez 2014). \nIt should finally be pointed out that in Brazil there has been some\ndiscussion of the philosophical connections between\nWittgenstein’s thought and Pyrrhonian skepticism—a\ncomparison first made, to the best of my knowledge, by Richard Watson\n(1969) and Robert Fogelin (1981). Plínio Junqueira Smith (1993)\nclaimed that there are strong similarities between\nWittgenstein’s later philosophy and the Pyrrhonism expounded in\nSextus Empiricus’s surviving works. For instance, according to\nSmith, both reject the conception of philosophy as a theory that\nprovides us with knowledge of the essence of things that lies beneath\ntheir surface, conceiving of it instead as an ability and a\ntherapeutic practice whose function is negative and critical.\nSmith’s interpretation was later on called into question by\nPaulo Roberto Margutti Pinto—currently a professor at the\nFaculdade Jesuíta de Filosofia e Teologia—who maintained\nthat, although there exist similarities, they are merely superficial\nwhile the differences are radical: e.g., while the Pyrrhonist accepts\nthat there are philosophical problems to be solved, Wittgenstein\ndissolves them by appealing to the way in which words are used in\nordinary language (Margutti Pinto 1996). \nTo conclude, we can briefly refer to an area that has received some\nattention in recent years, namely, the epistemology of law. In this\narea, we can mention the work of Andrés Páez and\nEleonora Cresto. \nPáez obtained his B.A. in philosophy from the Universidad de\nlos Andes (Colombia) and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from The\nCity University of New York. He is currently a professor at the\nUniversidad de los Andes. While in Páez (2014) he examines the\nrelevance of the epistemological debate between reductionism and\nanti-reductionism about testimony to the problem of the reliability of\ntestimonial evidence by focusing on both Colombian and American\nlegislation, in Páez (2016) he explores the nature of legal\nreputation from the point of view of social epistemology by\nconsidering recent views on group beliefs. \nWe have already discussed Cresto’s work in epistemology in\nprevious sections. Concerning the epistemology of law, while Cresto\n(2015b) outlines a theory of evidence in the legal context by focusing\non a particular model of the inference to the best explanation that is\nbased on elements of decision theory, Cresto (2016) proposes a\nsolution to the problem of judgment aggregation that can be applied to\nthe problem of opinion aggregation in the context of a court of\nappeals or a jury.","contact.mail":"diegomachuca@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
