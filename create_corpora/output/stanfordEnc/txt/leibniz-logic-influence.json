The most\nsignificant of Leibniz’s contributions to formal logic were\npublished in the early 20th century. Only then, Leibniz’s logic\ncould be fully understood. Nevertheless, the essentials of his\nphilosophy of logic and some technical elaborations could be derived\nfrom early editions of his writings published in the 18th and 19th\ncenturies.\n\n\n\nThe most important of these editions was Johann Eduard\nErdmann’s collection of Leibniz’s philosophical works\n(1839/40) which led to a first wave of reception of Leibniz’s\nlogic. This edition and Adolf Trendelenburg’s discussion of\nLeibniz’s theory of signs on the basis of texts published in it\nallowed a further reception of Leibnizian ideas among mathematical\nlogicians at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n\nLeibniz’s impact on the emergence of modern logic, be it\nmathematical, algebraic, algorithmic or symbolic logic, is an important\ntopic for understanding the emergence and development of the logic\npredominant today (on Leibniz’s influence and reception cf.\nHeinekamp (ed.) 1986; on his influence in logic cf. Peckhaus 1997).\nHowever, the question whether Leibniz had any influence at all, or\nwhether his ideas were rather not more than ingenious anticipations of\nlater developments, is still disputed. The significance of this problem\ncan be shown by referring to Louis Couturat, who claimed that in\nrespect to the logical calculus Leibniz already had all the principles\nof much more recent logical systems of the algebra of logic (George\nBoole, Ernst Schröder) and was even more advanced in some points\n(Couturat 1901, 386). But did early “modern” logicians like\nBoole, Schröder, or Frege have any knowledge of Leibnizian logic,\ni.e., could Leibniz have had any influence on these pioneers of modern\nlogic? \n\nThere are different answers to these questions. Wolfgang Lenzen,\ne.g., wrote that Leibniz was the most significant logician between\nAristotle and Frege, but despite the enormous significance of his\nlogic, he played hardly any role in the history of logic (Lenzen 2004a,\n15; cf. also Lenzen 2004b). According to Lenzen, Leibniz’s mature\nlogical theory was present in his Generales Inquisitiones de\nAnalysi Notionum et Veritatum, which was only published in\nCouturat’s edition of Leibniz’s minor writings and\nfragments (Leibniz 1903, 356–399). Couturat had already referred\nto it in his book on Leibniz’s logic which had appeared two years\nearlier (Couturat 1901). We find similar evaluations by William and\nMartha Kneale, who in The Development of Logic rank\nLeibniz among “the greatest of all logicians,” but stress\n“that his work on logic had little influence for nearly 200 years\nafter he wrote it” (Kneale/Kneale 1962, 320). In the\nKneales’ opinion, Leibniz had rather become notorious for\nclaiming to have made great discoveries in logic while there was little\npublished evidence for this claim. \n\nHeinrich Scholz, a great admirer of Leibniz and author of the first\nhistory of modern logic (Scholz 1931), argues along the same lines. For\nhim, Leibniz is the creator of logistic, i.e., modern formal logic\nusing logical calculi (Scholz 1931, 54, n. 9). Scholz reports that\nLeibniz inspired 18th-century logicians in Germany, above all Johann\nHeinrich Lambert (1728–1777) and Gottfried Ploucquet\n(1716–1790). But then he stresses (ibid., 56) that the logical\ncalculi created in the middle of the 19th century by the English logician Augustus De Morgan and George Boole living in Ireland were completely independent of\nLeibniz and German 18th-century research on logic. These calculi were amplified by the German mathematician Ernst Schröder\nin his monumental Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik\n(Schröder 1890–1905). \n\nIf this thesis of the independence of 19th-century algebra of logic\nfrom Leibniz is accepted, it is possible to connect the discovery of\nLeibniz, the logician, with the Leibniz renaissance in early 20th\ncentury. In addition to Couturat’s book La logique de Leibniz\nd’après des documents inédits (1901), with a\npresentation of Leibniz’s logic in the spirit of the new logic,\nthe following landmark publications have to be mentioned: Bertrand\nRussell’s A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of\nLeibniz (1900), providing an axiomatic deductive reconstruction of\nLeibnizian metaphysics, and Ernst Cassirer’s Leibniz’\nSystem in seinen wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen (1902), focussing\non a Neo-Kantian interpretation of Leibniz’s philosophy.\nUndoubtedly, Couturat’s edition of Leibniz’s Opuscules\net fragments inédits de Leibniz (Leibniz 1903), taken from\nthe manuscripts in the Royal Library in Hanover and published\nin 1903, gave for the first time access to the wealth of\nLeibniz’s different approaches to logic. \n\nOther authors assign Leibniz a key role in the development of modern\nlogic. Eric J. Aiton, e.g., wrote that the Leibnizian project of a\nuniversal characteristic and the logical calculi resulting from it,\n“played a significant role in the history of logic” (1985,\nix). Franz Schupp, starting from Couturat’s evaluation quoted\nearlier, assumed “that the Leibnizian logic might be relevant for\nthe further development of modern logic, beyond the historically\ninteresting aspect of an ‘ingenious anticipation’”\n(Schupp 1988, 42). Schupp wrote that every step in the development of\nmodern logic led to new insights into the Leibnizian logic, but\nsometimes dealing with Leibniz influenced the development itself. \n\nIt seems to be in accord with the second position that the pioneers\nof modern logic themselves referred to Leibniz. George Boole’s\nwidow, Mary Everest Boole, e.g., wrote that her husband, having been\ninformed of Leibniz’s anticipations of his own logic, felt\n“as if Leibnitz had come and shaken hands with him across the\ncenturies”\n(M. E. Boole 1905, quoted in Laita 1976, 243).\nWilliam Stanley Jevons, who was\nresponsible for the great public success of modern logic in Great\nBritain after Boole, claimed that “Leibnitz’ logical tracts\nare […] evidence of his wonderful sagacity” (Jevons 1883\n[1874], xix). Ernst Schröder thought that Leibniz’s ideal of\na logical calculus had been brought to perfection by George Boole\n(Schröder 1877, III). The special controversy between Ernst\nSchröder and Gottlob Frege which was at the root of the later\ndistinction between two kinds of modern logic, the algebra of logic and\nthe Frege-style mathematical logic, was centered on the question how\nfar the Leibnizian heritage was present in the respective variations of\nlogic. In his Begriffsschrift, Frege had written that the idea of a\ngeneral characteristic, of a calculus philosophicus or\nratiocinator was too ambitious to be achieved by Leibniz\nalone. Frege’s own Begriffsschrift provides the first\nsteps towards this goal, which can be found in the formula languages of\narithmetic and chemistry (Frege 1879, VI). In his review of\nFrege’s Begriffsschrift, Schröder (Schröder\n1880, 82) objected that the title “Begriffsschrift”\npromises too much. According to Schröder, Frege’s system is\nless of a ‘general characteristic’ and more of a\ncalculus ratiocinator, and its development would have been\nsignificant, had it not already been achieved by others (esp. by\nBoole). Frege replied (Frege 1883, 1) that he did not intend to present\nan abstract logic in formulae like Boole, but to express contents by\nwritten signs in a more precise and clear manner than it would be\npossible by words. Therefore the Begriffsschrift is not a mere\ncalculus ratiocinator, but a lingua characteristica\nin the Leibnizian sense, although he accepted that inferential\ncalculation (schlussfolgernde Rechnung) was a necessary\nconstituent of the Begriffsschrift. \n\nReferring to Leibniz was a common place in the initial period of\ndevelopment of modern mathematical logic. Obviously, the early\nlogicians saw some of their ideas represented in Leibniz, and in\naddition they had access to at least some of Leibniz’s writings\nthat could lend support to this claim. But which of Leibniz’s\nideas on logic could have been known in the middle of the 19th\ncentury? \n\nThe edition of Leibniz’s philosophical works in Latin and\nFrench, published by Rudolph Erich Raspe (Leibniz 1765; cf. Hallo\n1934) contained some up to then unpublished letters and six pieces\nfrom the unpublished papers, of which two, “Difficultates\nquaedam logicae” and “Historia et commendatio linguae\ncharactericae”, are relevant to logic. The most important\nfeature of Raspe’s edition was the first publication of the\n“Nouveaux Essais sur l’entendement humain” which had\nbeen missing for sixty years. They influenced, e.g., Bernard Bolzano\nwho regarded Leibniz as an ally when writing his\nseminal Wissenschaftslehre (Bolzano 1837, 2014; Mugnai\n2011). \n\nIn 1768 Louis Dutens published the Opera omnia nunc primum\ncollecta in Classes distributa praefationibus & indicibus\nexornata (Leibniz 1768; cf. Heinekamp 1986), a rather complete\ncollection of Leibniz’s published works. It contained some\nhitherto unpublished\ncorrespondences. \n\nThe “Nouveaux Essais” count as Leibniz’s main work\nin epistemology. They were written between 1703 and 1705 and contained\ncriticism of John Locke’s An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (Locke 1690). Locke died in 1704\nwhen Leibniz was still working on the essays. The text caused a great\nsensation when it was published by Raspe. It can therefore be regarded\nas a key text for the reception of Leibniz in the late 18th and the\n19th century. Logical considerations can be found in the fourth book\n“De la connaissance”. They concentrate on the theory of\nsyllogism, but all elements of Leibniz’s theory of logic are\npresent, to the extent that they are regarded as a device for the\nevaluation of the validity of given theses (ars iudicandi) and\nfor finding new truths on the basis of given truths (ars\ninveniendi). \n\nLeibniz stresses in the “Nouveaux essais” that\nsyllogistic is part of a sort of universal mathematics, an art of\ninfallibility (art d’infaillibilité). This art is\nnot restricted to syllogisms, but concerns all kinds of formal proofs,\ni.e. all reasoning in which inferences are executed by virtue of their\nform (NE, ch. XVII, §4). According to Leibniz, there are\nsome problems with algebra in that it is still far from being an art of\ninvention. It has to be supplemented by a general art of signs or an\nart of characteristic (NE, ch. XVII, §9). \n\nWhen access to Leibniz’s papers stored in Hanover became\npossible in the 1830s, interest in Leibniz arose almost immediately. It can be said\nthat German research on Leibniz started as an aftermath of this event\n(Glockner 1932, 60). The pioneers in this period of research were the\nfirst editors of these papers. Although the philological interest stood\nat the center, one could also observe an emerging interest in systematic aspects of\nLeibniz’s logic. The following editorial milestones have to be\nmentioned: Gottschalk Eduard Guhrauer (1809–1854) edited the\nDeutsche Schriften (Leibniz 1838/40); Georg Heinrich Pertz\n(1795–1876) directed the edition of the collected works, of which\na first series was devoted to the mathematical writings (Leibniz\n1849–1863). The latter were edited by Carl Immanuel Gerhardt\n(1816–1899). In addition, Pertz also edited Leibniz’s\nAnnales imperii occidentis Brunsvicenses (Leibniz\n1843–1846). \n\nThe most important among these editorial projects was the edition of\nLeibniz’s philosophical works God. Guil. Leibnitii opera\nphilosophica quae exstant Latina Gallica Germanica omnia (Leibniz\n1839/40; cf. Glockner 1932, 59–65) prepared in two volumes by\nJohann Eduard Erdmann (1805–1892), which included fragments,\npublished there for the first time, containing elaborations of\nLeibniz’s ideas concerning logical calculi. One of the documents is\nLeibniz’s 1696 letter to Gabriel Wagner which contains the famous\ndefinition of logic or the art of reasoning as the art to use the\nintellect (Verstand), i.e., not only to evaluate what is\nimagined, but also to discover (invent) what is hidden. The edition\nalso contains the seminal fragments “Specimen demonstrandi in\nabstractis” and “Non inelegans specimen demonstrandi in\nabstractis” (Leibniz 1839/40, 94–97), the last with the\nalgebraic plus-minus calculus, i.e. a central specimen of Leibniz’s\nvarious attempts to create logical calculi working with the two\n“constituting” operations “gathering\ntogether”, symbolized by +, and “taking away”,\nsymbolized by – (cf. Leibniz 1999, no. 178). \n\nJohann Eduard Erdmann studied theology and philosophy at Tartu and\nBerlin (cf. Glockner 1932). Friedrich Schleiermacher and Georg\nFriedrich Wilhelm Hegel were among his teachers. He later became a\nmember of the right wing Hegelian school. In 1839 he was appointed full\nprofessor of philosophy at the University of Halle. Erdmann became\nwell-known for his comprehensive history of modern philosophy entitled\nVersuch einer wissenschaftlichen Darstellung der Geschichte der\nNeueren Philosophie (“Attempt at a scientific presentation of the\nhistory of recent philosophy”), published in seven volumes (Erdmann\n1834–1853). This history of philosophy covers the period between\nDescartes and Hegel. In part 2 of vol. 2 of this work, Erdmann\npresented a discussion of Leibniz and the development of idealism\nbefore Kant. This presentation was published in 1842, two years after\nhis edition of Leibniz’s philosophical works. Erdmann reported\nthat while preparing his history he grew unsatisfied with the available\neditions of Leibniz’s works. He therefore intended to unite\nRaspe’s edition with the philosophical parts of Dutens’\nedition and some pieces from the unpublished papers. He started\neditorial work at the archive in Hanover in 1836. \n\nIn the chapter on Leibniz, Erdmann stressed the connection between\nmathematics and philosophy. He dealt with Leibniz’s logic in the\nsection on the philosophical method and mentioned Leibniz’s\ndefinition of “method” as the way to derive all knowledge\nwith the help of “principles of knowledge”\n(Erkenntnisprinzipien) (Erdmann 1842, 109). These principles\nare the law of contradiction and the law of sufficient reason. Erdmann\nquoted Leibniz’s letter to Gabriel Wagner containing the\nstatement that logic is the art to use the intellect; logic is\ntherefore the key to all sciences and arts. According to Erdmann,\nLeibniz identifies the logical method with the mathematical method regarding it as the true philosophical method. Erdmann\nfurthermore dealt at length with Leibniz’s “mathematical\ntreatment of philosophy” not only because it was important for\nChristian Wolff and his school, but also “because just this point\nis usually ignored in presentations of Leibniz’s\nphilosophy” (ibid., 114). He had good reasons for this evaluation\nbecause most of the relevant writings became only accessible in his own\nedition (Leibniz 1839/40). Erdmann discussed Leibniz’s calculi\ncalling them “methodic operations” with data in the\n“way of calculating”. He mentioned Leibniz’s idea of\na character script for the calculus which allows using signs without\nalways having a particular meaning in view. Such “pasigraphy”\nwould eliminate the differences between the languages, but, according\nto Erdmann’s evaluation, the idea of a universal language was not\nat the center of Leibniz’s interests. Leibniz’s main point\nwas that “all mistakes in reasoning will at once show up in a\nwrong combination of characters, and therefore the application of the\ncharacteristic script provides a means to discover the mistake in a\ndisputed point like in every other calculation” (ibid.,\n122–123). \n\nErdmann’s discussion of Leibniz can be evaluated as follows.\nHe opened the way for the inclusion of Leibniz’s conception of\nlogic into the actual philosophical debates on logic. This is all the\nmore astonishing as Erdmann was a Hegelian. Hegel was known and heavily\ncriticized for his depreciation of formal logic. On the other hand,\nstressing the close connection between philosophy and mathematics fits\ninto a time when many philosophers tried to bring philosophy back into\ncontact with the sciences. \n\nErdmann’s edition immediately stimulated further research on\nLeibniz’s logic. Gottschalk Eduard Guhrauer criticized\nextensively Leibniz’s universal characteristic in the first\nvolume of his biography of Leibniz (Guhrauer 1846). He stressed its\nabsurd and utopian character: According to Guhrauer, Leibniz’s\ngeneral characteristic must almost be seen as on a par with the\nphilosopher’s stone and the secrets of producing gold. \n\nIn a paper on “Über Leibnitz’ens\nUniversal-Wissenschaft,” (1843) the Austrian philosopher Franz\nExner referred explicitly to Erdmann’s edition. For Exner, the\nedition throws a brighter light on Leibniz’s conception of a\nuniversal science. Even though in Exner’s opinion it had its\nweaknesses, he predicted a healthy impact on philosophy. He wrote\n(Exner 1843, 39): In 1857 the Herbartian philosopher from Bohemia, František\nBolemír Květ (1825–1864), published a booklet\nentitled Leibniz’ens Logik. Květ reconstructed the\nelements of Leibniz’s scientia generalis stressing the\noriginality of their combination, but not of every single element. He\ndiscussed the “extremely meager” fragments concerning the\nphilosophical calculus. They showed, Květ wrote, how far their\nauthor stood behind his aims. He dismissed Leibniz’s ars\ninveniendi, calling it embarrassing because of its weaknesses,\ndefects and impossibility. The most important figure in this second period of reception was\nFriedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802–1872). He had studied\nphilology, history and philosophy at the universities of Kiel, Leipzig\nand Berlin (cf. Bratuschek 1872; Vilkko 2002, 56–81; Vilkko 2009,\n211–217; Peckhaus 2007). Among his teachers were Karl Leonhard\nReinhold and Johann Erich von Berger. He became professor in 1833; in\n1837 he was promoted to full professor of practical philosophy and\neducation at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Berlin where he grew\ninto one of the main leaders of Prussian education and German\nphilosophy. An ordinary member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science\nat Berlin since 1846, he became the secretary of the\nPhilosophical-Historical Section of this Academy in 1847. Trendelenburg\nwas an anti-Hegelian who started from Hegelian philosophy. His fame as\na neo-Aristotelian goes back to his Elementa logices\nAristotelicae, first published in 1836 with five further editions\n(Trendelenburg 1836). In his systematic work on logic he pleaded for a\nunity of logic and metaphysics as found in the Aristotelian organon.\nThis systematic attitude is developed in a comprehensive work\ncontaining heavy criticism of logical systems of his time, his\nLogische Untersuchungen, published in two volumes in 1840\n(Trendelenburg 1840). As a secretary of the Academy, Trendelenburg was charged with\nhonoring Leibniz’s memory. Leibniz had been the first president of the\n“Societät der Wissenschaften” at Berlin, the\npredecessor institution of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science,\nfounded on his initiative in 1700. In 1856, Trendelenburg delivered a\nseminal lecture entitled “Über Leibnizens Entwurf einer\nallgemeinen Charakteristik” at the Leibniz ceremony of the\nAcademy at Berlin (Trendelenburg 1857). This paper was reprinted in\nthe third volume of his Historische Beiträge zur\nPhilosophie (1867). In this discussion of Leibniz, Trendelenburg\nstressed the essential role of signs in communication and\nreasoning. There is no logical relation between sign and intuition,\nbut science has provided the opportunity to “bring the\ncomposition of the signs into immediate contact with contents of the\nconcept” (Trendelenburg 1857, 3). The composition of the sign\npresents the characteristic marks distinguished and comprehended in\nthe concept (ibid.). Trendelenburg called such a script\n“Begriffsschrift”. Maybe he took over this term from\nWilhelm von Humboldt who had introduced it in 1824 (v. Humboldt 1826,\nquoted 1848, 532; cf. Thiel 1995, 20). According to Trendelenburg the\nbeginnings of a Begriffsschrift were made, e.g., in the\ndecimal number system. Trendelenburg saw the objectives of Leibniz’s\nprogram as widening such an approach to the complete domain of\nobjects, thereby aiming at a “characteristic language of\nconcepts” and a “general language of matter.” He\nmentioned the different names used by Leibniz: lingua characterica\nuniversalis (in fact Trendelenburg’s term; Leibniz\nused characteristica universalis), alphabet of human\nthoughts, calculus philosophicus, calculus\nratiocinator,\nspécieuse générale. These names underline\nthe significance Leibniz ascribed to this program for his philosophy.\nAccording to Trendelenburg, Leibniz aimed at “an adequate and\ntherefore general signification of the essence [of conceptual content],\nnamely by such analysis into the elements of concepts, that it becomes\npossible to treat it by calculation” (ibid., 6). He mentioned as\nhistorical precursors the ars magna of Raymundus Lullus and\nother conceptions of universal languages. Because of its generality,\nLeibniz’s characteristica universalis stands out\ncompared with competing proposals by George Dalgarno (1661) and John\nWilkins (1668), which were obtained from “choice, nature and\nchance,” and relied upon existing languages (ibid.,\n14–15). \n\nTrendelenburg, however, did not welcome all the elements of\nLeibniz’s program. He heavily criticized its practical side, in\nparticular, calculation in logic. The connection of properties in a\nconcept is much more complicated than can be expressed with\nLeibniz’s operations (ibid., 24). He recommended abstaining from\ncalculation (Trendelenburg 1857, 55): \n\nTrendelenburg stresses that such analysis cannot be done given the\nstate of science of that time. If the characteristica\nuniversalis is not given up the still pending analytical formula\nhas to be replaced by arbitrary conjectures, a procedure which,\naccording to Trendelenburg, contradicts the idea and even the\npossibility of the intended calculation. \n\nErdmann’s edition induced a second wave of reception. This\nreception is characterized by an interest in Leibniz’s ideas on\nlogic. Its context was the reorganization of the philosophical scene\nafter Hegel’s death (1831). This process was connected with a\ndiscussion of the so-called “Logical Question”, a term\ncreated by Adolf Trendelenburg (Trendelenburg 1842) who initiated these\ndebates. The discussions concerned the role of formal logic in the\nsystem of philosophy (cf. Peckhaus 1997, 130–163; Peckhaus 1999;\nVilkko 2002, 56–81; Vilkko 2009). The authors aimed at overcoming\nHegel’s identification of logic and metaphysics without\nre-establishing the old system of Aristotelian logic. The philosophical\ndominance of metaphysics was subsequently replaced by that of\nepistemology. \n\nTrendelenburg’s comprehensive discussion was most significant,\nand his results are typical: He was interested in the\ncharacteristica universalis as a tool for knowledge\nrepresentation, although he stressed its utopian character. He had no\ninterest in the logical calculus due to a philosophical skepticism\ntowards mechanical tools. They cannot explain creativity and have no\nrelations to the predominant interest of philosophy in that time, namely\nthe fields of dynamical (temporal) logics which should help to model\nthe movement of thought (Denkbewegung). \n\nGiven the nature of Trendelenburg’s presentation of the\nLeibnizian system, his significance for the mathematical reception of\nLeibniz’s ideas in the context of the emergence of formal\nmathematics and mathematical logic in the second half of the 19th\ncentury is astonishing. Trendelenburg’s paper on Leibniz’s\nprogram of a general characteristic became a point of reference for\nlogical pioneers such as Gottlob Frege and Ernst Schröder (on\ntheir controversy cf. Peckhaus 1997, 287–296).\n \n\nThe discovery of Leibniz in mathematical logic can be shown by\nexample in the case of George Boole, the founder of the algebra of\nlogic (cf. Peckhaus 1997, 185–232; on Ernst Schröder’s\ndiscovery of Leibniz cf. ibid., 233–287). In his first writing on\nlogic, the booklet The Mathematical Analysis of Logic of 1847,\nhe gave an algebraic interpretation of traditional logic. His fame as\none of the founders of modern logic goes back to his An\nInvestigation of the Laws of Thought of 1854. According to\nBoole’s own evaluation, his main innovation was the Index Law\n(1847), later revised to the Law of Duality, also called\n“Boole’s Law”. This law expresses idempotence: \nA = AA \n\nWhat are the connections to Leibniz’s logic? Are there\nanticipations of the Boolean calculus in the work of Leibniz? One of\nthose authors looking for anticipations was Robert Leslie Ellis\n(1817–1859), who edited Francis Bacon’s Novum\nOrganon in The Works of Francis Bacon (1858–1874;\nvol. 1: 1858). During his editorial works he found a parallel to\nBoole’s Law (p. 281, footnote 1): “Mr. Boole’s\nLaws of Thought contain the first development of ideas of\nwhich the germ is to be found in Bacon and Leibnitz; to the latter of\nwhom the fundamental principle in logic a2 =\na was known.” As reference he gave Erdmann’s\nedition (Erdmann 1840, p. 130). Robert Harley (1828–1910),\nBoole’s first biographer, discussed this information in a paper\nentitled “Remarks on Boole’s Mathematical Analysis of\nLogic” (1867). He did not find the proper quote at the place\nindicated by Ellis, but he found other relevant texts. About the\nsignificance of Ellis’ remark he wrote: “Boole did not\nbecome aware of these anticipations by Leibnitz until more than twelve\nmonths after the publication of the ‘Laws of Thought,’ when\nthey were pointed out to him by R. Leslie Ellis” (p. 5). \n\nHarley’s research was taken up by the Manchester economist and\nphilosopher William Stanley Jevons (1825–1882). Jevons formulated\nhis philosophy of science, as found in the Principles of\nScience (1874), against John Stuart Mill’s\npredominant inductive logic. His alternative to inductive logic was the\n“Principle of Substitution”. He included a section\n“Anticipations of the Principle of Substitution”, which was\nenlarged in the later edition with a long discussion of Leibniz’s\nanticipations. There he expressed his thanks to Robert Adamson for the\ninformation that the Principle of Substitution can be traced back to\nLeibniz. Jevons asked what were the reasons for the long ignorance of\nLeibniz’s anticipations. Only Dutens’ edition was available\nin Owens College Library, Manchester. He regretted having overlooked\nErdmann’s edition, but noted that this was also done by other\n“most learned logicians”. \n\nFinally, John Venn (1834–1923) has to be mentioned. His\nSymbolic Logic (1881) is important for the historical\ncontextualization of the new logic. He criticized Jevons’\nstatement on the Law of Duality according to which “the late\nProfessor Boole is the only logician in modern times who has drawn\nattention to this remarkable property of logical terms” as being\nsimply false. Besides, Leibniz, Lambert, Ploucquet and Segner had\nanticipated the law “perfectly explicitly” and he had no\ndoubts “that any one better acquainted than myself with the\nLeibnitzian and Wolfian logicians could add many more such\nnotices” (Venn 1881, xxxi, footnote 1). \n\nNo doubt, the new logic emerging in the second half of the 19th\ncentury was created in a Leibnizian spirit. The essentials of\nLeibniz’s logical and metaphysical program and of his ideas\nconcerning a logical calculus were available at least since the 1840s.\nErdmann’s edition of the philosophical works and\nTrendelenburg’s presentation of Leibniz’s semiotics were\nthe most important steps towards the further reception of Leibnizian\nideas among mathematical logicians at the end of the 19th century. As\nsoon as these logicians became aware of Leibniz’s ideas, they\nrecognized Leibniz’s congenial affinity and accepted his\npriority. But the logical systems had basically been already\nestablished. Therefore there was no initial influence of Leibniz on the\nemergence of modern logic in the second half of the 19th century.","contact.mail":"volker.peckhaus@upb.de","contact.domain":"upb.de"}]
