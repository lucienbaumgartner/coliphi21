But many of\nhis books explaining Aristotle’s Organon (the\ncollection of Aristotle’s writings on logic and related\nsubjects) have survived, and the number of them available in Western\ntranslations is increasing steadily.  For general information on\nal-Fārābī see the entry on\n Al-Farabi.\n\n\nAl-Fārābī studies the various roles of language in\nhuman life and society.  He emphasises the use of language to convey\ninformation, to ask questions and resolve disagreements, and to\ndescribe distinctions and classifications.  He believes that language\nin some sense copies meanings, and that mismatches between language\nand meanings need to be avoided.  He presents Aristotle’s logic\nas a collection of methods for exercising persuasion, regulating\ndebate, discovering truth and achieving certainty.  He also explores\nits applications in poetry.  Along the way he makes many acute\nobservations on issues ranging from the sources of metaphysical\nquestions to the temporal structure of events and the relationship\nbetween poetry and music.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Fārābī’s surviving works contain well over a\nthousand pages that are devoted to explaining the contents of\nAristotle’s logical writings and aimed at educated readers of\nArabic. Much of this material reveals al-Fārābī’s\nstrong interest in the nature of language. \nAl-Fārābī’s intellectual background was not so\nmuch Aristotle himself. Rather it was the Aristotelian part of the\nsyllabus of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy that flourished in\nAlexandria (in Egypt) in the fifth and sixth centuries (see\nD’Ancona 2017). Al-Fārābī tells us that\neventually “instruction was moved from Alexandria to\nAntioch” (in Syria), until the last members of the school\nscattered “taking their books with them”. He says that he\nhimself studied with one of these last members,\nYūḥannā bin Ḥaylān, and together they read\nAristotle up to the end of Posterior Analytics. He adds that\nthe Alexandrian school came to describe the part of Aristotle’s\nOrganon from modal logic onwards as “the part that is\nnot read”, since under the Christians the modal material had\nbeen kept hidden. (Al-Fārābī’s account is in a\nlost work quoted by the historian Ibn Abī Usaybi‘a\n[‘Uyūn 604f]; see the translation in Fakhry 2002:\n159.) \nAl-Fārābī has oversimplified the history (see Lameer\n1997 and Watt 2008). But he correctly implies that his understanding\nof Aristotle is based on the Alexandrian syllabus and its later\noffshoots in the Middle East. For example, the account of logic in his\ninfluential [Catalogue] has been shown to be an edited\ntranslation of a work from the Neoplatonic teaching\n materials.[1]\n So for understanding al-Fārābī it becomes important to\nknow when he is giving his own considered view and when he is merely\npassing on parts of the Alexandrian syllabus. As yet there is no\nconsensus about this, or about the order in which he wrote his\nworks. \nThe Alexandrian Neoplatonists saw philosophy as an avenue by which we\ncan achieve happiness through knowledge of The One (see Wildberg\n2016). To add intellectual rigor to this mystical endeavor they\nincluded the logical writings of Aristotle in the early stages of\ntheir teaching syllabus. They devised a body of introductory texts to\nexplain how Aristotle’s logic saves us from incorrect thinking\nand acting, and why Aristotle devised his logic syllabus—his\nOrganon—in the form that he gave\n it.[2]\n Some features of al-Fārābī’s presentation are\nmost easily explained in terms of the Alexandrians. For example, the\nAristotelian part of their syllabus, after Porphyry’s\nEisagoge, began with Aristotle’s Categories,\nso al-Fārābī duly seeks reasons why categories are an\nessential first step in logic. Their Organon also included\nAristotle’s Rhetoric and his Poetics; so\nal-Fārābī explains why the arts of rhetoric and poetry\nare really parts of logic. If their Organon had contained a\nbook on music, al-Fārābī would have explained why\nmusical theory is a branch of\n logic.[3]\n (On music see\n Section 10\n below.) \nAl-Fārābī’s logical writings take various forms.\nSome of them are Long Commentaries on works of Aristotle, which\ndissect Aristotle’s text in sometimes excruciating detail; only\nthe Long Commentary on De Interpretatione survives in full,\nthough we have parts of others. More friendly are the Epitomes, in\nwhich al-Fārābī rewrites works in the Organon\nfrom his own point of view. There are also a number of texts that\nserve as introductions to the Organon, though they are not\nnecessarily elementary. We call attention to three works in this last\ngroup. The first, [Indication], teaches that logic is the art\nof making correct discriminations, and hence is the key to happiness\nin life as a whole. It also explains that we must study language\nbefore we study logic. The second, [Expressions], is a sequel\nto [Indication] and introduces the vocabulary of logic.  \nThe third work is the extraordinarily original and insightful\n[Letters], which weaves together language, logic, and\nmetaphysics. We will take this work as the best basis for\nunderstanding al-Fārābī’s overall view of\nlanguage and logic. Sections 2 to 5 below will review what we take to\nbe the core of this view. The remaining\n Sections 6 to 10\n will pick up particular themes. \nBesides the Alexandrian material, al-Fārābī was able to\ncall on highly professional Arabic translations of the books of the\nOrganon. He also had translations of some logical writers\nfrom the Roman Empire, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius. He is not known to have made any use of earlier Arabic\ntexts relating to logic, such as the Logic of Ibn\nal-Muqaffa‘ and writings of al-Kindī. (Zimmermann [1981:\nlxviii–xcviii] and Lameer [1994: Chapter 1] discuss what earlier\nlogical writings were available to al-Fārābī. See also\nWalzer [1962: 129–136] for al-Fārābī’s\nsources on Aristotle’s poetics.) \nAl-Fārābī’s work on logic and language had a\ndirect effect on several Arabic authors in the two hundred years after\nhis\n death.[4]\n These include Ibn Bājja (Avempace), Ibn Sīnā\n(Avicenna), Al-Ghazālī (Algazel), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes).\nHe also influenced a number of medieval Jewish authors including\nMaimonides. The Latins knew him as Alfarabius or Alpharabius or\nAbunaser. His influence can be seen in Scholastic treatments of\ndeterminism, poetic argument, and the classification of sciences, and\nprobably also in ampliation. \nAl-Fārābī describes how a language develops within a\ncommunity. In [Letters] (114, 115) 134.16–135.14 he\npictures a community whose members have concepts\n(ma‘qūlāt, literally “intellected\nthings”, or “intelligibles” in Scholastic\nterminology) that allow them to pick out identifiable objects in the\nexternal world, either individually or as kinds of thing. He refers to\nthese concepts drawn from perception of the external world as\n“primary concepts”. These people have beliefs, and they\nare able to reason about the world, to deliberate about their actions,\nand to communicate by pointing. But as yet these people have no\nlanguage. \nThe first development towards language is that the people come to\nrealize that they can communicate their needs to each other better if\nthey agree to label some objects and concepts with vocal sounds. This\nsets up a conventional correlation between simple (i.e., uncompounded)\nprimary concepts and words, and eventually this correlation comes to\nbe accepted by the whole community. The words are said to\n“signify” the concepts to which they are correlated.\nAl-Fārābī envisages that a lawmaker will regulate the\ncorrelation and add some words to it for the benefit of the community\n([Letters] (120) 138.4–8). Thus a national lexicon is\ncreated; the sounds that are used form a national alphabet.  \nOnce the idea has become established that words signify meanings, the\ncommunity will aim to develop the language so that words imitate the\n“ordering” or “regime”\n(intiẓām) of the primary concepts\n([Letters] (122) 139.2–4). This regime includes any\nrelationships that the concepts have as concepts. For example, two\nconcepts may be similar; so an effort will be made to find a pair of\nsimilar words to express these concepts. Al-Fārābī\nnotes that this effort may misfire and result in homonymy—a\nsingle word being used for two different concepts ([Letters]\n(124) 140.8–10). The pressure to copy similarities also leads to\nmetaphors ([Letters] (127) 141.10). \nAlso some concepts are derived from others; the word for the derived\nconcept should be grammatically derived from the word for the other\nconcept. The words for underived concepts should not be grammatically\nderived. Al-Fārābī notes that in practice this\ncorrelation sometimes fails. For example, he takes it that the\nparticiple “living” (ḥayy) is derived, but\nit is sometimes used to signify the underived concept\n“animal” ([Letters] (26) 74.16, (36) 81.18f).\nLikewise the underived concept “is” is sometimes signified\nby the derived passive participle mawjūd\n([Letters] (84) 113.9). \nAlso concepts can be combined into compound concepts, and this\npossibility will be copied in the language too. ([Letters]\n(126) 140.20–141.3.) Taking this view, al-Fārābī\nmakes a number of remarks that contain the first explicit formulations\nof the thesis of\n compositionality.[5] \nAl-Fārābī clearly believes that mismatches between\nwords and concepts are a bad thing, but it’s less clear why he\nbelieves this, or what he thinks should be done about it. The original\nmatching was set up by an artless consensus of the community,\npresumably because it served some social purpose.\nAl-Fārābī never analyses in detail what this purpose\nmight be, or, for example, how it would be damaged by using derived\nwords for underived concepts. Does he really fear that a mismatch\ncould lead to a breakdown in communication, even if the whole\ncommunity adopts the mismatch? Germann (2015/6: 138f) has suggested\nthat his fear is more specific: he worries that if mismatches develop,\nteachers—including philosophy teachers—may be unable to\npass information reliably to their students.  \nAnother possibility is that he is afraid that a mismatch will cause\nerrors in logical reasoning, because the relationships between\nconcepts that make an argument valid will not be visible in the\ncorresponding words. In [Expressions] 102.8–15, after\ntelling us that demonstrations and syllogisms take place in internal\nspeech, not external, he comments that \nmost students don’t have the ability to imagine how concepts are\nordered in the mind, so instead one takes expressions that signify the\nconcepts, so as to enable the student’s mind to make a\ntransition from them to the concepts.  \nAny mismatch between concepts and words could disrupt this process.\n \nIn any event, al-Fārābī is in no hurry to reform the\nlanguage. He is content to continue using the word\nmawjūd for “is”.  \nThere is one part of the regime of primary concepts that\nal-Fārābī never suggests that language should\nreplicate. Some concepts are more inclusive than others; for example,\n“animal” is more inclusive than “human”.\nFollowing one reading of Aristotle, al-Fārābī believes\nthat there are ten maximally inclusive simple primary concepts\n(ignoring “thing”, “concept”,\n“one”, and “being” which include all\nconcepts). He refers to these ten concepts as “categories”\n(maqūlāt, not to be confused with\nma‘qūlāt above). But we will prefer to call\nthem by their alternative name “supreme genera”, because\nal-Fārābī confusingly also applies the name\n“category” to all simple primary concepts. Languages do\ndistinguish the minimally inclusive concepts, those that apply to just\none thing, by using proper names for them. But it’s unrealistic\nto expect languages to copy the rest of this regime of inclusions, and\nwe know of no place where al-Fārābī suggests that it\nshould. \nSome of the historical processes mentioned above will have the effect\nof making people think about the primary concepts and their regime.\nAl-Fārābī points out that as a result, people will now\nhave concepts that classify concepts in the soul rather than\nidentifiable objects in the external world. So these are a new kind of\nconcept, and al-Fārābī calls them “secondary\nconcepts” (often translated as “second\nintelligibles”). Thinking about secondary concepts will give us\n“tertiary concepts”, and so on to infinity. As examples of\nsecondary concepts, al-Fārābī mentions\n“genus”, “species”, “more/less\ninclusive”, “known”, “concept”. (All\nthis is in [Letters] (7,8)\n 64.9–65.8.)[6] \nAlthough al-Fārābī doesn’t recommend any\nparticular reforms of language, he does make some detailed\nrecommendations for a philosopher who is seeking to translate\nphilosophy from another language and needs to introduce technical\nterms for the purpose. ([Letters] (155) 157.19–158.21.)\nIt would be interesting to compare al-Fārābī’s\nrecommendations with his own practice, if we could be sure which of\nthe technical terms used for translating Greek writers we can credit\nto\n him.[7] \nHe does introduce some new names for notions that he himself\npioneered. Three noteworthy examples are:  \nAl-Fārābī’s tale of the origins of language runs\non into a tale of how language makes it possible to handle concepts in\nnew ways. For al-Fārābī one key difference between\nlanguage and concepts is that language is public and allows\ncommunication between people. Hence many of the new uses of concepts\nhave to do with social interaction. In each case he is interested in\nthe development of new skills for handling concepts. Skills involve\ninstruments and rules for handling these instruments; so the\nappearance of a new skill involves an acceptance of the rules\n(qawānīn, singular qānūn) for\nhandling its instruments. A bundle of associated skills and their\nrules is called an “art”\n(ṣinā‘a).  \nThe first new art that he calls attention to is rhetoric\n(khiṭāba), the art of the orator, which uses\nconcepts in order to persuade people to do or believe certain things.\nThe main users of this skill are political and religious leaders, who\nemploy it in order to assert their authority. Alongside rhetoric\nal-Fārābī mentions the art of poetry\n(shi‘r), which uses concepts in order to bring people\nto certain states of mind. He sees this art as most useful for\nreligious leaders. He also mentions an art which he calls the art of\nsophistry. This art embodies the skill of producing bad arguments from\nfalse premises. It’s hard to see what could have led him to the\nconclusion that there is such an art, beyond the fact that the\nAlexandrian syllabus contained, wedged between a book on dialectical\nmethods and one on rhetorical methods, Aristotle’s treatise\nSophistical Refutations. Aristotle’s treatise is\nusually understood to be teaching the art of detecting and refuting\nbad arguments, not that of creating them!  \nOne effect of the introduction of language is that people are able to\nlearn the opinions of other people. They will inevitably discover that\nsome people disagree with them, not least in speculations about the\nnature of the universe. So the art of dialectics or debate\n(jadal) is introduced in order to resolve differences of\nopinion between two people. ([Letters] (140,141)\n150.2–151.7.) But a dialectical resolution of a disagreement is\nno guarantee of the truth of the agreed conclusion; one of the\ndebaters might just be better at arguing ([Debate]\n40.9–13).  \nA realization that dialectics doesn’t lead to certain truth will\ninspire some individuals to seek other methods that do. At this point\nthe community discovers the art of “demonstration”\n(burhān), which establishes truths with certainty.\nAl-Fārābī believes that among the Greeks this art was\nachieved by Plato: \nPlato was the first to be aware of the demonstrative methods and to\ndistinguish them from the dialectical, sophistical, rhetorical, and\npoetical methods. But from his point of view they were distinguished\nin use and according to matter, and in terms of what guidance he\nreceived from his considerations at leisure and his superior natural\nintelligence. He didn’t prescribe universal rules for them.\nAfterwards Aristotle did prescribe such rules in his book\nPosterior Analytics. ([Rhetoric] 55.13–17) \nIt was a Neoplatonic commonplace that the high point of logic was\nPosterior Analytics with its treatment of knowledge with\ncertainty. The Neoplatonists also considered that Aristotle had\narranged his Organon so that the path up to this summit\nthrough Categories, De Interpretatione, and\nPrior Analytics assembled the tools of logic, and the\ndownward slope from Posterior Analytics onwards allowed the\nstudent to apply these tools within demonstrative methods, dialectical\nmethods, sophistical methods, rhetorical methods, and poetic methods\nin turn.  \nIn\n Section 7\n below we will return to the question what al-Fārābī\nthought Aristotle had contributed to the art of demonstration. For the\npresent we take up al-Fārābī’s point that all\nthese methods involve skills in operating the appropriate rules, and\nthat these rules come to be accepted by the community. \nIn the case of dialectical and demonstrative methods, the aim is to\nreach either agreement on the facts, or certainty about the facts. In\nboth these cases the rules must include rules of inference, like the\nrules of syllogism which Aristotle codified in Prior\nAnalytics. But all the methods, even the non-inferential ones,\nmust also have rules about what to adopt as starting premises. In the\ncase of rhetoric, practicality implies that the orator should choose\npremises that the audience will accept; likewise in dialectics it\nmakes sense to start with premises that have some plausibility.\nAl-Fārābī believes that in practice the community will\ninsist on restrictions that add a note of objectivity: for example,\nthat experts agree to the premise, or that nobody positively disagrees\nwith it. He formulates some conditions along these lines, including\nthat the premises must be at least “standard”\n(masshūr) or “received”\n(maqbūl). (For discussion of such conditions and where\nthey apply, see Aouad 1992 and Black 1990: Chapter 5A.) \nAt several points al-Fārābī mentions Islamic juridical\n(fiqhī) discussions; in [Syllogism]\n54.5–64.13 he undertakes to show that they can be reduced to\nAristotelian syllogisms. He places them with rhetoric rather than with\ndialectic ([Commentary on Prior Analytics]\n 510.24–511).[9]\n But a comparison between fiqh and\nal-Fārābī’s dialectic makes better sense, as for\nexample in Gyekye (1989) and Young (2017: 539–543). \nAl-Fārābī has explained that language grew out of a\nneed to communicate requests. Requests and questions of various kinds\nare a central feature of his thinking. At [Debate] 43.2f he\ndistinguishes two main kinds of request: those that are requests for a\ncommitment, and those that are requests for knowledge or information.\nThis division corresponds to the roles of questions in debate and in\nscience respectively. We begin with debate. \nAl-Fārābī cites Aristotle as saying that the primary\naim in debate is to refute proposed views; reaching agreement is a\nsecondary aim ([Debate] 14.7–9). Accordingly the rules\nof debate provide that one of the debaters, known as the\n“questioner” (sā’il), has the role of\nrefuting the views offered by the other debater (the\n“responder”, mujīb). It’s also the\nquestioner’s task to elicit from the responder commitments to\nstatements. (Committing is called “conceding” or\n“submitting”, taslīm.) The questioner must\nthen try to refute these statements and the responder must try to\ndefend them. The questioner elicits a commitment by presenting to the\nresponder a pair of incompatible possibilities, and the responder must\nchoose which possibility to defend. This pair of incompatible\npossibilities is referred to as “what was sought after”\n(maṭlūb, in Latin quaesitum), or the\n“question” (mas’ala).  \nThe simplest case is where the questioner requires the responder to\ncommit to a view on whether some primary concept is instantiated in\nthe world. For example, “Is there or is there not a\nvacuum?” More complicated, because it combines two concepts, is\na question like “Is the sky spherical or not?” More\nbizarre, “Stone and human, which of the two is animal?”\n([Debate] 43.16–20) When the responder has made a\ncommitment, the questioner must devise a syllogism whose conclusion\ncontradicts the commitment, and then attempt to get the responder to\ncommit to the premises of this syllogism and to its validity. The\nresponder is allowed to challenge on any of these points, whereupon\nthe two participants swap roles.  \nAl-Fārābī comments that the rules of debate have been\nfound useful for other purposes besides resolving differences of\nopinion. For example, in demonstrative science debate trains the\nparticipants to be nimble and systematic thinkers; it clears out of\nthe way sophistical nonsense, and gives prima facie conclusions that\ncan then be checked by demonstrative methods. In fact it’s not\nhumanly possible to reach philosophical truth without engaging in\ndebate. ([Debate] 29.21–38.3.) The relationship between\nquestioner and responder can serve as a template for the relationship\nof teacher to pupil, so far as this is not simply passing information\nfrom teacher to pupil. It can also be a basis for collaborative\nresearch. ([Demonstration] 77.1–83.9.) \nAl-Fārābī’s treatment of information-seeking\nquestions is strongly influenced by two contexts in which\nAristotle’s Organon uses question words. The first of\nthese is in Categories, where Aristotle (at least as\nal-Fārābī reads him) classifies primary concepts under\nthe ten supreme genera. Aristotle explains his classification partly\nthrough question words: “how much” (Arabic kam),\n“how” (kayfa), “where”\n(ayna), “when” (matā).\nAl-Fārābī takes note of most of these question words,\nand adds two more: “what” (mā) and\n“which” (ayyu) ([Letters] (166) 165.17,\n(183) 181.16.) In [Expressions] 47.5–12 he notes that\nthe answers to some of these questions can be classified by the\nquestion word or a word derived from it: “quantity”\n(kamiyya), “quality” (kayfiyya),\n“quiddity” or “whatness”\n(māhiyya). (See the discussion of these questions in\nDiebler 2005.) \nThe second context is the second book of Posterior Analytics.\nIn the opening lines of this book Aristotle lists the four\n“things that we seek”, namely that it is so (annahu\nyūjadu), why it is (li-mādhā), what it is\n(mā) and which it is (ayyu). In\n[Letters] (210) 200.16 al-Fārābī adds the\nquestion “is it the case that” (hal), which turns\nAristotle’s “that it is” into a question. \nLarge parts of both [Expressions] and [Letters] are\ndevoted to explaining how we can elicit philosophical information by\nasking these and similar\n questions.[10]\n Thus for each primary concept we can ask “What is it”?\nAl-Fārābī defines the genus (jins) of the\nconcept to be the answer to this question. By asking “which\nthing” (in that genus), we get a more specific description that\nprovides the species (naw‘) below the genus.\nAl-Fārābī explains how further questions can elicit the\ndifferentiae and the definitions of concepts. The\n“essence” (dhāt) of a concept consists of\nthe concepts included in the definition of the concept; these concepts\nin the essence are also described as “constitutive”\n(muqawwim) for the concept.  \nAl-Fārābī tries hard to convince us that the\nphilosophers’ questions are a natural extension of everyday\nquestions. (Diebler 2005 draws a plausible comparison with ordinary\nlanguage philosophy.) But the effort hardly succeeds. In what everyday\ncontext would we ask, about a date-palm, “What is it?” and\naccept the answer “It’s a body”? ([Letters]\n(167) 166.16) The outcome is that al-Fārābī\nunintentionally raises problems that are still resonant in the\nphilosophy of questions. Compare “It’s a body” with\nthe answer “[He] is a person who is over three inches\ntall” discussed by Cross and Roelofsen 2018. \nIn his [Demonstration] (64.5–7)\nal-Fārābī tells us: \nTwo arts or sciences differ through having different subjects\n(mawḍū‘). If their subjects are identical\nthen the arts or sciences are identical; if their subjects are\ndifferent then the arts or sciences are different. Their subjects can\ndiffer either by having different features (aḥwāl,\nsingular ḥāl) or in themselves.  \nThus an art or science—al-Fārābī is very little\nexercised about the difference between the two—studies some\nentities called its subjects, and it ascribes to these entities some\nfeatures. Like other Aristotelians, al-Fārābī flips\nbetween saying (for example) that the subjects of arithmetic are\nnumbers and that the subject of arithmetic is number; the two\nlocutions mean the same. \nIn [Letters] sections 11–18 al-Fārābī\nundertakes to identify several arts or sciences in these terms, namely\n“the art of logic and the sciences of nature, politics,\nmathematics and metaphysics”. The first step is to identify\ntheir subjects. In all these cases, he says, the “primary\nsubjects” are the primary concepts ([Letters] 66.20f).\nFor example, in mathematics we study primary concepts from the point\nof view of quantity, abstracting from their other features\n([Letters] (15) 67.19–68.5). (See Druart 2007 and Menn\n2008 on the important question of how metaphysics fits into this\npicture.) \nAl-Fārābī tells us what features of the primary\nconcepts are studied in logic: \nInsofar as [the primary concepts] are signified by expressions, and\ninsofar as they are universals, and insofar as they are predicates or\nsubjects, and insofar as they are defined in terms of each other, and\ninsofar as they are asked about and taken in a question about them,\nthey are logical. They are taken so as to investigate the compounds of\nthem, one with another, where the aforementioned things attach to\nthem, and the features of the compounds after they have been\ncompounded. ([Letters] (12)\n 67.1–5).[11] \nHe gives no examples, but here is one. In his book\n[Syllogism] 27.6f he claims that the following argument is a\nvalid syllogism:  \nNo stone is an animal. Some body is an animal. \nThis yields: Some body is not a stone. \nWe can paraphrase his claim:  \nThis paraphrase (*) illustrates why “predicate” and\n“subject” are listed among the logical features, and also\nwhy logic has to consider compounds of primary concepts (since the\nthree sentences express propositions, which are compounds of\nconcepts). Al-Fārābī’s reference to being\n“asked about and taken in a question about them” could\nrefer either to dialectical questions, or to the questions that\nextract information about concepts, or possibly to both. \nThe features listed as characterizing the art of logic are concepts\nthat classify other concepts, and so they are secondary concepts. This\ndistinguishes logic from mathematics and natural science. For example,\nnatural science finds causes, but these causes are “not outside\nthe categories” ([Letters] (16) 68.17). \nBy describing simple primary concepts as the “first” or\n“primary” subjects of logic, al-Fārābī\nsuggests that there might be further subjects of logic. This makes\nsense; why shouldn’t the rules of logic apply to secondary\nconcepts just as much as to primary concepts? In fact the way\nal-Fārābī has set things up would allow him to explain\nhow this should go. Laws about secondary concepts will need tertiary\nconcepts. But there is no need to restate the laws of logic using\ntertiary concepts, because “the features that attach to the\nprimary concepts are exactly the same as those that attach to the\nsecondary concepts”, and so on all the way up\n([Letters] (9) 65.16f).  \nThere is an obvious criticism of al-Fārābī’s\ndefinition of logic, namely that the features that he lists are too\nvague. For example, how could we use his list to determine whether the\nart of poetry is or is not a part of logic? The real problem is that\nfor al-Fārābī himself with his Neoplatonic heritage,\nlogic consists of whatever Aristotle said in the Organon, and\nal-Fārābī never comes near finding any abstract way of\ncharacterizing this body of\n material.[12] \nAl-Fārābī gives an even vaguer characterization of the\nsubjects of logic in his [Catalogue] (59.9–11): \nAs for the subjects of logic, about which it gives rules, they are\nconcepts insofar as expressions signify them, and expressions insofar\nas they signify concepts. \nThis definition could have been copied from a text in the Neoplatonic\ntradition. \nWe return briefly to the question why al-Fārābī\nincludes the subject of categories in a logic syllabus. Commentaries\nin the Alexandrian tradition normally started with a statement of the\npurpose of the material to be discussed.\nAl-Fārābī’s epitome [Categories] has no\nsuch statement, but the surviving fragments of the longer\n[Commentary on Categories] do address the question. They tell\nus (p. 196) that Aristotle’s Categories was intended to\ncatalogue the simple universal primary concepts, but Aristotle found\nit sufficient to catalogue the ten supreme genera instead. Some people\n(p. 202) didn’t think Categories was specifically\nintended for logic; but “under the conditions we have mentioned,\nthe contents of Categories turn out to be a specific part of\nlogic”. But in fact no such conditions have been mentioned, at\nleast in the surviving fragments. What needs to be shown is that the\nfeatures (the aḥwāl) of categories studied in the\nfirst book of the syllabus are ones that will serve some purpose in\nlater books. But this issue is not addressed at all.\nAl-Fārābī does address it in [Rhetoric]\n87.16–89.4, where he says that the terms of premises can be in\nany of the ten supreme genera, in any combination. This only confirms\nthe suspicion that the supreme genera are irrelevant to logical\nreasoning. \nIn this section we run quickly through\nal-Fārābī’s formal systems of logic. We assume\nsome knowledge of Aristotle’s syllogistics, as in Smith (2018).\nAl-Fārābī discusses four logical systems: (a)\nCategorical syllogisms, (b) hypothetical syllogisms, (c) modal\nsyllogisms, (d) demonstrative syllogisms.  \nIn [Syllogism] and [Short Syllogism]\nAl-Fārābī recognizes three figures of categorical\nsyllogisms, following\n Aristotle.[13]\n In these three figures he recognizes respectively four, four, and six valid\nmoods, exactly as listed by Smith (2018). Following Aristotle again,\nhe regards the first figure syllogisms as “perfect”, i.e.,\nself-evident and not in need of justification. For the moods in second\nand third figures he gives justifications by reduction to first\nfigure, following Aristotle in the main. (His chief departure from\nAristotle in these justifications is that he never uses proof by\nreductio ad absurdum, though he does recognize such proofs as\nvalid.) Aristotle’s justification of\n Darapti[14]\n relies on the conversion implication: from “Every B is\nan A” infer “Some A is a B”\n(cf. [Syllogism] 30.3). This implication fails to hold if we\nallow “Every B is an A” to be true when\nthere are no Bs. Accordingly al-Fārābī declares\nthat “Every B is an A” is false unless there\nis at least one B ([Categories] 124.14). Though he\nsometimes seems to forget he said this, he is the earliest logician on\nrecord as having spelled out this implication of “Every B\nis an A”. \nProbably his main difference from Aristotle in categorical syllogisms\nis his treatment of the pairs of formal premises (i.e., with letters\nfor terms) where Aristotle says “no syllogism occurs” in\nthe sense that no syllogistic conclusion follows validly.\nAl-Fārābī calls these premise-pairs\n“nonproductive” (ghayr muntij). Aristotle had\nused the fact that valid inference rules preserve truth as a means to\nproving nonproductivity of a formal premise-pair; for any proposed\nconclusion, he found nouns that could be put for the letters, in such\na way that the premises came out true and the conclusion false. During\nthe Roman Empire period a tendency developed for logicians to skip\nthese proofs and fall back instead on “laws of syllogism”\nthat were supposed to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a\npremise-pair to be productive (cf. Lee 1984: 119f). This was generally\na lapse from the rigor of Aristotle’s work, because the\narguments given to justify the laws of syllogism were of a poor\nstandard. Though al-Fārābī does once briefly mention\nAristotle’s counterexample method ([Syllogism]\n20.2–5), in practice he relies entirely on the laws of\nsyllogism. By contrast the earlier logic texts of Paul the Persian and\nIbn al-Muqaffa‘, both heirs of the Alexandrian view, copied\nAristotle’s nonproductivity proofs in categorical logic with\ntotal formal rigor.  \nFor further discussion of al-Fārābī’s categorical\nsyllogisms, see Lameer (1994: Chapters II–IV) and\nRescher’s translation of [Short Syllogism]. \nA hypothetical sentence consists of two shorter sentences joined\ntogether, as in the connected (muttaṣil) form “If\np then q” or the separated\n(munfaṣil) form “Either p or\nq”. For the logic of these sentences,\nal-Fārābī confines his attention almost entirely to\nsimple inferences like modus ponens: \nIf this visible thing is a human, then it is an animal; but it is a\nhuman. Therefore it is an animal. \nor an inference with exclusive disjunction: \nThis number is either even or odd; but it is even. Therefore it is not\nodd. \nHis treatment is so similar to the contents of Boethius’ De\nSyllogismis Hypotheticis that they must have drawn on a common\nsource, possibly Galen’s now lost De Demonstratione.\n \nAl-Fārābī points out that hypothetical sentences can be\nchained so as to form “compound syllogisms”, as for\nexample in \nEither p or q. If p then not r. If not\nr then s. If s then t. Not t.\nTherefore q.  \nThis formalizes an argument at his [Short Syllogism]\n90.6–9. He also gives examples of categorical syllogisms chained\ntogether—though these can be found already in Aristotle.  \nThere is almost no mention of modal syllogisms in any of\nal-Fārābī’s surviving works. He must have\ndiscussed modal syllogisms in his [Commentary on Prior\nAnalytics]; but the relevant part of this work is lost and we\nhave to rely on citations by Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides. These\ncitations between them tell us of only one modal syllogistic mood that\nal-Fārābī either accepted or\n rejected.[15] \nFrom [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 193.3–19 and\nquotations in Maimonides, we know that al-Fārābī\nclaimed, against Galen, that logic with possibility statements is\nuseful in practical arts where actual outcomes have to be predicted,\nsuch as medicine, agriculture, and navigation (Schacht & Meyerhof\n1937: 67). This looks at first sight like a confusion between\npossibility and probability. But more likely al-Fārābī\nbelieved that the laws of modal logic could be tweaked so as to work\nwith “Probably” in place of a modal operator. In fact\nal-Fārābī does say at [Demonstration]\n44.20–22 that in many of the arts, “Necessarily every\nA is a B” and “Most As are\nBs” are treated as equivalent. (But wouldn’t this\ncorrelate “Probably” with “Necessarily” rather\nthan “Possibly”? Al-Fārābī is not here to\nanswer the question.) \nThere is further evidence of al-Fārābī experimenting\nwith other sentence forms in modal logic. Both Avicenna (Street 2001)\nand Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maqālāt 102.13f) cite\nal-Fārābī as considering syllogistic premises\ncontaining “insofar as”, for example, “Every\nA can be a B insofar as it is a B”.  \nFrom Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maqālāt 129.11–17)\nwe also know that al-Fārābī observed that to get the\nsyllogism \nEvery C is a possible B. Every B is a possible\nA. \nTherefore every C is a possible A. \n(a form that Aristotle accepted as perfect) we need that “Every\nB” in the second premise means “Every possible\nB”; otherwise the Cs might be possible Bs\nbut not actual Bs, so that they would escape the quantifier of\nthe second premise, and hence violate the dictum de omni. In\nthis sense al-Fārābī introduced ampliation to the\npossible in possibility sentences. \nExactly what al-Fārābī meant by the dictum de\nomni is hard to make out from Averroes’ account. But\nal-Fārābī’s use of it seems to contain an attempt\nto give a set-theoretic justification of\n Barbara[16]\n in modal contexts. Another quotation from Averroes (Ibn Rushd,\nMaqālāt 154.18f) shows al-Fārābī\nusing the dictum de omni (again presumably a set-theoretic\nargument) to justify a syllogism where the major premise has a\nnegative subject: \nA sculpture is not an animal. What is not an animal is not a\nhuman. \nTherefore a sculpture is not a human. \nThis is\n Celarent (see footnote 16)\n but with the middle term made negative. \nWe saw in\n Section 3\n above that al-Fārābī believed Aristotle had prescribed\nuniversal rules for demonstrative reasoning in his Posterior\nAnalytics. But apart from some discussion of techniques for\nfinding definitions, the only rules that al-Fārābī\noffers us in [Demonstration] are categorical syllogisms in\nmood Barbara with extra pieces clamped on. (These are in the\nsection [Demonstration] 33.1–39.4; they are quoted in\nHasnawi & Hodges 2016.) \nThis is disappointing, but at least it’s clear where the extra\npieces come from. Demonstrative reasoning gives knowledge with\ncertainty, and in [Certainty] al-Fārābī writes\ndown some necessary and sufficient conditions for certainty. (These\n“conditions of certainty” are listed by\nLópez-Farjeat 2018 and discussed by Black 2006.) The condition\nthat is relevant here is the last one: \nIf the previous conditions hold, it is not accidental that they\ndo. \n([Certainty] 100.18.) In other words they hold by reason of\nessence. Also in a discussion of demonstration in\n[Attainment] 51.15–52.17 al-Fārābī tells\nus that demonstration must proceed from some primary concepts, and the\nconcepts in question are those that are answers to the questions\n“what”, “by what”, “how”,\n“from what”, and “for what”. These are not\nexactly the questions listed in\n Section 4.2 above,\n but they are clearly in that territory. Again they indicate that a\ndemonstration should follow from the constitutive properties of the\nsubjects under discussion, i.e., from their essences.  \nSuppose we have constitutive properties of A and B which\nbetween them ensure that every A is a B, and likewise\nconstitutive properties which ensure that every B is a\nC. Then by Barbara we know that every A is a\nC; but for demonstrative certainty we want “Every\nA is a C” to be ensured by the constitutive\nproperties of A and C. Some of\nal-Fārābī’s syllogisms confirm that this is so,\nconsidering different kinds of constitutive\n property.[17 ]\n In some other cases the constitutive properties fail to yield the\nrequired sentences, and al-Fārābī comments that the\nsyllogism gives fact but not cause. Exactly why he chooses the cases\nthat he does is not clear. \nThe outcome is hardly a satisfactory theory. Galston (1981) offers\nreasons for thinking that al-Fārābī may have considered\ndemonstrative proofs a distant ideal, to be reached only after a\nsubstantial amount of work at the dialectical\n level.[18] \nAl-Fārābī’s most sophisticated definition of\nsyllogism is at [Expressions] 100.3–5: a syllogism\nis \nthings that are arranged in the mind in an order\n(tartīb) such that when the things have been put in this\norder, the mind as a result finds itself unavoidably looking down at\nsomething else of which it was ignorant before, so that it knows it\nnow, and thus the mind is equipped to submit to the thing it looked\ndown at, just as if it [already] knew that thing. \nThe reference to “order” must owe something to\nAristotle’s remark at Topics 156a22–26 that in a\ndebate, the questioner can sometimes hoodwink the responder by asking\nthe questions in the wrong order. But by bringing the notion of order\ninto the definition of syllogism itself, al-Fārābī\nopens up a new chapter in logic (see Hodges 2018 on this and\nAvicenna’s development of the theme).  \nFor further illumination on al-Fārābī’s\nunderstanding of logical consequence, we need to explore what he says\nabout logical rules. At [Catalogue] 53.5–9 he tells\nus: \nThe art of logic provides in general the rules whose nature is to\nconstitute the intellect and to guide a person along the correct and\ntrue path in everything where there can be conceptual error, and the\nrules that protect and guard him against mistakes and slips and errors\nin concepts, and the rules through which one tests things in concepts\nwhere one can’t be trusted not to make an error.  \nBut these are Neoplatonic\n commonplaces.[19]\n Elsewhere al-Fārābī says deeper things about the rules\nof logic, as follows.  \nRecall from\n Section 3\n above that on al-Fārābī’s understanding, the\ncorrect methods of logic were known by the time of Plato, who had them\n“according to matter”, and it was Aristotle who\nreformulated them as “universal rules”. He very probably\nhas the same thing in mind when he says that Aristotle in Prior\nAnalytics considered declarative sentences “from the point\nof view of their composition (ta’līf) and not of\ntheir matter” ([Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n53.3f). The point he is making here becomes clear if we go back to the\nexample syllogism spelled out at\n (*) in Section 5 above.\n This is actually al-Fārābī’s second shot at this\nsyllogistic mood. In his first shot ([Syllogism] 26.11f) he\nfollowed Aristotle’s preferred style and used letters A,\nB, C in place of the “matters” stone,\nanimal, and body respectively. So a corresponding paraphrase will\nread \nHere (**) is a universal rule in the sense that it is for all\nA, B, and C; the premises and conclusion contain\nno matter and are bare compositions.  \nMallet (1994: 329–335) calls attention to a passage in\n[Analysis] 95.5–8, where al-Fārābī says\nhe will explain “how we define syllogism” and how it is\nused.  \nFirstly, it is through knowledge of the topics, which are the\nuniversal premises whose particulars (juz’iyyāt)\nare used as major premises in a syllogism and in each separate art.\n \nIf “particulars” means what it usually means in such a\ncontext, namely existentially quantified statements, then this is just\nwrong: existentially quantified statements are hardly ever major\npremises in syllogisms. But as Mallet points out, the passage makes\nsense if the “universal premises” are statements like (**)\nand their “particulars” are corresponding statements of\nthe form\n (*).\n Al-Fārābī is then saying that natural language\nsyllogisms are validated through being instances of universal rules\nstating that all arguments of a certain form are valid. If this is a\ncorrect reading, it makes al-Fārābī a formal logician\nin a strong sense. And indeed some writers have written about\nal-Fārābī’s “formalism” (Zimmermann\n1981: xl). \nHowever, there are reasons for caution. As Mallet’s paper shows,\nal-Fārābī in his further discussion of topics, both in\n[Analysis] and in [Debate], heads off in completely\ndifferent directions (which are too complex to pursue here, but see\nHasnawi 2009 and Karimullah 2014). Moreover al-Fārābī\nhas a habit of justifying inferences by reference to real-world\ninformation about their terms (i.e., their matter) that is not\ncontained in the premises. He does this with the syllogistic mood\nBaroco ([Syllogism] 27.8–12, [Short\nSyllogism] 79.5–12), and there is a one-premise example at\n[Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n 136.10.[20]\n Elsewhere he plays fast and loose with the “forms” of\narguments, for example reducing a many-premise version of induction to\na two-premise categorical syllogism without giving any indication of\nhow a string of premises are reduced to a single one\n([Syllogism] 35.14–18).  \nAl-Fārābī often refers to “universal\nrules”. But they need not be laws that can be shown to hold\nwithout exceptions. Take for example his essay [Canons],\nwhich closes (272.16) with a statement that the work has presented\n“universal rules” of poetry. The work consists mostly of\nclassifications of different types of poetry, together with\ndefinitions of terms used in analyzing poetry, and a broad comparison\nwith decorative arts. These “rules” are at best things\nthat a person who aspires to work on the theory of poetry ought to\nknow. \nIn any case the only kind of justification that\nal-Fārābī offers for logical rules is that they have\nbeen found useful for certain purposes in the community that uses them\n(cf.\n Section 3 above).\n All in all, al-Fārābī treats the formal rules of logic\nas heuristics rather than as laws of a scientific theory. A case can\nbe made for viewing al-Fārābī as one of the creators of\nwhat is now known as “informal logic”, as in the texts of\nHitchcock (2017) and Walton (1989). The pivotal role that he gives to\ndialogue places him in the same world as Walton’s book. \nAl-Fārābī defines a concept to be “true”\n(ṣādiq) if it is the same\n(bi-‘aynihi) in the external world as it is in the soul\n([Letters] (88) 116.3f) For this definition to make sense,\nthe concept need not be propositional. For example ([Letters]\n118.5f), the concept “vacuum” is not true, because it\nexists only in the mind and not in the external world (Abed [1991:\n111–115] discusses the relationship between existence and truth\nin al-Fārābī). \nAl-Fārābī quite often uses the derived causative noun\ntaṣdīq, which has a range of meanings between\n“verification” (i.e., gaining certainty that a thing is\ntrue) and “assent” (i.e., treating a thing as true).\nAl-Fārābī expounds this distinction at\n[Demonstration] 20.4–21.12. He also points to the range\nof meanings of taṣdīq at [Attainment]\n90.6f: it can occur “either through certain demonstration or\nthrough persuasion”. Presumably the certain demonstration brings\nabout verification and the persuasion brings about assent. \nAt [Expressions] 86.17–87.4 al-Fārābī\ntells us that teaching has three steps:\n“conceptualization” (taṣawwur), where we\nunderstand what the concept is and what our teacher is telling us\nabout it; taṣdīq; and “committing to\nmemory”\n (hifẓ).[21]\n [Demonstration] 80.22, in another passage on teaching, adds\nthat “We can seek taṣdīq either of simple\nthings or of compound”. For al-Fārābī a\nproposition is always compound, so he is telling us that\nnon-propositional concepts can be assented to. \nThe view that both propositions and non-propositional concepts can be\ntrue runs fairly deep in al-Fārābī’s thinking,\nalthough he recognizes that not everybody agrees with it\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 52.13f). For example,\nthis view allows him to think of definition of non-propositional\nconcepts and demonstration of propositions as overlapping procedures;\nthere can be definitions that are identical with demonstrations except\nin the order of their parts ([Demonstration]\n 47.11).[22]\n Avicenna a hundred years later found it essential to distinguish\nbetween non-propositional and propositional concepts. Provocatively he\nused al-Fārābī’s own terminology of\ntaṣawwur and taṣdīq to fix the\ndistinction; for Avicenna any concept can be conceptualized, but only\npropositions can go on to be\n verified.[23] \nA sentence can be switched between true and false by adding a negative\nparticle, for example, “It is not the case that”\n(laysa). But it matters where the negative particle is put;\nal-Fārābī discusses a number of cases, ad hoc with no\nclear overall pattern. One case that he discusses in detail is where\nthe negation is attached to a noun, as when we form the noun\n“not-just” from the noun “just”. (Adjectives\nare counted as nouns.) Following Theophrastus (Fortenbaugh et al.\n1992: 148–153) he identifies this kind of negation as\n“metathetic” (‘udūlī); he takes\nthe resulting metathetic sentence to be an affirmation, not a denial.\nNothing can be both just and not-just, but there are things that are\nneither, for example infants. So an infant is not just, but it is also\nnot not-just. For a similar reason the infant is not unjust. Also it\nis false that the infant is just, and false that it is not-just.\nLikewise it is false (rather than meaningless) that every heat is\ncurvilinear ([Categories] 125.8). (Thom 2008 steers a clear\npath through these notions.) \nBefore al-Fārābī, metathesis seems to have played\nlittle or no role in rules of inference. So an example in\nal-Fārābī with a metathetic subject term is worth\nnoting: \nIf every human is an animal, then every non-animal is a non-human. \nThis appears in his ([Analysis] 114.11f), where he introduces\nit as a topic. (The example is discussed in a forthcoming paper of\nAsadollah Fallahi on contraposition.)  \nAl-Fārābī holds that “Come here” is neither\ntrue nor false, but “You must come here”, which can be\nused in place of it (yaqūmu maqāma(hu)), is true or\nfalse ([Short De Interpretatione] 47.3–48.1). The\nreason is that the first sentence, unlike the second, has the wrong\nshape to be true or false. He could be read as saying that every\ncommand has the same meaning as some indicative sentence, but truth\nand falsehood depend on the form of words used, not just on the\nmeaning. But closer inspection shows that he uses the phrase\nyaqūmu maqāma for some quite weak equivalences\nwhere the two sentences in question definitely mean different things.\nFor example, he uses the phrase when a questioner in a debate asks a\nquestion with a metathetic affirmation in place of a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 136.6). His words for\ndifferent kinds of equivalence (for example, bi-manzila,\n“in the same role as”, which will be familiar to readers\nof Classical Arabic linguistics) deserve closer study. Having written\n[Expressions] and [Letters], he certainly deserves\nto have his prepositional phrases taken seriously. \nAt [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 89.12–100.25\nAl-Fārābī presents a distinctive view of statements\nabout the future (cf. Adamson 2006, Knuuttila 2015). In connection\nwith a future battle, the disjunction “The battle either will or\nwill not take place” is a necessary proposition and hence true.\nBut since the future is indeterminate, neither of the sentences\n“The battle will take place” and “The battle will\nnot take place” is true; moreover the lapse of truth value is\nsomething intrinsic in the world, it is not just our ignorance.\nGranted, if Allah knows that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, then it is\ntrue now that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, and this implication is a\nnecessary truth. But the necessary truth of this implication\ndoesn’t entail the necessary truth of its conclusion, and hence\nZayd still has the freedom to choose. Al-Fārābī\ndoesn’t make clear whether he is doubting the modal\ninference \nNecessarily if p then q. Necessarily p. Therefore\nnecessarily q \nor whether he is allowing that there may be restrictions on what Allah\nnecessarily knows. (Hasnawi [1985: 28f] relates this passage to Muslim\ndebates about Allah’s foreknowledge.) \nIn several works al-Fārābī analyses features of Arabic\nas a language. Some of these works contain comparisons between Arabic\nand other languages: Greek, Syriac, Persian, and Sogdian in\n[Letters], Greek and Persian in [Commentary on De\nInterpretatione], and Greek in [Expressions].\nAl-Fārābī’s comments on Greek include several\nmistranslations and dubious grammatical remarks, making it clear that\nhe didn’t read Greek (for al-Fārābī’s\nknowledge of languages see Zimmermann 1981: xlviif). Also\nal-Fārābī has a strong tendency to classify languages\nas (1) Arabic and (2) “other languages”. So these\ncomparisons are far from being a serious contribution to comparative\nlinguistics, and one asks why he includes them.  \nOn reading the comparisons, a pattern emerges.\nAl-Fārābī starts from a theory of the regime of\nconcepts (cf.\n Section 2\n above), and his chief concern is how well Arabic reflects this\nregime. The role of “other languages” is always to\nillustrate how other languages reflect the regime of concepts where\nArabic fails to do so. As Menn puts it, “in practice, his\nreconstructed Greek serves as an ideal logical language, i.e.\na language in which grammatical form always tracks logical form”\n(2008: 68). \nAl-Fārābī’s starting point is the concepts\nrequired for sentences that appear in categorical syllogisms, such\nas \nZayd is human. Every horse is animal. Some horse is not stone. \nHere “Zayd” , “horse”, “animal”,\n“stone” signify simple primary concepts; the proper name\n“Zayd” signifies a particular (juz’), and\nthe other three words signify universals (kullī).\n“Every” and “some” are quantifiers\n(sūr), and “is” is a copula\n(rābiṭ) signifying the connection between two\nprimary concepts so as to form an affirmation or a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 102.17)\nAl-Fārābī groups all these words into two classes: noun\n(ism) for those signifying primary concepts, and particle\n(ḥarf) for the remainder. (Adjectives count as nouns.)\nHe makes clear that the particles are a disparate group and need\nfurther classification ([Expressions] 42.8–12).  \nAl-Fārābī introduces a distinction between concepts\nthat apply to a thing permanently and those (called accident,\n‘araḍ) that apply only temporarily. As a result,\nconcepts have a temporal regime, and language should reflect this.\nAl-Fārābī is at his most a priori here, claiming that\nthe temporal regime of concepts should be represented by a system of\nthree tenses: past, present, and future. We don’t know whether\nhe simply failed to notice other ways in which time is represented in\nArabic grammar (for example, continuous tenses and pluperfect\nconstructions), or for some reason he dismissed these features as\nmarginal.  \nBroadly following Aristotle, al-Fārābī adds to noun and\nparticle a third class, namely verb (kalima). A verb\nsimultaneously expresses three pieces of meaning: a simple primary\nconcept, a copular linking, and a tense (and hence a time). Thus in\n“Zayd walked”, the verb “walked” expresses (i)\nthe primary concept “walking”, (ii) a linking of this\nconcept to the concept of Zayd, and (iii) a past tense.  \nIn spite of his blind spot about tenses,\nal-Fārābī’s comments on verbs in Arabic contain\nsome of his best linguistic insights. For example, he notes that since\ntenses are needed only for talking about accidents, one should not\nexpect to find a verb whose primary concept is a permanent notion such\nas “human” (insān). He tests this by\nconstructing a verb from “human”, namely\nta’annasa. By the rules of Arabic, one would understand\nit to signify something with a temporal feature, namely\n“becoming a human” ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 34.4–9). Al-Fārābī also\nuses a quite subtle linguistic argument to show that Arabic has a word\nthat can express pure tense without copula or primary concept. This is\nthe word kāna, as in “Zayd was walking”,\nzaydun kāna yamshī. We can see that there is no\ncopula in kāna, he tells us, because “Zayd is\nwalking”, zaydun yamshī, already contains a copula\nin the verb yamshī ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 42.6–18). We even find the beginnings of\nan analysis of the structure of events in\nal-Fārābī’s discussion of how the present tense\ncan signify either a point of time or an interval ([Commentary on\nDe Interpretatione] 40.3–41.18).  \nFor al-Fārābī, music theory sits on the very edge of\nbeing a syllogistic art along with rhetoric and poetry: \n… it becomes clear that [the theoretical art of music] has much\nin common with that of the scholars in the linguistic arts from the\npeople of each tongue, and has much in common with the art of rhetoric\nand the art of poetry, both of which are parts of the art of logic in\nmany things. ([Music] 173) \nThe link to poetry is clear, he tells us, given that poetry is\nperfected by being set to music. Besides this there are formal\nsimilarities: poetry is formed by concatenating letters from a finite\nalphabet, and music is formed by concatenating sounds from a finite\npalette. Al-Fārābī grants that in the case of music the\npalette is dictated by nature, whereas the letters of a national\nalphabet are adopted by convention in that nation ([Music]\n120f). But he notes that in some cultures the music accompanying a\npoem is counted as a part of the poem, and that this can be justified\nby the fact that sometimes the poetic metre is sustained by the music\nrather than the words ([Poetry]\n 91.15–17).[24] \nAl-Fārābī never considers music on its own as a\nsyllogistic art. There is an obvious reason for this, namely that\nmusic is not built of words, and syllogisms (by Aristotle’s\ndefinition which al-Fārābī cites at\n[Syllogism] 19.8) are a form of verbal discourse\n(qawl). But this requires only that the premises are verbal;\nthe conclusion, on both Aristotle’s definition and\nal-Fārābī’s own quoted in\n Section 7\n above, is simply a “thing”. Already in Aristotle the\nconclusion of a practical syllogism is an action, not a proposition.\n(Thus Aristotle, De Motu Animalium 7, 701a11: “The two\npropositions result in a conclusion which is an action”.) \nIn what sense is it true that poetry contains words that compel assent\nto something that one didn’t previously know?\nAl-Fārābī discusses this question in three essays:\n[Canons], [Poetry], and [Proportion]. In\nall of them, part of his answer is that poetry excites our imagination\nand thereby persuades us to adopt certain attitudes.  \nThis takes “syllogism” in a very weak sense. But in all\nthree works al-Fārābī also indicates that poetry\ncontains text that is “potentially” a syllogism. His only\nexamples, in [Proportion] 505.22f, yield invalid categorical\nsyllogisms in second figure, as follows (see Aouad & Schoeler\n2002): \nHis point can be teased out in several different ways; the reader may\nhave better suggestions than ours. But here at least is a reading that\nmatches al-Fārābī’s text. Consider the following\nline of Abū Tammām, in a poem written in 838 to celebrate a\nmilitary victory: \nKnowledge lies in the bright spears gleaming between two armies.\n(translated in Stetkevych 2002: 156)  \nReading this in context, we realize that the poet is telling us that\nthe weapons gave certainty through a decisive victory. Knowledge is\nwhat gives certainty. So we can expand the text by what it brings to\nmind: \nThe spears give certainty. Knowledge gives certainty. Therefore the\nspears are knowledge. \nThis is not deductive reasoning. It’s a verbalizing of thoughts\nthat the poem brings to our minds. Spelling it out, we are drawn to\nappreciate the fact that the battle resolved the situation. The text\nis an invalid syllogism in just the same way as\nal-Fārābī’s two examples above, but the fact that\nit is in second figure is really neither here nor there.  \nNote that in this case the poem provides the conclusion, not the\npremises. So it fits Black’s (1990: 226) description that\n“What appears in the finished product is not a poetic syllogism\n… but only its conclusion”. Are the hearers supposed to\nreconstruct the poet’s premises by telepathy? Black leaves the\nproblem open, but in fact it’s a problem we have met before. In\n[Syllogism] 19.10f al-Fārābī tells us that \nA syllogism is just composed to reach a quaesitum which was\npreviously defined; the quaesitum was assumed first and one\nseeks to verify it by a syllogism. \nThis applies in various contexts, for example, when the questioner in\na debate has the task of finding a syllogism to refute the\nresponder’s claim; “the enquiry is always about a\nquaesitum whose syllogism has not yet been found”\n([Debate] 45.6). In the poetical case the hearers have the\ntask of finding a middle term that generates a poetic syllogism; in\nour example the middle term is “giving certainty”. And\nagain, the premises yield the conclusion by imaginative suggestion,\nnot by deduction. \nThere remain some problems with al-Fārābī’s\naccount of poetic syllogisms. First, he never says that only the\nconclusion appears in the poem. Black (1990: 235–8) suggests\nthat the practical syllogism might be a key to understanding other\ncases.  \nSecond, why does al-Fārābī say in [Canons]\n268.15 that “poetic discourse is in all cases absolutely\nfalse”? This is a gross exaggeration, and it raises the question\nwhether a poet can really expect the audience to assent to a pack of\nlies. It seems we can handle this problem.\nAl-Fārābī’s statement in [Canons] is a\ntypical Neoplatonist soundbite, witness the Alexandrian Elias (In\nCategorias Prooemium 117.2–5): \nEither all the premises [of the syllogism] are true, making it\ndemonstrative, or they are all false and they make it poetic and\nmythic, or some are true and some are false ….  \nAl-Fārābī’s own more mature view, in\n[Proportion] 506.3f, is that \nPoetry doesn’t aim either to tell lies or not to tell them; its\naim and purpose is to arouse the imagination and the passion of the\nsoul.  \nAnd even if some blatant lies do occur, we would surely admit (though\nal-Fārābī himself never quite says it in the texts that\nwe have) that a false statement may still contain poetic truth.","contact.mail":"wilfrid.hodges@btinternet.com","contact.domain":"btinternet.com"}]
