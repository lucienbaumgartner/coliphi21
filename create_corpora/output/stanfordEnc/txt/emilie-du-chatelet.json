She married Marquis Florent-Claude de Châtelet-Lomont\nin 1725. Together they had three children, a daughter and two sons\n(the second died the year after his birth). In 1733, she met Voltaire\nwho became her lover and life-long intellectual companion. They\nretired to Du Châtelet's husband's\nestate—Cirey—which was remodeled to include a laboratory\nwith several instruments for their on-going scientific experiments. In\n1748, she became pregnant at the age of 42 with the child of her then\nlover, Jean-François de Saint-Lambert. She bore her fourth\nchild, a daughter, on 4 September 1749 and died on 10 September\n1749.\n\n\n\nIn her intellectual work, Du Châtelet focused on natural\nphilosophy, particularly that of Newton, Leibniz and Christian Wolff.\nShe knew, corresponded with, or was tutored by Pierre Louis de\nMaupertuis, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, Samuel Koenig, and several members\nof the Bernoulli family, and her advanced abilities in physics and\nmathematics made her especially able to write capably about\nNewton's physics. She thus contributed to the shift in France\naway from an acceptance of Cartesian physics and toward the embrace of\nNewtonian physics. Nonetheless, she was more than just an expositor of\nothers' works, and she was not interested in physics alone.\nIndeed, still squarely in the tradition of natural philosophy, Du\nChâtelet sought a metaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics\nshe embraced upon rejecting Cartesianism.\n\n\n\nVoltaire implicitly acknowledged her significant\ncontribution—especially on more technical material—to his\n1738 Eléments de la philosophie de Newton. For many\nyears, it was believed that there was one surviving chapter from an\notherwise lost work written by Du Châtelet—her\n“Essai sur l'optique” (ca. 1736). This chapter is housed\namong Voltaire's papers in Russia's National Library in\nSt. Petersberg. Judging from that chapter on color formation this\nearlier essay seems to have been a more developed version of the\nchapter on optics in Voltaire's book, thus indicating her significant\ncontribution to Voltaire's work. As a fascinating side note on how\ndynamic Du Châtelet studies are, in recent years fully three\ncomplete copies of her Essai have been found, one in\nBernoulli's papers in Basel (Nagel 2012) and two that have been\nacquired recently by the Musée des lettres et manuscrits in\nParis. In 1737 Du Châtelet entered a competition to explain the\nnature of fire, conducting her experiments in secret while Voltaire\nalso conducted experiments for his entry to the competition. Both Du\nChâtelet's and Voltaire's entries aimed to disprove the theory\nthat fire is a material substance, and both were published along with\nthe three winners (including the essay essay by Leonhard Euler, which\ntook the top prize). Du Châtelet returned to this project a\nnumber of times thereafter, making significant revisions to the\noriginal text as her ideas on the nature of fire matured and\nchanged.\n\n\n\nIn 1738, she published “Lettre sur les\n‘Eléments de la philosophie de\nNewton’” in the Journal des savants in which\nshe argued against those who accepted a Cartesian account of\nattraction. In 1740 she published her Institutions de\nphysique (The Foundations of Physics) ostensibly a\ntextbook in physics for her son, but in reality a highly original work\nin natural philosophy (a second edition was published in 1742 under\nthe slightly altered title Institutions physique). It was in\nthis text—her magnum opus—that she supplied the\nmetaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics she had long\naccepted. This metaphysics was Leibnizian and Wolffian in flavor. Her\ninclusion of a defense of force vive (she thus sided with\nLeibniz on this question) led to her subsequent dispute on the issue\nwith Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan. Sometime in the early 1740s she\nbegan work on her two-volume translation of and commentary on Newton's\nPrincipia. She died shortly after she completed this work,\nwhich remained unpublished until 1759. It is still the leading French\ntranslation of Newton's book.\n\n\n\nWhile Du Châtelet's primary interest was in natural\nphilosophy, she also had interests in ethics (translating of portions\nof Mandeville's Fable of the Bees), theology and the\nBible (writing a book titled Examens de la\nBible), and the source of human happiness\n(writing a semi-autobiographical book, Discours sur le\nbonheur). Her non-scientific work occasionally touched on the\nsubject of women's social roles and their education.\n\n\n\nThis entry focuses on Du Châtelet's natural philosophy,\nwhich occupied the bulk of her intellectual efforts. More specifically,\nit focuses on that aspect of her thought as found in her own clearly\narticulated version of natural philosophy—her masterwork of\n1740, The Foundations of Physics.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that Du Châtelet's interest in writing a\ntext on Newtonian physics began to form around 1736 when Voltaire was\nworking through his own ideas for a text on Newton, eventually\npublished in 1738 (Eléments de la philosophie de\nNewton). Du Châtelet's distinct advantage over\nVoltaire on this project was her superior mathematical training, given\nthat she sought out and benefitted from the tutelage of several of\nEurope's leading mathematicians. One such engagement was to have\nsignificant impact on both her own text on natural philosophy and on\nthe fate of her reputation as an original and innovative thinker. This was her\nengagement with Samuel Koenig, who arrived at Cirey in 1739 to tutor Du\nChâtelet in mathematics shortly after Du Châtelet\nbenefitted from similar tutelage under Maupertuis (Zinsser 2006,\n162). \n\nThe significant—and positive—impact upon her text on\nnatural philosophy followed from the fact that Koenig brought with him\nto France, and to Du Châtelet, the Leibnizian-inspired ideas of\nChristian Wolff. This may have contributed to a critical change in Du\nChâtelet's project, for Newtonian physics alone no longer seemed\nto her to be the correct way of explaining various features of the\nnatural world. Still, it is quite possible that Koenig's influence on\nDu Châtelet has been over-estimated, for when Du\nChâtelet's earliest version of the Institutions de\nphysique (hereafter Foundations) was approved by the\ncensor Pitot—before Du Châtelet's tutoring sessions with\nKoenig—Pitot mentioned that the text already contained ideas\nfrom\n Leibniz.[1]\n Nonetheless, in her later, published version of the\nFoundations, it is possible that she came to see more\nforcefully the need for metaphysical foundations for the phenomena\nthat Newton so powerfully describes in mathematical terms (e.g. Janik\n1982, 93 and 102). And so, in 1738, Du Châtelet withdrew her\nFoundations from imminent publication in order to massively\nredraft it. The final product, published in 1740, would include an\nIntroduction followed by ten chapters on topics of metaphysics\ntouching on issues such as the principles of knowledge (chapter 1),\nGod (2), space and time (5 and 6) and four chapters on matter and\nbodies (7 through 10). Only then does the text deal with physics of an\nessentially Newtonian character. \n\nThe significant—and negative—impact upon her reputation as\nan original and innovative thinker followed from Koenig's accusation,\nupon the publication of Du Châtelet's Foundations, that\nshe had plagiarized his ideas within the text, though given the point\nmade above, that Leibnizian ideas were already present in the text she\nwrote before Koenig's arrival, his charge seems\nmisplaced. Nonetheless, this stain upon the originality and power of\nDu Châtelet's intellect remained in some form or another until\nthe mid-twentieth century when William Barber concluded that her\nthought was “essentially derivative” of a number of her\nmale contemporaries, particularly Voltaire (Barber 1967). Others have\nargued for the originality of her views, and (Barber aside), this\ninterpretation has been the dominant one since Ira O. Wade presented\nhis careful case for her intellectual independence—again,\nparticularly from Voltaire (Wade 1947). In what follows, more evidence\nis provided in favor of the growing belief that Du Châtelet is\nnot a mere parrot of her more famous male contemporaries' views. \n\nOne way of characterizing Du Châtelet's\nFoundations is to show that it is a reaction against Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and in favor of Newtonian physics. In the main, this\nis correct. Indeed, by the time Du Châtelet turned her attention\nto the project of the Foundations, the popularity of Cartesian\nnatural philosophy was on the wane in France, the popularity of\nNewtonain physics was on the rise, and Du Châtelet was in the\nthick of these movements. Still, two facts should give us pause when\nmaking the general claim just articulated. The first is that Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and Newtonian physics have\ndifferent scopes, with the former presenting a unified system of\nmetaphysics grounding and constraining the physics that follows from\nthe metaphysics. Indeed, Du Châtelet's commitment to\ndeveloping a natural philosophy (rather than writing simply about\nphysics) required that she find an appropriate metaphysics to ground\nNewtonain physics, thus presenting a unified system to replace the (in\nher and others' view) defunct system of Descartes. \n\nThe second fact that ought to give us pause is that Du\nChâtelet was remarkably even handed and open minded about her\nreaction to various thinkers. She seems to have been swayed neither by\nnational prejudice nor by the authority of whatever great men were most\nfavored in France in her time. She prescribed being guided by truth in\none's philosophical decisions about what to adopt and what to\nreject from the various metaphysicians and physicists whose work was\nanimating intellectual circles in her time (IP Avant-Propos\nVII, X and XI). She herself was remarkably in line with this principled\napproach. So while it is true that, in the main, she rejects Cartesian\nnatural philosophy, she is still appreciative of Descartes'\nadvances in, for example, geometry, dioptrics and method (IP\nAvant-Propos V, p.\n 118).[2] \n\nOne interesting element of what could be characterized as her\nadmiration of Descartes' method is that the Foundations\nfairly closely tracks the structure of Descartes' project in his\nPrinciples of Philosophy. Both texts start with indubitable\nprinciples of knowledge, which, in the first instance, lead to\nconclusions about the metaphysics of God. These conclusions allow one\nto gain knowledge of the metaphysical structure of the world, which in\nturn grounds physical laws that allow the observer to make scientific\nsense of the world (Lascano 2011, 742–3; c.f. Zinsser 2006,\n173). This underscores at least that the two thinkers had a shared\ninterest in developing a unified natural philosophy with a well-worked\nout, and fairly robust, metaphysics detailed first. Another highly\nplausible reading of Du Châtelet's mimicking of Descartes'\nmature work is that she sees herself offering a new natural philosophy\nto replace the largely rejected Cartesian system, just as Descartes\nbefore her aimed to replace the old Scholastic natural philosophy with\nhis Principles of Philosophy. This interpretation is born out\nby a comparison of the two texts, for there are important divergences\nbetween them, not just on the details in the metaphysics, but also on\nthe range of topics addressed. For Descartes' forays into what we\nwould now call “science” included not only astronomy and\nphysics, but planned sections on living bodies and on the human being,\nincluding its soul, thus promising to touch on topics such as human\nhealth and morals (in keeping with his metaphor of the tree of\nphilosophy offered in the preface to the Principles). In\ncontrast, Du Châtelet's text deals exclusively with physics,\nleaving the broader array of natural philosophical topics and moral\nphilosophy left untouched. Still, the overall similarity in structure\nbetween the two texts indicates her affinity, at least with respect to\nher overall project, with Descartes. Here, we examine a few crucial\nmoments in her Foundations, underscoring how she and\nDescartes compare and contrast on these points, with an eye to showing\nsome central aspects of her own brand of natural philosophy, and some\nof the ways in which Du Châtelet fit (and did not fit) into the\nFrench Enlightenment (especially with regard to Newtonianism and\nscientific methodology). \n\nDescartes famously writes in the preface to the Principles\nthat “the whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other special sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics, and morals” (AT\nVIIIa, 14; CSM 1, 186). Metaphysics is his starting point, but\nwhat Descartes means by metaphysics, and what falls under the\nrubric of metaphysics for him, is crucial to understanding his project,\nand for understanding Du Châtelet's conceptual relation to\nhim. One of the central innovations Descartes makes in the field of\nmetaphysics is to include metaphysical claims about the mind of the\nknowing subject (Hatfield 1990, 11–17). This element of metaphysics\nleads Descartes very quickly into a discussion of first principles of\nknowledge, such as his belief that the knowing subject is capable of\nrationally intuiting further metaphysical principles because God has\nimplanted innate ideas about them within human souls. \n\nDu Châtelet's starting point—her first chapter\nof the Foundations—is also a consideration of first\nprinciples, but she starts immediately with first principles of\nknowledge, and hers are very different from Descartes'. Indeed,\nher first principles are distinctively Leibnizian and Wolffian, and\nnumber exactly two; they are the principle of contradiction (hereafter\nPC) and the principle of sufficient reason (hereafter PSR). In what\nfollows, we present some general ideas that are helpful to bear in\nmind when thinking about Du Châtelet's use of the PC and\nPSR. We then draw some important conclusions regarding these principles\nas they are found in Wolff, noting points on which Wolff departs from\nLeibniz with regard to first principles of knowledge. And finally, we\nturn to a consideration of how Du Châtelet employs these\nprinciples in her work. \n\nThere are a number of different ways of articulating the PC,\nincluding the\n following.[3] \n\n(1) equates the PC with the Principle of Identity. (3) through (5)\nbring together the Law of Non-Contradiction (hereafter LNC) and the Law\nof the Excluded Middle (hereafter LEM) within the PC. These versions of\nthe PC rely upon opposition based in contradictories. That is,\nP and ~P are mutually inconsistent and cannot be both true (LNC), and\nthey are mutually exhaustive (LEM). (6) relies upon the LNC only, and\nnot the LEM. This formulation of the PC, that is, relies upon\nopposition based in contraries. For example, “P is\nhappy”, and “P is sad” are contraries and thus\nmutually inconsistent and cannot both be true (LNC). But they are not\nmutually exhaustive, because they both can be false (and thus,\nthe LEM does not hold in these cases). The PC can be intended as a\nlogical, ontological or psychological principle. As a logical\nprinciple, the PC is about opposite assertions. As an ontological\nprinciple, the PC is about properties in a subject.\nAs a psychological principle, the PC is about what is possible and,\nespecially, impossible to believe. Finally, the PC can operate in\ndifferent realms. For example, it can operate in the realm of\nmodality, perhaps serving to pick out necessary truths.\nAlternatively, it can operate in the realm of standard areas of\nhuman inquiry, perhaps serving as the foundation of mathematics\n(but perhaps not in metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines). \n\nAs with the PC, there are different ways of articulating the PSR,\nincluding the\n following.[4] \n\nThe PSR embodies the position that everything is explainable and\nthus intelligible. The PSR can also be used to explain a number of\ndifferent things, including the coherence of a thing's\nessence, that essences have a cause, and the\nexistence of things. These points can also be captured by the\ndepiction of the PSR as the principle which accounts both for the\npossibility of things (i.e. due to the coherence of their\nessences), and for the actualization of essences (i.e. there\nis a cause of their actualization which thus brings them into\nexistence). Sometimes the PSR is taken to have a very wide\ndomain (e.g. all truths and all events), while sometimes the PSR is\ntaken to have a narrower domain. For example, the domain of the PSR is\nsometimes only events, but not truths, even while some truths (but not\nmathematical truths) can be translated into events. Or, as another\nexample, sometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be only the domain\nof contingent truths but not necessary truths.\nSometimes the domain of the PSR is taken to be all truths,\nwith the sufficient reason for the truth of necessary truths being that\ntheir negation violates the PC. There are different ways of thinking of\nthe relation between the PC and the PSR, the two most prominent being,\nfirst, that the PC and the PSR are equally fundamental, and, second,\nthat only the PC is fundamental, with the PSR either playing a role of\nsecondary importance or being derived from or proven by the PC.\nFinally, as with the PC, the PSR can operate in different realms. For\nexample, it can operate in the realm of modality, perhaps\nserving to explain contingent truths. Alternatively, it can operate in\nthe realm of standard areas of human inquiry, perhaps serving\nas the foundation of metaphysics, natural theology, physics, and many\nother disciplines (but not mathematics). \n\nAs should be clear from the above, there is no single and settled\nversion of either the PC or the PSR, different thinkers employ them\ndifferently, and sometimes a single thinker employs them differently in\ndifferent periods of their thought or in different texts and contexts.\nIn what follows, we sketch one respectable interpretation of\nWolff's use of these principles—together with notes on\nwhere he departs from Leibniz's (admittedly multi-faceted) use of\nthe principles—at least in part because Wolff's approach\ndoes seem to be fairly close to Du Châtelet's own. \n\nFor Wolff,[5] the\nPC is fundamental, and it is an innate first\nprinciple. Methodologically, Wolff starts with the psychological\nimpossibility of believing or judging that something both is and is\nnot. Wolff thus accepts version number 2 above of the PC, and he\nstarts with the first person awareness of one's psychological\ninability to not accept the PC so presented. This psychological\nawareness further reveals the logical impossibility of any proposition\nthat asserts that something is both true and false at the same time,\nand the logical impossibility of a proposition that asserts contraries\nfurther reveals the ontological fact that something cannot have\ncontrary properties.  The PC first and primary job, then, for Wolff is\nto divide impossible concepts and things—concepts and things\nthat embody a contradiction—from possible concepts and\nthings—concepts and things that do not embody a\ncontradiction. Possible concepts for Wolff include both necessary\ntruths and contingent truths.  Thus, the fundamental and first job of\nthe PC for Wolff includes the work of dividing both necessary and\ncontingent truths from impossible truths. As result, in the realm of\nmodality, the PC serves to identify not only necessary truths, but\nalso contingent truths, pace Leibniz for whom, in the realm\nof modality, the PC serves to identify necessary truths. Once\nimpossible concepts and things are isolated from the rest, the PSR\nenters to further explain aspects of possible things.  It does so in\ntwo ways. First, the PSR acts as a “principle of being” in\nthe sense that there is a sufficient reason to explain the essence of\nany possible being; there is a sufficient reason why a being's essence\nis as it is. This role for the PSR is relevant in the case of both\nnecessary beings and contingent beings, and on this point, Wolff once\nagain divergences from Leibniz in that the latter often (though not\nalways) restricts the role of the PSR to that of providing an\nexplanation for why contingent beings, though not necessary beings,\nare as they are. For Leibniz (usually), the PC explains why necessary\nbeings (and truths) are as they are. Still, the divide between Wolff\nand Leibniz on this point may be narrower than it seems, because for\nWolff, the sufficient reason why a necessary being is as it is just is\nthat the PC establishes this. The second way in which the PSR enters\nthe picture to further explain aspects of possible things for Wolff is\nthat it acts as a “principle of becoming”. In this role,\nthe PSR gives the causes or grounds for why a possible being becomes\nactual as opposed to remaining possible but non-actual. \n\nWith this general background on our two great principles in place,\ntogether with how these principles operate in Wolff (sometimes in\ncontrast with how they operate in Leibniz),  we now turn to a\nconsideration of how these principles operate in Du\nChâtelet's opening chapter of the Foundations.\nWhile we cannot here do full justice to Du Châtelet's\naccount of the first principles of knowledge, we  provide some essential\nbackground to these principles in order to set the stage for an\nevaluation of other central aspects of her natural philosophy as\npresented in the Foundations. \n\nAs with Leibniz and Wolff, Du Châtelet's two primary first\nprinciples of knowledge are the PC—‘the basic axiom upon\nwhich all truths are founded’, which is consequently the\nfoundation of all certainty (§4)—and the PSR (§8).\nThese two principles operate not by opening up a category of\nmetaphysical truths that are innate to our minds. Rather, they operate\nby giving universal (perhaps one would want to call these\ninnate)[6]procedures for delineating what is possible from what is\nimpossible, and then for determining what is necessary and what is\nactual (as opposed to non-actual) from among the range of\npossibilities. Du Châtelet's first use of the PC, then, is\ndecidedly Wolffian for its task is to separate the impossible from the\npossible. \n\nThe PC is foundational in all our thinking. At its most basic, this\nprinciple seems to be, for Du Châtelet, the principle that: for\nany proposition P, if P implies a contradiction, then P is false (5\nabove): ‘For, if one once granted that something may exist and\nnot exist at the same time, there would no longer be any\ntruth…’ (IP §4). According to Du Châtelet once\nthis principle as stated is acknowledged, one can divide claims into\nthe impossible and the possible: ‘It follows from this\n[principle] that the impossible is that which implies contradiction,\nand the possible does not imply it at all’ (IP §5). The\npossibles include the possibilities from among which God created the\nworld. \n\nBut the PC does more work for Du Châtelet than just separating\nout the possible from the impossible, and on this point, she leans more\ntoward Leibniz's use of this principle than toward Wolff's\nuse of it, for the PC secondarily divides the category of the possible\ninto truths that are necessary from those that are contingent. At this\nsecond stage, she seems to be employing a new conception of the PC. To\nshow this, we examine her way of distinguishing between necessary and\ncontingent truths. Necessary truths are ‘truths which can only be\ndetermined in a single way, for this is what is meant by the term\nnecessary’ (IP §7). Immediately after this\n(admittedly odd) definition she contrasts necessary truths with\ncontingent truths, ‘that is to say, when a thing can exist in\nvarious ways’ (IP §7), indicating that necessary truths are\nclaims about things that can exist in only one way. To use her own\nexamples to further clarify (IP §8), geometrical truths are\nnecessary because, for example, a triangle (generally conceived) can\nexist in only one way, i.e., it is a figure whose three angles added\ntogether are equal to the sum of two right angles. We cannot conceive\nof it in any other way. Conversely, truths about the posture Du\nChâtelet finds herself in are contingent because she can exist in\nmany ways, i.e., standing, sitting, lying down and so forth. Implicit\nhere is a version of the PC which states that for any proposition P if\nP is or is reducible to an identical proposition, then P\nis necessarily true (6 above, with the modality of necessity\nadded). For ‘triangle’ and ‘a figure whose three\nangles added together are equal to the sum of two right angles’\ncan be reduced to an identity statement (triangles can exist only in\nthat one way) while ‘Du Châtelet’ and ‘sitting\ndown’ cannot be reduced to an identity statement (Du\nChâtelet can exist in many other\nways).[7] A\ncrucial lesson to be drawn from her approach just outlined is that she\ntakes the human's everyday experience—including our\npsychological inability to imagine, for example, necessary geometrical\ntruths differently than how they are—as telling us something\nmetaphysically true about the world itself. That is, like Wolff, she\nstarts with a psychological rendition of the PC, but draws ontological\nconclusions from this starting point. \n\nAccording to Du Châtelet, the PSR is ‘[t]he principle on\nwhich all contingent truths depend…’ (IP §8). Given\nwhat follows, the most consistent way to interpret Du Châtelet's\nclaim here is not to assume that the PSR picks out all\ncontingent truths, for this is clearly the work of the PC (when that\nlatter principle is used to identify necessary truths, with the\nleftovers therefore being contingent). Rather, Du Châtelet seems\nquite clearly to mean that the PSR explains why the contingent truths\nthat actually obtain in the world do obtain. Thus, she seems\nto accept the second of Wolff's ways in which the PSR further explains\naspects of possible things: the PSR acts as a “principle of\nbecoming”. It also acts as a “principle of being” in\nso far as it explains essences, but it explains the essences of\ncontingent things, while the essences of necessary things are\nexplained by the PC for her (pace Wolff, but in keeping with\nLeibniz's usual approach). So, immediately after her definition of the\nPSR given above, she writes that: \n\nAccording to this interpretation of the PSR, it is the principle\nthat explains why some contingent truths actually obtain while others\ndo not (there is no sufficient reason for these others to obtain). The\nPSR is also the reason that led God to actualize this world from among the\nvarious possibilities (IP §9); that is, to reiterate the\ninterpretation offered here, it is the principle that explains why our\ncontingent universe exists rather than any number of other such\npossible, but not necessary, universes. The PSR serves as (a) the principle of\nbecoming (b) of contingent beings only. \n\nDu Châtelet indicates what the PSR requires of us as\ninvestigators of nature. In the closing sections of her chapter on the\nnature of body (§162–4), she makes clear that since full\nknowledge of contingent truths is too complex for humans to grasp\nthrough rational intuition (IP §9), we need to turn to some other\nway of learning them. But because God is bound by the PSR, we cannot\nappeal directly to his will as the ‘explanation’ of these\ntruths, and so we must turn to proximate causes rather than the\nultimate cause for explanation. We must investigate nature in order to\ntry to discern causes of effects—that is, in order to discern\nthe sufficient reason why effects obtain. Empirical observations that\nwe have of how bodies actually do operate in the actual world will\nlead the investigator to beliefs about features of bodies. These\nfeatures, however, are not taken to be certainly true as a result of\ntheir being supposedly known by introspection into our innate ideas\n(as they are for Descartes). It may be, therefore, that we are unable\nto know the sufficient reason for why actuals exist as they do exist,\nthough we surely know that there is a reason, for our\nexperience tells us that actual beings were chosen to exist rather\nthan not to exist.  But God knows the sufficient reason, and it is the\nreason why he actualized the beings that he did: “Without the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, one would no longer be able to say\nthat this universe, whose parts are so interconnected, could only be\nproduced by a supreme wisdom, for if there can be effects without\nsufficient reason, all might have been produced by accident, that is\nto say, by nothing” (IP §8, p. 129). \n\nTwo important aspects of Du Châtelet's broader philosophy are\ncaptured by this passage just quoted. The first is that she takes the\nnatural world to be a whole whose parts are systematically\ninterconnected. This natural systematicity is crucial to her\nscientific method, it sets her apart from many of her French\nEnlightenment peers, but there are nonetheless important limits to her\nwillingness to call upon systematicity in her approach to\ninvestigations of the natural world.  We address these points in\n§5 and §6 below. The second important point implicit in the\nabove-cited passage is that she clearly sides with what we would now\ncall the intellectualist side of the voluntarist-intellectualist\ndebate. Crudely, the debate centers around whether God's will or God's\nintellect takes precedence in his actions with respect to the created\nworld, including the act of creation itself. A voluntarist would say\nthat God's will takes precedence, and God could will anything to be\nthe case. Whatever he wills just would be true and\ngood because he willed it. Thus, God could have willed 2+2=5\nto be true, and it would thereby be true. Conversely, an\nintellectualist would say that God's intellect takes precedence in his\nactions with respect to creation, including creation itself. He first\nunderstands what is true and good, and then he wills that certain\nthings should attain\nbecause his intellect understands the truth and goodness of\nthem (and his benevolence guides his choice). Earlier, Du\nChâtelet wavered on how to interpret the relation between God's\nwill and intellect, but by the time she wrote the\nFoundations, she had clearly settled for the intellectualist\nside, and the PSR guides God in his choices no less than it guides\nhumans. On this point, she is squarely in opposition to Voltaire who\nsuggests that we should not search for, in his words,\n“sufficient causes” in nature for natural phenomena;\nrather we should bear in mind that the first cause of nature's\nactivities is to be referred to God's will and\n power.[8] \nIt is enough to appeal\nto this as the source of phenomena, and then leave it at that. Du\nChâtelet dissents from this approach, and not just because it\nmistakes, in her view, God's nature. Rather, it is an appeal we ought\nnot to make as scientists (IP §162), for it is an\nutterly unscientific approach to a natural problem, putting the cause\nof the phenomena wholly beyond our ability to investigate \n it.[9] \nWe return to this point in §5 below. \n\nTwo further points are of particular importance in Du Châtelet's\ndiscussion of first principle of knowledge. The first is her noting\nthat the term “principle” “has been much\nabused”, especially by “the Scholastics, who could\ndemonstrate nothing [and who] chose unintelligible words for their\nprinciples” (IP §1, p. 125). The PSR, she later tells us,\nbanishes these unintelligible principles such as “plastic\nnatures, vegetative souls” (IP §10, p. 131). Without\ndetailing how the PSR might banish such other principles, we focus on\nDu Châtelet's own conception of the sort of intelligible\nmetaphysical principle identified by the PSR, for she favors\nthe mechanical philosophy over, for example, plastic natures and\nvegetative souls. According to Du Châtelet, one must explain how\na mechanism can produce a plant relying, for example, upon an\nexplanation of how each particle of matter is able to produce the\neffect that it does (IP §10 and §12, p. 131–2) through\nsimple motion. Accounting for natural change by appeal to bits of\nmatter interacting through lawful motion and contact—but not by\nappeal to plastic natures and vegetative souls—is consistent\nwith the PSR. \n\nThe second point of particular importance in Du\nChâtelet's discussion of first principles of knowledge is\nwhat may be taken as her moderate form of nativism, in contrast with\nDescartes' much stronger form. Du Châtelet does not have the\nsort of first principles of knowledge, together with a commitment to\nvoluntarism, that lead to the doctrine of innate ideas, as we see in\nDescartes. That is, Descartes has been characterized as a voluntarist\nwho believes that God created the eternal truths through an act of\nwill; God did not understand, through an act of the intellect, that the\neternal truths just are true independently of any will, his own\nincluded. Fine details on Descartes' position with respect to the\nvoluntarist-intellectual debate aside, it is true that he does believe\nGod endowed all rational creatures with innate ideas of the eternal\ntruths such that we might all come to know their certain truth despite\nthe fact that they could have been otherwise. Du Châtelet does\nnot endorse this kind of nativism. But it is true that, unlike Locke\nfor\n example,[10]\nshe does think there are some\nuniversally held principles such as the belief that something cannot be\nand not be at the same time (PC), and to this degree, she does seem\ncommitted to some sort of nativism. But because of her requirement that\none demonstrate a contradiction (in the case of the PC) or\nthat one demonstrate the reasons one has for one's\nactions (in the case of the PSR, e.g. IP §8, p. 128–9) in\nemploying these universally-held first principles of knowledge, her\nnativism is of a different and weaker form than is Descartes'\nnativism. Hers describes innate rules of reasoning that (as we shall\nsee) can then be used to develop a metaphysics, while Descartes'\nnativism directly delivers robust metaphysical information about the\nworld. Once again, we see shall the impact of this characteristic of Du\nChâtelet's starting point upon her methodology as well as\nher understanding of the relation between physics and metaphysics. \n\nOne of Descartes' first metaphysical first principles that he\nproves is the existence and nature (as benevolent) of God. His primary\nreason for this is to call upon a benevolent God as a guarantor of the\ntruth of his clear and distinct ideas. Immediately after her\ndiscussion of her first principles of knowledge, Du Châtelet\nalso turns to metaphysical first principles that can be derived from\nthe epistemology, and she too turns to a proof for the existence and\nnature of God. But her reasons for doing so are different from\nDescartes' immediate reasons as just articulated. For Du\nChâtelet, as Marcy Lascano has rightly argued, “wanted to\nprovide a ground for physics that would explain the rational basis of\nthe workings of the universe. Proving that an eternal, good and\nrational being created the universe would provide such a ground”\n(Lascano 2011, 743). In Du Châtelet's words, “[t]he study\nof nature elevates us to the knowledge of the supreme being; this\ngreat truth is even more necessary, if possible, to good physics than\nto morality, and it ought to be the foundation and conclusion of all\nthe research we make in this science” (IP §18, p. 138). As\nshown above, Du Châtelet believes in the interconnectedness and\nsystematicity of the natural world as a whole, and she believes that\nthis is a crucial general reason why God has chosen to actualize this\nworld. And so, it seems humans do have cognitive access to\nthis sufficient reason for why God chose this world as opposed to any\nother world. In fact, Du Châtelet links the interconnectedness\nand systematicity of the natural world as a whole with perfection\n(§26), thus indicating that God's sufficient reason for his\nchoice of this world over any other possible worlds in a further\nprinciple, namely, the Principle of the Best. Du Châtelet's\nbelief in the interconnectedness and systematicity of the natural\nworld as a whole is the key to her method and physics, even though\n(as shown below) there are limits to the role that can be played in\nphysics by these metaphysical features of the world. Nonetheless,\nestablishing the existence of God as one who would choose to actualize\nsuch a world is Du Châtelet's next crucial step. \n\nWe shall not go into the details of her argument for the existence and\nnature of God (see Lascano 2011). We simply note here that hers is a\ncosmological argument for the existence of God, specifically one\nstarting from the existence in the world of contingent beings. Thus,\nher distinction between necessity and contingency as developed in her\nmaterial on the PC and the PSR, together with further use of the PSR\nin her chapter on God, lead to her particular proof for God's\nexistence.  She argues: \n\nLascano has noted the influence of both Leibniz and Locke on Du\nChâtelet's cosmological proof (Lascano 2011,\npassim). She also notes that Du Châtelet makes a similar\nmistake to one Aquinas makes in his Five Ways, in assuming that an\ninfinite chain of causes cannot simply extend into the past with no\nneed of a supermundane cause (Lascano 2011, 756). It is a shame that Du\nChâtelet's acquaintance with the ideas of Samuel Clarke\n(Hutton 2012) did not extend as far as his cosmological proof from\ncontingency to necessity for the existence of God, for if it had, then\nperhaps she would have sidestepped this error. Nonetheless, again as\nLascano points out, her proof is a notable improvement on\nLocke's, and the key point to be drawn from her discussion of\nGod is that articulated above, namely the importance to Du\nChâtelet's scientific endeavors of God and the nature of\nthe world he creates. \n\nIn the preface to the Foundations, Du Châtelet writes:\n“It is certain that there are a number of points in metaphysics\nwhich lend themselves to demonstrations just as rigorous as the\ndemonstrations of geometry, even if they are different in kind”\n(Avant-propos, XII). Du Châtelet's first\nepistemological principles thus help to establish what she takes to be\nthe certain truth of some metaphysical claims. At least two of these\nclaims, she believes, are necessarily true (see below for the kind of\nnecessity at work here). So, for example, and echoing Leibniz, because\nof the infinite divisibility of extension, and because atoms are\nextended, atoms cannot be the ultimate beings of nature; simple\nsubstances (or monads) must be such beings, and the PC establishes\nthis necessary (in Du Châtelet's mind) metaphysical\nfact (IP §121). The argument for this runs as follows. Atoms,\ndefined as indivisible, extended particles of matter are\nactually divisible, and thus their very definition, taken\ntogether with the fact of their divisibility, implies a contradiction.\nSo atoms cannot be the necessary beings out of which matter is\ncomposed; indeed, they are by definition impossible. How does Du\nChâtelet justify the claim to atoms' divisibility? She justifies\nthis claim based upon the PC: ‘there is no contradiction in the\ndivisibility of extended things,’ and atoms are extended thing\n(IP §121). Notice here, she must be relying upon a conceptual\ndivisibility rather than a physical divisibility (for atoms are\ndefined as physically indivisible), though one could bolster\nthis argument by claiming that if an atom is conceptually divisible by\nus, then it is physically divisible by an omnipotence God, and\ntherefore is in neither way indivisible. Indeed, the divisibility of\nanything—atoms or something else—that is extended\nindicates that extension is composed and not simple; it is\ncomposed out of the parts into which it can be divided (IP\n§120). So nothing extended—neither atoms nor any other\npiece of extension—can serve as the simple beings out of which\ncomposed beings are made. Only things that are unextended can serve as\nthose simple beings (IP §122). Since this conclusion follows from\nthe PC, it is a conclusion about the necessary constitution\nof the simple beings of our universe. \n\nThis introduces a further feature of Du Châtelet's PC in\naddition to those identified above. The PC, in the case of simple\nbeings, establishes both the necessary existence and\nnature of simple beings. That is, simple beings are\nnecessarily unextended (their nature), and they necessarily must exist\nso as to explain the fact of existing composed, extended\nbeings—a fact established by our experience that such composed\nbeings do indeed exist. But this is what we might call a\nhypothetical necessity (as opposed to what we might call an\nabsolute necessity). That is, these necessary facts about the\nsimple beings of our world obtain only on the hypothesis that our\nworld actually does exist. God could have not created our world, and\nhad he so chosen to not create any world, then simple beings which\nactually exist (with the nature of being unextended) need not have\nexisted at all. \n\nThis discussion of Du Châtelet's understanding of the (hypothetically) \nnecessary metaphysical constitution of the world further underscores a\npoint about her first principles of knowledge mentioned above. While\nthe fundamental metaphysical truth that only unextended beings can\nserve as the simple beings of the created world—simple beings\nout of which complex beings are made—may be repugnant to sense\nand imagination, reason (as captured by her PC in this case) demands we\nbelieve it (IP §135). But this indicates that Du \nChâtelet—like Wolff—may start with a psychological conception of\nthe PC, but (again like Wolff), she takes this psychological conception\nof the principle to indicate that there are underlying logical and\nontological truths which are the source of our psychological response\nto contradictions. So one of Du Châtelet's first\nprinciples, in this case, gives us knowledge of metaphysical essences.\nImportantly, Du Châtelet takes her conclusion that substances\nmust be simple in the way just characterized to be necessarily\ntrue on the hypothesis that God chooses to actualize our world. \n\nMoreover, she even uses her PSR to establish other claims about\nmaterial substance, claims that she also takes to be necessary in the\nsame sense of necessity that applies to simple beings (i.e. what we\nmay call \"hypothetical necessity\" above). In using the PSR, we observe the\nphenomenal facts of our actual world, and we can then posit hypotheses\nabout what must further be true of substance in order to make those\nfacts \n possible.[11]\n We see this method at work in several\nsections of the Institutions; for example, monads are active,\nshe concludes, because this would explain the brute fact of motion in\nthe phenomenal world, and she goes so far as to claim that force is\nalso necessary to the nature of matter (IP §139). At the same\ntime, precisely because things do not always move in the natural\nworld, this force must be of two kinds: active force—the source\nof motion—and passive force, or inertia—the source of rest\n(IP §142). From her letter to Maupertuis of 30 April 1738 (#122),\nwe know that she was familiar with Leibniz's work on dynamics and\nmetaphysics, having sought out his articles on the\ntopics—articles such as “The Brief Demonstration of the\nError of Descartes” and “A Specimen of Dynamics”. So\nagain, phenomena of our actual world that Leibniz details in those\npapers lead Du Châtelet to the same conclusions regarding the\nmetaphysics of substance that Leibniz reaches—namely, that the\nunextended simple substances are also internally active, as well as\nconstrained in their activity, through their possession of active and\npassive force, as this claim helps explain the phenomena of the\nnatural\n world.[12] \n\nPrecisely because the elements of matter are simple, unextended active\nmonads, what we see around us as extended must be merely phenomenal,\nand she does endorse this \n Leibnizian-Wolffian[13]\nconclusion.\nThroughout her seventh chapter “On the Elements of Body”,\nshe follows the Leibnizian tradition in concluding that metaphysical\nreality must consist in unextended monads. Consequently, what we see\nin nature as extended must be mere phenomena and not real in the\nfullest metaphysical sense. She concludes, for example, that\nphenomena, known best through sense, result from the confusion of\nsimple beings (IP §152–5), and that just as monads are\ncharacterized by active and passive force (now termed primitive\nforce), so too are phenomenal bodies to be thought of as possessing\nforce—both derivative active and passive force (IP\n§158–9). Thus, suppositions such as Newton's that the\nnatural world can be described with reference to inelastic, invisible,\nextended atoms must be suppositions not about ground floor metaphysics\nbut about the derivative physical world which is merely\nphenomenal in a broadly Leibnizian sense. This has led Linda\nJanik to helpfully characterize Du Châtelet's account of the\ncreated world as a three-tier account (Janik 1982, 106): the basic\nmetaphysical tier of unextended monads, the subvisible physical tier\nof (for Du Châtelet) extended matter which is also imbued with\nderivative force, and the visible physical tier of bodies in motion\nand at rest. Without working through the details of her picture,\nincluding the coherence or difficulties with it, what this three-tier\naccount permits is significant separation between metaphysics and\nphysics. We see this when we consider the following. We can know\nthat there is a systematic interconnection among all elements\nof the created world—the PSR, together with what we can derive\nof God's nature seem to establish this for Du Châtelet—we\ncannot always know all the details of that systematicity. Moreover, we\ncan expect that this systematicity occurs most fundamentally at the\nlevel of ground floor metaphysics—that is, among unextended\nmonads. But Du Châtelet does not spell out in detail how exactly\nthe metaphysical tier and physical tiers are related to each other\n(Iltis 1977, 36–7). And so, while the systematic\ninterconnectedness we experience at the level of phenomena—the\nrealm of physics, that is—surely has some grounding in\nmetaphysics, crucially, we cannot know many details of the connection\namong realms. While it is certainly true that there is some connection\nbetween the metaphysics and physics—for example, the force,\nwhich belongs to monads explains the brute phenomena of motion and\nrest in the physical world—physics does enjoy significant\nautonomy from metaphysics (Janik 1982, 106; Barber 1967, \n 209).[14] \nWe see the impact of\nthis on her physics in §6 below. \n\nDu Châtelet herself spent time running extensive experiments to\ngain understanding of various natural phenomena. She set up a lab at\nher estate Cirey in which she and Voltaire both undertook experiments\n(e.g. Walters 1967). Her descriptions of experiments undertaken to\ndetermine the nature and propagation of fire in her Dissertation\non the Nature and Propagation of Fire attest to this fact. She\nwas also well educated on scientific advancements of her day, most\nespecially in astronomy and physics. Her comments in the\nFoundations on scientific methodology focus primarily on her\nanalysis of the method of great astronomers and physicists. Here, we\nfocus on her explicit theorizing on the role of hypotheses in science,\nfor her views on this topic place her clearly at the start of the\nhypothetico-deductive tradition in scientific methodology. \n\nAt the close of her chapter on hypotheses, Du Châtelet’s\n writes: [15] \n\nIn this declaration, Du Châtelet establishes how out of \nstep—though not necessarily entirely to her detriment—she was\nwith her own milieu. Members of the Royal Society in Britain and\nAcademie Royale in France in the 18th century tended to\neschew the use of hypotheses, preferring what they took to be a\nscientific focus on empirical\n facts.[17]\nMoreover, Newton was seen by\nmany of his admiring contemporaries to have captured the value of the\nSocieties’ approach in his scientific practice and in his famous\n motto hypotheses non\n fingo.[18]\nAmong the most vocal\nspokespersons in eighteenth century France for this approach was none\nother than Du Châtelet’s housemate during her years spent\ndrafting the Foundations, Voltaire who, in his Elements of\nNewton’s Philosophy, contrasts Descartes and Newton along\nexactly these\n lines.[19]\nIn siding with the use of\nhypotheses, in once again lauding Descartes for this aspect of\nhis\n method,[20]\nand in suggesting that\nNewton himself makes use of hypotheses, Du Châtelet establishes\nherself as no mere mimic of ‘greater’ men of her time. The\nfact that this highly innovative chapter survives her massive rewrites\nafter her tutelage under Koenig also throws into question the doubt\ncast upon her originality by Koenig's charge of\nplagiarism. Indeed, close examination of the manuscript of what\nremains of Du Châtelet's earliest version of the\nFoundations in the Bibliothèque nationale de France\ndiscloses that her chapter on hypothesis is much more well-worked out\nthan surrounding chapters, many of which have two significantly edited\ndrafts. This indicates that she may have fairly clear ideas on this\nchapter, even while her thoughts on the rest of the first half of the\nbook are in considerable\n flux.[21] \n\nDu Châtelet distinguishes those who use hypotheses well from\nthose who use them badly, and she recognizes a third \ngroup—those who eschew the use of hypotheses altogether largely due to\nperceived misuse of them among their predecessors and contemporaries.\nAmong those who use hypotheses poorly are those working in the\nCartesian tradition and those in “the Schools” who are\nespecially guilty of spouting unintelligible jargon (IP\nAvant-Propos VIII, §55). The key downfalls of those who\nmake bad use of hypotheses are the mistakes of taking them as truth (IP\n§62–63), and of building theories and systems upon them that\nresemble “fables” and “dreams” (IP §55)\nmore than they resemble a science of nature firmly rooted in empirical\nknowledge of nature. As a consequence of previous abuse of hypotheses,\nDu Châtelet notes that many in her own century have entirely\nshied away from their use—or at least claim to have done \nso—which they regard as (quoting Newton) the “poison of\nreason and the plague of philosophy” (IP §55). Du\nChâtelet stresses that it is a mistake, however, to believe that\nhypotheses are useless in physics just because they have been abused in\nthe past (IP §63), and she suggests that hypothetical thinking is\nnot only useful, but indeed necessary; without hypotheses, almost no progress\nwould have been made in astronomy (IP Avant-Propos VIII,\n§57), and they are also valuable in physics (IP §55). She\neven goes so far as to claim “without hypotheses… there\nwould be no astronomy now” (IP §57). To bolster her case,\nshe details a few recent successes in astronomy which relied pivotally\non the use of hypotheses with theories of Copernicus (IP §57 and\n§67), Kepler (IP §58) and Huygens (IP §57 and §67)\nfeatured as evidence. Those who refuse to include hypothetical thinking\nin their scientific method are guilty of retarding the progress of\nscience no less than are those who include such thinking but do so\nbadly (IP §54). \n\nDu Châtelet believes that hypotheses are necessary\nbecause not all phenomena can be explained through reliance upon first\nprinciples alone—there is a gap between first principles and\nobserved phenomena in the world in the sense that the scientist cannot\ndeduce the cause of those phenomena directly or through chains of\ndeduction from the first principles. Neither can experiment directly\ntease out such a cause. “Hypotheses are… sometimes very\nnecessary… in all cases when we cannot discover the true reason\nfor a phenomenon and the attendant circumstances, neither a\npriori, by means of truths [identified as principles in §53]\nthat we already know, nor a posteriori, with the help of\nexperiments” (IP §60). And: “[P]hilosophers frame\nhypotheses to explain the phenomena, the cause of which cannot be\ndiscovered either by experiment or by demonstration” (IP\n§56). \n\nRecall that for Du Châtelet, these first principles include\nepistemological principles—the principles of contradiction and\nsufficient reason (IP §4 and §8). Du Châtelet writes\nthat “a hypothesis… [must] not be in contradiction with\nthe principle of sufficient reason, nor with any principles that are\nthe foundation of our knowledge” (IP §61). But, presumably,\nthe principles constraining the sorts of hypotheses the scientist can\nposit also include metaphysical principles which can be derived\ndirectly from foundational principles of knowledge. For Du\nChâtelet, as shown above, these include the three-tier\nmetaphysical account she develops, the nature of matter, and so\nforth. \n\nIn her opening comments on hypotheses, Du Châtelet writes:\n“The true causes of natural effects and of the phenomena\nwe observe are often so far from the principles on which we can rely\nand the experiments we can make that one is obliged to be content with\nprobable reasons [hypotheses] to explain them” (IP §53\nemphasis added; c.f. §56). She anticipates that these probable\nreasons aim at truth about the causal structure of the world and not\njust at an accurate description and prediction of phenomena. This is\ninteresting because this situates Du Châtelet squarely within one\nparticular tradition with respect to hypotheses. Historically, there\nhave been two key directions in which thinking about hypotheses\ndeveloped, indeed from Ancient times, and certainly throughout the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries as well. According to one \napproach—typified by Ptolemy in pre-modern thought and sometimes\nassociated with “save the phenomena” type \nexplanations—hypotheses are posited merely because they are useful\ninstruments, mere mathematical calculating devices especially useful\nfor prediction and scientific practice. The aim with hypotheses,\naccording to this approach, is not to propose a true account\nof the nature of things since reaching true conclusions about the world\nis not necessarily relevant when formulating hypotheses according to\nthis tradition which focuses more pointedly on prediction. According to\nthe second approach—typified by Aristotle in pre-modern thought\nand sometimes associated with causal explanations—hypotheses\nare posited in order to provide an explanation of how experienced\neffects might have come about. The aim is to give a true\naccount of the nature of things, especially the causal nature\nof\n things.[22]\nIn starting off her chapter\non hypotheses with a mention of “the true causes of natural\neffects”, Du Châtelet indicates her commitment to the\nAristotelian tradition vis à viz hypotheses, a point\nwhich becomes abundantly clear as her chapter on hypotheses\nproceeds. \n\nDu Châtelet thinks hypotheses are useful (in addition to their\nproviding a necessary step in scientific method) because “when a\nhypothesis is once posed, experiments are often done to ascertain if it\nis a good one, experiments which would never have been thought of\nwithout it” (IP §58). They are useful, that is, for\nsuggesting innovative experiments. Such experiments can add\nplausibility to a hypothesis if the results of them indicate that the\nhypothesis captures the truth, but a single experiment which falsifies\na hypothesis is enough to require the scientist to reject it, or at\nleast, to reject whatever part of the hypothesis is deemed faulty, for\na hypothesis “can be true in one of its parts and false in\nanother” (IP §65). As an example to explain how this might\nbe the case, she cites Descartes’ hypothesis of a vortex of fluid\nmatter being the cause of the gravitational pull of bodies to the\nearth. As an example of her remarkable open-mindedness, she rejects the\nspecifics of Descartes’ hypothesis in light of Huygen’s\ndemonstrations that it does not square with observed facts, while also\nallowing that “it cannot be legitimately concluded that a vortex,\nor several vortices, conceived of in a different way, cannot be the\ncause of these movements” (IP §65). In this case, then,\nfalsifying data requires that we invalidate only part of\nDescartes’ hypothesis. \n\nSo Du Châtelet takes an extremely friendly view of the role of\nhypothesis in scientific reasoning. Still, wary of those who make bad\nuse of hypotheses, Du Châtelet puts strict limits on their use. A\nhypothesis must “not only [explain] the phenomenon that one had\nproposed to explain with it, but also that all the consequences drawn\nfrom it agree with the observations” (IP §58). Herein, we\nhave the idea that a good hypothesis will explain a plethora of effects\nincluding many not originally under investigation. Du Châtelet\nbelieves that the more such effects that can be explained (as well as the more\nexperiments performed which turn out as predicted by the hypothesis),\nthe more probable the hypothesis is. Indeed, Du Châtelet makes\nthe very strong claim that “hypotheses finally become truths when\ntheir probability increases to such a point that one can morally\npresent them as certain” (IP §67), though the\npsychological context of the passage (“as a very great\ndegree of probability gains our assent, and has on us almost the same\neffect as certainty”) indicates that a highly probable hypothesis\nis merely highly probable and not strictly true, and \nthat Du Châtelet’s considered position\nis “that hypotheses become the poison of philosophy when they are\nmade to pass for the truth” (IP, Avant-Propos\n VIII)[23].\nAccording to Du Châtelet, part of the scientist’s job is to\n“have certain knowledge of the facts that are within our reach,\nand to know all the circumstances attendant upon the phenomena we want\nto explain… for he who would hazard a hypothesis without this\nprecaution would run the risk of seeing his explanation overthrown by\nnew facts that he had neglected to find out about” (IP §61).\nSo the scientist must become acquainted with many empirical facts so as\nto ensure that she is not ignorant of potentially falsifying data (IP\n§64). \n\nDu Châtelet’s belief that hypotheses gain strength the\nmore phenomena they explain indicates a commitment to the idea of\nsimplicity and systematicity of causes, and the orderly\ninterconnectedness of cause and effects in the created world. These\nfeatures, to recall the discussion above of her PSR, are explicitly\nassociated with the PSR, and that principle’s\nmetaphysical\n dimension.[24]\nFor not only is the PSR a\nprinciple which guides our own search for knowledge, it is a principle\nwhich guided God in his choices when creating the world (IP §23)\nwhich, as the best possible world, is “the one where the greatest\nvariety exists with the greatest order, and where the largest number of\neffects is produced by the simplest laws” (IP §28). So the\nability of hypotheses to explain a plethora of phenomena is a direct\nresult for Du Châtelet of the real systematicity of the\nworld’s causal structure\n itself.[25]\nThis point drives home the\nsuggestion made above that Du Châtelet is squarely in the\nAristotelian tradition with respect to hypotheses; hypotheses are meant\nto capture the true causal structure of our systematically\ninterconnected world, and are not only calculating or predictive\ndevices by which the scientist merely gives an accurate description of\nthe phenomena. At the same time, and we shall see this in the next section,\nthe fairly significant degree of separation between metaphysics and \nphysics mentioned at the close of the previous section will put \nstrict limits on how much the scientist can appeal to systematic\ninterconnectedness in \n physics.[26] \n\nTo conclude, let me turn to Du Châtelet’s definition of\na useful hypothesis: \n\nAt the start of this section, we mentioned that Du Châtelet is at\nthe forefront of the emergence of the embrace of the\nhypothetico-deductive in scientific explorations. Some have attributed\nsuch a method to Descartes (e.g. Lauden 1981) while others have\ndisputed this, due to his refusal to devise testing experiments and to\ntake falsifying data seriously (McMullin 1990, 44; McMullin 2008, 98;\nand Sakellariadis 1982, passim). On both points, Du\nChâtelet departs notably from Descartes due to her very\nfriendliness to this sort of engagement with the empirical.\nNonetheless, as also mentioned above, she is somewhat out of step with\nher own time precisely because of her unabashed endorsement of the\nneed for hypotheses. Moreover, her endorsement of the Aristotelian\nidea of hypotheses, and her belief in the systematic unity of the\nnatural world, shows that she also embraces there being a relation\nbetween metaphysics and physics, even while she also believes that\nthere are limits to what we can know about that relation. This is no\nsurprise given our characterization of her above as a natural\nphilosopher, a pre-modern stance despite her standing on the cusp of\nmodern conceptions of hypotheses and scientific methodology. She is\ntruly standing between two worlds, the old world of natural philosophy\nand the soon to emerge new world of modern science as we now know\nit. \n\nThe first ten chapters of the Foundations provide the\nepistemology, metaphysics and theorizing on scientific methodology\nthat is meant to provide the foundations for the remaining chapters on\nNewtonian physics. An evaluation of the success of that seemingly\nparadoxical project must await a much more sustained treatment than\ncan be given here.  Rather, in this final section of this survey of\nDu Châtelet's natural philosophy, we focus on one chapter of that\nlater material both to show ways in which the earlier chapters affect\nthose that follow, and to show the limits to the characterization of\nDu Châtelet as a metaphysical\n systematizer.[27]\n This chapter is chapter 16: On Newtonian Attraction. \n\nIn this chapter, she argues against some of Newton's followers\nwho aimed to universalize Newton's attraction. While Du\nChâtelet argues that Newton's theory of attraction is\nbetter than Descartes' vortices at explaining the effects of\ngravity, and that Newton's theory of attraction can\nsatisfactorily explain a wide range of other phenomena such as tidal\nmovements, the rotation of the earth, and irregularities in the\nmovement of the moon, she criticizes Newton's disciplines for\nextending Newton's theory of attraction too far. In one\nespecially interesting section, she focuses on the Newtonian theories\n(IP §389–92) of John Freind (1675/76–1728) and John Keill\n(1671–1721). \n\nIn §391, titled “The usage that Mss. Freind and Keill have\nmade of the principle of attraction” (notably, she discusses only\nKeill therein), she writes: \n\nAt the end of his Introductio ad veram Astronomiam\n(Introduction to the True Astronomy), Mr. Keill set several\npropositions, through which he maintains we can deduce geometrically\nthe majority of phenomena by means of this attraction, if it is\npowerful in contact. \n\nAccording to these propositions, not only are cohesion and chemical\neffects the result of attraction, but so too are the spring of bodies\nand the phenomena of electricity…. \n\nWe find the source of all these applications of attraction in the\nquestions that Mr. Newton posed at the end of his\n Optics.[28]\nThe disciples of this great\nman believed that his doubts might serve even as a basis for their\nhypotheses: but it must be admitted that some of these hypotheses\nare a bit forced and that there is a great difference in accuracy\nbetween the applications of attraction to celestial phenomena and the\nuse one makes of it in the other effects just mentioned. Also this\nuse of attraction is not as universally received by the same\nNewtonians, as the use of it when one is in fact explaining\nastronomical phenomena. (IP §391; emphasis\n added)[29] \n\nIn essence, what Du Châtelet disputes in Keill's\nuniversalization of Newton's theory of attraction is his use of\nit to explain, among other phenomena, the cohesion of bodies and their\nspring, or elasticity. To make these claims, which focus\nspecifically on features intrinsic to bodies rather than on relational\nfeatures that bodies bear, Du Châtelet believes these thinkers\nmust claim that attraction is a property of matter itself\n(IP\n §389–92).[30]\nHer mention in this passage\nof his “forced” hypotheses alerts us to the fact that she\nbelieves Keill is using hypotheses in forwarding this claim about\nmatter. As the previous section showed, she can have no quibble\nwith the fact that he uses hypotheses, yet she clearly dissents from his\nhypotheses with respect to the nature of matter and the phenomena he\nwishes to explain through this matter theory. \n\nAccording to Du Châtelet, the PSR positively rules out extending\nattraction to account for the nature of matter. How so? The argument\nseems to be that if attraction (as some sort of active\nprinciple or force) were to be inherent in bodies, then bodies would\nalways move, and yet bodies always moving is contrary to our\nexperience of the physical world. There is no sufficient\nreason—an inherent passive principle within bodies, for\nexample, to counteract the active force—to account for the brute\nfact that bodies are also sometimes at rest. So attraction cannot be\nan inherent property of matter (c.f.  IP Avant-propos\nVII). Yet for attraction to explain the cohesion of bodies, it would\nneed to be an inherent property. So attraction cannot be employed as\nthe cause of the cohesion of bodies. \n\nThree crucial points for a consideration of Du Châtelet's\nscientific method and her position between pre-modern and modern\nconceptions of natural philosophy and then science emerge from this\ndiscussion of Newtonian attraction. First, the role played by\nexperience of the world is crucial for her. If our experience (in this\ncase, the brute fact that bodies are sometimes at rest) falsifies an\nhypothesis (namely, that attraction belongs to matter), then the\nhypothesis must be rejected.  Second, while Du Châtelet accepts\nthe systematic interconnection of the created world as a feature of\nit, and as a sort of heuristic in our scientific practice, she puts\nstrict limits on the scientist's appeal to a systematic account of\nphenomena, especially in light of falsifying experience. So, while the\nuniversalizing of Newton's theory of attraction to account for a\nplethora of phenomena would represent a more interconnected physical\nsystem, this systematicity must be rejected in light of our\nexperiences of nature. Finally, while it is true that Du\nChâtelet thinks a full scientific account must try to give the\ncauses of phenomena we experience—whether those be causes in the\nbasic metaphysical tier or causes in the derivative, subvisible\nphysical tier—when scientists are unable to give a causal\naccount without violating the empirical facts of nature, then they\nought not to give such an account. So while it is true that\nDu Châtelet invokes hypotheses in her approach to natural\nphilosophy, and while it is true that in doing so, she departs\nradically from those who believe that the aim of science is to merely\ndescribe (ideally in mathematical terms) the phenomena without appeal\nto metaphysical systems underlying those phenomena, the\nparticular—indeed, very modern—flavor of her theory of\nhypotheses puts strict limits on that metaphysics. This underscores\nthe point made at the close of §4 above: there is a connection\nbetween metaphysics and physics in Du Châtelet's view, but we\nare not always able to ascertain that connection, and so, the\nscientist cannot claim systematic unity in physics when doing so runs\nroughshod over empirical data or either of her two foundational\nprinciples. While still a natural philosopher, she has taken a\ndecisive step toward modern science in her masterwork, Foundations\nof Physics.","contact.mail":"detlefse@phil.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"phil.upenn.edu"}]
