No thinker from that fertile period has been more unjustly\nneglected.  He wrote some acute and highly-regarded reviews of Kant,\nand he corresponded with Kant about the philosophy of\n mathematics.[1]\n Kant's reply to Rehberg's objections is one\nof his most important explanations of his mathematical\n doctrines.[2]\n Such, indeed, was Rehberg's grasp of Kant that\nJ.B. Jachmann, Kant's friend and biographer, regarded him as\n“the finest head among all your\n students.”[3]\n But Rehberg was much more than a Kantian epigone.  He also made an\noriginal contribution to the pantheism controversy, where he staked\nout his own position vis-à-vis Jacobi, Mendelssohn,\nHerder and Kant; and he wrote an influential critique of Reinhold's\nElementarphilosophie, which was a potent source of the\nskepticism surrounding neo-Kantian foundationalism in the early 1790s.\nAll these facts are sufficient to give Rehberg a notable, if minor,\nplace in the intellectual pantheon of his age.  They are not, however,\nthe main reason for remembering him.  \n\n\n Rehberg's historical importance lies chiefly in his critique of the\nFrench Revolution.  In the early 1790s he became renowned as its\nforemost conservative critic.  He was the chief spokesman for the\nso-called ‘Hannoverian Whigs’, a group of conservative\nwriters based in Göttingen who defended the old\nStändesstaat (i.e., a state based on the old society\nof estates) against revolutionary\n ideology.[4]\n Rehberg provided the philosophical foundations for the politics of the\nHannoverians, and he saw more clearly than they, or any other\nconservative writer of his day, the general philosophical issues\nraised by the Revolution.  The basis for his attack on revolutionary\nideology was his skeptical epistemology, which grew out of his study\nof Hume and Kant.  For all these reasons, Rehberg has been rightly\nregarded as a founding father of German\n conservatism.[5]\n\n\n In the few cases Rehberg has been recognized, his reputation has not\nbeen fairly assessed.  He has been described as “next to\nFriedrich Gentz, the ablest literary opponent of the French Revolution\nin\n Germany”.[6]\n But such a tribute does not do him full\njustice, for the comparison should really be to the advantage of\nRehberg, who was politically wiser and philosophically deeper than\nGentz.  To some scholars, Rehberg has seemed a pale German imitation\nof Edmund Burke, whose Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance became extremely popular in Germany in the early\n 1790s.[7]\n It has been indeed customary to stress the\nindebtedness of the Hannoverians to Burke, as if they were all his\nmere\n epigones.[8]\n Here again, though, Rehberg has been done\nan injustice.  He wrote his critique of the Revolution before Burke,\nand it is superior to Burke's in its philosophical content.  Although\nRehberg's writing has none of the rhetoric of Burke's, it makes up for\nits lack of style with greater substance.  Unlike Burke, Rehberg\nrealized that it was pointless to indulge in diatribe, no matter how\nflashy or brilliant, and that what was needed amid the passion and\npartisanship of revolutionary politics was sober and solid argument. \n Rehberg's early articles on the French Revolution, which were\npublished in the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung, the most\nprominent journal of the day, quickly won him a national reputation.\nIn the early 1790s, when pro-revolutionary sentiment swept through\nGermany, Rehberg stood out as an articulate spokesman for the\nconservative cause.  He seemed to show that a case could be made for\nconservatism, that it was intellectually respectable to honor the\nhistorical traditions of the old German states.  Apart from the\nimmediate effect of his early articles, Rehberg's critique of the\nRevolution had a more lasting influence, and in two basic respects.\nFirst, by criticizing the abstract idealism of the radicals, and by\nstressing the importance of historical continuity for social and\npolitical stability, Rehberg made himself an important figure in the\ndevelopment of historicism.  Second, as the close friend of Karl von\nStein, the leader of the Prussian Reform movement, Rehberg's thinking\nhad a direct effect on the politics of his age.  Though Stein and\nRehberg later fell out, Stein always acknowledged his great debts to\n Rehberg.[9] \n Rehberg was born in 1757 into a middle class Protestant family.  His\nfather was a secretary for the estates of Calenberg, one of the\nduchies of Hannover.  Although Rehberg aspired to an academic career,\nhe was foiled in his ambitions.  A plan to get him a teaching post at\nthe Berlin Ritterakademie was thwarted by no less than\nFrederick the Great, who turned him down on the grounds that royal\npractice was to hire only cooks from Hannover.  After a humiliating\nfour years teaching German to Englishmen, he became in 1783 the\nsecretary to the Duke of York, who was then bishop of Osnabrück.\nSo impressed was the Duke with Rehberg's abilities that he made him in\n1786 a secretary to the Hannoverian Geheime Ratskollegium (the\nsecret counsel).  The Ratskollegium consisted in aristocrats,\nthough its affairs were usually conducted by bourgeois secretaries\nlike Rehberg, who were denied any vote.  It was one of the tragedies\nof Rehberg's career that his onerous duties gave him little time for\nphilosophy. Hence his writings are scattered and occasional, and\nsometimes lack precision and polish.  For the same reason, he never\ngave a systematic exposition of his philosophy.   \n It was a striking curiosity of Rehberg's cultural milieu that his\nfather was a close friend of Johann Adolf Schlegel, the father of\nAugust Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel, two founding spirits of\nRomanticism.  The families would often meet, and so the little Rehberg\nwould often romp with the Schlegel kids.  As it happened, Rehberg's\nyounger sister Caroline became the first love of Friedrich Schlegel,\nwho immortalized her as Luise in his Lucinde. During one of\nthe family outings, Caroline sketched a drawing of the young Friedrich\nSchlegel, which now introduces the critical edition of his\n works.[10]\n If the Rehbergs inspired the Schlegels, the\nSchlegels did little for Rehberg.  Known for his dry, sober and\npuritanical temperament, Rehberg distrusted the self-indulgence and\nlibertinism of Romanticism.  He always kept his critical distance from\nRomanticism when it spread throughout Germany in the early 1800s.  The\nbest indicator of his attitude toward Romanticism is his review of\nsome of Adam Müller's writings, in which he deplored their\nmysticism and\n obscurantanism.[11] \n Rehberg's early interests were in philosophy and literature rather\nthan politics.  Intellectually precocious, he learned to read Greek,\nLatin, Italian, Spanish, French and English before he was fifteen.\nFrom 1774 to 1777 he attended the University of Göttingen, then\none of the main centers of intellectual life in Germany.  Finding\nlittle inspiration from the Popularphilosophie then prevalent\nin Göttingen, Rehberg resolved to educate himself, and did so by\nstudying Leibniz and Spinoza on his own.  One hallmark of Rehberg's\nintellectual character—central for his philosophy and politics—was\nhis skepticism, which he formed in his earliest years.  When he was\nonly fourteen, he had doubts about Christianity, and soon became an\nunbeliever, which he remained for the rest of his life.  His\nskepticism soon extended to metaphysics itself.  He had his doubts\nabout Leibniz and Spinoza, because their systems rested upon\nquestionable and indemonstrable first principles.  In 1779 he wrote an\nessay for a competition organized by the Berlin Academy, where he took\na skeptical position regarding metaphysics in\n general.[12]\n\nAlthough he argued that Leibniz's system was the best defense against\nSpinozism and skepticism, he also strongly suggested that it was by no\nmeans an adequate defense.  The only reason he defended Leibniz, he\nlater confessed, is that the Berlin Academy was dominated by\nLeibnizians, who would never have awarded a prize critical of their\n founder.[13]\n His real convictions were that Spinoza's\nsystem is the epitome of abstract thinking, though it suffers from\nirresolvable problems that demonstrate the inadequacies of all\n metaphysics.[14] \n Three philosophers had a formative influence on Rehberg's\nintellectual development. He greatly admired Hume, a favourite author\namong Hannoverian circles, for his\n skepticism.[15]\n It was\nfrom Hume that Rehberg most probably learned how skepticism could\nserve the cause of political conservatism.  Another crucial influence\nwas Justus Möser, so-called advocatus patriae, famed\ndefender of the Kleinstaat and seminal influence on\nhistoricism.  When Rehberg did his apprenticeship as an Hannoverian\nbureaucrat, he was sent to Osnabrück, where he met Möser,\nwho soon became his “fatherly friend”.  It was Möser\nwho taught him to appreciate the traditions and workings of the\nKleinstaat, “the basic principles of [German] civil\nsociety as they prevailed before the French\n Revolution”.[16]\n Last but not least, Rehberg's\nskepticism was greatly abetted and strengthened by his study of Kant.\nAlthough his skepticism was already ripening in the late 1770s, before\nthe publication of the first Kritik, Kant greatly assisted\nRehberg in formulating his own\n skepticism.[17]\n He fully\nendorsed Kant's critique of rationalist metaphysics, accepted his\naccount of the limits of human knowledge, and greatly admired his\nmoral philosophy.  However, for reasons we shall soon see, he took\nissue with Kant's attempt to extend his moral philosophy into the\npolitical world.   \n The basis of Rehberg's critique of the Revolution was his early\nphilosophical views, which he developed from the late 1770s to the\nearly 1790s.  It has been a mistake of traditional scholarship on\nRehberg that it attempts to compartimentalize his thought, separating\nhis philosophical and political\n thinking.[18]\n No one would\nhave been more astonished by such an artificial separation than\nRehberg himself, who, in his retrospective account of his writings in\nthe introduction to his Sämmtliche Schriften, stressed the\ncentrality of his general philosophical principles.  Apart from their\nimportance for his politics, Rehberg's early philosophical views\ndeserve attention in their own right.  Rehberg staked out a unique and\noriginal position amid the controversies of his age.   \n Like so many intellectuals who came of age in the 1780s, the young\nRehberg's intellectual landscape was formed by the pantheism\ncontroversy.  This controversy began in 1785 when Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi proclaimed in his Briefe über die Lehre von Spinoza\nto a stunned public that Lessing had been a Spinozist.  Jacobi used\nthis juicy bit of gossip to make a provocative philosophical point:\nthat all rational enquiry, of which Lessing was such a eminent\nexemplar, ends in the atheism and fatalism of Spinozism.  The only way\nto save oneself from such atheism and fatalism, Jacobi suggested, was\nto take a “salto mortale”, a leap of faith\nin a personal God and freedom.  Hence Jacobi presented his\ncontemporaries with a dilemma: either a rational atheism and\na-moralism or an irrational theism and morality.  There could be no\ncomfortable middle path: rational demonstrations of the essential\nbeliefs of morality and religion.  Jacobi's dilemma was a profound\nchallenge to the German Enlightenment or Aufklärung, whose\nultimate article of faith was that there must be some rational\nfoundation for our moral and religious beliefs.  The effect of\nJacobi's book on the German intellectual stage was like “a\nbombshell”.  Within the next year, Kant, Fichte, Herder,\nReinhold and Mendelssohn would write responses to it.  Virtually every\nyoung romantic—Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis, Hölderlin and\nSchleiermacher—would take a stand in the ensuing debate. \n The young Rehberg too was drawn into the vortex of the pantheism\ncontroversy.  Although his skepticism began in the late 1770s, he\nformulated much of his philosophy in response to the issues it raised.\nHis contribution to the controversy were his reviews of Jacobi and\nHerder in the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung, and his 1787\ntract Über das Verhältnis der Metaphysik zu der\n Religion.[19]\n In these writings Rehberg continues to\ndevelop his skepticism, which now became his settled position.  In\nthis task he was greatly assisted by his close study of Kant's\ncritical philosophy.  Rehberg agreed with some of Kant's central\ncritical teachings: that pure reason cannot know anything without the\naid of sense experience, and that it is impossible for the senses to\nknow anything beyond appearances.  He found Kant's critique of\ndogmatic metaphysics compelling, and even defended Kant against\nEberhard and the old dogmatic\n Wolffians.[20]\n He rejected,\nhowever, Kant's solution to the pantheism controversy: the concept of\npractical faith, the defense of religious belief on the basis of\npractical reason.  While Rehberg agreed with Kant that the only\njustification of religion is\n practical,[21]\n he could not\naccept that a practical justification has its basis in reason alone.\nThe only practical justification of religion was political: its\nutility in maintaining order among the people.  A more educated man,\nhowever, did not need religious faith to love virtue and do his duty.\nRehberg affirmed an austere stoic ethic, which demanded acting on duty\nalone, regardless of personal happiness.  Like many of his\ncontemporaries, he held that the doctrine of moral faith violated\nKant's own strictures about the autonomy of morals.  The moral law\ndemands acting for the sake of duty alone, regardless of supernatural\nrewards and punishments.   \n Throughout the pantheism controversy, Rehberg maintained his\nskeptical attitude toward all religious belief.  Such skepticism was\nunique, his original contribution to the controversy.  All his fellow\ndisputants— Kant, Herder, Jacobi, Mendelssohn, Goethe, Novalis,\nSchleiermacher, Hölderlin—affirmed some kind of religion,\nwhether theism or pantheism.  Although Rehberg agreed with Jacobi that\nall metaphysics ends in Spinozism, he did not take this as proof for\npantheism, still less as reason for a salto mortale into\ntheism.  Since he rejected all metaphysics as empty speculation, he\ndid not think that reason obliges us to accept pantheism, let alone\ntheism.  Metaphysics could never justify theism, Rehberg argued,\nbecause it at best establishes that there is a first cause of things,\nbut never that this first cause is a personal being with understanding\nand\n will.[22]\n Although we can attribute understanding and\nwill to God, we have to realize that such attributes are only\nanthropomorphisms that are true for us and never for\n things-in-themselves.[23]\n When his friend J.J. Engel later\nasked him “Do you want to reduce all religion down to\npoetry?”, Rehberg did not demur; his only qualification was that\npoetry sometimes has a moral\n worth.[24] \n Already in Über das Verhältnis, published two\nyears before the Revolution, some of Rehberg's conservative views make\na brief appearance.  His skepticism was beginning to bear political\nresults.  It is dangerous, he argues, to assume that reason is the\nbasis for civil administration, because it leads to unwarranted\nexpectations.  The everyday administration of the state often rests on\nad hoc or arbitrary decisions, and it is impossible to expect\nall of them to be based on some rational standard.  Since conflict\nbetween people is inevitable, even in a purely rational constitution\nsome things have to be decided on the basis of force \n alone.[25]\n Rehberg was also convinced of the necessity of elite rule, of the\nneed for someone to make judgements about what is in the best interest\nof everyone.  What is in the best interests of a state is a matter of\nspecialized knowledge, which is not the concern of every\n man.[26] \n After participating in the pantheism controversy, Rehberg made his\nmark in other philosophical controversies of his day.  In the early\n1790s he wrote several reviews for the Allgemeine Literatur\nZeitung of Karl Leonhard Reinhold's Elementarphilosophie,\nwhich had been at the centre stage of the new debates surrounding\nKant's critical\n philosophy.[27]\n Reinhold's\nElementarphilosophie was a radical form of foundationalism,\nwhose basic aim was to derive all the results of Kant's philosophy\nfrom a single self-evident first principle.  The crucial question for\nReinhold's contemporaries concerned the very possibility of such\nfoundationalism.  Is it possible to found all knowledge upon a single\nfirst principle?  Given Rehberg's skepticism, it should not be\nsurprising that he took a negative stand on this basic question.  In\nhis January 1791 review of Reinhold's Beyträge zur\nBerichtigung bisheriger Missverständnisse der Philosophen,\nthe chief exposition of the Elementarphilosophie, Rehberg\nsketched his misgivings about foundationalism.  It is striking that\nhis chief objections are strictly Kantian, coming straight out of the\nKritik der reinen Vernunft itself.  Rehberg implies that\nReinhold is guilty of ignoring Kant's own strictures about the limits\nof knowledge; it is as if he were insinuating that Reinhold would\nbetter have heeded Kant's advice to limit himself to popularizing the\ncritical philosophy.  The problem with Reinhold's philosophy, Rehberg\nargues, is that it begins with definitions, ignoring Kant's warnings\nthat definitions should end rather than begin philosophy.  Reinhold\nneglected Kant's teaching that there is a fundamental difference in\nkind between the methods of mathematics and those of philosophy.\nWhile mathematical definitions can construct their objects in\nintuition, philosophical definitions have no such advantages.  What we\nderive from a definition depends on how we interpret it, on what we\nread into it in the first place; and there are all kinds of\ninterpretations of the same definition, so no basis of unanimity\nshould be expected simply by beginning with a definition, no matter\nhow simple and unproblematic.  The chief theme of Rehberg's\nreview—and indeed the leitmotif of all his political\nthought— is contained in his remark that “a definition need not\ncontain a criterion of that which falls under it” (202).\nRehberg develops this remark so that it becomes an objection against\nany attempt to apply general principles of philosophy to the practical\nworld (205-6).  To apply a general first principle, it is necessary to\nhave a criterion to show the subordinate principles to which it\napplies; but there are no such criteria, because how we apply a\nprinciple is a matter of judgment, which, as Kant demonstrated, has no\n criteria.[28]\n As one might suspect, Rehberg's argument here\nis politically motivated, because he singles out Reinhold as one of\nthose philosophers who think that his first principles are guidelines\nfor the social and political world (204).  The general conclusion of\nRehberg's reasoning could not be more expressly political:\n“...the whole system of education and culture of man that should\nbe based on scientific insight is false in theory and impossible in\nexecution.” (205). \n In the rest of his reviews, Rehberg doggedly pursued Reinhold's\nargument throughout the Beyträge, showing precisely\nhow his principles are insufficient to derive even the most basic\nresults of Kant's philosophy.  We cannot begin to reconstruct here the\ndetails of his\n arguments.[29]\n Suffice it to say that\nRehberg's reviews made an impact on his contemporaries, not least\nReinhold himself, who fell into a fit of depression after reading\n them.[30]\n Rehberg's articles had made a great contribution\ntoward skepticism about foundationalism, which would soon have a\nprofound impact on the development of Romanticism.   \n The net result of Rehberg's participation in the philosophical\ncontroversies of the late 1780s and early 1790s was a deeper\nskepticism.  There were two basic themes behind his skepticism.\nFirst, his adoption of Kant's critical thesis that we cannot know\nthings-in-themselves, and that all knowledge is limited to\nappearances.  Second, Rehberg's insistence that, even within the realm\nof appearances, there is a fundamental chasm between the universal and\nparticular, between what we think and what we sense.  There were in\nturn two aspects behind this latter dualism: that the universal\nconcepts of theoretical reason cannot sufficiently explain or\ndescribe something particular; and that there is no criterion by which\nto apply the universal principles of practical reason to\nordinary life.  It was this latter aspect of the second theme, which\nwas essentially an argument in behalf of the necessity of judgment to\nsolve the basic problems of politics, that was decisive for Rehberg's\npolitical philosophy.  \n Rehberg formed his political convictions early, long before the\nRevolution.  Like all the Hannoverians, the inspiration for his\npolitics came from the British\n constitution.[31]\n\nHannoverian admiration for the British constitution is not surprising,\ngiven that Britian had long standing dynastic relations with the House\nof Hannover.  But there were other sources for this admiration, all of\nthem, ironically, perfectly French.  Rehberg and the Hannoverians had\nread their Voltaire, Montesquieu and Jean Louis De Lolme, who had all\npraised the English constitution, making it their model for modern\ngovernment and their antidote to absolutism.  Like their French\nforbears, the Hannoverians admired the British constitution for its\nmixture of modern freedom and ancient institutions.  The British had\npreserved their monarchy, their aristocracy and the ancient role of\nParliament as a representative institution; but they had also\nliberalized these institutions by granting toleration, freedom of\nspeech, and the right of commoners to hold office and participate in\ngovernment.  The great strength of the British constitution, in the\nHannoverian view, is that it served as a bulwark against the two chief\ndangers of the modern political world: radical democracy and monarchic\nabsolutism.  The British constitution wisely limited the franchise to\nthe aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, which saved their system from\nochlocracy; but it also ensured that the king had to govern with the\nco-operation of parliament.  Contrary to Montesquieu and De Lolme,\nhowever, the Hannoverians did not see the balance of power, the system\nof checks and balances, as the reason for the success of the British\nsystem; they found it instead in the British party system, which\nthey admired for two grounds: it organized politicans into effective\ngroups in behalf of the public good, and it avoided corruption and\ncomplacency through\n opposition.[32] \n Although Rehberg's conservative views were formed before the\nRevolution, his early reaction to events in France was not hostile.\nHe was sympathetic to the moderate French reformers in the National\nAssembly, and he was hostile to royalists who insisted that France\nreturn to the days of absolute rule.  Unlike Burke, he refused to\nwhitewash the ancien régime, and he fully recognized\nthat, before the Revolution, France had been in desperate need of\nsocial and political reform.  Its taxes fell heavily on the poor, its\naristocrats had undeserved privileges, and its monarchs had ruled by\nwhim.  Like all the Hannoverians, Rehberg's great hope was that France\nwould evolve toward something like the British constitution, that it\nwould become something like a Parliament along the Seine.  He knew\nthat France and Britian were very different societies, having\ndifferent languages, traditions and values, and that it was impossible\nfor one country to adopt wholesale the constitution of another.\nNevertheless, he still hoped that the Estates General could become\nsomething like the British parliament.  If only\nFrench aristocrats could be more like their British cousins, and if\nonly Louis XVI could be persuaded to limits his powers like George\nIII.  When, however, it became clear that the Constituent Assembly was\nbent on more radical democratic and egalitarian changes, Rehberg's\nsympathy transformed into antipathy.  His opposition became resolute,\neven passionate, when he saw that the French were ready to import\nthese radical changes into Germany.   \n Despite his implacable hostility to radical democracy and\negalitarianism, Rehberg's general stance toward the Revolution, as\nthat of the Hannoverians in general, is best described as reform\nconservatism.  Its task was to walk the fine middle path between\nrevolution and reaction.  Rehberg disapproved of the reactionaries in\nGermany no less than the revolutionaries in France.  He realized that\nthe expectations aroused by the Revolution made it impossible to\nreturn to the old authoritarian ways.[33]\n\nThe only means to preserve the old order against revolutionary ferment\nwas through timely reforms.  Reform from above should placate and\ndampen the revolutionary demands coming from below.  The best way\nforward, he believed, was for the German Kleinstaat to evolve\nin the direction of the English Parliament.  The estates should become\nagain what they had been in the medieval past: representative bodies\nthat could check the power of kings and serve the interests of the\npublic.  Given Rehberg's mistrust of democracy and egalitarianism, it\nis perhaps going too far to describe his reform program as “one\nof constitutional advance under the disguise of antiquarian\n claims”.[34]\n Nevertheless, when we consider his\nliberal values and contempt for reactionaries, it is necessary to\nadmit that there is some measure of truth to this description.  \n Although Rehberg and the Hannoverians were eager to uphold the\ntraditional order against the radical currents of the Revolution, it\nis also important to be clear about just what kind of order they\nwanted to preserve.  They were sharply critical of the ancien\nrégime of Friedrich II's Prussia and of Louis XVI's France.\nThey feared and condemned the despotic power of absolute monarchs,\nwhich they saw as threats to the traditional liberties of the\nestates. Their sympathies were for the pluralistic structure of the\nold Kleinstaat, where each locality or province had its\ntraditional laws and customs, and where the estates gave some degree\nof representation.  The Hannoverians saw the constitution of their own\nElectorate as the norm for the German Kleinstaat. In the late\neighteenth century the Electorate of Hannover still had a thriving\naristocracy, a pliable peasantry, and a still nascent middle class.\nThe government was still in the hands of the Stände, i.e.,\ngoverning committees representing clergy, town and landed interests.\nIf these could only be reformed along the lines of the British\nParliament, Rehberg believed, German states would not have to fear the\nexcesses of absolutism or radical democracy.   \n The core of Rehberg's reform program came with his ideas about\nreforming the Stände. In the past the\nStände had been dominated by aristocratic cliques who were\nconcerned chiefly with their own interests rather than the public\ngood.  They would quarrel constantly with the princes to preserve\ntheir old privileges.  The best positions were held by aristocrats,\nwho alone had voting rights.  Despite these defects, Rehberg believed\nthat the Stände still had a valuable role to perform in\nthe modern state, and that it would be a disaster to replace them with\na bureaucracy.  Whereas a bureacracy fostered a spirit of obedience\nand order, the Stände were open to discussion and debate\nabout the public interest.  Its members were not beholden to a\nmonarch, but the interests of their locality and constituency.  If the\nStände were to survive in the modern era, they would have\nto respond more directly to their constituency, work more\nco-operatively with the monarch, and hold regular meetings to discuss\nand debate public affairs.  Most importantly, they would have to be\naccessible to the bougeoisie as well as the aristocracy, so that men of\ntalent could have the opportunity to rise to the top.  Although\nRehberg wanted the Stände to be more representative\ninstitutions, he still wanted to limit access to them.  He feared\ndirect representation of people—the slippery slope toward the dreaded\nuniversal franchise— and advocated representation on the basis of\nproperty.  His chief demand for reform is that\nLandstandschaft—the right to participate and vote in\ncommittees—be extended to anyone who owned land and not simply to the\ntraditional aristocracy.  Hence a bourgeois purchaser of traditional\naristocratic land could now be accepted into the Stände.\nSuch a proposal is very modest and cautious; but it was also intended\nonly for the near future; for Rehberg also advocated, though for the\nmore distant future, the participation of the peasantry in the\n estates.[35] \n Prima facie it is strange to find Rehberg, a burgher whose\ntalents were thwarted by the aristocracy, to be such an advocate of\nits preservation.  It seems as if he were a humble and obedient\nservant in his politics as well as in his bureacratic work.  Yet\naristocracy was fundamental to Rehberg's whole political outlook.\nAristocracy was natural for him, given his insistence that rights and\nobligations are inherited, handed down from one generation to another\n(see below, section 4).  More importantly, aristocracy was his bulwark\nagainst major fears: democracy and egalitarianism.  The chief danger\nto democracy is that it could lead to ochlocracy, government by the\nmob.  It was axiomatic for Rehberg that all government had to be\nmeritocratic, and he could see no way of ensuring this principle in a\nradically democratic and equalitarian society.  He believed firmly in\nthe value of a social and political hierarchy, the importance of\nmaintaining class differences between\n people.[36]\n Class\ndifferences were in his view both desirable and inevitable: desirable,\nbecause they allow merit to rule; and inevitable, because people have\nmore or less merit or talent according to circumstances, temperament\nand birth.   \n Rehberg's critique of revolutionary ideology was based upon his\ngeneral skepticism toward reason.  He worked out his criticisms\ngradually and on scattered occasions from 1789 to 1792 in his reviews\nfor the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung. He later revised and\ncollected these reviews, publishing them in 1793 under the title\nUntersuchungen über die Französische\n Revolution.[37]\n This work stands as one of the best\nGerman critiques of the French Revolution.  In fundamental respects it\nlaid the groundwork for German conservatism.  Its significance was\nimmediately recognized by Fichte, who devoted much effort to its\nrefutation in his Beiträge zur Berichtigung der Urteile des\nPublikums über die französische Revolution.   \n For Rehberg, the Revolution was a failed experiment in idealism, a\nmisguided attempt by French radicals to recreate society and state\naccording to the principles of reason.  There lay a fundamental\nfallacy behind this experiment: the belief that the principles of\nreason are guidelines for concrete political practice, that they are\nblueprints to reconstruct all society and the state.  It was this\nbelief, Rehberg argues, that sanctioned the frenzy of destruction\nbehind the Revolution, the eagerness to abolish all the traditional\npolitical institutions of France.  Since the French radicals believed\nthat the principles of reason mandate a specific kind of constitution,\nand since traditional French institutions were very far from that\nideal, they held that these institutions are contrary to\nreason, so that it was obligatory to abolish them.  The chief fallacy\nbehind revolutionary ideology, therefore, was its\nhyperrationalism, its belief that reason by itself dictates\npolitical practice.  Hence Rehberg made it his chief business to\nexpose this fallacy.  In his many writings on the Revolution he argued\nemphatically and repeatedly that reason has no such powers.  Although\nhe accepted that pure reason does determine the general principles of\nmorality, he denied that it is by itself sufficient to dictate\npolitical\n practice.[38]\n Reason by itself demands only that\nour principles are just and universal, applying without exception to\neveryone alike; but such principles are indifferent regarding the\nspecific form of a constitution; they determine nothing about\nwhich laws are just and universal in the specific circumstances\nof a country.  On their own, the general principles of reason are\nconsistent with monarchy, democracy or aristocracy.  Which form of\ngovernment is best can be determined by experience alone, by seeing which\nlaws have the greatest utility under specific circumstances.   \n It was one of Rehberg's central themes that the gap between theory\nand practice, between general principle and specific constitution, has\nto be bridged by judgment.  Judgment is the special faculty and\nprovince of the statesman.  Its task is to determine how best to apply\nthe principles of reason under specific circumstances.  It should\nnever be confused simply with reason, the intellectual power of\ndetermining general rules; for, as Kant taught in the first\n Kritik,[39]\n judgment is that faculty that determines\nthe application of rules and therefore does not stand under any rule\nitself.  Judgment, however, is no easy task: there are many ways of\napplying the same principles; and the consequences of applying them\nhave to be weighed against one another.  Judgment is a faculty that\nimproves with age and experience, and that sometimes requires\ntechnical expertise. The shortcoming of the French radicals is that\nthey had underestimated judgment as they had overestimated reason.\nThey assumed that each principle involves the criterion for its\napplication, and that it should be applied in just one unique way,\nregardless of the circumstances.   \n Recognizing the role of judgment in politics means for Rehberg\nthat another fundamental tenet of revolutionary ideology collapses:\nthe principle of the autonomy of reason, i.e., the belief that each\nindividual alone has the power and right to determine how to act in\nthe state (15-17). Rousseau and Kant are right to claim that reason is\ninalienable, and that each individual is sovereign in having the power\nand right to ascertain general moral principles.  But this does not\ngive them, Rehberg argued, the power and right to determine how to\napply these principles in specific circumstances.  Since knowing how\nto apply these principles is a matter of judgment, and since judgment\ndepends on experience and expertise, only a few qualified individuals\nwill be able to determine the best form of a constitution and the laws\nof a country.  Hence, in these cases, the individual should alienate\nhis powers of judgment to those who are more qualified.  Rehberg's\nadvocacy of the role of judgment in politics thus became the basis for\nhis defense of elite rule.   \n A central pillar of Rehberg's conservatism was his defense of\ntradition.  The basis for that defense was, again, his critique of\nreason.  Since reason by itself cannot determine the specific form of\na constitution, it never lays down a mandate to abolish the\nestablished institutions of a country, and so it is permissible for\nthe statesman to follow tradition.  Sometimes, Rehberg argued, it is\nnot only permissable but also obligatory for the\nstatesman to respect the traditions and established institutions of a\n country.[40]\n A state is the product of the history of its\npeople, of the experience of many generations; and each\ngeneration lays down the foundations on which another must build.\nWhat our forefathers built grew out of the unique circumstances of the\ncountry, and it has gradually adapted to them; to abolish it would\nleave us nothing to build upon and make it necessary to create ex\nnihilo.  Rehberg's defense of tradition and precedent went even\nfurther: he argued that many of our social and moral obligations are\nthemselves essentially historical, arising from inheritance.  No state\ncould persist for long, he argued, if future generations did not take\nover the obligations of past generations, or if children did not\nassume the duties of their parents (52-53).  It was therefore a\nfundamental rule of civil society that children inherit the duties and\nresponsibilities of their parents.  Rehberg knew that this was a\nsomewhat harsh doctrine, because it would mean accepting inequalities\nfrom birth and aristocratic privileges; yet he insisted upon it all\nthe same: “Human beings in\ncivil society must be compelled to honor what their parents promised\nand began.  No state could exist for long if children and other heirs\nwere not made to take the place where the deceased once stood.  Who\nwould want to enter into commitments when the uncertain death of one\nof the committed parties released them of all obligations?”\n(52) \n Given Rehberg's critique of rationalism and his respect for\ntradition, his reaction to social contract doctrine should not be\nsurprising.  He condemned it in the sharpest terms.  This doctrine not\nonly assumed that every individual has the power to judge political\naffairs, but it also seemed to absolve him from all traditional\nresponsibilities and obligations.  The social contract doctrine\nfalsely holds, he argued, that we enter society and the state at will,\nas if we were born free and had some natural criterion by which to\njudge them; but we are born into society and the state, and the\ncriteria by which we judge things are formed by them.  We must give up\nthe assumption, he insisted, that civil rights belong to people by\nnature; ranks and rights are inherited and depend upon the place in\nsociety into which we are born (62). \n Rehberg saw the chief inspiration for French radicalism in the\nseductive and paradoxical writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau (6, 21).\nIt was Rousseau who first advanced the principle of the autonomy of\nreason, and who made reason alone the touchstone of political\nlegitimacy.  His doctrine of the general will meant that every\npolitical principle should be tested in the light of reason, or\naccording to what an ideally rational person would will.  Rehberg\nfound irresolvable ambiguities in Rousseau's doctrine, which, he\nclaimed, made its application to the political world impossible.\nRousseau's distinction between the general will and the will of all\nmade it clear that it was not possible to determine the general will\nsimply by what people happen to want; the general will was understood\nby Rousseau to be a norm that determines what everyone ought to will.\nBut how is it possible to determine what everyone ought to will?  And,\nmore importantly, who is to determine it?  The ambiguities of\nRosseau's doctrine made it ripe for exploitation by Jacobin\nideologues, who felt justified in “forcing people to be\nfree”. \n Another source of revolutionary ideology that became the special\ntarget of Rehberg's wrath was physiocratic doctrine.  Though this\ndoctrine was often associated with absolutism, Rehberg still saw it as\na basic influence on radical thinking.  He especially disliked what he\ntook to be the physiocrats' leading principle: that everyone should\nhave the right to do whatever they want as long as they do not\ninterfere with anyone else.  Such a principle laid down the path\ntoward “a very crude egoism”.  If this were made the\ngoverning principle of civil society, he argued, then people would\nrecognize no obligations other than to leave others alone; the whole\nculture of social virtue would disappear (25-26).  The physiocratic\nsystem also leads to materialism, he believed, because it values\neverything according to its utility, its ability to satisfy our basic\nneeds.  People will regard themselves as machines, who work to eat and eat only to work more\n(27).  Since they show no immediate profit, there will be no point in\ndeveloping our higher powers or in cultivating the arts (28). \n In the late 1780s, before his encounter with Reinhold, Rehberg took\npart in some of the heated debates surrounding Kant's critical\nphilosophy.  He was both an admirer and critic of Kant.  While he\ndefended Kant against the polemics of the Wolffians, he also wrote a\ncritical review of the second Kritik, which was widely read in\nhis\n day.[41]\n But the review of the second Kritik was\nonly the first skirmish of a greater battle.  Rehberg realized that\nhis case against revolutionary ideology could triumph only if he\ndefeated Kant.  For Kant's ethical rationalism gave a strong\nphilosophical foundation for the doctrines of Rousseau, which had been\nsuch an inspiration for the radicals in France.  Some of Kant's basic\nconcepts—the categorical imperative and moral autonomy— seemed\npost facto rationalization for Rousseau's social contract\ntheory and republicanism.  What was only a feeling or intuition in\nRousseau became a concept or principle in Kant.  These implications of\nKant's doctrines became explicit in 1793 when Kant published his\nfamous ‘Theory-Practice’ essay in the Berlinische\n Monatsschrift.[42]\n Here Kant argued that there is no\ngap between theory and practice in politics, and that reason is\npractical in political as well as moral life.  He maintained that the\nprinciples of morality, which are determined by pure reason alone, are\nalso binding in politics, and that pure reason provides the basis for\na republican constitution involving the principles of liberty,\nequality and independence.  Kant's theses were a direct challenge to\nRehberg, who had made the gap between theory and practice the\nleitmotif of his critique of the Revolution.  Sooner or later,\nthen, he would have to reckon with the sage of Königsberg.  His\nreply to Kant duly appeared in the Berlinische\nMonatsschrift in February\n 1794.[43] \n Rehberg began his essay by expressing his agreement with the basic\nprinciples of Kant's moral philosophy.  Unlike many opponents of\nKant's moral theory, Rehberg was not an empiricist in ethics.  He\nflatly denied that utility could settle matters of\n right,[44]\n\nand he held that the first principles of morality have to be\nestablished independent of experience, apart from any knowledge of the\nconsequences of acting upon them.  It was Kant's great merit, Rehberg\ndeclares, to have shown that the first principle of morality—\n‘Act so that the maxim of your will becomes a universal\nlaw’—is determinable by pure reason alone.  Where Rehberg\ndisagrees with Kant is in his attempt to establish specific\nmoral and political maxims from the first principle of morality.  Like\nmany later critics of Kant, Rehberg maintains that the categorical\nimperative is a purely formal principle, insufficient to determine the\ncontent of our specific duties.  The categorical imperative amounts to\nnothing more than the general demand that our principles be\nuniversalizable, that they hold for everyone alike without exception,\nor that we treat like cases alike (117-118).  As such it provides a\nmerely negative condition for accepting a moral principle; the problem\nis that it does not provide a positive criterion to distinguish\nbetween the many maxims that satisfy this condition.  The principle is\nstill compatible with many different maxims, all of which are\nuniversalizable.   \n But why is the categorical imperative such a formal principle?  Why\ncannot it derive any of our more specific duties?  Rehberg's argument\nhere becomes somewhat blurred and confused.  While his intention is to\nshow that the categorical imperative is a purely formal principle,\nsome of his arguments tend to demonstrate not its formality but the\nimpossibility of acting according to it in the real empirical world.\nIt is one thing to show that the categorical imperative is not\npractical because it cannot determine specific duties; it is another\nthing to show that it is not practical because no one in the real\nworld could act according to it, whether it derives specific duties or\nnot.  All told, Rehberg's polemic against Kant is an extraordinary\nmixture of insight and confusion.  We can best summarize it in the\nfollowing points: \n Rehberg's importance for the historicist tradition has long been\nappreciated by the few scholars who know him.  It is scarcely\nrecognized, however, among scholars of historicism, who either ignore\nhim or treat him in a footnote.[46] In his magisterial\nEntstehung des Historismus Friedrich Meinecke treated Rehberg\nen passant, as if he were but a disciple of\n Möser.[47]\n This too is an injustice, since Rehberg was\nas great an influence on the historicist tradition as Möser\nhimself.  Though Möser was the more original thinker, Rehberg had\na better understanding of its relevance for the post-revolutionary\nera.  It is surely a telling sign of Rehberg's significance for\nhistoricism that Friedrich Savigny, the founder of the historical\nschool of law, had praised him repeatedly for his critique of the\nCode Napoleon, the French attempt to impose a rational\nconstitution upon the Electorate of\n Hannover.[48]\n Resistance\nto the Code Napoleon was the first cause\ncélèbre of historicism, its first case in its\nbattle against the legal rationalism of the Enlightenment; and in this\nrespect Rehberg was Savigny's most weighty precedent.  In sum,\nRehberg's chief contribution to historicism was making it the\nantithesis to revolutionary ideology.   \n We find in Rehberg some standard historicist tropes before they\nbecame widespread in the nineteenth century.  Like Herder and\nMöser, he taught that each nation is an organic whole, a unique\nindividual, which cannot be reduced down to the mere sum of its\nmembers.  Each nation has a singular and characteristic spirit\n(Volksgeist), which pervades every aspect of its life, and\nwhich persists over the generations. This meant for Rehberg, as later\nhistoricists, that moral and political values are sui generis\nand incommensurable, so that we should not judge one nation or epoch\nby the values of another.  Rehberg also shared some of Möser's\nskepticism about the natural law tradition, which attempted to\nformulate universal values or moral standards above all the changes of\n history.[49]\n He too believed that these values often turned\nout to be the product of their own time and place, that they rested\nupon illicit generalizations from the values of one culture. \n What was new to Rehberg's historicism was his critique of reason.\nHis skepticism regarding the practical powers of reason gave\nhistoricism a new firmer foundation, one deeper than that dug by\nMöser or Herder.  The ultimate upshot of his skepticism, as we\nhave seen, is that there is a gap between theory and practice, between\nreason and conduct, in the realms of morality and politics.  Since\nreason cannot lay down specific maxims for moral conduct, and since it\ncannot determine the specific form of a constitution, it proves to be\na useless guide to moral and political action.  What fills the gap\nbetween theory and practice is, for Rehberg, nothing less than\nhistory.  There are two senses in which this is the case.  First, we\ndetermine the specific maxims of our moral conduct, or the proper\npolitical constitution for a country, only by judging their utility,\nby seeing how well they fit into their cultural context, which is the\nproduct of history.  Second, we sometimes have to lay aside utility\nand determine how to act by precedent and tradition, by learning the\ncustoms of a culture; but precedent, custom and tradition are also\nresults of history.  Both points show, Rehberg believes, that we are\nnot completely free moral agents who simply choose to become part of a\nculture, and who choose principles of action based on pure reason\nalone; rather, we are born into our culture, which shapes our very\nidentity, and which supplies the content for our principles.  We\ncannot escape our history because it makes us who we are. \n It is necessary to be precise, however, about the exact role played\nby history in Rehberg's philosophy.  The historical strands of his\nthought have often been exaggerated, as if he completely rejected the\nnatural law tradition and all rationalism in\n politics.[50]\n\nAlthough he was indeed skeptical about many claims made for natural\nlaw, he never denied its very existence; and although he doubted that\npractical reason determines concrete maxims, he never questioned that\nit could lay down the most general principles of morality.  More\nexactly, his position is that natural law and practical reason are\nnecessary, but not sufficient, for moral and political practice.\nHistory completes reason, but it does not replace it.  This residual\nrationalism in Rehberg's political thought appears in some of his\nlater articles on the historical school of\n law.[51]\n\nReaffirming the Kantian view that there is an a priori dimension of\nright, he argued against the doctrine that all laws are nothing more\nthan arbitrary commands.  In this regard, Fichte's critique of Rehberg\nis unfair and misses the\n point.[52]\n Rehberg taught not that\nhistorical traditions determine the standard of right, as Fichte\nclaimed, but only that they determine how it should be applied and\ndeveloped in specific circumstances. \n It is also important not to exaggerate Rehberg's traditionalism.  His\ninsistence on the indispenable role of tradition in political life was\none of the characteristic features of his conservatism.  It is\nimportant to add, though, that his faith in tradition was not that of\na reactionary.  He never went so far as to hold that custom and\ntradition are sacred.  He admitted, indeed insisted, that we should\nchange custom and tradition if they become oppressive or inconvenient\nin changing\n circumstances.[53]","contact.mail":"fbeiser@syr.edu","contact.domain":"syr.edu"}]
