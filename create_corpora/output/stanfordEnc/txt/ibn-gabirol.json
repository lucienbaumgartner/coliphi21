Ibn Gabirol is moved first and foremost by\nthe Neoplatonic theological sense that God's reality infuses all\nthings, and by the concomitant ethical and existential ideal of\nNeoplatonic Return—the notion that we must strive, through mind\nand deed, to reclaim our own truest being and likeness to our\nsource. Thought wrongly by centuries of Christian scholastics to be\neither a Christian defender of Augustine or a Muslim misreader of\nAristotle, Ibn Gabirol is in fact a Jewish Neoplatonist who, under the\nadditional influence of Pseudo Empedoclean ideas, paints for us a\nmodified Plotinian universe in which all things are rooted in various\n“layers” of matters and forms which reveal the mediating\ngraces of God's own Will/Wisdom/Word. For Ibn Gabirol, everything\n(even the simple unity of intellect itself) reveals a matter+form\ncomplexity, mirroring in this way the complex unity of God's own\n“essential” and “active” moments. Where God\nreveals himself as the “Fountain of Life,” our material\ncore acts as the river through which we may return always to our\nsource.\n\n\n\nJewish Neoplatonist Solomon ben Judah Ibn Gabirol (Shelomoh ben\nYehudah Ibn Gabirol in Hebrew; Abu Ayyub Sulaiman ibn Yahya Ibn\nJubayrol (or Ibn\n Jabirul)[1]\nin Arabic; Avicebron / Avicembron / Avicenbrol /\nAvencebrol in Latin) was born in Málaga Spain in 1021/2 (Guttman\noffers 1026) and died, most likely in Valencia, most likely in 1057/8\n(Guttman offers 1050; Sirat offers 1054–8; Joseph Ibn Zaddik\noffers\n 1070).[2]\nFrom his own\nautobiographical remarks in his poems, it appears that this important\npoet-philosopher was orphaned, infirm and unattractive (it seems he\nsuffered a disfiguring skin\n ailment).[3]\nWhile there was a time during which he was\ninvolved with a circle of Jewish intellectuals in Saragossa, and while\nhe did enjoy the patronage of a respected (though, eventually murdered)\nJewish patron for a short while, it is also clear that Ibn Gabirol had\nan anti-social\n disposition[4]\nand a mostly strained relationship with the Jewish community. This\nlatter point has perhaps been overemphasized to full blown misanthropy\ndue to a translation error: in his sharp criticism of Ibn Gabirol's\nphilosophy (as repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing), Ibn Daud\nconcludes (in his ha-Emûnah ha-Ramah) that through his\nphilosophy Ibn Gabirol “led the Jewish people into error,”\nwhich through a mistranslation of the Arabic into Hebrew got wrongly\nconveyed as the claim that he slandered the Jewish people\n(dîber sarah gedôlah al ha-ûma) (see Pines\n1977a; for brief discussion in English, see Sirat 1985, p. 81). That\naside, a poem he wrote upon leaving Saragossa does lambast the\ncommunity (“…giants they deem themselves, for me to rate\nno more than grasshoppers…I am away, beneath my feet like mire\nI stamp them hard…”) (for translation and references for\nthis poem, see Loewe 1989, p. 21, and footnote 9, p. 170), and it does\nseem that he had a hard time finding patrons and friends (legend tells\nof his having created some sort of female automaton for house chores\n[apparently this story circulated in the 17th century; see Ashkenazi\n1629, part 1, 9; see Bargebuhr 1976, p. 62; Loewe 1989 fn. 9\np. 170]—perhaps a legend built on his reputation as having had\nfew companions). Perhaps we may root his generally surly disposition\nin his rather hard life or, on the other hand, in his self-assured\nsense of what was, to be sure, his own keen intellect and poetic\ngenius. On this latter point, we might consider another Ibn Gabirol\nlegend—a mythic tale of his death: killed by a jealous poet, Ibn\nGabirol's remains are discovered when curious townsmen dig under a fig\ntree to determine why its flowers, fruit, and fragrance exceed the\nbeauty of anything they've ever experienced (see Loewe 1989, p. 23\nwith reference details in footnote 14, p. 170). \n\nComplementing a vast corpus of Hebrew poetry (see section 7 below),\nIbn Gabirol's most expansive work is his philosophical treatise,\nthe Fons Vitae (The Fountain of Life, or\nyanbû‘ al-hayâh in\n Arabic,[5]\nand the meqôr\nhayyîm in its later Hebrew\n translation).[6]\nOriginally written in Arabic in\nthe 11th century in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and his\nstudent, the Fons Vitae was translated into Latin in the 12th\ncentury by the translation team of Dominicus Gundissalinus and John of\nSpain (Johannes\n Hispanus),[7]\nand made into an abridged Hebrew version (one\nwhich loses the dialogue format and is something more of a summary of\nthe original) by Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera in the 13th century. The\noriginal Arabic text is lost to us, though we do have some extant\nfragments in the form of citations of the original Arabic version in\nthe Arabic language texts of other Jewish medieval\n philosophers.[8]\nBecause the Arabic\nfragments are sparse, the main version of the text is the Latin 12th\ncentury translation—it is considered more true to the original\nthan the later 13th century Hebrew translation both because it is an\nearlier translation, but also because unlike the Hebrew summary\ntranslation, the Latin edition is (ostensibly) a complete translation,\nmaintaining—as the Hebrew summary does not—the original\ndialogue format of Ibn Gabirol's original text. That said, it is\nworth noting that sometimes the 13th century Hebrew translation is more\nhelpful than the Latin because it is able to resonate with various\nHebrew terms at play in Ibn Gabirol's own vast corpus of Hebrew\npoetry which is often helpful in shedding light on some given\nphilosophical point in the Fons Vitae. \n\nIbn Gabirol also authored (in Arabic) On the Improvement of the\nMoral Qualities (islâh al-’akhlâq in\nthe Arabic, or tîkkûn mîdôt ha-nefesh,\nthe Hebrew title of the translation by Judah Ibn Tibbon) a blend of\nphysiological and philosophical insights on the nature of the human\nsoul. We also have evidence in other medieval Jewish authors of what\nmight be part of an allegorical commentary on the Bible by Ibn Gabirol\n(as found in Abraham ibn Ezra's commentary on the Bible; see\nFriedlaender 1877, p. 40; Kaufmann 1899, p. 63ff.; for English see\nSirat 1985, p. 79), and it is debated whether he might also be the\nauthor of Choice of Pearls (mukhtâr\nal-jawâhir, lit. Choice (or: Selection) of Jewels;\nor Mivhar ha-Penînîm, Choice of Pearls, in its\nHebrew\n translation),[9]\na collection of maxims aimed at cultivating a\nvirtuous soul. It might be further noted that there are medieval lists\nby later thinkers enumerating a total 21 treatises by Ibn Gabirol (see\nLoewe 1989, pp. 24–5) including an entire [non-extant] treatise on\nDivine Will to which Ibn Gabirol himself alludes in his Fons\nVitae. All this, of course, in addition to his having authored a\nvast corpus of Hebrew poetry, including a number of lengthy\nphilosophical poems (see section 7). \n\nAlthough we are not certain of what traditions most influenced his\nwork, we might certainly see in the pages of his philosophy and poetry\na unique blend of Jewish, Islamic, Neoplatonic, Pythagorean,\nphilosophical, Biblical, and mystical (Jewish and Islamic) source\nmaterials. We find overt use of Biblical quotes throughout his poetry,\nthough (and this is something for which other Jewish thinkers\ncriticized him) no overt references to the Bible or Jewish tradition in\nhis Fons Vitae (though the title arguably references\nPsalms 36:10). In his notion of a Divine Word (in the Fons\nVitae), we might hear resonances of the Longer Theology of\nAristotle; in his interest in a Divine Throne (in the Fons\nVitae and in his Keter Malkhût [Kingdom's\nCrown] poem), we might hear resonances of Muslim and Jewish\n“Throne\n theologies”;[10]\nin his reference to God creating out of letters, we might hear resonances of the\nSêfer Yezîrah (The Book of Formation,\npossibly known to Ibn Gabirol through the commentary edition of Saadya\nGaon; for discussion of Sêfer Yezîrah and Ibn\nGabirol, see Schlanger 1965 and Liebes 1987); in his causal\nmetaphysical hierarchy we might discern the influence of the Liber\n de Causis;[11]\nand in his emphasis on a principle called “al-‘unsur\nal-awwal” in his Arabic writing (generally translated as\nfirst matter) and called “yesôd”\n(foundation) in his Hebrew poetry, we might hear resonances of a\ntradition which scholars have dubbed “Pseudo Empedoclean”—an \nimprecisely understood tradition of ideas found in an\neclectic array of medieval Jewish and Islamic texts (where authors\nsometimes refer overtly to Empedocles by name) in which there emerges a\nnotable focus on a principle of pure supernal matter\n(al-‘unsur al-awwal, literally “the first\nelement”) at the core of being which is itself either coupled\nwith a principle of first form or described as itself composite of the\nduality of “love and strife.” The exact nature of this\ntradition or traditions remains unclear, but can be found in\nal-Shahrastani, al-Shahrazuri, Ps. Ammonius, and al-Amiri (for\nreferences, see the entry on “anbaduklîs”—the \nArabic transliteration of “Empedocles”—in \nEncyclopedia of Islam), in some medieval Hebrew\nKabbalistic\n traditions,[12]\nand has been linked to ideas in Ibn Masarra (see Asín-Palacios\n1978), Isaac Israeli and Ibn Hasday (See Stern 1983a). Linking Ibn\nGabirol to this tradition seems warranted not only in light of his own\nemphasis on al-‘unsur al-awwal (followed in turn by an\nunusual focus on the role of matter/s in the cosmos), but in light of\na claim by his 13th century translator Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera who in the introduction to his Hebrew edition\nof Meqôr Hayyîm (Fons Vitae) writes that\nIbn Gabirol seems to have been influenced by\n“Empedocles' Book of the Five Substances”\n(cf. Falaquera in Fons Vitae 1962, p. 435). Leaving aside what\nthis might refer to (scholars debate both the title as well as what it\nrefers to), it does seem that Ibn Falaquera was right to note some\nlink between Ibn Gabirol's Fons Vitae and some set of ideas\ncirculating under the name of\n Empedocles.[13] \n\nWhile some later medieval Jewish thinkers—such as Shem Tov\nIbn Falaquera, Moses Ibn Ezra, Abraham Ibn Daud, Joseph ibn Zaddik and\nIsaac and Judah Abrabanel—were familiar with his philosophy,\nIbn Gabirol is probably most well-known among medieval and modern\nJewish authors for his Hebrew poetry, the best known of which being the\nKeter Malkhût (variously translated as\nKingdom's Crown, The Kingly Crown, The\nRoyal Crown, et\n al.),[14]\na long devotional poem exploring the ineffable\nsplendor of the divine and tracing God's presence throughout the\nvarious cosmological spheres which make up the universe. In fact, this\npoem is included in many Jewish prayer books for recitation on\nYôm Kippûr (The Day of Atonement), the highest of\nJewish holy days. \n\nThe Fons Vitae is arguably the most influential of his\nworks, though mostly among medieval Christians. Available in Hebrew\nsummary form by the 13th century, and quoted in Arabic in\nMoses Ibn Ezra's\n work,[15]\nthe Fons Vitae left its strongest\nimprint not on medieval Jews but on the medieval Christian world.\nTranslated into Latin in the 12th century, and circulating\nno longer under Ibn Gabirol's name per se, but now under the\nLatinized version of his name (variously as Avicebron, Avicembron,\nAvicenbrol and Avencebrol), the Fons Vitae was engaged\n(variously criticized and hallowed) by centuries of medieval Christian\nscholars, who either assumed the author to be a Muslim or a Christian,\nnone suspecting the author to be the accomplished medieval Jewish poet,\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol. \n\nFollowing the Christian reception of Ibn Gabirol's text\nfurther, we might note that whole groups of medieval Christian\nphilosophers assumed the text to have been written in particular by an\nAugustinian Christian. Taken up by many Franciscan philosophers in just\nthis way, Ibn Gabirol's Fons Vitae text became a\ncornerstone in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans\nand Dominicans, the Franciscans pointing to many of the Fons\nVitae doctrines in support of what they took to be true, untainted\nChristian ideas as laid out by Augustine—in contrast to the\nmore heavily Aristotelianized ideas of Dominicans like St. Thomas\nAquinas. It was not until the middle of the 19th century\nthat the Fons Vitae began its return to its Jewish roots when\nSolomon Munk uncovered the 13th century Hebrew summary by\nShem Tov Ibn Falaquera in which the text is attributed to Solomon Ibn\nGabirol. In this way, Munk recognized the Fons Vitae to have\nin fact been penned by the 11th century Jewish poet. \n\nIt is worth noting that in spite of this discovery, many scholars\ncontinue to tacitly read Ibn Gabirol's Fons Vitae\nthrough Augustinian and other inappropriate lenses. (See section 2 on\nmethodology below). \n\nWhile there is no neutral lens through which to engage the history\nof ideas, it is important to guard against three particularly\ndistorting lenses in the study of Ibn Gabirol: Aristotelian,\nAugustinian, and Kabbalistic. \n\nOne of Ibn Gabirol's key interests in his Fons Vitae is a\nstudy of matter and form (and in particular a doctrine which later\nthinkers have called “Universal Hylomorphism”). While\nthere is no question that Ibn Gabirol is in some sense influenced by\nAristotelian concepts of form, matter, substance, categories, etc.,\nthere is no reason to think that he is generally using those concepts\nin anything even close to an Aristotelian way. As hopefully will\nbecome clear in this study, the primary notions of matter and of\nsubstance in Ibn Gabirol are deeply (and obviously)\nnon-Aristotelian [see sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3], revealing instead deeply\nPlatonic and Neoplatonic sensibilities, and—even more\nuniquely—deeply “Empedoclean” influence. (In this\nregard, Pessin 2009 (pp. 287–288) uses the novel term\n“Grounding Element” to replace the Latin\n“materia prima” and its English translation as\n“prime matter” as a translation for Ibn Gabirol's Arabic\n“al-‘unsur al-awwal”; see too Pessin\n2004). It is critical to note that “prime matter” is a\nmisleading term to use in a study of Ibn Gabirol as it at imports\nundue Aristotelian resonances to—and masks Pseudo (henceforth,\n“Ps.”) Empedoclean resonances at play in—Ibn\nGabirol's Arabic terminology. \n\nNoting that Ibn Gabirol is not an Aristotelian goes a long way to\ninvalidating the deepest grounds (as opposed to the details) of Thomas\nAquinas' and other medieval thinkers' criticisms of Ibn\nGabirol's metaphysics as essentially being some kind of\nmisunderstanding of Aristotle. Since Ibn Gabirol is not trying—tacitly \nor otherwise—to do what many scholastics are trying to\ndo (viz. to “get Aristotle right”), it is methodologically\nstrained to critique Ibn Gabirol from an Aristotelian vantage point. An\nAristotelian lens does not open us to understanding the metaphysical\npicture that Ibn Gabirol is trying to paint for us. \n\nAnother of Ibn Gabirol's key interests in the Fons\nVitae is the Divine Will. This focus in part explains why many\nChristian Franciscans thought the Fons Vitae to have been\nauthored not only by a Christian but by what they would have seen as a\nright-minded Augustinian Christian. While we have known since the\n19th century that the Fons Vitae was in fact\nauthored by a Jewish poet, this has arguably not altered much of the\nAugustinian-lensed scholarship on the Fons Vitae. Some\nscholars, for example, have concluded simply on the basis of the idea\nof a Divine Will in Ibn Gabirol that he (like Augustine) must mean by\nthis some divine power at odds with emanation. While the details of Ibn\nGabirol's cosmogony are complex, and while it is indeed possible\nthat his notion of Will rules out emanation, another equally strong\noption is that he uses the term “Divine Will” in a way that\n(contra Augustine) is deeply compatible with Plotinian emanation. My\npoint here is simply to caution the reader: just because something\nsounds Augustinian does not mean that it is, and if it is not, we need\nto keep all our conceptual options open. Certainly “will”\nis consistent with emanation in the pages of Plotinus; we should not\nstart out—tacitly wearing Augustinian lenses—with any\nassumptions to the contrary in the Fons\n Vitae.[16]\n(In this regard, Pessin 2009, p. 286 with note 54, \nuses the term “Divine Desire” to replace the\nLatin “voluntas” and the English\n“Will” as a translation of Ibn Gabirol's Arabic\n“al-irâda”). \n\nFor our current purposes, we must at least bear in mind that since\nIbn Gabirol is not a Christian Augustinian, it is methodologically\nstrained to read Ibn Gabirol from an Augustinian vantage point. An\nAugustinian lens does not open us to understanding the metaphysical\npicture that Ibn Gabirol is trying to paint for us. \n\nIn his elaboration on the metaphysics of matter, Ibn Gabirol\nfrequently uses the Arabic term “al-‘unsur”\n(instead of the more common Arabic terms\n“al-hayûlâ” and\n“al-madda”) for matter. In fact, as outlined in\nsection 1, this is one of the key pieces of evidence for identifying a\nuniquely “Empedoclean” strain in his thinking. That said,\nmany readers instead simplistically fall into a Kabbalistic reading of\nIbn Gabirol since the Arabic “al-‘unsur” is\ncorrelated to the Hebrew term “yesôd” both\nin Ibn Gabirol's own Hebrew poetry as well as in\nFalaquera's 13th century Hebrew translation of the\nFons Vitae. While to be sure, the Hebrew term\n“yesôd” (literally “foundation”)\nis a cornerstone term and concept in Jewish mysticism, the desire to\nread Ibn Gabirol Kabbalistically (as a proto-Zoharian) is simply\nunder-supported by the mere fact that he (and his Hebrew translator)\nuse the term “yesôd”. While there might be\nKabbalistic traces in Ibn Gabirol, it is methodologically inadvisable—and \ndistorting—to simply start out assuming there are.\nWe might note, for example, F. E. Peters' boldly claiming—with\nno stated evidence—in his “Avicebron” entry in\nthe New Catholic Encyclopedia: “The true philosophical home of\nAvicebron is in the Zohar and in the speculative sections of the\nCabala” (see Peters 1967, volume 1, p. 1130). Such a claim is not\nprima facie evident. In an obviously more methodologically careful\nspirit, there are scholars of Jewish mysticism who recommend\nconnections to Ibn Gabirol (usually with reference to Ibn\nGabirol's poems, not his Fons Vitae) (see, for example,\nIdel, who offers the suggestion of mystical overtones in an Ibn Gabirol\npoetic reference to “ten sefirôt” (Idel\n1982, p. 278); see too: Idel 1992; Liebes 1987; Heller-Wilensky 1967).\nWhile we needn't dismiss the idea of links between Ibn Gabirol\nand Jewish mysticism (he was most likely familiar with the\nSêfer Yetzîrah tradition, and possibly other\ntraditions, of sefîrôt), we must be\nmethodologically cautious to not over-Kabbalize Ibn Gabirol (and\nespecially his Fons Vitae): use of terms like\n“sefîrôt,”\n“yesôd,” et al. do not necessarily reveal\nJewish mystical overtones or influence. Scholem reminds us (in his\nstudy of Ibn Gabirol's influence on Kabbalah) that even after\nmany studies of the link between Ibn Gabirol and the Kabbalah, we have\nno clear conclusions (Scholem 1939, p. 160). (Avoiding reading Ibn\nGabirol as a proto-Zoharist is not to deny any impact of Ibn Gabirol on\nlater Kabbalists; but even this question of forward-influence must be\ntreated with care; as Scholem also notes, the mere use of the term\n“Divine Will” in Kabbalistic thinkers after Ibn\nGabirol does not necessarily reveal a Gabirolean influence (Scholem\n1939, p. 161)). \n\nSince we have strong reason to claim that Ibn Gabirol's use of\nthe term “yesôd” reflects a Ps. Empedoclean\ntradition, it is methodologically strained to read Ibn Gabirol from a\nKabbalistic vantage point. A Kabbalistic lens does not open us to\nunderstanding the metaphysical picture that Ibn Gabirol is trying to\npaint for us. \n\nLike any engaged Neoplatonist, Ibn Gabirol is first and foremost\ninterested in understanding the nature and purpose of human being: we\nmust understand what we are (our nature) so that we know how to live\n(our purpose). This set of interconnected human questions is what Ibn\nGabirol is interested in even in the midst of what might sometimes seem\nto be rather laborious cosmological and metaphysical explorations. Ibn\nGabirol, like other Neoplatonists, explores layers of cosmological and\nmetaphysical realities in an attempt to understand how to live the best\nhuman life possible. \n\nEmphasizing that this is Ibn Gabirol's main concern, we find\nin the opening pages of his Fons Vitae text a reminder that\nthe goal of the entire inquiry is to understand why human beings were\nmade (“Quare factus est homo?,” “Why was man\nmade?”—Fons Vitae 1.1, p. 2, line 8)—which \nis to say, to understand the ends (or purpose) of human being\n(the Fons Vitae teaches that a human ought to “pursue\nknowledge of his final cause [or: purpose] according to which he was\ncomposed,” Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 8–9). In spelling\nout the true, divinely ordained goal of human life (the purpose of the\nhuman life is described as a product of God's Will\nat Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 10–12), the text describes a\ntwofold endeavor: the pursuit of knowledge and the doing of good deeds\n(Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, line 27). \n\nWhile the remaining hundreds of pages of the Fons Vitae go\non to offer highly obscure elaborations on matter and form, the overall\npoint of the entire study (and one might argue, of Ibn Gabirol's\nentire oeuvre of poetry as well) is not obscure at all: his\ngoal is to understand the nature of being and human being so that he\nmight better understand and better inspire the pursuit of knowledge and\nthe doing of good deeds: \n\n“And in this way, the soul returns to its higher world.”\nThe ends of humanity (reached through the pursuit of truth and\ngoodness) are imagined by Ibn Gabirol—as we find is the case\namong Neoplatonists more generally—through the evocative image\nof a “return” coupled with the image of a “higher\nworld”: \n\nThe joint imagery of a “return” and a “higher\nworld” are themselves part of a conceptual framework in which all\nof existence is seen to follow a principle of similitude whereby lesser\nbeings mirror higher beings. This idea, often expressed as the idea\nthat “the microcosm mirrors the macrocosm”—a common\nPlatonic, Pythagorean, and Neoplatonic trope—has a strongly\nprescriptive overtone: it's not simply that lesser things mirror\ngreater things, but that in this mirroring, we find the purpose of the\nlesser things, viz. to be just like the greater things. Depending on\nthe context, the “lesser things” and “greater\nthings” might vary, but the most popular version of this\n“microcosm mirrors the macrocosm” idea, and the one at play\nin the above Ibn Gabirol passage, envisions the human being (sometimes\nhuman soul, sometimes human intellect) as the “lesser\nthing” and the wisely ordered cosmos (and sometimes, relatedly,\nthe mind of God or, alternatively, the cosmic Intellect) as the\n“greater thing.” In this descriptive idea that humans\nmirror something greater there emerges the strongly prescriptive\nreminder that we ought to emulate that which is better than ourselves\n(viz. through the pursuit of knowledge and good deeds). This\nprescriptive call to human perfection through truth and goodness is the\nessence of the idea of Neoplatonic Return, and it is this idea which\nlies at the core of Ibn Gabirol's claim that we ought purge our\nsouls of darkness and “return to our like[ness]”. \n\nIn one especially important Fons Vitae passage, we find a\ndescription of this Neoplatonic return which very much reflects\nPlotinus' own famous ascent passage (at Enneads 4.8.1),\na passage reproduced (with important changes) in what misleadingly\nbecame known as the Theology of Aristotle, an Arabic\ncompilation-edition of books 4–6 of Plotinus'\n Enneads.[17]\nHere is the final part of Ibn Gabirol's version: \n\nIn addition to many other changes from Plotinus and the Theology\nof Aristotle, one special point of difference is the reference\nhere to universal matter (see section 5). It is precisely Ibn\nGabirol's unique focus on “universal matter” (a grade\nof spiritual materiality at the very core of existence) which leads him\nto uniquely envision the ultimate moment of Neoplatonic return as a\nmoment of “illuminated shadow”: since there is a material\nelement just “above” Intellect for Ibn Gabirol, the return\nto Intellect will be characterized by the light of Wisdom set within\nthe shade of the supernal first matter. \n\nIn the closing sentences of the Fons Vitae, Ibn Gabirol\nfurther describes this state of “return” as a liberation\nfrom death and a cleaving to the source of life (“Evasio\nmortis et applicatio ad originem vitae,” Fons Vitae\n5.43, p. 338, line 21). Following on general Neoplatonic intuitions,\nthis means that when one has attained the heights of truth and\ngoodness, one will have reverted to one's truest life, a pure\nstate of soul which transcends mortal life—we might describe it\nas a kind of immortality while in the mortal body. This directly\nresonates with what A.H. Armstrong, in his study of Plotinus, has\ndescribed as the Neoplatonic doctrine of “Double Selfhood,”\na sensitivity to the human condition being at one and the same time (1)\nalready fully imbued with the fullest state of intellect, but somewhat\nparadoxically also (2) fallen from—and needing to return to—the \nfullest state of intellect. \n\nWhile Ibn Gabirol's quest towards the Neoplatonic Return\ncenters, as we have seen, on the pursuit of truth and goodness, it also\nincludes an attempt to know the unknowable God. In laying out the kinds\nof truth that the human soul must aim to acquire, the Fons\nVitae speaks of “the knowledge of all things according to\nwhat they are” (Fons Vitae 1.4, p. 6, lines 13–14), and\nmost of all of the knowledge of the First Essence [Latin, essentia\nprima, Arabic, adh-dhât\nal-’ûlâ, as evidenced in some\nof the extant Arabic fragments of the Fons Vitae; see Pines\n1958/77 and Fenton 1976] that sustains and moves all things. While we\nare asked to know God—understood by Ibn Gabirol in tripart\nterms as a hidden First Essence and as an active, manifesting Will and\nWisdom—we are cautioned a few lines later that it is impossible\nto truly know the First Essence, and that we can only aspire to know\nthe things which He makes and sustains (Fons Vitae 1.4, p. 6,\nlines 19–22). As it relates to Ibn Gabirol's more general\ncharacterization of God in the Fons Vitae in tripart terms as\nan essential hidden reality and an active manifesting Will and Wisdom,\nwe might say that for Ibn Gabirol, we can only know God through the\nmanifestation of his Will and Wisdom in the ordered structure of\nexistents in the universe (i.e. through the things which He makes and\nsustains, and in particular, through the wisdom revealed by them). \n\nIbn Gabirol describes God's creative act in many ways across\nhis philosophical and poetic writings. While it is certainly possible\nto find a single overall theological picture emerging from across Ibn\nGabirol's work, it is at least worth noting a degree of tension\nbetween a range of different and sometimes seemingly conflicting ideas.\nIn what follows, we will look at the complex play of creation,\nemanation, Will, Wisdom, Word, and desire in Ibn Gabirol's\ncosmo-ontology. \n\nTo begin with, Ibn Gabirol's God is described as a Creator God\nwho is an absolute simple unity—so simple as to exceed the\ngrasp of the human mind and tongue. This apophatic theme (a theme which\nin any philosopher highlights the absolute unity of God) can be seen\nfor example, in the very first canto of his Keter\nMalkhût [Kingdom's Crown] depiction of God:\n“Yours is the name hidden from the wise…” God, for\nIbn Gabirol, is, in proper Neoplatonic fashion, an absolute unity. That\nsaid, God is nonetheless described in the Fons Vitae by Ibn\nGabirol in dual—and in some sense, tripart—terms:\nGod's unity consists on the one hand in a purely hidden Essence\nand on the other hand in the manifesting activity of a Divine Will. We\nalso learn (thirdly) of God's Wisdom (and in related fashion, of\nthe Divine Word). Emphasizing more of a dual—and less of a\ntripart—vision of this absolutely simple Creator, Ibn Gabirol\nsometimes directly identifies the Divine Will with the divine Wisdom\n(though that does not always seem clear throughout Ibn Gabirol's\nwritings). \n\nWhile God's creative act is described by Ibn Gabirol as a\ncreation ex nihilo (see Fons Vitae 3.3, p. 79, line\n18; FV 3.25, p. 139, lines 24–25) a view normally seen in opposition to\ndoctrines of emanation, he also uses common emanation metaphors—the \nflow of light and the flow of water—to describe the origins\nof the cosmos. For example, drawing on the Psalms 36:10 image\nof a “fountain of life,” in the very title of his Fons\nVitae\n text[18]\nIbn Gabirol seems to at least beckon to Greek and Muslim Neoplatonic\nvisions of an emanating\n God.[19]\nSimilarly stressing an emanating cosmos (though\nnot necessarily the idea of an emanating God per se), Ibn Gabirol—in \nwhat appears to be part of a commentary on Genesis—likens \nthe material core of being (to which we will return in\nsection 5) to a river. Allegorically rendering the Garden of Eden\nwaters to the pure matter which sits at the root of the unfolding\ncosmos, Ibn Gabirol envisions the pulse of existence as a River of Life—a \nvibrant outpouring which links all of existence to a single\noverflowing source (see Sirat 1985, p. 79). Of course, this particular\nimage does not necessarily suggest that God Himself emanates (i.e. the\nidea that existence emanates forth from matter is still consistent with\nGod creating that matter ex nihilo, and not via\nemanation). \n\nAttempting to put all the pieces of Ibn Gabirol's complex\ncosmogony together, we can find pieces of creation ex nihilo,\nemanation, and creation ex aliquo; God's formative act\nbegins with creating matter and form (possibly a creation ex\nnihilo, but described fluidly enough as to leave open other\ninterpretations), and He then draws out, in an emanating flow, the\nremainder of existence from these dual starting points (emanation, but\nalso creation ex aliquo in the sense that all of existence is\nbeing formed through the mediation of matter, as opposed to each\nexistent being created directly—in the sense of\n‘unmediated’—by God as in other versions of\ncreation ex nihilo\n accounts).[20]\nIn the end, Ibn Gabirol's conceptual play—with \nnotions of creation and emanation side by side—ought \nleave us open to various interpretations of how precisely to\nunderstand his cosmogony. \n\nIn his Keter Malkhût poem (Kingdom's\nCrown), Ibn Gabirol further describes God's creative act as\na splitting open of nothingness: “…ve-qara el\nha-’ayîn ve-nivqa…,” (“…and\nHe called out to the nothing and it split open…”; in\nGabirol's poem, Keter Malkhût, canto 9; See\nSchirmann 1967, p. 262, line 82; for a treatment of this line, see\nPines 1980). Here, the void of precreation—the pre-existent\n’ayîn, or “nothingness”—is\nsplit open by God's own voice in the moment of creation—a\nmoment arguably described by Ibn Gabirol in his poem\nahavtîkha (“I Love You”) as the material\n“proto-existence” (kemô-yêsh) awaiting\nits fulfillment through\n form,[21]\nand described in the Fons Vitae as a\ncomplex unfolding of and downward manifesting of a first pure matter\nthrough the introduction of (or unfolding of) forms by the Divine Will.\nThe material nothing—in all three images—is the ground\nof existence, as it is at once the site of desire, a yearning to be\nen-formed, which is to say, to become more and more manifest. We will\nsay more about this emphasis on desire below (see section 4.3). \n\nCentral to Ibn Gabirol's cosmogony is also the notion of the\nDivine Will, an emphasis for which the Fons Vitae is\nhighlighted in the history of ideas. \n\nEarly on in the Fons Vitae, we learn that the Divine Will\nis one of three central concepts that the human mind must set out to\ngrasp (the workings of matter and form, and the reality of a divine\nEssence as primal cause are the other two central concepts). We also\nlearn of Will that it is some sort of cosmic “intermediary\nbetween the extremes,” a role described as central to the basic\nunderpinning of the universe (Fons Vitae 1.7, p. 9, lines\n28–30; see too Fons Vitae 5.36, p 322, line 20–p. 323, line 1\nfor another statement of the three divisions of knowledge; in this\nlatter context, Will is identified with Word). We learn that Will is\nthe power of God infused in and penetrating through all things, that it\nis the power of unity in the universe, and that it is that which both\nbrings forth and moves all of existence. It is also described as the\ndivine force that maintains and sustains the essence of all things (see\nFons Vitae 5.39, p. 327, lines 14–15: Will is the power\n[virtus] of God infused in and penetrating all things; 5.39,\np. 327, lines 26–27: Will is the power [virtus] of unity; 1.2, p. 4,\nlines 14–15: Will is the divine power [virtus] bringing forth\nand moving all things; 1.5, p. 7, line 15: Will maintains and sustains\nthe essence of all things). \n\nTurning further to Will's mediating cosmic role, while the\nLatin text translates “intermediary between the extremes,”\nthe Arabic text uses a dual grammatical form, translating more\nspecifically as “intermediary between the two extremes.” In\nthe context of this claim, the “intermediation” role\nbetween the “two extremes” is ambiguous between two\ndifferent claims which are both equally true within the context of Ibn\nGabirol's worldview: on the one hand, Ibn Gabirol might mean that\nWill intermediates between (1) matter and form on the one hand and (2)\ndivine Essence on the other (the items corresponding to two of the\nthree “divisions of knowledge” which he describes [see\nsection 5]); on the other hand, Ibn Gabirol might mean that Will\nintermediates between (1) matter and (2) form, the two cosmic\n“building blocks” out of which all reality is\ncomprised. \n\nWill is further described as taking its own root in God's\nEssence, and is sometimes (but not always) described as the immediate\ncreative source of (and not just intermediary between) matter\nand\n form.[22]\nComplicating this picture of Will's creation of matter and form,\nwe also learn on the contrary that Will is the direct source only of\nform (and not\n matter)[23]—a \npoint supported further by the claim\nthat Will is (1) identical to Wisdom (and the source of form; see\nFons Vitae 5.42, p. 335, lines 4–5), and (2) that Wisdom is\nthe source only of form (and not matter), with the divine Essence\nitself being the direct source of matter: “…materia\nest creata ab essentia, et forma est a proprietate essentiae, id est\nsapientia et unitate…” (“…matter is\ncreated from Essence, and form is from the property of Essence, viz.,\nfrom Wisdom and Unity…”; Fons Vitae 5.42, p.333,\nlines 4–5; see too 5.42, p. 335, lines 4–5). \n\nLeaving the complexities of these competing claims aside in the\ncontext of this study, it is sufficient here to emphasize that Ibn\nGabirol's theology includes a Divine Will not only responsible\nfor the generation of one or both of matter and form, but responsible\nin some way for the “connection between matter and form” in\nall things, and, as such, responsible for sustaining all existing\nthings (all of which are, for Ibn Gabirol, form and matter composites;\nsee section 5). By sustaining the matter and form composition of all\nthings, Divine Will signifies the permeation of God's creative\nforce at the core of Being itself, and as such at the core of every\nindividual being. \n\nIn addition to identifying Will with Wisdom, Ibn Gabirol also\nidentifies Will with Word (Fons Vitae 5.36, p. 323, line 17).\nFollowing on this identification, in a rather evocative set of\npassages, Ibn Gabirol likens the act of creation to God's\nutterance of word (Fons Vitae 5.43). While this theme is\ncertainly not new within the history of Neoplatonic and Jewish ideas\n(suggesting resonance with the Longer Theology of\nAristotle's reference to the Word [Ar. kalima], as\nwell as resonance with Sêfer Yezîrah's\nemphasis on God's creation via Hebrew\n letters[24]),\nwhat is new is Ibn\nGabirol's unique way of fleshing that idea out in light of his\noverall metaphysics: Creation, writes Ibn Gabirol, is like a word that\nGod utters, and that word is itself the coming together of voice (the\nuniversal matter), the audible sounds that make up a given word\n(manifest forms), and the actual meaning of the word (the hidden\nuniversal form which contains and sustains all manifest forms). For Ibn\nGabirol, this analogy helps highlight his view of the unfolding divine\nWisdom / Will giving way to a cosmos which is a complex blend of\nmatters and forms, with a principle of pure universal matter and pure\nuniversal form at the very root of all existence. \n\nHere, we may speak of a revised Neoplatonic cosmos in which\nprinciples of form, matter and Will (if we are to think of that as\nsomething separate from God's Essence) emerge\n“between” God and the principle of Intellect (the principle\nwhich follows directly upon God in standard chartings of the\nNeoplatonic cosmos): \n\nIn Ibn Gabirol's cosmology, Intellect is highlighted as the\n first created being, as the Divine Glory\n (Kavod),[25]\nand as the first\noccurrence of “form in matter” composition (see Fons\nVitae 5.10, p. 274, line 19; 5.11, p. 277, line 4; for the related\nidea that God creates esse in a composite way out of matter\nand form, cf. Fons Vitae 5.40, p. 329, line 4). At times, Ibn\nGabirol emphasizes that this matter is pre-existent (that it does not\nhave existence on its own without form), and at times, he can be taken,\non the contrary, as emphasizing the “per se\nexistens” nature of matter (as for example in his very\ndefinition of matter at Fons Vitae 1.10, p. 13, lines 15–17\nand 5.22, p. 298, lines 13–7). While the precise meaning of Ibn\nGabirol's idea is open for interpretation, Schlanger suggests\nthat matter per se exists for Ibn Gabirol only as an idea in\nthe mind of God, and not as an actual reality prior to Intellect (see\nSchlanger 1968, p. 294). In this vein, we may note Ibn Gairol's\nclaim that the existence (esse) of matter is in the wisdom of\nGod (Fons Vitae 5.10, p. 275). \n\nReflecting on Ibn Gabirol's idea of some kind of “form\nand matter before Intellect” (either in an actual or in some\nconceptual sense), it is worth considering to what extent this suggests\n(as the above two discrete charts seem to suggest) a genuine departure\nfrom Plotinian Neoplatonism. On the face of it, Plotinus does not\nemphasize a principle of matter and form prior to Intellect. As such,\nwe may say that Ibn Gabirol's emphasis introduces a Ps.\nEmpedoclean change (either an actual ontological change or a\nconceptual “shift in focus”) into the standard Plotinian\npicture. That said, Plotinus certainly is sensitive to the duality of\nthe unity of Intellect (as compared with the unity of the One), and\neven occasionally overtly emphasizes the notion of Intellect's\ncomposition out of “intelligible matter” (See\nEnneads 2.4.1–5, 5.4.2 and 5.5.4; on the conceptual resonance\nof “intelligible matter” in Plotinus and Ibn Gabirol, see\nDillon 1992). While these sections of the Enneads in which\nPlotinus overtly emphasizes this theme are not part of the Arabic\nPlotinus materials which we would presume Ibn Gabirol to have had\naccess, it is worth noting that Ibn Gabirol's emphasis on\n“form and matter prior to intellect” does not necessarily\nrepresent any conceptual departure from Plotinus (or, we might add,\nfrom Platonic and Pythagorean sensitivities to the principle of an\nindefinite dyad at the core of reality). Clearly Plotinus is sensitive\nto the “duality” of any grade of reality outside of the\nOne: while Intellect is for Plotinus a unity, it is clearly a\n“dual” (or even plural) sort of unity as compared with the\nutter unity of the One. In this sense, Plotinus is deeply sensitive to\nthe “duality” outside of God (and, as such, the duality of\nIntellect), even in passages where he is not overtly referencing the\ncomposition of Intellect/Being out of intelligible matter (which is to\nsay, even in passages where he is not emphasizing the dual nature of\nIntellect). In this sense, it is arguably conceptually appropriate to\nalign even Ibn Gabirol's most emphatic sense of the dual\n“matter-with-form” composition of Intellect (or, relatedly,\nhis emphasis on a grade of matter “prior to” Intellect)\nwith even Plotinus' staunchest insistence on the unity of\nIntellect (as for Plotinus, the unity of Intellect, as compared with\nthe unity of the One, is dual by nature). \n\nReturning to our earlier discussion, Ibn Gabirol describes pure\nmatter as stemming directly from the Divine Essence itself, with form,\non the contrary, arising somewhat secondarily\nfrom the Divine Will. While this is not to suggest that God is Himself\nmade up of matter (as concluded by some fans of Ibn Gabirol such as\nDavid of Dinant in the history of Christian philosophy who ran into\ntrouble with the Church for theorizing God as matter), there is\narguably in Ibn Gabirol an intimate link between God and matter. Such a\nlink between materiality and God is not much of a conceptual stretch\n(though in standard Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian contexts we\nwould tend to link God with form): both matter and God are utterly\nhidden and utterly grounding for all else, while form (and the\nWill/Wisdom with which it is associated) mark the lesser\n“active” or “manifesting” mode of divinity and\nof the cosmos. While of course for Ibn Gabirol God is an utter unity,\nwe may nonetheless theorize with Ibn Gabirol as follows: As God's\nessential hiddenness moves forward into action (Wisdom/Will/Word), so\ntoo pure material pre-existence moves forward into manifest being (i.e.\nbecomes more and more en-formed). Here, in an important sense, the\nimages of “darkness and the hidden” trump the images of\n“light and the manifest” both as they relate to God and to\nthe cosmos: as God's hidden Essence precedes and grounds his\nacts, so too matter precedes and grounds enformed being (and as such,\nall existents). Here, God and matter—in their dark / hidden\nrespects—have something very important in common. (See Pessin\n2009, p. 290, for chart mapping the superiority in this regard of the\nmaterial over the formal). \n\nIt ought be noted that herein lies a paradox found in one form or\nanother in all versions of Neoplatonism: on the one hand, there is a\nsense that moving forward (or downward) in the great chain of being is\na tragic fall away from the purity of divine unity; on the other hand,\nthere is a sense (not, for example, found in Gnostic materials) that\nthere is beauty and light in the creation, which is to say that in the\ncontinual downward manifesting of being we find the trace of Divine\nWill. In the context of Ibn Gabirol's conceptual space in which\n(as we will see in more detail in section 5) reality is seen as the\nprocess of moving from a more hidden / material to a more manifest /\nformal reality, the result is at once (1) a sense of loss in the move\naway from God's own hiddenness (with a sense that darkness is\nsublime) and (2) a sense of beauty and increasing grace as more and\nmore forms continue to manifest (“joining” to matter\nthrough the intermediation of the Divine Will), resulting ultimately in\nthe fullness of the cosmos (with a sense that light is sublime). These\ndueling images of the sublimity of unity (or pre-creation) on the one\nhand and manifestness (or creation) on the other (here in terms of the\nsublimity of darkness on the one hand and light on the other) offer an\ninsight into what we may call a Neoplatonic “theology of\nparadox” which is very much at play in Ibn Gabirol. \n\nIn his conception of God's relation to matter in the act of\ncreation, we must also emphasize Ibn Gabirol's focus on desire.\nProviding a bit more context to (and a different translation of) Ibn\nGabirol's Keter Malkhût [Kingdom's\nCrown] rehearsing of God's “splitting of the\nnothing” (see section 4.1), consider: \n\nIn these poetic lines, as elsewhere throughout his writing, Ibn\nGabirol emphasizes the central motion of desire at the core of the\nuniverse. This can be seen throughout the Fons Vitae\nin the dual reminders that (1) all things have matter at their core,\nand (2) matter's own reality consists essentially in desire (viz.\na desiring-after-form). These two simple ideas lead to a much more\narresting insight, viz. inasmuch as all things are grounded in matter,\nand inasmuch as matter is a marker of desire, it follows that all\nreality is grounded in desire. Desire—in the guise of matter—is \nin this sense a central principle of Ibn\nGabirol's\n universe.[26] \n\nIn his vision of the world, Ibn Gabirol's focus is on God,\nDivine Will, and the duality of form and matter. From an early section\nin his Fons Vitae, we learn: \n\nMatter and form—referred to in his Hebrew poetry under the\nalluring Hebrew labels of “yesôd”\n(foundation) and “sôd” (secret)—are,\nalong with the doctrine of Divine Will, cornerstones of the Fons\nVitae. In particular, the Fons Vitae teaches (rather\nunusually within the history of ideas) that all things—including \nspiritual simples such as soul and intellect (but not God)—are \ncomprised of matter and form. This doctrine is called\n“Universal Hylomorphism” by later scholastics in contrast\nto ordinary Aristotelian hylomorphism in which all substances\nother than soul/intellect are said to be comprised of matter\n(Greek: hûlê) and form (Greek:\nmorphê). This doctrine of Universal Hylomorphism emerges\nas a central theological and philosophical point of contention between\nAugustinian Franciscans (who embrace it) and Aristotelian Dominicans\n(who reject it). (It might be noted that one popular way that the\nFons Vitae doctrine comes up in medieval Christian debates is\non the question of whether angels (the separate intellects) are made up\nof matter and form, or just\n form).[27] \n\nHand in hand with the doctrine that all things (including spiritual\nsimples) are matter+form composites is Ibn Gabirol's idea of a\npure spiritual matter at the core of being which grounds even Universal\nIntellect in the great Neoplatonic chain of being. In the extant\nArabic, we find that Ibn Gabirol uses the term\n“al-‘unsur”, or the more descriptive\n“al-‘unsur al-awwal,” first matter (in\ncontrast to other more common Arabic philosophical terms for matter\nwhich Ibn Gabirol himself uses at other points in his\n work).[28]\nIn spite of the\nfact that this term is translated as “materia\nprima” in the Latin, and is as such often translated as\n“prime matter” in English, we need to keep in mind that\nwhatever Ibn Gabirol is talking about is not best thought of as\nAristotelian prime matter (which is what may readers undoubtedly\novertly or covertly think of when they hear the term “prime\nmatter”; see section 2). First of all, Ibn Gabirol's pure\nmatter is part of an overtly Neoplatonic world-view which, contra\nAristotle, privileges spiritual/intelligible substances over\nsensible/corporeal reality, and which, contra Aristotle and Plato,\nemphasizes the emanation of the sensible realm from the spiritual\nrealm. Further emphasizing that we are not talking of Aristotelian\nprime matter is the fact that Ibn Gabirol's use of the Arabic\nterm al-‘unsur (literally “the element,” and\ntranslated by the 13th century Hebrew editor as\n“yesôd” (foundation)) expressly mirrors a\nPs. Empedoclean tradition of a spiritual matter (called\nal-‘unsur) immediately outside of God. For these\nreasons, it is important to avoid Aristotelian resonances when\nconstructing Ibn Gabirol's ontology, and as such, one ought use\nthe term First Matter over “prime matter.” \n\nOf this first pure matter we learn at the very start of the Fons\nVitae that it is “…per se existens, unius\nessentiae, sustinens diversitatem, dans omnibus essentiam suam et\nnomen” (“…existent in and of itself, of a\nsingle essence, sustaining diversity, and giving to everything its\nessence and name”; Fons Vitae 1.10, p. 13, lines 15–17).\nAnd, in similar manner we learn at the very close of the Fons\nVitae that it is: “…substantia existens per se,\nsustentatrix diversitatis, una numero; et…est substantia\nreceptibilis omnium formarum” (“…a substance\nexistent in and of itself, the sustainer of diversity, one in number;\n…it is a substance receptive to all forms”; Fons\nVitae 5.22, p. 298, lines 13–7; compare with facing Arabic text at\nPines 1958/77, p. 53, section 9:2). Related to its status as the\n“sustainer of diversity,” pure matter is presented as the\nfundamental receiver that always seeks to receive its partner, viz.\nform. Pure universal matter is thus coupled—in a process\noverseen by Divine Will—with a pure universal form to yield the\nfirst fully existing substance, Universal Intellect. In their coupling,\nmatter and form thus mark the permeating presence of Divine Will in the\nuniverse. Related to his vision of a matter-to-form coupling through\nWill, Ibn Gabirol envisions the Neoplatonic emanating chain of being as\nan ever-descending series of matter-to-form couplings, and so: \n\nHere, a hylomorphic lens is put onto the standard Neoplatonic\nhierarchy emphasizing the composition of all things (spiritual simples\nas well as bodies) in terms of matters and forms (and highlighting\nthree kinds of matter: spiritual, celestial, and\n terrestrial).[29]\nAnd with this\nhylomorphic lens emerges too the emphasis on Divine Will, the active\npresence of God responsible in some way for “mediating”\nbetween these matters and forms. \n\nIn the context of this hylomorphic vision, we find a confounding\nflipping in the Fons Vitae between ordinary negative and\nunexpected positive descriptions of the notion of\n matter.[30] \n The universal pure matter certainly has a positive set of associations\nwith it in Ibn Gabirol as compared with “corporeal” (or\n“lower”) matter: in contrast to “lower” matter\nwhich carries the 9 Aristotelian categories, “higher”\nmatter is the matter of pure spiritual simples and carries no quantity\nor quality (or any of the 9 categories). Again, mindful of the\nEmpedoclean tie-in and of his Hebrew terminology of\n“yesôd” (foundation), we are looking at\nsomething quite sublime, a reality which sits, as it were, directly\noutside of God prior even to Intellect, which he likens to a Divine\nThrone (see Fons Vitae 5.42, p. 335, lines 23–4), and which\nhe correlates to the more essential (and hidden) reality of God. In\nthese and related contexts in Ibn Gabirol, matter often emerges\n(somewhat unexpectedly within the history of ideas) as more sublime\n than even pure form.\nAnd yet, there are plenty of passages in\nthe Fons Vitae in which it is form which reigns supreme (as\nwe would expect in standard Platonic, Aristotelian, and Neoplatonic\ntraditions): for example, form is identified as the cosmic source of\nunity and light, and it is form which is said to perfect or complete\nmatter by bringing being to it (although, as we have emphasized, it is\nstill plausible that for Ibn Gabirol matter per se still has\nsome kind of pre-existent—and perhaps superior—subsistence \nprior to and independent of this gift of being from\nform). Further highlighting form's supremacy, Ibn Gabirol\nargues, for example, that the substance of Intellect is superior to\nthe substance of body precisely because the former contains all forms\nand the latter contains only some forms (see Fons Vitae 3.9,\np. 98, line 24– p. 99, line 3), an argument which relies on the\nintuition that formality (not materiality) is the ontological marker\nof supremacy (and an argument which seems directly at odds with the\nintuitions behind another of his ideas, viz.  that we ought call\na higher substance “matter” with respect to a lower\nsubstance). In the final account, we can see Ibn Gabirol as\nuniquely sensitive to the equal importance of both matter and form,\ntheir intimate interdependence one upon the other, and, ultimately,\ntheir unity as a single whole—a dynamic arguably mirroring his\nvision of God's own reality in terms of essential and active\n“moments” which are ultimately one inseparable unity. \n\nOne way to think of Ibn Gabirol's hylomorphic levels of\nreality (although Ibn Gabirol does not himself theorize it in this way\novertly) is in terms of his Neoplatonizing the Platonic notion of\nparticipation. For Plato, participation is in a form, and a highest\nform—participated in by all—is the form of being. For\nthe Neoplatonist, as for Ibn Gabirol, the focus on the form is replaced\n(or amplified) by the focus on the Universal Intellect that contains\nall forms (simultaneously, in potency, as one nested in the next).\nImagine the conceptual implication of this Neoplatonic focus on\nIntellect (versus a Platonic focus on the form of being) for a\nparticipation theory—if we think of it carefully, we will find\nthat the Neoplatonic model can quite organically gives rise to the kind\nof hylomorphic focus we find in Ibn Gabirol: In a Neoplatonic\nIntellect, all the forms are “in” Intellect, a notion which\ncan easily be seen as emphasizing Intellect's material role as\nsustainer. This would mean that the move from Platonic talk of forms to\nNeoplatonic talk of Intellect organically invites a new focus on the\nrole of [spiritual] matter (viz. the matter of Intellect by which it\nreceives or holds all the forms). This immediately transforms the\nPlatonic concept of participating in form/s to the concept of\nparticipating in matter (the receiver) (or, we might say, participating\nin matter as the means to participating in forms). And so, whereas for\nPlato all things participate in the form of being, for Ibn Gabirol, all\nthings are grounded in / have as their underlying “true\nsubstrate” the substance of Intellect which is to say, they\nparticipate in matter (viz. the spiritual matter of pure intellect)\nplus forms. \n\nIbn Gabirol's metaphysics are obviously influenced by\nAristotle's talk of substance and its 9 categories. And yet, it\nwould be a mistake to think of Ibn Gabirol as an Aristotelian in much\nof his use of the term “substance.” \n\nTo confuse things, Ibn Gabirol does use the term substance in an at\nleast somewhat Aristotelian sense when he talks of corporeal substance—the \nsubstance which, a la Aristotle, receives the 9 categories.\nIbn Gabirol argues that this substance is first enformed by the form of\ncorporeity, or quantity (one approach among many ancient and medieval\ninterpretations of Aristotle, even if not actually\nAristotle's\n view).[31]\nMoving\nalready, though, from anything even loosely Aristotelian and\nmanifesting a more Platonic impulse, this substance is seen by Ibn\nGabirol as “lower substance” marking the lowest extremity\nof reality. Continuing on this Platonic move away from Aristotle, Ibn\nGabirol's main talk of “substance” refers, contra\nAristotle, to “simple substances,” by which he means the\nNeoplatonic Universal Intellect and Soul(s), each understood by Ibn\nGabirol as a joining of spiritual matter to spiritual form, and each\ndevoid of any of the 9 categories plaguing the “lower”\ncorporeal (i.e. Aristotelian) substance. These simple substances\n(exemplified in the simple substance of Intellect) are theorized as the\nintermediaries between God and lower substance. \n\nWe may begin to understand this sense of substance by noting that\nwith other Platonists and Neoplatonists, and deviating from\nAristotelian sensibilities, Ibn Gabirol envisions a “higher\nrealm” as that which is most real. However, whereas standard\nPlatonisms identify forms as the truest realities within that realm,\nIbn Gabirol adopts a hylomorphic (but by no means\nAristotelian) sensibility in his conception of the higher\nrealities: unlike Aristotle for whom only items in the corporeal realm\nare form+matter composites, for Ibn Gabirol, the realities in the\n“higher realm” (a Platonic idea avoided by Aristotle) are\nalso comprised of form+matter. This move turns a number of standard\nAristotelian, Platonic and Neoplatonic sensibilities on their heads in\na Gabirolean metaphysics, including the notion of substance. \n\nSpeaking of substance in the sense of “true substance”\nseparate from (and higher than) corporeal substance, Ibn Gabirol, in\nline with other Platonisms and contra Aristotle, is referring to a\n“higher realm.” However, unlike Plato, Ibn Gabirol focuses\n(with Neoplatonists) on the substances of Intellect and Soul(s)—which \nis to say, the reality of all forms “in” the simple\nspiritual substances (of Intellect and Soul), not on forms per se (see\nsection 5.1 above). In this sense, the spiritual simples are primarily\nnot the forms (as we might expect in Plato), but (in Neoplatonic\nspirit) the Universal Intellect and Soul. Relatedly, unlike other\nPlatonisms, Ibn Gabirol's higher realm is not theorized as a\nrealm of forms but as a realm of form and matter (again see section 5.1\non how the talk of Intellect leads us to the talk of forms\n“in” matter). This also means that with Aristotle, Ibn\nGabirol employs a lot more hylomorphic talk than Platonists (though\napplied to a completely non-Aristotelian “higher\nrealm”). \n\nThis also means that contra the standard Neoplatonic (and Platonic)\nrhetorics of “matter as evil,” there emerges in Ibn Gabirol\na concurrent discourse of “matter as supreme”: for Ibn\nGabirol, both form and matter in the “higher realm” carry\nwith them all the positive associations which form carries in standard\nPlatonic pictures (including a trajectory of thought in Ibn Gabirol on\nwhich pure matter arguably emerges as more sublime than pure form). \n\nIn the context of this analysis, we might also say a word about the\ndoctrine of “the plurality of forms,” a doctrine associated\nwith the Fons Vitae by later Christian scholastics. Taken in\ncontrast to the Aristotelian doctrine that each existent has a single\nsubstantial form (ensuring its unity as a substance), “the\nplurality of forms” doctrine describes the Universal Hylomorphic\nsense in which each existent has a number of essential forms (and\nmatters). In our highly Neoplatonic Gabirolean context (but less so in\nRoger Bacon and other Christian Universal Hylomorphists), we can simply\ntake this doctrine as an extension of the standard Plotinian idea that,\nas part of the great chain of being, any given existent is saturated\nthrough with the reality of the hypostases Soul and Intellect: in this\nsense, each existent has a number of essences, corresponding to the\nvarious “layers” (for Ibn Gabirol,\n“form+matter” spiritual simples) in the great chain of\nbeing. \n\nIbn Gabirol can be seen as offering us a revised version of the\nNeoplatonic great chain of being, adding an emphasis on Will, matter\nand form (and, in light of section 5, we might say a number of levels\nof matters and forms). With other Jewish Neoplatonists (see Isaac\nIsraeli for example), Ibn Gabirol also envisions not one but three\nWorld Souls, and a Universal Intellect which he describes in his\nKeter Malkhut [Kingdom's Crown] as “the\nSphere of Intellect” (in his Hebrew, galgal\nha-sâkhel), an odd and creative locution which blurs\nastronomical and metaphysical conceptions: generally the languages of\n“sphere” and “intellect” do not mix, the former\nreferring to the celestial realm, and the latter referring to\nsomething well beyond the celestial realm. To these Neoplatonic layers\nof Intellect and Souls, and following mostly in the spirit of astronomy\nof his day (with the exception, that is, of his positing Intellect as a\nso-called “10th sphere” in contrast to the more\naccepted Ptolemaic system of 9 spheres; see Tanenbaum 1996 and Loewe\n1979), Ibn Gabirol also envisions a hierarchy of star fields and\nplanetary orbs, a cosmic picture which he lays out in great detail in\nhis Keter Malkhut poem. Moving from God outward, we find the\nlayers as follows: \n\nAbove even the “Sphere of Intellect” is the Divine\nThrone, which we know from the Fons Vitae refers to pure\nuniversal matter “between” God and Intellect (on matter as\nThrone, see Fons Vitae 5.42, p. 335, lines 23–4; for a great\ndiagram see Loewe 1989, p. 114). \n\nIt should be noted that it is in reference to the above chart of the\ncelestial levels of stars and planets that we find in various medieval\nMuslim and Jewish thinkers—for example in al-Farabi and in\nMaimonides—a Neoplatonized Aristotelian focus on a hierarchy of\n“separate intellects,” the last of which (generally\nconstrued as the 10th intellect lowest down—with God\nconceived either as the first such Intellect or as an Intellect above\nthis enumeration altogether) being described as the “Active Intellect”\nwhich governs the sublunar realm, and is that to which human minds\n“conjoin” (through the process of\n ittisâl).[32]\nIt is important to\ndistinguish this system from the one at play in Ibn Gabirol: whereas\nal-Farabi, Maimonides, and others focus their attention on a Return to\n(or a “conjunction with”) the 10th lowest down\nof the separate intellects (the Active Intellect as the intellect\nassociated with our earthly realm below the moon), Ibn Gabirol's\nfocus is, as in Plotinus, on an Intellect at the very heights of the\ncelestial world, and just outside of God's own being: Whereas Ibn\nGabirol's “10th sphere” is a Sphere of Intellect just\noutside of God, Maimonides' “10th\nIntellect” corresponds to the sphere of Moon (just above Earth).\nThis point is often confused in secondary literature, and can lead to\nproblematic misunderstandings and misconstrued correlations between\nphilosophical systems. \n\nReturning full circle to our start (see section 3), Ibn\nGabirol's emphasis even in his elaboration on a celestial\nhierarchy centers on the Neoplatonic concern with the cultivation of\nthe human soul—its Return to its highest fullness in Intellect:\nfrom a series of planets, we immediately move to Intellect\n(“galgal ha-sêkhel”), the ground and goal of\nthe virtuous human life. \n\nIn addition to his philosophical writing, Ibn Gabirol is\nauthor to an extensive corpus of Hebrew poems (generally categorized\ninto “religious” and “secular” poems) which it\nis beyond the scope of this entry to\n address.[33] \n\nAside from Ibn Gabirol's technical prowess as a poet, it is\nworth noting that Ibn Gabirol's own self-conception as a poet (a\ntheme overtly and self-referentially explored in many of his poems)\nopens important philosophical questions about the nature of language,\nselfhood and divinity. In, for example, drawing parallels between\nGod's act of creation (by Word), and the poet's /\nphilosopher's own act of writing, Ibn Gabirol arguably invites us\nto reconceptualize human subjectivity, the sacred, and the relationship\nbetween philosophical theory-building and imagino-poetic play.","contact.mail":"spessin@du.edu","contact.domain":"du.edu"}]
