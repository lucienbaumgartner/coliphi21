Proposals for a unified\nglobal political authority have existed since ancient times—in\nthe ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and\nphilosophers. Recently, some have argued that a world government is\nalready here, or nascent in contemporary conditions of capitalist\nglobalization. There is much debate about whether global institutional\ndevelopments towards a world state are inevitable or contingent,\nstable or subject to reversal, and whether unifying economic and\npolitical developments are to be desired or feared, justified or\nillegitimate, actively promoted or resisted.\n\n\nProponents of world government offer distinct reasons for why\nit is an ideal or necessary form of political organization. Some are\nmotivated negatively and see world government as functionally\nthe definitive solution to old and new human problems such as\nwar and the development of weapons of mass destruction, global poverty\nand inequality, global financial instability, infectious disease and\npandemics, and environmental degradation and climate change. More\npositively, some have advocated world government as a proper\nreflection of the unity of the cosmos, under reason or God, or as the\nteleological end-state of struggles for recognition or moral freedom\nor the perfection of humanity. Proponents have also differed\nhistorically in their views of the form of government that a\nworld state should take. While medieval thinkers advocated world\ngovernment under a single monarch or emperor who would possess supreme\nauthority over all other lesser rulers, modern proponents of world\ngovernment generally have not advocated a wholesale dismantling of the\nsovereign states system but incremental innovations in global\ninstitutional design to move humanity toward pacific world federalism\nor cosmopolitan democracy.\n\n\nCritics of world government come from a wide political spectrum, from\nradical and postcolonial to liberal to far right political adherents.\nCritics have offered three main kinds of objections—to do with\nthe feasibility, desirability and necessity of establishing a common\nglobal political authority.\n\n\nThis entry will, first, outline the historical development of ideas of\nworld government, as well as objections to it, through a selective\ndiscussion of the idea’s history in Western political thought.\nThe entry will focus on Dante’s medieval treatise on the\nnecessity of a world monarch or emperor, and then consider mainly\narguments by Hobbes, Rousseau and Kant that reveal more skepticism\nabout world government as a solution to the problem of war and peace\namong sovereign states. The historical background section will\ncontinue with the revival of ideas of world government in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, prompted by imperial and colonial\nactivity, technological developments, economic globalization, and the\nexperience of two devastating world wars. While debates about world\ngovernment during the Cold War were pervaded by the ideological\ndivision of the world, the section concludes with a discussion of the\nacceleration of neoliberal globalization, following the end of the\nCold War, as well as resistance to it, on the prospects, promise, and\nperils of world state formation.\n\n\nSecond, the entry will explore debates in contemporary theory. One set\nof debates is located within international relations theory, between\nrealist and neorealist, “international society”, liberal\ninternationalist, republican, and constructivist schools, over the\npossibility and desirability of global structural transformation from\nanarchy to hierarchy. A second set of discussions about world\ngovernment is located within contemporary liberal theory, between John\nRawls and his cosmopolitan liberal critics, over the institutional\nimplications of liberal commitments to both normative individualism\nand the value of freedom as collective self-determination. A third set\nof debates among contemporary republican and democratic theorists\nrevolves around the question of whether a world state would fulfill or\ndestroy the conditions necessary to support republican nondomination\nand democratic justice. A related, fourth set of debates involve\ncritical and postcolonial theoretical critiques of the nascent global\nstate emerging from the ascendancy of neoliberalism and persistence of\npatriarchal and racial capitalism.\n\n\nThere is lively debate between scholars within and between these sets\nof discussions about the feasibility, desirability, and necessity of\nuniting humanity under a world government. In current conditions, it\nis apparent that persistent and pervasive structural inequalities at\nthe global level make health, security, prosperity, human rights,\nglobal justice, and environmental protection unevenly accessible, and\nseriously inaccessible, to a significant portion of the Earth’s\ninhabitants. In the context of the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century, it is uncertain whether world government is a\npolitical institutional project that, even if effectively pursued,\nwould fulfill humanity’s collective aspirations for a\nsustainable peace of justice and freedom, or whether it will\ndisappoint or haunt those who reach out for it.\n\n—Alfred, Lord Tennyson, “Locksley Hall” (1837)\n \nUnited States President Harry Truman, who oversaw the founding of the\nUnited Nations after the Second World War, kept these lines from\nTennyson’s poem in his wallet (Kennedy 2006: xi). After this\nbrutal global war that claimed over fifty million lives, just like\nafter the previous world war in which almost ten million perished,\nordinary people and statespersons alike sought to establish a post-war\ninternational order that would be able to prevent another war of\nglobal devastation from occurring. In fact, since the problem of war,\nor large-scale socially organized violence, has been with us\nthroughout human history, the ideal of a universal community of\nhumankind living in perpetual peace was not at all new. \nDerek Heater’s history of ideas of world government and\ncitizenship begins by noting their presence in ancient Chinese and\nIndian as well as Graeco-Roman thought (1996: ix–x). According\nto Heater, the concept of human unity produced an ideal that such\nunity ought to be expressed in political form. The exact nature of\nthat form, however, has changed radically over time. While Stoic ideas\nabout the oneness of the universe were politically inchoate, they\ninspired medieval Christian proposals for a global political\nauthority; at the same time, the historical model of imperial Rome (or\nits myths) inspired medieval quests for world empire. \nThe Italian poet, philosopher, and statesperson, Dante\n(1265–1321), perhaps best articulated the Christian ideal of\nhuman unity and its expression through a world governed by a universal\nmonarch. In The Banquet [Convivio], Dante argued\nthat wars and all their causes would be eliminated if \nthe whole earth and all that humans can possess be a monarchy, that\nis, one government under one ruler. Because he possesses everything,\nthe ruler would not desire to possess anything further, and thus, he\nwould hold kings contentedly within the borders of their kingdoms, and\nkeep peace among them. (Convivio, bk 4, ch 4 [2000: 169]) \nIn De Monarchia (1309–13: 8]), a full political\ntreatise affirming universal monarchy, Dante draws on Aristotle to\nargue that human unity stems from a shared end, purpose or function,\nto develop and realize fully and constantly humanity’s distinct\nintellectual potential. In Book I, Dante argues that peace is a vital\ncondition for realizing this end, and peace cannot be maintained if\nhumanity is divided. Just as “[e]very kingdom divided against\nitself shall be laid waste” (Monarchia bk 1, ch. V,\nquoting Luke 11:17 [1995: 10]), since humankind shares one goal, \nthere must therefore be one person who directs and rules mankind, and\nhe is properly called “Monarch” or “Emperor”.\nAnd thus it is apparent that the well-being of the world requires that\nthere be a monarchy or empire. (Monarchia bk 1, ch. V [1995:\n10]) \nMost importantly, when conflicts inevitably arise between two rulers\nwho are equals, “there must be a third party of wider\njurisdiction who rules over both of them by right”; a universal\nmonarch is necessary as \na first and supreme judge, whose judgment resolves all disputes either\ndirectly or indirectly. (Monarchia bk 1, ch. X [1995:\n14]) \nIn the absence of a universal monarch, humanity is “transformed\ninto a many-headed beast”, striving after “conflicting\nthings” (Monarchia bk 1, ch. XVI [1995: 28]); humankind\nordered under a universal monarch, however, \nwill most closely resemble God, by mirroring the principle of oneness\nor unity of which he is the supreme example. (Monarchia bk 1,\nch. VIII [1995: 19]) \nDante completes his treatise by extolling the Roman Empire as a part\nof God’s providence (Monarchia bks 2 and 3 [1995:\n30–94). And while Dante argued for a universal emperor whose\ntemporal power was distinct from the pope’s religious power, and\nnot derivative from the latter, he envisioned that God’s will\nmust require pope and emperor to forge a cooperative and conciliatory,\nrather than competitive and antagonistic, relationship. \nThe idea of uniting humanity under one empire or monarch, however,\nbecame an ambivalent appeal by the seventeenth century with the\nentrenchment in Europe of the system of sovereign states after the\nPeace of Westphalia (1648). At the same time, European encounters with\nnon-European worlds precipitated European ambitions based on the\nprinciple of promoting civilization as an organizing framework for\nlegitimizing European imperial and colonial expansion into other parts\nof the world (Keene 2002). \nIn Leviathan (1651), Hobbes (1588–1679) gave the\nquintessential formulation of sovereignty as supreme legal coercive\nauthority over a particular population and territory. Hobbes argued\nthat although mutual vulnerabilities and interests lead individuals to\ngive up their liberties in the state of nature, in exchange for\nprotection—thereby instituting sovereign states—the\nmiseries that accompany a plurality of sovereign states are not as\nonerous to individuals, hence there is less rational basis for\npolitical organization to move towards a global leviathan: \nbecause states uphold the Industry of their Subjects; there does not\nfollow from the international state of nature, that misery, which\naccompanies the Liberty of particular men. (1651: ch. 13 [1986:\n188]) \nContrary to realist interpretations of Hobbes in international\nrelations thought, Hobbes did not consider international law or\ncooperation between sovereign states to be impossible or impractical.\nAnticipating the development of international law, collective security\norganizations, the League of Nations and the United Nations, he\naffirmed the possibility and efficacy of leagues of commonwealths\nfounded on the interests of states in peace and justice: \nLeagues between Common-wealths, over whom there is no humane Power\nestablished, to keep them all in awe, are not onely lawfull [because\nthey are allowed by the commonwealth], but also profitable for the\ntime they last. (1651: ch. 22 [1986: 286]) \nIn Hobbes, we find the first articulation of the argument that a world\nstate is unnecessary, although he envisaged that the development of a\nlawful interstate order is possible, and potentially desirable. \nIn the eighteenth century, Charles Castel, Abbé de Saint-Pierre\n(1658–1743), in his Project for Making Peace Perpetual in\nEurope (1713), extended Hobbes’s argument that a rational\ninterest in self-preservation necessitated the creation a domestic\nleviathan to the international realm, asserting that reason should\nlead the princes of Europe to form a federation of states by social\ncontract. The contracting sovereigns would form a perpetual and\nirrevocable alliance, establishing a permanent Diet or Congress that\nwould adjudicate all conflicts between the contracting parties. The\nfederation would also proscribe as “a public enemy”\n(Rousseau 1756 [1917: 63]) any member who breaks the Treaty or\ndisregards the decisions of the congress; in such a situation, all\nmembers would “arm and take the offensive, conjointly and at the\ncommon expense, against any State put to the ban of Europe” in\norder to enforce the decisions of the federation (1756 [1917:\n61–4]). In other words, perpetual peace can be achieved if the\nprinces of Europe would agree to relinquish their sovereign rights to\nmake war or peace to a superior, federal body that guaranteed\nprotection of their basic interests. \nIn his comments on this proposal, Rousseau (1712–78)\nacknowledged its perfect rationality: \nRealize this Commonwealth of Europe for a single day, and you may be\nsure it will last forever; so fully would experience convince men that\ntheir own gain is to be found in the good of all. (1756 [1917:\n93]) \nTo Rousseau, however, existing societies had so thoroughly corrupted\nhumans’ natural innocence that they were largely incapable of\ndiscovering their true or real interests. Thus, the\nAbbé’s proposals were not utopian, but they were not\nlikely to be realized “because men are crazy, and to be sane in\na world of madmen is itself a kind of madness” (1756 [1917:\n91]). At the same time, Rousseau noted that the sovereigns of Europe\nwere not likely to agree voluntarily to form such a federation: \nNo Federation could ever be established except by a revolution. That\nbeing so, which of us would dare say whether the League of Europe is a\nthing more to be desired or feared? It would perhaps do more harm in\nthe moment than it would guard against for ages. (1756 [1917:\n112]) \nThis consequentialist objection to the idea of world\ngovernment speculates that even if it were desirable, the process of\ncreating a world government may produce more harm than good; the\nnecessary evils committed on the road to establishing a world\ngovernment would outweigh whatever benefits might result from its\nachievement. \nRousseau viewed war as a product of defectively ordered social\ninstitutions; it is states as public entities that make war, and\nindividuals participate in wars only as members or citizens of states.\nFar from viewing the achievement of a domestic leviathan as moral\nprogress, Rousseau noted that the condition of a world of entangled\nsovereign states puts human beings in more peril than if no such\ninstitutions existed at all. Isn’t it the case, he argued,\nthat \neach one of us being in the civil state as regards our fellow\ncitizens, but in the state of nature as regards the rest of the world,\nwe have taken all kinds of precautions against private wars only to\nkindle national wars a thousand times more terrible? And that, in\njoining a particular group of men, we have really declared ourselves\nthe enemies of the whole race? (1756 [1917: 56]) \nIn Rousseau’s view, the solution to war is to establish\nwell-governed societies, along the lines he established in The\nSocial Contract (1762); only in such contexts will human beings\nrealize their full rational and moral potential. To establish\nperpetual peace, then, we should not pursue world government, but the\nmoral perfection of states. A world of ideal societies would have no\ncause for war, and no need for world government. \nKant tried, in his Idea for a Universal History with a\nCosmopolitan Purpose (1784), to refute the claim that the\ndevelopment of the domestic state constituted a moral step backwards\nfor humankind, by placing it and its trials \nin the history of the entire species, as a steadily advancing but slow\ndevelopment of man’s original [rational] capacities. (1784\n[1991: 41]) \nNature employs the “unsociableness of men” to motivate\nmoral progress; thus war is a means by which nature moves states \nto take the step which reason could have suggested to them even\nwithout so many sad experiences—that of abandoning a lawless\nstate of savagery and entering a federation of peoples in which every\nstate, even the smallest, could expect to derive its security and\nrights not from its own power or its own legal judgment, but solely\nfrom this great federation (Foedus Amphictyonum), from a\nunited power and the law-governed decisions of a united will. (1784\n[1991: 47]) \nThis is the “inevitable outcome” (1784 [1991: 48]) of\nhuman history, a point Kant reiterated in Perpetual Peace\n[1795], when he argued that rationality dictated the formation of \nan international state (civitas gentium), which would\nnecessarily continue to grow until it embraced all the peoples of the\nearth. (1784 [1991: 105]) \nIn present conditions, however, Kant noted that “the positive\nidea of a world republic cannot be realized”, thus his\ntreatise on perpetual peace begins with the social fact of a world of\ndistinct but interacting states. What would be required, given such a\nworld, to achieve perpetual peace? Kant makes three arguments. First,\nevery state must have a republican constitution that guarantees the\nfreedom and equality of citizens through the rule of law and\nrepresentative political institutions. The internally well-ordered\nrepublican state is less likely to engage in wars without good\nreason; \nunder a constitution where the subject is not a citizen, and which is\ntherefore not republican, it is the simplest thing in the world to go\nto war. (1784 [1991: 100]) \nSecond, such internally well-ordered states would need to enter into a\n“federation of peoples”, which is distinct from an\n“international state” (1784 [1991: 102]). A \npacific federation (foedus pacificum) … does not aim\nto acquire any power like that of a state, but merely to preserve and\nsecure the freedom of each state in itself, along with that of the\nother confederated states. (1784 [1991: 104]) \nIn this context, a federal union of free and independent states, he\nargued, \nis still to be preferred to an amalgamation of the separate nations\nunder a single power which has overruled the rest and created a\nuniversal monarchy. \nHis reasons against a universal monarchy combine fears of an\nall-powerful and powerless world government: \nFor the laws progressively lose their impact as the government\nincreases its range, and a soulless despotism, after crushing the\ngerms of goodness, will finally lapse into anarchy. (1784 [1991:\n113]) \nMost forcefully articulating the tyranny objection, Kant argued that a\n“universal despotism” would end “in the graveyard of\nfreedom” (1784 [1991: 114]). The third condition for perpetual\npeace in a world of distinct but interacting states is the observance\nof cosmopolitan right, which Kant limits to universal hospitality.\nAlthough the human race shares in common a right to the earth’s\nsurface, Kant argued that strangers do not have entitlements to settle\non foreign territory without the inhabitants’ agreement. Thus,\ncosmopolitan right justifies visiting a foreign land, but not\nconquering it, which Kant criticized the commercial states of his day\nto have done in “America, the negro countries, the Spice\nIslands, the Cape” and East India (1784 [1991: 106]). \nKant’s views on the desirability of world government were\nclearly complex (Kokaz 2005: 87–92; Pogge 2009). On the one\nhand, Kant provides two of the most trenchant objections to world\ngovernment. The tyranny argument posits that world government\nwould descend into a global tyranny, hindering rather than enhancing\nthe ideal of human autonomy (Kant 1795 [1991]). Instead of delivering\nimpartial global justice and peace, a world government may form an\ninescapable tyranny that would have the power to make humanity serve\nits own interests, and opposition against which might engender\nincessant and intractable civil wars (Waltz 1979; DuFord 2017). In\nanother argument against its desirability, the inevitable remoteness\nof a global political authority would dilute the laws, making them\nineffectual and meaningless. The posited weakness of world government\nleads to objections based on its potential inefficiency and\nsoullessness (Kant 1795 [1991]). \nOn the other hand, Kant also provides a republican vision of world\ngovernment based on universal reason. His endorsement of the ideal of\nhuman unity prompted him to see a world republic, under which free and\nequal individuals, united by one global sovereign, would achieve a\n“fully juridical condition” (Pogge 2009: 198), as the\nideal end of the progress of human history. At the same time,\nKant’s faith in human unity through reason coexisted with his\nsubscription to a theory of racial hierarchy in human development, and\nhe came to be critical of the dominant modes of European expansionist\npolicies in world politics in the late eighteenth\ncentury—through colonial wars, exploitation, and\nconquests—as undermining the moral progress of Europeans (Valdez\n2019). More generally, Kant condemned any move towards a universal\nmonarchy, because a monarchy, in contrast to a republic, does not\nguarantee, but undermines, the freedom and equality of individuals.\nAlthough a world republic is Kant’s ultimate political ideal, a\nuniversal despotic monarch that exercises power arbitrarily is\nequivalent to a global anarchic state of nature, which is his ultimate\ndystopia. In between lies his “realistic utopia” (Rawls\n1999: 11–6) consisting of a federation of free (republican)\nstates short of a world state. As Habermas has put it, \nThis weak conception of a voluntary association of states that are\nwilling to coexist peacefully while nevertheless retaining their\nsovereignty seemed to recommend itself as a transitional stage en\nroute to a world republic. (2010: 268) \nKant’s work shows that even in the eighteenth century, debates\nabout world government were alive and well, including arguments by\nradical political cosmopolitans such as Anacharsis Cloots\n(Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots, 1755–1794), who\nused social contract theory to advocate the abolition of the sovereign\nstates system in favor of a universal republic encompassing all\nhumanity (Kleingeld & Brown 2002). At the same time, philosophical\nprojects for perpetual peace in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies were Eurocentric in adopting Europe as the centre of world\norder, in failing to recognize non-European peoples in equal standing,\nand in obscuring the global inequalities and injustices being\nestablished by European commercial enterprises and states (Pitts 2018:\n6–7). \nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed revivals of proposals\nfor world government that were fueled by racialized theories of\nprogress that buttressed European-led colonial and imperial expansion\nover much of the world, technological developments in travel and\ncommunications, the rapid ascent of a global capitalist system, as\nwell as the devastating impact of wars fought with modern technology.\nTheories of “scientific racism” continued to pervade\nEuropean thought on world order: \nWhite supremacist visions of global governance circulated widely in\nthe Anglo-American world. (Bell 2018: 871) \nOne of the most prominent proponents of world order, H.G. Wells\n(1866–1946), envisaged in 1901 a “New Republic” of\nAnglo-American dominance, and while he repudiated racial theories, his\nvision of a universal world state included a civilizing mission (Wells\n1902; Bell 2018: 870). The construction of racial and civilizational\nhierarchies, backed by military domination, meant that the inclusion\nof non-Europeans and non-whites, whether in imperial projects,\ncolonial civilizing missions, or later, in a system of formally\nindependent states embedded in a capitalist global economy, would be\nmarked by deep asymmetries and inequalities in standing, status,\nrights, burdens, and powers (Anghie 2005; Bell 2019; Getachew\n2019). \nIn the Second World War, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki, atomic scientists lobbied for the international control of\natomic energy as a main function of world federalist government.\nAlbert Einstein wrote in 1946 that technological developments had\nshrunk the planet, through increased economic interdependence and\nmutual vulnerability through weapons of mass destruction. Although his\nadherence to the idea of a world government to guarantee interstate\npeace preceded the development of nuclear weapons, Einstein’s\nadvocacy gained momentum with the risk of nuclear annihilation: \nA world government must be created which is able to solve conflicts\nbetween nations by judicial decision. This government must be based on\na clear-cut constitution which is approved by the governments and\nnations and which gives it the sole disposition of offensive weapons.\n(1946 [1950: 132]; Nathan & Norden 1960) \nOrganizations such as the United World Federalists (UWF), established\nin 1947, called for the transformation of the United Nations into a\nuniversal federation of states with powers to control armaments. World\npeace required that states should give up their traditional\nunrestricted sovereign rights to amass weapons and wage war, and that\nthey should submit their disputes to authoritative international\ninstitutions of adjudication and enforcement; world peace would only\nbe achieved through the establishment of world law (Clark & Sohn\n1958/1960 [1962]). \nCalls for world government in the post-World War Two era implied a\ndeep suspicion about the sovereign state’s potential as a\nvehicle for moral progress in world politics. Emery Reves’\ninfluential The Anatomy of Peace, is a condemnation of the\nnation-state as a political institution: “The modern Bastille is\nthe nation-state, no matter whether the jailers are conservative,\nliberal or socialist” (1945: 270). Echoing Rousseau, Reves\nargued that nation-states threaten human peace, justice and freedom,\nby diverting funds from important needs, prolonging a global climate\nof mistrust and fear, and creating a war machine that ultimately\nprecipitates actual war. The experience of the world wars thus made it\nespecially difficult to view states as agents of moral progress. David\nMitrany, perhaps motivated by such suspicions, bracketed the idea of a\nworld federation or world state, and focused on the role that “a\nspreading web of international activities and agencies” could\nplay in the pursuit of world integration and peace (1966: 38;\nTrachtman 2013). \nSome did not reject the nation-state per se, but only\nauthoritarian nondemocratic states as unfit partners for building a\npeaceful world order. The Atlantic Union Committee (AUC), formed in\n1949 by Clarence Streit, for example, called for a federal union of\ndemocratic states that would be the genesis of a \nfree world government, as nations are encouraged by example to\npractice the principles which would make them eligible for membership,\nnamely the principles of representative government and protection of\nindividual liberty by law. (1950, quoted in Baratta 2004: 470; for a\ncritique see Rosenboim 2017) \nIn the context of the Cold War (1945–89), however, the division\nof the world into two ideologically opposed camps—led by the\nUnited States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n(USSR)—produced mutual distrust that pervaded the reception of\nall proposals for world government. Soviet opposition to all Western\nproposals as attempts to impose “American monopolistic\ncapitalism” on the world (Goodman 1953: 234) made the world\nfederalist movement’s goal of establishing a universal\nfederation infeasible. The Soviet leadership also condemned the\nAUC’s proposal for an exclusive union of democracies as part of\nthe Cold War rivalry—an attempt to strengthen the anti-communist\n(anti-Soviet) bloc. \nIn a distorted fashion, the Soviet Union became the historical\nmanifestation of socialist or communist thought. Socialist ideas can\nbe traced back to the French Revolution, but developed more fully as a\nresponse to negative aspects of the rapid growth of industry in the\nnineteenth century. At the same time that technological advancements\npromised great material progress, the changes they wrought in social\nand economic relations were not all positive. While the many workers,\nor “proletarians”, in new industrial factories worked\nunder terrible conditions for meager wages, the few factory owners,\n“the bourgeoisie” or “capitalists”, amassed\ngreat wealth and power. According to Karl Marx (1818–1883),\nhuman history is a history of struggles not between nations or states,\nbut between classes, created and destroyed by changing modes of\nproduction. The state as a centralized, coercive authority emerges\nunder social modes of production at a certain stage of development,\nand is only necessary in a class society as the coercive instrument of\nthe ruling class. The capitalist economic system, however, contains\nwithin it the seeds of its own destruction: capitalism necessitates\nthe creation of an ever-growing proletarian class, and a global\nrevolution by the proletariat will sweep away “the conditions\nfor the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally”\n(Marx & Engels 1848 [1988: 75]). The state will fall along with\nthe fall of classes: \nThe society that will organize production on the basis of a free and\nequal association of the producers will put the whole machinery of\nstate where it will then belong: into the Museum of Antiquities, by\nthe side of the spinning wheel and the bronze axe. (Engels 1884 [1978:\n755]) \nIn a communist vision, capitalism is a necessary but transitional and\nephemeral order of things; the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism\nby forces it unleashed itself is necessary to attain a new world\norder, “in which the free development of each is the condition\nfor the free development of all” (Marx & Engels 1848 [1988:\n75]). World peace and freedom as nondomination for all (Roberts 2017),\nincluding freedom from the “alienated” or\n“estranged” labor (Marx 1844 [1978: 71–81]) produced\nunder capitalism, will be achieved through the transformation of a\ncapitalist to a communist social order: \nIn proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation\nvanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\n(Marx & Engels 1848 [1988: 73]) \nThe Russian revolutionary, V.I. Lenin (1870–1924), drew on Marx\nto argue that the proletarian class needed to seize the coercive\napparatus of the state to oppress the resisters and exploiters, the\nbourgeoisie, however, Lenin was committed to world revolution, and to\nthe view that the state is “the organ of class rule”, and\nthat even the \nproletarian state will begin to wither away immediately after its\nvictory because the state is unnecessary and cannot exist in a society\nin which there are no class antagonisms. (Lenin 1918: 65) \nIn the context of the post-World War I world that witnessed the\ncollapse of empires as well as the fortification of others, buttressed\nby the League of Nations, Lenin’s vision of a new communist\nworld order entailed an appeal to the colonized to mount\nanti-imperialist revolutions. This contrasted with U.S. President\nWoodrow Wilson’s less radical interpretation of\nself-determination as good self-government, a formulation that was\nconsistent with the civilizing narrative based on racial hierarchies,\nand the continuation and extension of a colonial international order\n(Pedersen 2015). \nLater Soviet leaders and elites who rejected Western proposals for\nworld federation somewhat inconsistently envisaged the transcendence\nof nation-states and world capitalism, and the establishment of a\nworld socialist economy governed by a “Bolshevik World\nState” (Goodman 1953: 231). In communist ideology, ultimately,\nbalance-of-power politics between states enjoying unrestricted\nsovereignty did not cause war; the real cause of war was capitalism.\nIn practice, the Soviet Union’s internally and externally\nrepressive policies made a mockery of socialist ideals of a classless\nsociety, or a world of peaceful socialist republics, and the\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union itself spelled the practical end of\none alternative to a capitalist world order. \nThe end of Cold War ideological divisions led some to have great\nexpectations in the 1990s of enhanced global cooperation to rid\nhumanity of the threat of global nuclear annihilation and to increase\nglobal commerce and spread prosperity, the material bases for building\na truly global moral and political community of humankind. The end of\nthe twentieth century was marked by an unbridled faith and optimism in\nthe inexorable twin triumph of capitalism and liberal democracy as the\nend of history (Fukuyama 1992). With the collapse of Soviet-style\nstate socialism, the world witnessed neoliberal transformations on a\nglobal scale, driven by the “ideology of free markets, trade\nliberalization, deregulation, and the small state” (Lüthi\n2020: 596). Quinn Slobodian has described the paradoxical ascendancy\nof “globalist” neoliberalism, entailing the development of\na world state and regulatory laws that privileged the\n“encasement” of markets from domestic democratic\nregulation and accountability, leading to an institutional project to\nredesign “states, laws, and other institutions to protect the\nmarket” (2018: 4 and 6). As neoliberalism spread on a global\nscale, so did the deterioration of conditions for robust democratic\npolitics, precipitating serious backsliding of democratization. \nThe optimism of the 1990s and early 2000s was thus short-lived as a\nvariety of persistent and deepening structural injustices of the\nmodern international system produced conditions ripe for violent\nconflict and mass atrocities, the global war on terror after 2001, the\nglobal financial crisis of 2007–9, growing numbers of displaced\npeople, rising socioeconomic inequality, and the hollowing out of\nsocial welfare protections, not to mention the disruptive consequences\nwrought by climate change, and the Covid-19 global pandemic. The\npersistence of racial subordination and gender inequalities, as well\nas the ascendancy of a neoliberal world order, have provoked much\ncritical debate about how these and other dominating hierarchies,\nbacked by powerful international institutions, law, states, and\ncorporations, can be tamed or overthrown, or how the crises they\ngenerate may accelerate structural transformations at the global level\nin a more emancipatory direction. \nContemporary international relations theory developed out of the\nurgent need to explain and predict the causes of war and peace in\nworld politics. International relations theory has also developed in\nresponse to globalization, which has wrought “fundamental\nchanges in the spatial and temporal contours of social\nexistence” (Scheuerman 2002 [2018]), characterized by the uneven\nincrease and intensification of social interconnectedness, economic\nintegration, and the “shrinkage of geographic distance on a\nworld scale” (Keohane 2001). While much of international\nrelations theory’s approach to world government has remained\nfocused on the problem of overcoming interstate anarchy for the sake\nof human security in the face of common global threats, a\n“global politics paradigm” (Zürn 2018) has emerged\nwhich understands world government as only one possible institutional\ndevelopment among others in a system of global governance\ncharacterized by the co-constitution of transnational, international\nand domestic realms of politics and political contestation. \nContemporary international “realists” or\n“neorealists” claim not to evaluate the contemporary\nstates system in normative terms. They liken the international order\nto a Hobbesian state of nature, where notions of justice and injustice\nhave no place, and in which each unit is rationally motivated to\npursue every means within its power to assure its own survival, even\nat the expense of others’ basic interests. Some realists have\nthus held that ideas of world government constitute exercises in\nutopian thinking, and are utterly impractical as a goal for human\npolitical organization. Assuming that world government would lead to\ndesirable outcomes such as perpetual peace, realists are skeptical\nthat world government will ever materialize as an institutional\nreality, given the problems of egoistic or corrupted human nature, or\nthe logic of international anarchy that characterizes a world of\nstates, all jealously guarding their own sovereignty or claims to\nsupreme authority. World government is thus infeasible as a solution\nto global problems because of the unsurpassable difficulties of\nestablishing “authoritative hierarchies” at the global or\ninternational level (Krasner 1999: 42). Furthermore, Kenneth Waltz, in\nhis seminal account of neorealism, Theory of International\nPolitics, clearly favors a system of sovereign states over a\nworld government (1979: 111–2). World government, according to\nWaltz, would not deliver universal, disinterested, impartial justice,\norder or security, but like domestic governments, it would be driven\nby its own particular or exclusive organizational interests, which it\nwould pursue at the expense of the interests and freedom of states.\nThis realist view thus provides a sobering antidote to liberal and\nother progressive narratives that foretell peace through\ninterdependence. \nWilliam Scheuerman has argued (2011: 67–97), however, that\nso-called “classical” realists of the mid-twentieth\ncentury were more sympathetic to ideas of global institutional reform\nthan contemporary realists. “Classical” and\n“progressive” realists such as Reinhold Niebuhr, E.H.\nCarr, and Hans Morgenthau, as well as John Herz and Frederick Schuman,\nsupported a global reformist agenda, prompted by the advent of\neconomic globalization, technological change, modern total warfare,\nand the nuclear revolution. Although a desirable end-goal, the\nfeasibility of global political change towards a world government in\nthe form of a global federal system, according to Reinhold Niebuhr,\nwould depend on deeper global social integration and cohesion than was\nevident in the mid-twentieth century (Scheuerman 2011: 73). In\naddition, Niebuhr was concerned that absent the required social and\ncultural basis for global political unity, the achievement of world\ngovernment would be undesirable, since in such conditions, a world\ngovernment would require authoritarian devices to rule, raising the\nspecter of a global tyrannical power (72–6). Others, such as\nJames Burnham, posited that a world state could only arise through\nimperial conquest (Deudney 2019). Despite these caveats, realist\nprudence-based as well as functional arguments for a Weberian world\nstate have gained traction again (Cabrera 2010; Ulaş 2016; Araujo\n2018; Craig 2019). \n“International society” theorists, or the “English\nschool”, argue that although there is no central overriding\nauthority above sovereign states, their relations are not wholly\nlawless or devoid of authoritative and enforceable norms and rules for\nconduct. The anarchy between states does not preclude the concept of a\nnorm-governed society of states (Bull 1977). Since\n“international society” theorists do not see the absence\nof a central global authority as necessitating a state-eat-state\nworld, they regard the idea of world government as unnecessary, and\npotentially dangerous, since it may serve as a cloak in the struggle\nfor imperial domination between states. Martin Wight has noted that\nthe moral ideals of cosmopolitanism typically translate in practice\ninto political tyranny and imperialism (1991). As an alternative to\nworld government, and echoing both Rousseau and Kant, Chris Brown\nforwards \nthe ideal of a plurality of morally autonomous, just communities\nrelated to one another in a framework of peace and law. (1995:\n106) \nEstablishing an international society, ideally conceived, would make a\nsupreme world government unnecessary. Andrew Hurrell, however, argues\nthat \nit is important to recognize the extent to which social, environmental\nand, above all, technological change is likely to affect the\nscale of governance challenges, the sources of\ncontrol and governance, and the subjects of control. (2007:\n293) \nFor these reasons, Hurrell does not consider a retreat to a\ntraditional state-based pluralism to be feasible, but argues that the\ndevelopment of a “stable, effective and legitimate international\nsociety” requires redressing global inequality through the\nsignificant redistribution of political power to buttress the\ncollective political agency of the weak and marginalized (2007:\n318).Liberal internationalist accounts of world order are motivated by\nmore than just the traditional preoccupation with problems of war and\npeace. This school of international relations thought, more than the\npreceding two, is explicitly critical of traditional accounts of state\nsovereignty. Richard Falk has depicted the contemporary world order as\none of “inhumane governance”, identifying the following\nills: global severe poverty affecting more than one billion human\nbeings, denial of human rights to socially and culturally vulnerable\ngroups, the persistent use and threat of war as an instrument of\npolitics, environmental degradation, and the lack of transnational\ndemocratic accountability (1995: 1–2). A liberal\ninternationalist agenda is advanced when progress is made on\nalleviating or correcting these ills. However, Falk is explicit\nthat \nhumane governance can be achieved without world government,\nand that this is both the more likely and more desirable course of\naction. (1995: 8) \nBy world government, Falk means a form of global political\norganization that has, at minimum, the following features: \ncompulsory peaceful settlement of all disputes by third-party decision\nin accordance with law; general and complete disarmament at the state\nand regional levels; a global legislative capacity backed up by\nenforcement capabilities; and some form of centralized leadership.\n(1995: 7) \nInstead of world government, Falk calls for “transnational\ndemocratic initiatives” from global civil society as well as\nUnited Nations reform, both of which would challenge and complement\nthe statist and market forces that currently produce our contemporary\nglobal ills (1995: 207). Most liberal international theorists thus\nenvision the need for authoritative international and global\ninstitutions that modify significantly the powers and prerogatives\ntraditionally attributed to the sovereign state. \nAnne-Marie Slaughter has also rejected the idea of cosmopolitan\ndemocracy and a global parliament as infeasible and unwieldy (2004: 8\nand 238). Slaughter is an advocate of “global governance”,\nin the sense of “a much looser and less threatening concept of\ncollective organization and regulation without coercion”, to\nsolve common global problems such as transnational crime, terrorism,\nand environmental destruction (2004: 9). According to Slaughter,\nstates are not unitary, but “disaggregated” and\nincreasingly “networked” through information, enforcement,\nand harmonization networks (2004: 167)—producing \na world of governments, with all the different institutions that\nperform the basic functions of governments—legislation,\nadjudication, implementation—interacting both with each other\ndomestically and also with their foreign and supranational\ncounterparts. (2004: 5) \nA networked world order, she argues, \nwould be a more effective and potentially more just world order than\neither what we have today or a world government in which a set of\nglobal institutions perched above nation-states enforced global rules.\n(2004: 6–7) \nAlthough Slaughter is keen to highlight the promise of “global\ngovernance through government networks” as “good public\npolicy for the world and good national foreign policy” (2004:\n261), she acknowledges that in contemporary world conditions of\nradical social, economic and political inequality between states and\npeoples, effective and fair global governance will require the\nnetworks comprising global governance to abide by the norms of\n“global deliberative equality”, toleration of reasonable\nand legitimate difference, and “positive comity” in the\nform of consultation and active assistance between organizations; in\naddition, global governance networks would need to be made more\naccountable through a system of checks and balances, and more\nresponsive through the principle of subsidiarity (2004: 244–60).\nWithout movement towards a more equitable world of mutual respect,\nhowever, it is difficult to see actually existing global governance\nnetworks operating in an impartial and generous spirit to help \nall nations and their peoples to achieve greater peace, prosperity,\nstewardship of the earth, and minimum standards of human dignity.\n(2004: 166) \nIn this vein, Thomas Weiss has lamented the intellectual and political\nshifts in perspective from world government to global governance,\narguing that current voluntary associations, organizations and\nnetworks at the global level are “so obviously inadequate”\nto meeting global challenges that we \nare obliged to ask ourselves whether we can approach anything that\nresembles effective governance for the world without institutions with\nsome supranational characteristics at the global level. (2009:\n264) \nWhile many contemporary international relations theorists seem to\nreject the feasibility, desirability, or necessity of world\ngovernment, constructivist theorist Alexander Wendt has argued that\nthe “logic of anarchy” contains within it the seeds of\ntransformation towards a “global monopoly on the legitimate use\nof organized violence—a world state” (2003: 491). Using\nAristotelian and Hegelian insights, Wendt offers a teleological\naccount of the development of world order from an anarchic states\nsystem to a world state, arguing that \nthe struggle for recognition between states will have the same outcome\nas that between individuals, collective identity formation and\neventually a state. (2003: 493) \nTechnological changes, especially those that increase the “costs\nof war” as well as “the scale on which it is possible to\norganize a state”, affect the struggle for recognition among\nstates, undermining their self-sufficiency and making a world state\n“inevitable” (2003: 493–4). Wendt draws on the work\nof Daniel Deudney (1995 and 1999), who argued that the evolution of\ndestructive technology makes states as vulnerable as individuals in a\nHobbesian state of nature: \nHence nuclear one-worldism—just as the risks of the state of\nnature made it functional for individuals to submit to a common power,\nchanges in the forces of destruction increasingly make it functional\nfor states to do so as well. (Wendt 2003: 508) \nDeudney, however, has recently argued that the world state solution,\ninvolving a top-down hierarchical mode of government, is impractical\nand conceptually dead; his proposed alternative is a\n“negarchic”, republican-federalist conception of world\norder that solves the problems of anarchy through the development of\nregimes of mutual restraint and obligation, but without the risk of\ndespotism or totalitarianism accompanying hierarchical world\ngovernment (2019 and 2020). \nAccording to Wendt, however, the path of world state formation is\ninevitable, and would be characterized by the emergence of “a\nuniversal security community”, in which members expect to\nresolve conflicts peacefully rather than through force; a\n“universal collective security” system that ensures the\nprotection of each member should “crimes” occur; and a\n“universal supranational authority” that can make binding\nauthoritative decisions about the collective use of force (2003: 505).\nDriving this transformation is the struggle for recognition, and\nthe \npolitical development of the system will not end until the\nsubjectivity of all individuals and groups is recognized and protected\nby a global Weberian state. (2003: 506; for a critique of teleological\narguments about institutional forms, see Levy 2020) \nWendt recognizes that powerful states enjoying the benefits of\nasymmetrical recognition may be most resistant to world state\nformation. He argues, however, that with the diffusion of greater\nviolence potential to smaller powers (such as al-Qaeda and North\nKorea), \nthe ability of Great Powers to insulate themselves from global demands\nfor recognition will erode, making it more and more difficult to\nsustain a system in which their power and privileges are not tied to\nan enforceable rule of law. (2003: 524) \nBased on the assumption that systems tend to develop toward stable\nend-states, a world state in which individuals and \nstates alike will have lost the negative freedom to engage in\nunilateral violence, but gained the positive freedom of fully\nrecognized subjectivity. (2003: 525) \nis the inevitable end-state of the human struggle for recognition. At\nthe same time that Wendt sees world state formation as an inevitable\ntrajectory of the struggle for recognition between individuals and\ngroups, he argues that a world state could take various forms: while\ncollectivizing organized violence, it need not collectivize on a\nglobal scale culture, economy or local politics; while requiring a\nstructure that “can command and enforce a collective response to\nthreats”, it need not abolish national armies, or require a\nsingle UN army; and while it requires a procedure for making binding\nchoices, \nit would not even require a world “government”, if by this\nwe mean a unitary body with one leader whose decisions are final.\n(2003: 506) \nWe now turn to debates about world government among contemporary\nliberal theorists. Since the publication of John Rawls’s\nlandmark A Theory of Justice in 1971, liberal theorists such\nas Charles Beitz and Thomas Pogge have sought to formulate a\ncosmopolitan version of liberalism by extending Rawlsian principles of\ndomestic justice to the international realm. According to Beitz, a\ncosmopolitan liberal conception of international morality is \nconcerned with the moral relations of members of a universal community\nin which state boundaries have a merely derivative significance. (1979\n[1999a: 181–2]) \nCosmopolitan liberalism evaluates the morality of domestic and\ninternational institutions based on “an impartial consideration\nof the claims of each person who would be affected” (1999b:\n287). A cosmopolitan liberal theory of global justice thus begins with\na conception of humanity as a common moral community of free and equal\npersons. There is debate among contemporary theorists about the\nrelationship and distinction between moral cosmopolitanism and\npolitical or institutional cosmopolitanism in the form of a world\nstate or government (Beitz 1994; Dufek 2013; Ypi 2013; Cabrera 2018\nand 2019). \nContemporary liberal theorists have traditionally argued that world\ngovernment, in the form of a global leviathan with supreme\nlegislative, executive, adjudicative and enforcement powers, is\nlargely unnecessary to solve problems such as war, global poverty, and\nenvironmental catastrophe. World government so conceived is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to achieve the aims of a liberal agenda (Yack\n2012). Even cosmopolitan liberals have not argued that moral\ncosmopolitanism necessarily entails political cosmopolitanism in the\nform of a world government. \nAlthough Rawls himself rejects cosmopolitan liberalism, disagreeing\nwith his liberal critics on several critical issues related to global\ndistributive justice, they are united in their agreement that a world\nstate is not part of a liberal ideal for world order. In his treatise\non global order, The Law of Peoples, Rawls forwards the\nconcept of a society of peoples, governed by principles that will\naccommodate “cooperative associations and federations among\npeoples, but will not affirm a world-state” (1999: 36). He\nexplicitly states his reason for rejecting the idea of a world state\nor government: \nHere I follow Kant’s lead in Perpetual Peace (1795) in\nthinking that a world government—by which I mean a unified\npolitical regime with the legal powers normally exercised by central\ngovernments—would either be a global despotism or else would\nrule over a fragile empire torn by frequent civil strife as various\nregions and peoples tried to gain their political freedom and\nautonomy. (1999: 36) \nOther liberal thinkers have similarly rejected the desirability of\nworld government in the form of a domestic state writ large to cover\nthe entire globe (Beitz 1999b: 182; Jones 1999: 229; Tan 2000 and\n2004; Pogge 1988: 285; Satz 1999: 77–8; Risse 2012). \nIn a related objection, “communitarian” liberals, such as\nMichael Walzer, argue against a centralized world government as a\nthreat to social pluralism. Walzer thus endorses “sovereign\nstatehood” as “a way of protecting distinct historical\ncultures, sometimes national, sometimes ethnic/religious in\ncharacter”, and rejects a centralized global order because he\ndoes not \nsee how it could accommodate anything like the range of cultural and\nreligious difference that we see around us today. … For some\ncultures and most orthodox religions can only survive if they are\npermitted degrees of separation that are incompatible with globalism.\nAnd so the survival of these groups would be at risk; under the rules\nof the global state, they would not be able to sustain and pass on\ntheir way of life. (2004: 172 and 176) \nAt the same time that distinct communities may constitute intrinsic\nhuman goods, Walzer also endorses social and political pluralism as an\ninstrumental good: given the diversity of human values, he argues that\nthey \nare best pursued politically in circumstances where there are many\navenues of pursuit, many agents in pursuit. The dream of a single\nagent—the enlightened despot, the civilizing imperium, the\ncommunist vanguard, the global state—is a delusion. (2004:\n188) \nA world of distinct, autonomous communities may be important to\ncurbing the appetite of a hegemonic or global state to re-make the\nworld in its own image. Liberal nationalists and communitarians thus\nobject to world government due to the homogeneity\nargument—world government may be so strong and pervasive as to\ncreate a homogenizing effect, obliterating distinct cultures and\ncommunities that are intrinsically valuable. Liberal political\npluralists (Muñiz-Fraticelli 2014) are concerned that any\nstate, including a world government, could destroy associative groups\nthat constitute legitimate sources of political authority; and by\ndestroying the rich social pluralism that animates human life (Walzer\n2004), produce a loss of value (Miller 2007; Valentini 2012). \nThe liberal rejection of world government, however, does not amount to\nan endorsement of the conventional system of sovereign states or the\ncontemporary international order, “with its extreme injustices,\ncrippling poverty, and inequalities” (Rawls 1999: 117).\nRawls’s rejection of a world government does not negate the\nlegitimacy and desirability of establishing international or\ntransnational institutions to regulate cooperation between peoples and\neven to discharge certain common inter-societal duties. Thus, after\nhis rejection of a world state, Rawls goes on to say that in a\nwell-ordered society of peoples, organizations \n(such as the United Nations ideally conceived) may have the authority\nto express for the society of well-ordered peoples their condemnation\nof unjust domestic institutions in other countries and clear cases of\nthe violation of human rights. In grave cases they may try to correct\nthem by economic sanctions, or even by military intervention. The\nscope of these powers covers all peoples and reaches their domestic\naffairs. (1999: 36) \nRawls’s vision of global order clearly rejects a world of\natomistic sovereign states with the traditional powers of absolute\nsovereignty. Instead, his global vision includes “new\ninstitutions and practices” to “constrain outlaw states\nwhen they appear” (1999: 48), to promote human rights, and to\ndischarge the duty of assistance owed to burdened societies. \nThomas Pogge argues that realizing \na peaceful and ecologically sound future will … require\nsupranational institutions and organizations that limit the\nsovereignty rights of states more severely than is the current\npractice. (2000: 213) \nHe sees this development to be possible only when a majority of states\nare stable democracies (2000: 213–4). Pogge thus appears to\nagree with Rawls that the path to perpetual peace (and environmental\nsafety) lies in promoting the development of well-ordered states,\ncharacterized by democratically representative, responsive and\nresponsible domestic governments. \nAs these lines of argument by Rawls and Pogge suggest, liberals have\nbeen quick to reject framing the choice of world orders as one between\neither a world of traditional sovereign states or a\nworld with a global central government. Pogge has asserted that\nliberals should \ndispense with the traditional concept of sovereignty and leave behind\nall-or-nothing debates about world government. \nInstead, he argues for an \nintermediate solution that provides for some central organs of world\ngovernment without, however, investing them with [exclusive]\n“ultimate sovereign power and authority”. (1988: 285) \nIn this “multi-layered scheme in which ultimate political\nauthority is vertically dispersed”, states that retain ultimate\npolitical authority in some areas would be juxtaposed with a world\ngovernment with “central coercive mechanisms of law\nenforcement” that has ultimate political authority in other\nareas (Pogge 2009: 205–6). Debra Satz has also argued that\nframing the choice as one between the current states system and\n“an all-powerful world-state” poses a false dilemma: \nthe contrast between a system of sovereign states and a centralized\nworld-state is too crude. There are many other possibilities,\nincluding a state system restrained by international and\nintergovernmental institutions, a non-state-based economic system, a\nglobal separation-of-powers scheme, international federalism, and\nregional political-economic structures, such as those currently being\ndeveloped in western Europe and the Americas (via NAFTA). (Satz 1999:\n77–8) \nSimon Caney has also endorsed a system of international institutions\ndesigned to \nprovide a reliable and effective means of protecting people’s\nbasis interests (and instrumental consideration) and also to provide a\nfair forum for determining which rules should govern the global\neconomy (a procedural component). (2006: 734) \nAs the many liberal proposals for moral improvement of the world order\nindicate, liberal objections to world government—whether they\ntake the form of tyranny/homogeneity arguments and/or the\ninefficiency/soullessness objections—are not motivated by a\ncomplacent attitude towards the contemporary world order and its\nresulting conditions (Pogge 2000). As Charles Jones has put it, these\nvalid and plausible objections to world government do not show that\n“the status quo is preferable to some alternative\narrangement” (1999: 229). While liberal theorists acknowledge\nthe tyrannical potential of a world government, they also acknowledge\nthat “sovereign states are themselves often the cause of the\nrights-violations of their citizens” (1999: 229). Kok-Chor Tan\ncharacterizes liberal proposals for world order to involve, therefore,\nneither world government nor absolute state sovereignty. Instead,\nliberals have argued consistently for restrictions on the traditional\npowers of sovereignty, as well as for the vertical dispersion of\nsovereignty, “upwards towards supranational bodies, and also\ndownwards toward particular communities within states” (2000:\n101). In such a world order, states become “another level of\nappeal, and not the sole and final one” (2000: 101). \nDavid Held argues that this dispersion of sovereignty is inevitable\ngiven that the nation-state does not exist in an insular world, but a\nhighly interdependent and complex system: the contemporary reality\nconsists of a globalized economy, international organizations,\nregional and global institutions, international law, and military\nalliances, all of which operate to shape and constrain individual\nstates. Although national sovereignty still has a place in the\ncontemporary world order, \ninterconnected authority structures … displace notions of\nsovereignty as an illimitable, indivisible and exclusive form of\npublic power. (1995: 137) \nIn Held’s account of cosmopolitan democracy, the universal\nrealization of the liberal ideal of autonomy, derived from Kant,\nultimately requires long-term institutional developments such as the\ncreation of a global parliament, an international criminal court, the\ndemilitarization of states, and global distributive justice in the\nform of a guaranteed annual income for each individual (1995:\n279–80). Although cosmopolitan theorists tend to reject the\ndichotomy posed between a political system of sovereign states and one\nwith a centralized world government, and have tended to eschew the\nterminology of the world state in their accounts of global democratic\ninstitutional reform, William Scheuerman has argued that some of their\nproposals of supranational institutions mimic core attributes of\ntraditional statehood, thus inadvertently bringing the world state\nback into liberal cosmopolitan visions of world order (2014). It is\nthus an open question whether “statist cosmopolitanism”\n(Ypi 2011), which considers states as viable agents of cosmopolitan\njustice, is feasible, or whether cosmopolitanism requires transcending\nthe state system (Ulaş 2017). \nDemocratic, republican and critical theorists have become concerned\nwith the global context of order and justice due to its importance for\nestablishing protective external conditions for the moral and\npolitical achievements of centuries of domestic democratic political\nstruggle. Traditionally, the main global threat was interstate war,\nthus the projects for perpetual peace. Today, democratic theorists\nworry that contemporary processes of globalization are undermining the\nachievements of democratic societies in the areas of civil and social\nrights such as access to education and healthcare, and the economic\nsecurities provided by the welfare state. From this perspective,\neconomic globalization and the growing power of international and\ntransnational institutions pose a potential threat to democratic\nideals of civic equality and self-determination. The task of the\ndemocratic theorist is to think about how democracies can respond to\nthese global developments in ways that best help preserve the fragile\nachievements of domestic democratic justice (Habermas 2004 [2006]; see\nalso Scheuerman 2008). Increasingly, theorists of global democratic\nreform envisage the need to develop new institutions and practices of\nrepresentation and accountability rather than merely to extend\ntraditional constitutional models and electoral mechanisms of domestic\ndemocratic governance (Archibugi 2008; Macdonald 2008; Marchetti 2008;\nTinnevelt 2012; Tanyi 2019; Erman 2019). \nKey to discussions in democratic, republican and critical theory about\nglobal order and justice is the political ideal of nondomination.\nNeo-republican theorist Philip Pettit understands commitment to this\nideal to entail reducing people’s vulnerability to alien control\nor the arbitrary power of others to interfere with their choices and\ntheir lives. In the international context, Pettit has outlined a\n“republican law of peoples” that has the twin goals of\nensuring that every people is represented by a non-dominating\ngovernment in a non-dominating international order (2010). Starting\nwith a world of states, Pettit argues that a state which is\n“effective and representative of its people” fulfills the\nrepublican ideal of nondomination, and “it would be\nobjectionably intrusive of other agents in the international\norder” to bypass such states and assume responsibility for its\nmembers (2010: 71–2). A legitimate international order is\none \nin which effective, representative states avoid\ndomination—whether by another state, or by a non-state\nbody—and seek to enable other states to be effective and\nrepresentative too. (2010: 73) \nIn an international context, the sources of domination include other\nstates; “non-domestic, private bodies” such as\n“corporations, churches, terrorist movements, even powerful\nindividuals”; and “non-domestic, public bodies” such\nas the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (2010: 77). While representative states\nrealize nondomination internally for their members, individuals’\nenjoyment of freedom as nondomination is not secured unless their\nstates are protected in their external relations from dominating\nstrategies, including “intentional obstruction, coercion,\ndeception, and manipulation” as well as\n“invigilation”, and “intimidation” (2010:\n74). \nPettit’s account presupposes the legitimacy of domestic\ndemocracies that ensure nondomination as a starting point for thinking\nabout a legitimate international order, and he explicitly rejects the\nidea of a world state, modeled on a domestic republican regime, as an\ninfeasible remedy for the challenges posed by domination in an\ninternational context (2010: 81; but see Koenig-Archibugi 2011). There\nis no easy solution, but Pettit considers feasible improvements to the\ncurrent international order can be made by further developing\nmultilateral \ninternational agencies and forums by means of which states can work\nout their problems and relations in a space of more or less common\nreasons \nas well as fostering greater solidarity among subgroups of weaker\nstates so that they can form rival blocs that can resist domination by\nmore powerful agents (2010: 84). While Pettit is mostly concerned with\nthe dominating potential of powerful states, and considers\ninternational agencies to be less threatening (2010: 86),\nCécile Laborde adds to Pettit’s account not only a\nconcern for agent-relative domination, but also, and more centrally,\nsystemic domination, which entails a greater awareness of the\ndominating potential of international organizations such as the\nInternational Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization and the World\nBank (2010). One of the ways that powerful states dominate weak states\nis by “entrenching and institutionalizing” their dominant\nposition through unfair international social structures in areas such\nas trade (2010: 57). \nIndeed, Nancy Kokaz, in a republican interpretation of Rawls’s\nLaw of Peoples, argues that “a global republic cannot\nbe dismissed by a civic [republican] theory of global justice”\n(2005: 94). The civic pluralist ideal that is threatened by the advent\nof global capitalism and ensuing deracination requires “a global\nstate powerful enough to protect local communities” from the\nhomogenizing tendencies and “excesses of global\ncapitalism” (2005: 93). In a further development of republican\nideas about global order and justice, James Bohman has argued that a\nrepublican ideal of freedom as nondomination in the new global\n“circumstances of politics” requires political struggle in\nthe direction of transnational democracy (2004 and 2007). According to\nBohman, \nunder conditions of globalization, freedom from tyranny and domination\ncannot be achieved without extending our political ideals of\ndemocracy, community and membership. (2004: 352) \nNot only are currently bounded democratic communities ineffective in\nresisting new global sources and forms of domination, they are also\n“potentially self-defeating”, constituting \na thousand tiny fortresses in which the oldest form of domination is\npracticed at many different levels: the domination of noncitizens by\ncitizens, or nonmembers by members, using their ability to command\nnoninterference much like those who live within gated communities.\n(2007: 175 and 180) \nDaniele Archibugi has termed this \ndemocratic schizophrenia: to engage in a certain [democratic] behavior\non the inside and indulge in the opposite [undemocratic] behavior on\nthe outside. (2008: 6) \nSuch vicious circles of “democratic domination” can only\nbe overcome by making borders, membership and jurisdiction the\nsubjects of democratic deliberation across dêmoi\n(Bohman 2007: 179). Whether or not democracy serves global justice\ndepends on the possibility of transnational democratization, and\nBohman sees two primary agents of such transformation, in democratic\nstates pursuing “broadly federalist and regional projects of\npolitical integration”, such as the European Union, and in the\nless institutionalized activities of “participants in\ntransnational public spheres and associations” (2007: 189).\nWhile some think that the formal development of regional or global\ninstitutions must be democratized in order to realize republican\nnondomination or democratic agency (Valentini 2012), others argue that\nglobal democracy may be justified mainly for its instrumental role in\nprotecting and promoting \nthe fundamental interests of all the world’s citizens, rather\nthan by that of maximizing citizens’ democratic agency \nat the global level (Weinstock 2006: 10). \nCritical theorist Iris Marion Young similarly calls for a global\npolitics of nondomination, that would support “a vision of local\nand cultural autonomy in the context of global regulatory\nregimes” (2002: 237). Her model of global\ngovernance—“a post-sovereign alternative to the existing\nstates system” (2000: 238)—entails a “decentred\ndiverse democratic federalism” (2000: 253). While everyday\ngovernance would be primarily local, it would take place in the\ncontext of global regulatory regimes, built upon existing\ninternational institutions, that would be functionally defined to deal\nwith \n(1) peace and security, (2) environment, (3) trade and finance, (4)\ndirect investment and capital utilization, (5) communications and\ntransportation, (6) human rights, including labor standards and\nwelfare rights, (7) citizenship and migration. (2002: 267) \nYoung envisages these global regulatory regimes to apply not only to\nstates, but also to non-state organizations, such as corporations, and\nindividuals. In terms of feasibility, Young points to the development\nof a robust “global public sphere” (Habermas 1998) as\ncrucial to bringing about “stronger global regulatory\ninstitutions tied to principles of global and local democracy”\n(Young 2002: 272). \nIncreasingly, then, republican and democratic theorists view\ntransnational and supranational institutions not as intrinsic threats\nto democratic freedom and justice, but as potentially instrumental\ninstitutional developments that are necessary to fortify the\ncapacities of contemporary states to deliver on democratic and\nrepublican values. In this sense, supporting the development of\ntransnational democratic institutions is consistent with upholding the\nvalues of national identity and belonging, and the proper functioning\nof states, by providing a robust framework to coordinate and\ndiscipline states into solving problems of human rights and global\njustice in areas such as labor, health, migration, and taxation, in a\nmore fair, equitable, and non-dominating manner (Abizadeh 2008;\nRonzoni 2012; Valentini 2012; Dietsch 2015; Fine & Ypi 2016;\nCabrera 2018). Paradoxically, it may be that in conditions of\nglobalization, only a world state can provide the essential supporting\nconditions for all states, including democratic ones, to enjoy\neffective and legitimate collective self-determination (Lu 2018).\nThus, republican cosmopolitanism in the form of a world state may be\nless of an oxymoron than Pettit suggests. \nAn abiding controversy about the contemporary world economy is its\npotential to enhance or destroy societal goals of securing justice,\nfreedom, and welfare provision, including the protection of human\nrights and democratic politics (Stiglitz 2002; Kinley 2009). Craig\nMurphy has worried that globalization would \ninevitably be accompanied by the anti-democratic government of\n“expertise” or by the non-government of marketization at\never more inclusive levels. (2000: 800) \nEconomists have warned that the relationship between global economic\nintegration, national self-determination, and democratic politics can\nbe fraught (Rodrik 2011), and that capitalism has a tendency to\nreproduce and intensify inequality (Piketty 2013 [2014]). In the\ntwentieth century, Immanuel Wallerstein (2011) developed the\nworld-systems approach to analyzing the contradictions inherent in a\ncapitalist world-system. Although imperial military competition gave\nway to a world of sovereign states in the era of decolonization, he\nnoted that a capitalist world order perpetuates systems of domination\nto maintain capitalist interests, at the expense of the developing\nworld. World-systems theory thus explains how capitalism forms a\nstable set of exploitative relations between core and peripheral\nstates, resulting in an international division of labor that benefits\nthe core at the expense of the periphery. \nWhile world-systems theory posits that “economic exploitation of\nthe periphery does not necessarily require direct political or\nmilitary domination” (Kohn & Reddy 2006 [2017]),\ncontemporary postcolonial theorists argue that the rise of neoliberal\nglobalization can be marked by the establishment of international\neconomic institutions that have dislocated the power of sovereign\nstates to make economic decisions, and relocated them in international\neconomic institutions—the WTO, IMF and World Bank—with\neffective enforcement powers. \nWhereas realist, liberal and republican theorists typically posit that\na world state is a possible futuristic institutional development to\nevolve from anarchy, postcolonial theorists have argued that anarchy\ndoes not accurately describe the global historical institutional\nreality. Some also argue that world government is already here, albeit\nin a nascent form (Albert et al. 2012; Goodin 2013). Critical and\npostcolonial theorists argue that the course of capitalist modernity\nhas produced a nascent world state of neoliberal domination (Chimni\n2004; Slobodian 2018). In such conditions of structural domination, a\nworld state may be undesirable as a political project due to\nestablished and entrenched global hierarchies based on racist,\npatriarchal, and capitalist domination and exploitation (Robinson\n1983; Pateman and Mills 2007). As B.S. Chimni has put it, \nA network of economic, social and political [International\nInstitutions] has been established or repositioned, at the initiative\nof the first world, and together they constitute a nascent global\nstate whose function is to realize the interests of transnational\ncapital and powerful states in the international system to the\ndisadvantage of third world states and peoples. The evolving global\nstate formation may therefore be described as having an\nimperial character. (2004: 1–2) \nAlthough fragmented in structure, the future global state, according\nto Chimni, is in the process of congealing to actualize and legitimize\na world-view that ultimately serves the transnational capitalist class\ncomprising the owners of transnational capital. This class allies with\nthe networks of international law and institutions to undermine the\ndecision-making powers of states, especially those with weak\ninstitutional capacities, and to make decisions without transparency\nor effective participation of those affected. \nWhile increasingly intrusive, the decisions of international economic\nand financial institutions remain largely unaccountable. According to\nSlobodian, neoliberal globalists actively sought to construct the\ninstitutions of the global economy to evade accountability, “to\ncontain potential disruptions from the democratically empowered\nmasses”, so that the global economy could be “protected\nfrom the demands of redistributive equality and social justice”\n(2018: 264). While the Washington Consensus seemed to be based on\nsound economic principles—that free markets “and\ncompetition enable the efficient allocation of scarce\nresources”—and forecast economic growth based on\nliberalizing trade, investment, and capital flows, its failure to\nproduce growth or inclusive development in many countries has revealed\nthe importance of empirical analysis to check ideological distortions\nof economic policy (Rodrik 2015). China’s economic\ntransformation illuminates global challenges arising from the decline\nof “managerial capitalism”, or Fordism, which generated\nthe regulatory state-model of governance, and the rise of\n“neoliberal capitalism”, or post-Fordism, defined by the\n“hollowing out” of the state, reduction of central\nregulatory capacity, coupled with flexible production processes\ndisaggregated into production chains and networks, and increasing\nvulnerability of the peripheral workforce (Dowdle 2016:\n207–229). \nIn response to these predicaments of contemporary capitalism, critical\nand postcolonial theorists emphasize that there is no option to return\nto a mythical world of autarkic or autonomous and insulated states\nwith traditional sovereign prerogatives (Winter & Chambers-Letson\n2015). Instead, globalized domination can only be transformed through\nglobalizing transnational labor and social movements that struggle for\ngreater democratization of the decision-making processes of both\ndomestic and international institutions (Chimni 2004). In calling for\na revision of the principles that regulate the relationship between\nthe global economy and sovereign states, in order to buttress state\npower, especially of Third World states, against international\neconomic and financial institutions, critical theorists join\ncontemporary liberal (Isiksel 2020) and republican theorists who view\nthe state as continuing to play an important role in securing equal\nhuman freedom. According to Adom Getachew, “postcolonial\ncosmopolitanism” acknowledges the persistent unequal integration\nand hierarchy produced by the world politics of empire, and views the\nreinforcement of the sovereign state, as well as the dispersion of\nsovereignty in regional federations and a redistributive international\neconomic order, as key to anti-colonial struggles to resist domination\nand remake the world (2019: 34). \nGiven that the Eurocentric narrative of civilizational progress\nforwarded the nation-state as a marker of civilization, and fated\nIndigenous peoples to extinction with the advent of modernity,\nhowever, Indigenous political theorists have reason to be ambivalent\nabout a Weberian state at any level of political organization. Some\nIndigenous political theorists have mounted radical challenges to the\nsettler colonial state as well as the statist international order.\nGlen Coulthard’s critique of the liberal politics of\nmulticultural recognition reveals that the struggle for recognition\nmay not emancipate, but entrench subjects in the settler colonial\nsubjectivity offered by the settler colonial state (2014). Following\nanti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon, Coulthard argues that dominated\nagents need to struggle to create new decolonized frameworks of\nrecognition that they can call their own, and not only seek equal\nrecognition based on structures of settler colonial power,\notherwise \nthe colonized will have failed to reestablish themselves as truly\nself-determining: as creators of the terms, values, and conditions by\nwhich they are to be recognized. (2014: 139) \nCoulthard also understands the political project of Indigenous\n“resurgence” to be inextricably linked to the struggle to\nconstruct alternative social and economic systems to capitalism; thus\nfor Indigenous resurgence to be successful, “capitalism must\ndie” (2014: 173). Such Indigenous politics of refusal (Simpson\n2014) of both statism and capitalism underscore that the struggle for\nrecognition of Indigenous humanity in conditions of racial capitalist\nmodernity entails radical structural transformations of global order\n(Lu 2017 and 2019). \nThe aim of much normative theorizing about global institutions and\nglobal justice is to interrogate whether a world government is\nfeasible, desirable, or necessary for realizing human aspirations for\njust, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous relations between the\ndiverse individuals and groups that comprise a common moral community\nof humankind. Some think that the idea of world government involves a\nparadox: however it is conceived institutionally, when the winning\nconditions exist for establishing a desirable form of world\ngovernment—one that will guarantee human security with\nindividual liberty, protect the environment, and advance global social\njustice—it will no longer be necessary (Nielsen 1988: 276). Once\nall governments, especially the most powerful ones, are willing to use\ntheir power to build government networks that promote global peace,\njustice and environmental protection, and to cede some traditional\nrights of sovereignty to supranational institutions in areas such as\nthe use of military force, the management and protection of the\nenvironment and natural resources, and the distribution of wealth, the\nestablishment of a global political authority might seem superfluous.\nAs Alexander Wendt has pointed out, however, a stable end-state of\nworld order development requires such ideal conditions, should they\never develop, to become institutionalized into a world state that\nenacts “a global monopoly on the legitimate use of organized\nviolence” (1988: 491); enforcement mechanisms are not\nsuperfluous, since there is always the possibility of violations by\noutlaw states and groups. In a similar vein, the Swedish philosopher\nTorbjörn Tännsjö has argued that neither voluntary\nmultilateral cooperation under conditions of anarchy, nor a hybrid\narrangement of “shared sovereignty between the world\ngovernment and nation-states”, will be effective in resolving\ncontemporary challenges in the realms of human security, global\njustice and the environment (2008: 122–125). Since sovereignty\nis indivisible, Tännsjö posits that a world state must have\nultimate decision-making authority over nation-states over\njurisdictional issues: \nUnless there are sanctions available to the central authority to back\nup a decision as to where a question is to be handled, the system of\nstates will be thrown back into a state of nature. (2008:\n125–6) \nFrom critical and postcolonial perspectives, however, the state of\nnature reference point of much of international relations theory is a\nnormatively obscuring myth that occludes the hierarchies of structural\ndomination that have pervaded the development of world order (Jahn\n2000; Lu 2017: 120). Postcolonial and critical theorists often share\nthe ethical concerns and moral commitments of normative theorists\n(Kohn 2013)—justice, equality, freedom, nondomination—but\ntheir theorizing focuses on the diagnostic task of analyzing the\ncauses and character of contemporary structural and institutional\ndevelopments, as well as the global processes and conditions that make\nthem possible. They view contemporary global order, marked by radical\nimbalances and disparities produced by historic and ongoing structural\ninjustices based on class, race, and gender, as serving certain\nfunctions and interests, in terms of what they naturalize, enable,\nsuppress, and obscure. In 2020 and 2021, as a world divided by deep\npolitical, social and economic structural inequalities faces pandemic\nconditions, economic recession, and environmentally deleterious\ndevelopments, the questions of whose sense of world community\nand whose global needs will define the global political\nagenda and order are more salient than ever.","contact.mail":"catherine.lu@mcgill.ca","contact.domain":"mcgill.ca"}]
