His Common Sense (1776) was a central text\nbehind the call for American independence from Britain; his Rights\nof Man (1791–2) was the most widely read pamphlet in the movement\nfor reform in Britain in the 1790s and for the opening decades of the\nnineteenth century; he was active in the French Revolution and was a\nmember of the French National Convention between 1792 and 1795; he is\nseen by many as a key figure in the emergence of claims for the\nstate’s responsibilities for welfare and educational provision, and\nhis Age of Reason provided a popular deist text that remained\ninfluential throughout the 19th century. In his own\nlifetime, and subsequently, he has been extensively vilified and often\ndismissed. Yet many of his ideas still command wide interest and\nenthusiasm in readers throughout the world.\n\nThomas Paine was born on January 29, 1737 to a family of moderate\nmeans in Norfolk, England. His father was a Quaker and his mother an\nAnglican, and it is likely Paine was baptized into the Anglican\nchurch. He had some schooling, although his father forbade him to\nlearn Latin, and at the age of twelve he was withdrawn from school and\napprenticed to his father to learn the craft of staymaking. When he\nwas in his mid-teens, inspired by the romantic stories of naval life\nby one of his teachers, Paine twice ran away from home to sea. The\nfirst time he was intercepted. The second time he enlisted on the\nprivateer, the King of Prussia. The exact sequence of events\nover the subsequent ten to fifteen years is unclear. He lived in\nLondon on and off, but also had periods in Sandwich and in Margate. He\ncontinued periodically to ply his skills as a staymaker; he may have\ndone some preaching (in the Methodist persuasion); and in 1759 he\nmarried a Mary Lambert, who died the following year in\nchildbirth. Following his wife’s death, he sought his father-in-law’s\nsupport to take up a career in the excise service. He first served as\nan officer in December 1762, but in August 1765 he was dismissed. Tradition has it that this was for ‘stamping’—providing certificates for goods not\ninspected. New research (in Brent et al) suggests it may have been for whistleblowing. He wrote formally seeking re-admission to\nthe service, which was granted. While awaiting a posting he taught\nschool in London. In 1768 he accepted a posting to Lewes, on the South\nCoast of England, and he took up lodgings with a Samuel Ollive, a\nlocal tobacconist. In Lewes he became a member of the debating\nsociety—the Headstrong Club—and he was also reputed as a\nskater and player of bowls. Ollive died in July 1769, and Paine took\nlodgings elsewhere. But he sustained his links with the family, and in\nMarch 1771 he married the daughter, Elizabeth Ollive (1741–1808) and\nestablished himself as part proprietor of the business. The following\nyear he went to London to press the claims of the excisemen for higher\npay. Although he returned to Lewes, he was sacked by the excise and\nhis marriage had failed, and he sold up his business. In the final settlement between\nPaine and his wife he was awarded £400. He headed to London,\nwhere he secured letters of introduction from Benjamin Franklin, whom\nhe had encountered on an earlier visit to the capital, and embarked in\nApril 1774 for the New World. He was carried ashore in Philadelphia in\nNovember 1774 suffering from putrid fever, but he survived. In Philadelphia Paine developed an acquaintance with Robert Aitkin,\na publisher and bookseller, who employed him to edit\nthe Pennsylvania Magazine. There remains considerable\ndisagreement about which pieces in the Magazine were written by Paine,\nbut it seems clear that he did contribute and that he developed a\nreputation among political circles in Philadelphia as a result, at\njust the time that tensions with Britain were reaching a crisis\npoint. In the autumn of 1775, encouraged by Benjamin Rush, Paine began\nwork on a pamphlet defending the case of American independence. He\ndiscussed his work with Rush, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Franklin,\nand Samuel Adams, but the work was his own (save for the title, for\nwhich Rush claimed responsibility). Common Sense (1776) was\nthe most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a\nclarion call for unity, against the corrupt British court, so as to\nrealize America’s providential role in providing an asylum for\nliberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the\ndecaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an\nabsurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with\nBritain, Common Sense demonstrated to many the inevitability\nof separation. Paine consolidated his reputation as a pamphleteer with his series\nof American Crisis letters (1777–83); he also served in a\nnumber of capacities for Congress and the Pennsylvanian\nAssembly. Although he had links with the more radical elements of\nPennsylvanian politics, he also committed his energies to a number of\nmore elite projects—contributing to the establishment of the\nBank of America to help raise money for the war, and working with\nRobert Morris to encourage State Legislatures to accept the need for\nFederal taxation to support the war. Following the conclusion of the\nwar he was awarded a farm by the New York assembly, and Congress voted\nhim a grant of $3,000 for his services. After the Revolution he dedicated his time to scientific\nexperiments, designing an iron bridge capable of spanning wide\ndistances without the use of piers, experimenting with marsh gas with\nWashington, and attempting to produce a smokeless candle with\nFranklin. In 1787 he took a wooden model of his bridge to Paris, and\nsubsequently to England where an iron model of 110 feet was forged and\nconstructed for public display in a field near Paddington in May\n1790. He also became increasingly caught up in the initial events of\nthe French revolution, thanks in part to his involvement with a group\nof French intellectuals enabled by Thomas Jefferson (US Minister to\nFrance until late 1789). Paine contemplated writing a history of the\nFrench Revolution but he made slow progress—exacerbated by his\npoor French. When Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance appeared in November 1790, he determined to answer it and\nturned his materials to that task. The result, Rights of Man\n(February/March 1791) coupled a narrative of French events with a\ntrenchant attack on Burke and the Revolution Settlement of 1688. It\nwas an immediate success, and brought Paine into the circles of those\nseeking to achieve parliamentary reform in Britain. He continued to\nvisit France and was in Paris in June 1791 in the immediate aftermath\nof Louis XVI’s flight to Varennes. He collaborated with a small group\n(including Nicholas Bonneville and the Marquis de Condorcet) to\nproduce a republican manifesto that was pasted on the walls of Paris,\nto the outrage of most members of the National Assembly. That movement\nwas firmly repressed at the Massacre of the Champs de Mars in July\n1791, by which time Paine was already back in Britain. But the\noccasion marks a shift in his thinking—from seeing monarchy as\nan inevitable part of the institutional order in the corrupt states of\nEurope, to thinking that the American model could be applied more\ngenerally throughout Europe. Where Rights of Man had shown\nconsiderable tolerance for France’s limited monarchy, his Rights\nof Man: Part the Second (March 1792) was explicitly republican\nand he drew extensively on his American experience in sketching the\nbasic principles of a largely self-regulating commercial society,\ncoupled with representative government, the rule of law, and a\nperiodically renewable covenant. The final chapter, influenced by his\nfriendship with Condorcet and other members of the Comité\nde Mendicité, outlined a program for welfare provision for\nthe poor, aged, disabled and destitute. The two parts of Rights of Man were quickly combined in\ncheap editions (at Paine’s insistence) and sold in unprecedented\nnumbers. Paine’s advocacy of natural rights, his attacks on mixed\ngovernment, his outspoken republicanism, and his extensive proposals\nfor schemes of social welfare set him apart from the more common\nopposition rhetoric that emphasized the need to protect the integrity\nof the mixed constitution to secure English liberties. His success\nsuggests that he was reaching a popular audience who attached\ndiminishing weight to these traditions and were struck by his\ninsistence on their essential equality and their right to challenge\nthe status quo. In May 1792 a prosecution for sedition was initiated\nagainst him. When the case was heard in November of that year he was\noutlawed—but by this time he had returned to France, having been\nelected as a member to the National Convention in the summer of\n1792. He arrived in Paris shortly before the September massacres, and it\nseems clear that he found it hard to find his feet—being out of\nsympathy with the more sanguinary elements in the city. His closest\nconnections were with Girondin leaders in Paris, who were rapidly to\nfall from favour. Moreover, his plea in the National Convention for\nclemency for Louis XVI at his trial at the end of 1792, led to his\ndenunciation by Marat and the enmity of the Jacobin faction. He served\nwith Condorcet and Sieyes on the Committee to design a republican\nconstitution, but the extent of his contribution is unclear, and\nalthough Condorcet pressed on with the work, producing a report in the\nspring of 1793, it was immediately shelved. Paine led an increasingly\nconstrained life as the Jacobins assumed ascendancy and his friends\nwere arrested and executed, fled, or killed themselves. Orders for his\narrest were issued on 27 December 1793. While he was being taken into\ncustody he passed to his American friend Joel Barlow the manuscript\nfor the first part of Age of Reason which was published\nshortly thereafter. Paine spent eleven months in the Luxembourg (not\nunconnected to the studied neglect of his case by the US Minister,\nGouvernor Morris), and seems only narrowly to have escaped the\nguillotine. When he left prison, after Robespierre’s execution, it was\nthanks to the intervention of Morris’s successor, James Monroe. On his\nrelease, Paine was in an extremely debilitated state, and Monroe\nlooked after him in his home. Paine’s angry denunciation of\nWashington, whom he believed had ignored his pleas for help, and the\npublication of subsequent parts of Age of Reason made Monroe\nincreasingly uncomfortable with his guest and Paine left to live with\nthe printer Nicholas Bonneville and his family. Although still a member of the National Convention, Paine had\nrarely attended and did not do so after his release. His one\nintervention was his Dissertation on First Principles of\nGovernment (1795), a critique of the Constitution of 1795, and a\nsummary of his own thinking about politics, in which he urged the\nConvention to institute universal manhood suffrage. In 1796,\nresponding to the attempted coup by Babeuf’s ‘conspiracy of\nequals’, Paine’s Agrarian Justice developed further\nideas fist canvassed in the second part of Rights of Man and\nset out a principled case for a tax on inheritance so as to provide a\ncapital grant for all reaching the age of majority, together with an\nannual pension for all at fifty, arguing that the earth is common\nproperty to the human race and that everyone is owed compensation for\nthe private appropriation of it. Paine finally left France to return to America in 1803, during the\nPeace of Amiens, but was vilified on his return for his radicalism,\nhis deism, and for his embittered critique of Washington. He was\njoined in America in 1804 by the wife of Nicholas de Bonneville and\nher three sons who lived with him for a period; but this arrangement\nbroke down and Paine became increasingly ill and isolated. He died in\nobscurity in 1809. In 1819, William Cobbett, the Tory turned radical\nand critic of Paine turned supporter, had Paine’s bones dug up and\nreturned to England to be buried with honour. They were promptly lost,\nthereby ensuring that the man who declared his attachment to be\n‘to all the world, not to any particular part’ retained\nhis universal citizenship. Paine’s reputation has been a source of controversy since his own\nlifetime. He was a controversialist—what he wrote invariably\nprovoked controversy and was intended to do so. As such, one needs a\nreasonably capacious understanding of ‘philosophy’ to\ncount him as a philosopher. He was a pamphleteer, a journalist, a\npropagandist, a polemicist. Nonetheless, he also settled on a number\nof basic principles that have subsequently become central to much\nliberal-democratic culture. Few of these are original to Paine, but\nhis drawing together of them, and his bringing them before a wide\npopular audience, at this key historical moment when the people emerge\nas a consistent and increasingly independent force on the political\nstages of Europe and North America, has ensured that his works remain\nwidely read and are seen as of enduring value. That said, a great deal\nabout his life and about the value and interpretation of his work is\ndeeply contested and promises to remain so. In Common Sense Paine opens his account with the contrast\nbetween society and government: ‘Society is produced by our\nwants and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our\nhappiness positively by uniting our affections, the\nlatter negatively by restraining our vices’ (CW\nI, 4). [CW refers to The Complete Writings of\nThomas Paine, P.S. Foner (ed.), 1945.]  As with many Paine\nclaims, this seems simple, intuitive, and attractive. Our interests\nunite us, and it is only when we overstep the legitimate bounds of\nthose interests, or push them to the detriment of others, that we need\nconstraint. But when we do that, we ought to know better, and as such\nGovernment can appropriately be regarded as constraining our\nvices. What is less clear is how far we must assume vice (and thereby\ngovernment). ‘Society in every state is a blessing, but\ngovernment even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its\nworst state an intolerable one.’ The opening of Common\nSense can be read as a gloss on Locke’s Second Treatise,\nwithout the references to God. Yet Paine claimed never to have read\nLocke. He also seems clear in his first major pamphlet that government\n‘is a mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue\nto govern the world’ (CW I, 6). The issue, then is how extensive\nmust government be, and what sort of government provides the necessary\nbenefits, without multiplying the evils. Paine’s view is that\n‘the more simple anything is, the less liable it is to be\ndisordered…’ Simple government for Paine is\n‘republican government’: he rejects monarchical and mixed\nforms of government, in favour of a system in which ‘the liberty\nof choosing an House of Commons out of their own body’ is the\nkey republican moment (CW I, 16). Paine’s attack on monarchy in Common Sense is essentially\nan attack on George III. Whereas colonial resentments were originally\ndirected primarily against the king’s ministers and Parliament, Paine\nlays the responsibility firmly at the king’s door. And he appeals to a\nsense among Americans that they have all the resources, and every\nclaim, to rule themselves without the interference and control of a\nbody half-way around the world. Subverting paternalist metaphors for\nBritain’s colonial claims, Paine creates an image of a nation come of\nage, ready for freedom from its leading strings, having every\njustification for separation from its unnatural parent, and seeking to\nstand on its own as a commercial republic, trading in its own\nright. It is not America who is behaving unnaturally and ungratefully,\nbut the ‘royal brute of Great Britain.’ ‘Nature has\ndeserted the connection, and art cannot supply her place’ (CW I,\n23). Americans do not see the way forward, but it is simple. The\ncolonies need to be divided into districts, districts should elect\ntheir representatives to Congress, and Congress should choose a\nPresident by ballot from the delegates of each state in turn, with the\nfirst state being chosen by lot. To avoid injustice, three fifths\nshould be required for a majority. To avoid imposing his views,\nhowever, he suggests that each state nominate two members to a\nContinental Congress to frame a charter fixing the details of the\ngovernment—‘always remembering that our strength is\ncontinental, not provincial’ (CW I, 29). And in a rare citation\nof another’s works, Paine appeals to Dragonetti’s adage that the aim\nshould be ‘a mode of government that should combine the greatest\nsum of individual happiness with the least national expense’ (CW\nI, 29). For all its success, Common Sense is not without flaws. It\ncontains a digression on biblical accounts of the origin of monarchy;\nits powerful rhetoric leaves unanswered a range of more practical and\ntheoretical questions, and the argument jumps around\nconsiderably. Later editions added an appendix denouncing the Quakers\nfor their quietism. But its rhetorical effectiveness cannot be \ndoubted—which suggests that it intersected \npowerfully with the concerns and\nbeliefs that were widespread in colonial America at the point of\nrupture. Political theorists might want to press for more details\nabout who will have the vote; about whether there is an implicit\nacceptance of a doctrine of the fall; about the extent to which his\nappeals to republics envisage a degree of republican civic virtue;\nabout whether the argument is based on an account of natural rights;\nand so on. But on such issues the pamphlet is either silent or only\nbarely suggestive. Unlike Locke, this is not a principled\njustification for resistance, so much as a concatenation of points\nabout Americans taking their collective identity and independent\ninterests seriously and separating from the increasingly arbitrary\nrule of Britain. Given these sweeping claims, it is easy to see why so\nmany commentators have held that Paine was both lacking in\nintellectual sophistication and basically held to a consistent set of\nprinciples throughout his work, since it is difficult to demonstrate\nthat much he says is actively inconsistent with what he later\nwrote. Nonetheless, if we take increasing precision in his claims as\nevidence of greater attention to issues that he felt he could\nconfidently sweep past in Common Sense, then a case for a\ndeepening of his thinking and for a process of change over time can be\nmade. While there may be suggestions of rights claims in Common\nSense and in a number of minor texts attributed by some to Paine\nbut where the authorship is a matter of dispute, it is clear that the\nfully fledged account of rights that Paine advances in the first part\nof Rights of Man (1791) represents a significant development\nin his thinking. It is common to attribute that development to the\nfoil he found in Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance (1790), where Burke inveighs against the idea that rights\nare preserved from the state of nature in the civil state. ‘Men\ncannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state\ntogether…That he may secure some liberty, he makes a surrender\nin trust of the whole of it’ (CW VIII, p. 110). And where he\nclaims that, in England, ‘We have not been drawn and trussed, in\norder that we may be filled, like stuffed birds in a museum, with\nchaff and rage, and paltry, blurred shred of paper about the rights of\nman’ (CW VIII, p. 137). It seems more likely, however, that\nPaine’s distinction between natural rights, where we necessarily have\nthe power to execute the right (as in the right of conscience), as\nagainst rights where we need the arm of society to secure the right\n(as in property), although more sharply expressed in Rights of\nMan (1791), is a product of discussions with Jefferson and French\nsympathizers with America in the late 1780s, when they were discussing\nthe proposed Federal Constitution and its failure to contain a bill of\nrights. In a letter to Jefferson written in 1788/9 Paine draws a\ndistinction between ‘rights they could individually exercise\nfully and perfectly, and those they could not’ (CW II,\n1298). In the reply to Burke this is used to show that every civil\nright grows out of a natural right or ‘is a natural right\nexchanged)’; that the civil power is made up of the aggregate of\nthat class of the natural rights of man, which becomes defective in\nthe individual in point of power; and that the power produced from the\naggregate of natural rights, imperfect in power in the\nindividual’, cannot be applied to invade the natural rights\nwhich are retained by the individual…’ (CW I, 276). How much, in fact, separates Paine from Burke? The rights in which\nour power is perfect, are relatively few—so that many of the\nthings that really matter, access to means of labour and sustenance,\nfreedom of movement and contract, seem to fall under Burke’s sense of\nmatters of convenience which government orders on the basis of general\nutility. Although Paine does not provide much detail, it seems clear\nthat he sees himself as different from Burke primarily because he\nargues for continuing normative salience of the natural right and for\nthe on-going collective sovereignty of the people over the\narrangements that they make the better to secure those rights. Paine’s\nreaders had little doubt that he sought to defend their rights from\ninvasion, but his distinction does not in-itself do that. After all,\nwhat is to stop the collective encroaching on the rights of citizens?\nOne answer is given in Paine’s account of popular sovereignty. Common Sense might presume a principle of collective\nself-determination and the sovereignty of the people, but it does not\narticulate or defend it. Something like this issue does come under\nconsideration in Paine’s Dissertations on Government, a\npamphlet written in 1786, defending the Bank of America and the\nprinciple that contracts formed by government ought to be respected by\nsubsequent occupants of power. ‘Every government…contains\nwithin itself a principle common to all, which is that of a sovereign\npower, or a power over which there is no control, and which controls\nall others….In republics, such as those established in America,\nthe sovereign power…remains where nature placed it—in the\npeople. …This sovereignty is exercised in electing and deputing\na certain number of persons to represent and to act for the whole. But\nhe goes on to insist that As a result, This position sits uncomfortably with more direct and active\ninterpretations of the sovereignty of the people or any general\nwill. Hence Paine’s claim in 1791 to be ‘a Citizen of a country\nwhich knows no other Majesty than that of the People; no other\nGovernment than that of the Representative body; no other sovereignty\nthan that of the Laws…’ (CW II, 1315). Paine’s account of sovereignty dramatically delimits collective\npower to the securing of civil rights, based on natural\nright. In Rights of Man (1791) he quotes Lafayette’s claim\nthat ‘For a nation to be free it is sufficient that she wills\nit’ (CW I, 322). Lafayette most likely\nmeant it as a call to reject despotism; but Paine’s account is perhaps\nmore subtle, seeing it as a right of the nation to determine its\ngovernment, but also as a right that is itself delimited by the end of\nliberty—that is, by the protection of individual rights and by\nensuring their more adequate security within the collective. That this is so helps account for Paine’s account of generational\nsovereignty. In Rights of Man (1791) he attacks Burke’s claim\nthat the terms of the 1688 Revolution Settlement ”bind\nus,” (meaning the people of the day) “our heirs\nand our posterity, to them, their heirs and\nposterity, to the end of time” (CW I, 250).  Paine\ndemurs: There never did, there never will, there never can\nexist a parliament, or any description of men, or any generation of\nmen, in any country, possessed of the right or the power of binding\nand controlling posterity to the ‘end of\ntime’…Every generation must be as free to act for\nitself, in all cases, as the ages and generation which\npreceded it. This too looks like a principle that Paine worked out with\nJefferson, in 1788–9, when Jefferson first mentions it in his\ncorrespondence, although the prior source is likely to be Adam Smith’s\nWealth of Nations. The principle is a powerful one—but\nit is negative: no generation can be bound by those before it; and\nnone can bind those after. But equally, no generation is free to act\nunjustly. In his Dissertations of Government (1786), Paine\nhad struggled with precisely this issue in wanting to claim both the\nsovereign power of the people and the duty on the part of the state to\nrespect contracts made previously by others in their capacity of\nrepresentatives. Paine tries to reconcile the claims by arguing that a\ncontract is not a law but an action, and while laws can be changed,\nacts are binding. He does not yet claim generational sovereignty,\nalthough the right to change laws is clearly there. But the insistence\non a sovereignty of justice is designed to ensure that actions that\ninvolve the transfer of rights must have the protection of the state\nand cannot be justly abrogated. What becomes clear, is that, as Paine struggles to articulate his\naccount of rights, he comes to defend a very Lockean account in which\nthe government is there to interpret and to secure antecedently\ndefined rights and just claims that are the outcome of the exercise of\nthese rights. Rights acquired through clear contract or agreement\ndeserve every protection: even if subsequent generations are at\nliberty to question the laws of the nation and to alter them as they\nwill, they are not at liberty to invade the property rights of people\nsecured through past agreements. Paine’s institutional suggestions in Common Sense are\nhardly fully fledged proposals. Indeed, one of the most surprising\naspects of Paine’s writing is how little institutional discussion\nthere is—he is not a man for the detailed discussions of\nconstitutions and legislative and executive arrangements. Even his\npiece in the summer of 1791 Answer to Four Questions on the\nLegislative and Executive Power is not especially\nilluminating. Most modern commentators tend not to notice this. Paine\nis clearly a democrat, he advocates democratic institutions, and he\nrejects those of monarchy and aristocracy. But such judgments are\noften deeply anachronistic. If we examine what Paine actually says, we\nsee that his own perspective was one which evolved and remained\ninclusive in many areas. It seems clear that Paine was a\nrepublican—but in a changing and always very specific\nsense. In Dissertations on Government (1786) he specifies it\nas government directed towards ‘the public good, or the good of\nthe whole’ (II, 372). In Rights of Man (1791) he\nunderstands it as government by election and representation (I,\n338)—a definition of republic that matches closely that\nadvocated by Madison in the Federalist Papers. In Rights\nof Man (1792) he switches back to the earlier formulation: Yet he steadfastly refuses to call the form of government he is\ninterested in a ‘democracy’—which he identifies with\nancient direct democracy and sees as essentially limited. The system\nhe sees as operating in America is ‘representation ingrafted\nupon democracy’ (CW I, 371). And, unlike Joel Barlow, he does\nnot use the neologism ‘representative democracy’ nor, like\nJohn Adams, ‘representative government.’ Paine thus plays\na part in the process of transforming representation from something\nthat was seen as compatible with monarchical—indeed with\nabsolutist—states, although it could also take more popular\nforms, often linked to a gothic feudal past—into something that\nwas directly linked to the sovereignty of the people in their\nnations. But, in many respects, he does little especially\ninnovative. The one major impact of his work was to bring to a wide\naudience some of the thinking that he shared with both Madison and\nJefferson about the distinctive features of the American form of\ngovernment. Rights of Man (1791) is a rather mixed performance,\ncombining historical narrative of events in France, engagement with\nBurke, the adumbration of principles, and some powerful moments of\npolitical rhetoric—suggesting that Burke has constructed a set\nof tragic paintings by which he has ‘outraged his own\nimagination’ (CW I, 258), that Burke ‘pities the plumage\nbut forgets the dying bird’ (CW I, 260) and that he has worked\n‘up a tale accommodated to his own passions and\nprejudices.’ He makes his points about rights polemically, as he\ndoes those concerning the sovereignty of each generation and in\ndrawing a distinction between the constitution and the government, and\nhis most passionate attacks are on the hereditary principle and its\naccompanying ‘gibberish’ of titles and\ndistinctions—‘the idea of hereditary legislators is as\ninconsistent as that of hereditary judges , or hereditary juries; and\nas absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man;\nand as ridiculous as an hereditary poet-laureate’ (CW I,\n289). In Rights of Man (1792) Paine shifts the ground\nsubstantially. He hardly mentions events in France, and barely touches\non Burke. Instead, the revolution in America is announced as an event\nof global importance—the place ‘where the principles of\nuniversal reformation could begin’ (CW I, 354). What began in\nAmerica is now seen, not as an exception, but as the trigger for a\nrenovation or the world as a whole. The relative tolerance for\nFrance’s monarchy in the first part of Rights of Man is set\naside, suggesting that Paine had not previously thought that the old\nworld states could manage a representative system of the American\nform, but that he now does think this. Moreover, his old distinction\nbetween society and government is re-animated but, instead of\nemphasizing the inevitability of vice, he represents society as in\nalmost every respect sufficient unto itself: ‘Government is no\nfurther necessary than to supply the few cases to which society and\ncivilisation (a new concept) are not conveniently competent’ (CW\nI, 357–8). Indeed, ‘the more perfect civilisation is, the less\noccasion has it for government, because the more does it regulate its\nown affairs, and govern itself…’ (CW I, 358–9). And,\nagain, it is America that is the model—where the country\nsubsisted with hardly any form of government throughout the revolution\nand the subsequent period. Moreover, America becomes the model for\nreform: a society that agrees articles, establishes a constitution,\nand is able periodically to revise the constitution as the collective\nact of the people. Contrasting old forms of government, based on an\nassumption of power, for the aggrandizement of itself’; and the\nnew: ‘a delegation of power, for the common benefit of the\npeople’ (CW I, 363), Paine roots the new forms in the\nestablishment of a constitution and the regulation of government in\naccordance with the constitution for the good of all, seeing the\nAmerican example as one that may be spread throughout the\nglobe. Indeed, Paine thinks ‘it is too soon to determine to what\nextent of improvement government may yet be carried. For what we can\nforesee, Europe may form but one great republic, and man be free of\nthe whole’ (CW I, 397). This is a hymn to representative\ngovernment, to minimal government, and to government with the primary\nconcern of protecting the natural rights of man more effectively. It\nis not a defense of democracy or universal suffrage. For all his\ncharacterization as a democrat he does not embrace that description;\nand there is no advocacy of universal suffrage prior to\nPaine’s Letter Addressed to the Addressers, written and\npublished in the summer of 1792 shortly before he left for\nFrance. This should further alert us to the fact that, in this period,\nPaine’s thinking was changing, often as rapidly as events around him\nchanged. In the final chapter of Rights of Man, Paine addresses the\nexpenditure of the British state and to issues of commerce. Since\nhis Letter to the Abbe Raynal (1782), he had expressed a\ngrowing confidence in commerce as a means of uniting the interests of\nnations and rendering outdated and irrelevant the European system of\nwar. The final chapter of Rights of Man develops the same\nview, suggesting the incompatibility between monarchical regimes and\nthe growth of commerce and national wealth, and going on to itemize\nthe taxation raised in Britain to support the costs of monarchical\nwars. Given the new era of peace between nations consequent upon the\nrevolutions in America and France, Paine raises the question of what\nshould be done about the immense sums raised in taxes in Britain (some\n£15.5 millions), suggesting that ‘whoever has observed the\nmanner in which trade and taxes twist themselves together, must be\nsensible of the impossibility of separating them suddenly’ (CW\nI, 423). Paine then develops a series of welfare proposals that seem\nto have no underlying principle of justice, but are proffered wholly\nas a way of redirecting spending. He advocates that poor relief be\nremoved as a local tax and replaced by central provision from\ngovernment coffers; that pensions be offered for those advanced in\nage, starting at 50, and in full form at 60; that provision be made\nfor the education of the poor; that maternity be benefit be granted to\nall women immediately after the birth of a child; that a fund be\nestablished for the burial of those who die away from home; and that\narrangements be made for the many young people who travel to the\nmetropolis in search of a livelihood to provide initial accommodation\nand support until they find work. Paine ends by identifying provision\nfor those who have served in the army and navy, and suggesting that,\nas demands on the public purse from these sources declines, then items\nof indirect taxation might also be lifted, and the burden of taxation\ngradually shifted towards a progressive taxation on landed property,\ncoupled with the abolition of primogeniture, and a progressive tax on\nthe income from investments. Although certainly influenced by his\nacquaintance with Condorcet and members of the Comité de\nMendicité de la Constituante, this raft of proposals\nrepresents a major innovation on Paine’s part, its slight oddity being\nthe absence of any clear set of underlying principles for its\njustification. The ad hoc turn to welfare in the second part\nof Rights of Man (1792) finds some compensation in the short\npamphlet, Agrarian Justice (1795–6), that Paine wrote after\nhis release from prison in response to the unrest in 1795 in Paris as\nprotests spread against the economic hardship suffered in the capital,\nstimulating culminating in Babeuf’s conspiracy of equals. Unlike the\nfinal chapter of Rights of Man, Agrarian Justice provides a\nprincipled defense for welfare provision, rooted in a conception of\nthe original equality of man and the equal right to a subsistence from\nthe earth. He acknowledges that there are benefits to allowing private\nproperty in land and its cultivation, but argues that every proprietor\nowes the community a ground-rent for the land he holds, which should\nbe used as a right of inheritance for all, paying the sum of £15\nas a compensation for the loss of natural inheritance at the age of\ntwenty-one and an annual grant to the aged. These payments are a\nmatter of right, not of charity. A claim against the common stock that\nall may make, on the ground that ‘no person ought to be in a\nworse condition when born under what is called a state of\ncivilization, than he would have been had he been born in a state of\nnature…’ (I, 613). The money is to be raised from\nprogressive taxation in inherited wealth and will contribute to its\nmore equal distribution. To modern critics it may seem odd to couple the essentially\nlibertarian sentiments of the opening of the second part of Rights\nof Man with a major raft of welfare reforms. But Paine clearly\ndid not think about these reforms as an extension\nof government. Although he does not make the point, they seem\nto be more a matter of administration, and that is in keeping with his\nessentially consensual view of the formal exercise of responsibilities\nby those invested with the confidence of the nation as a whole. Paine’s proposals probably had little practical effect on the\nemergence of the welfare state, but they helped influence early\nsocialist doctrines and working men’s associations, and they have\nsince been taken up by those advocating a right to basic income or a\nchild inheritance as a way of ensuring that the young need not inherit\ntheir parents’ poverty. In his Letter Addressed to the Addressers (1792), and more\nfully in Dissertation on First Principles of Government 1795)\nPaine commits to the conclusion that equal rights entail an equal\nright to have a say in one’s representative. He provides two main\narguments. In the Letter… he argues that as every man\nover the age of twenty-one pays taxes in one form of another, so\neveryone has a right to vote—or a form of entitlement through\ncontribution. But in the Dissertation he makes the case\nwholly on the basis of equal natural rights: ‘the right of\nvoting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights\nare protected. To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery,\nfor slavery consists in being subject to the will of another, and he\nthat has not a vote in the election of representatives is in this\ncase. (II, 579) ‘It is possible to exclude men from the right of\nvoting, but it impossible to exclude them from the right of rebelling\nagainst that exclusion; and when other rights are taken away, the\nright of rebellion is made perfect.’ (II, 580) This suggests\nthat the role of rights grows in importance for Paine, making little\nappearance at all before 1788, and then coming to play an expanding\nrole in his account, to provide the underpinning for political\nauthority and an account of its limits, to justify the right to vote,\nand to make the case for a right to land and the fruits of nature\nwhich is translated into an inheritance right and a range of welfare\nrights. In his account of the origin of rights in Rights of\nMan (1791), he suggests that those (like Burke) who appeal to the\nauthority of antiquity simply do not go back far enough: For a man so frequently called an atheist, Paine shows a remarkable\nconfidence in the divine order of the creation. The work that did most\nto damage his reputation in America, and which split his supporters in\nBritain, was his Age of Reason (1793/4), which was followed\nby a further part in 1795, and additional writings compiled by later\neditors into a third part, from 1804. The Age of Reason is\nnot an atheist tract, but a deist one. It combines scathing criticism\nof claims to authority for the bible by religious authorities, with an\nexpression of confidence in a divinely ordered world, revealed in\nnature through the exercise of reason, that drew heavily on the\nlectures he had attended in London prior to leaving for America, given\nby James Ferguson and Benjamin Martin. Indeed, he seemed to have\ncommitted their account to memory, and uses the text to lay out the\norder of the universe, to speculate on the possibility of a plurality\nof worlds, and to dismiss all claims for mystery, miracles and\nprophecy. God is an unmoved first cause, who designs and sets the\nuniverse in motion for the benefit of man, and the moral duty of man\nconsists in ‘imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of\nGod, manifested in the creation toward all His\ncreatures…everything of persecution and revenge between man and\nman, and everything off cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral\nduty.’ (I, 512). Although the later parts of Age of Reason\ndescend into detailed interpretation and controversy, and lose\nmuch of their intuitive appeal, the first part is a powerful\nconfession of rationalist faith in a divine creator whose design can\nbe appreciated by man in the Bible of Creation, whose principles are\neternal, and which rejects as meaningless the claims to authority and\nthe theology of the Christian Churches. ‘The study of theology,\nas it stands in the Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is\nfounded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it produces no\nauthorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits\nof no conclusion’ (CW I, 601). ‘The only religion that has\nnot been invented, and that has in it every evidence of divine\noriginality, is pure and simple Deism’ (CW I, 600). And as\nsimple government avoids us becoming the dupes of fraud, so simple\nbelief protects us from the fraud of priestcraft, which so often runs\nhand in hand with despotism. Paine’s religious views, not unlike his political views, are not\nespecially original or subtle. They follow much of the deist writing\nof the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. But, as with\nmuch Paine wrote, the bluntness and sweeping rhetoric that alienates\nthe more philosophically inclined modern reader were an essential\nelement in his success and his continuing importance. Paine spoke to\nordinary people—and they read him in their\nthousands—indeed, he was often read aloud in public houses and\ncoffee shops. He claimed no authority over them, but helped them to\ndoubt those who did claim such authority, whether civil or religious,\nand he affirmed over and over again their right and responsibility to\nthink for themselves and to reach their own judgment on matters. He\ndid so at a time when the press had become capable of reaching even\nthe poorest of society—when the Attorney General launched the\nprosecution of Rights of Man (1792) he distinguished between\nthe first part, which was ‘ushered into the world under\ncircumstances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the\njudicious reader’, and the second part, which ‘with an\nindustry incredible, it was either totally or partially thrust into\nthe hands of all persons in this country, of subjects of every\ndescription…Gentlemen, to whom are those positions, that are\ncontained in this book addressed…to the ignorant, to the\ncredulous, to the desperate.’ (State Trails v. 22, 381–3). Paine would have embraced the description—although he was\nless of a ‘common man’ than many who have subsequently\neulogized him make him out to be. In many respects, he was a\nmoderately respectable radical, with a deep suspicion of the\nhierarchical systems of Europe, a brimming confidence in his own\njudgment that his experience in America confirmed—which expressed\nitself in his willingness to tackle a range of subject areas,\nincluding bridge-building and scientific experiments—and with a\ngrowing sense that he knew how to communicate, with powerful effect,\nwith a popular audience at exactly the point at which that popular\naudience was beginning to feel and test its political influence. Paine was vehemently attacked in his own lifetime—if the\nscurrilous biography was not invented for him it certainly attained\nsomething of an art form in his depiction. He was outlawed in England,\nnearly lost his life in France, and was largely ostracized and\nexcluded when he returned to America. A sizable collection of papers\nat his New Rochelle farm were destroyed in a fire, and his oeuvre\nremains contested, at least at the margins. Biographers have drawn\nheavily on early work by Moncure Conway, but while several new accounts\nappear each decade few add much to our knowledge. Serious analysis of\nhis ideas is relatively rare, and tends to be more historically than\nphilosophically orientated (although recent work by Robert Lamb does gives his ideas serious philosophical attention, and van Parijs’s work on Basic Income recognizes his importance). But until very recently he has remained on the edges of\nthe canon of political thought, easily dismissed by those who want\nmore substantial philosophical fare, and subject to fits of enthusiasm\nby writers who are either insufficiently attuned to the complexities\nof the period or are simply uncritical. Such an attitude does poor\nservice to the history, to the ideas, or to the man.","contact.mail":"mark.philp@warwick.ac.uk","contact.domain":"warwick.ac.uk"}]
