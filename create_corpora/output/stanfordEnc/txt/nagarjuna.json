His philosophy of the\n“middle way” (madhyamaka) based around the\ncentral notion of “emptiness”\n(śūnyatā) influenced the Indian philosophical\ndebate for a thousand years after his death; with the spread of\nBuddhism to Tibet, China, Japan and other Asian countries the writings\nof Nāgārjuna became an indispensable point of reference for\ntheir own philosophical inquiries. A specific reading of\nNāgārjuna’s thought, called\nPrāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka, became the official\nphilosophical position of Tibetan Buddhism which regards it as the\npinnacle of philosophical sophistication up to the present day.\n\n\n\nEven though legendary accounts abound, very little can be said\nprecisely about Nāgārjuna’s life. That Nāgārjuna\nwas a Buddhist monk who lived some time between 150 and 250 CE,\nprobably mainly in southern India is rarely disputed. If we want to go\nbeyond these bare facts, however, intricate historical detective work\nis required. Some interesting connections have been discovered by this\nbut they are of limited importance in the present context which is\nprimarily aimed at providing information about Nāgārjuna’s\nphilosophical works. The interested reader is referred to Mabbett 1998\nand Walser 2005 for further discussion. \n\nFortunately there is more information about Nāgārjuna’s\nworks than there is about his life but the situation is still far from\nideal: it is not easy to come up with a precise list of texts\nNāgārjuna composed. This is partly due to the fact that\ndifferent authors bearing the name “Nāgārjuna” might have\nlived during different periods of the development of Buddhist thought\nin India, and partly due to the tendency of attributing newly composed\nworks to the great authorities of the past. For the present purposes,\nhowever, we can divide Nāgārjuna’s works into three main\ngroups (further discussion can be found in Ruegg 1981). In the list I\ngive here the ascription of the works mentioned to Nāgārjuna\nis largely uncontested. The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way (MMK)\n(Mūlamadhyamakakārikā). This is the most\nimportant of Nāgārjuna’s works. In its 450 stanzas it\nexpounds the entire compass of his thought and constitutes the central\ntext of the “philosophy of the Middle Way”. It has been\ncommented upon by a large number of later authors. (See Ye 2011, Siderits/Katsura 2013). The Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning\n(Yuktiṣaṣṭikā). \nA shorter treatise, discussing the notions of emptiness and\ndependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda). The Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness\n(Śūnyatāsaptati).  Another short treatise,\ndealing in addition with questions of agency and the two truths. The Dispeller of Disputes\n(Vigrahavyāvartanī). In this work of seventy verses\nwith an autocommentary in prose Nāgārjuna responds to a set\nof specific objections raised against his system. These objections\ncome both from Buddhist and non-Buddhist opponents and initiate\ndiscussions of topics which do not get much coverage in\nNāgārjuna’s other works (in particular epistemology and the\nphilosophy of language). (See Westerhoff 2010). The Treatise on Pulverization\n(Vaidalyaprakaraṇa). A very interesting and difficult\nwork in which Nāgārjuna sets out to refute the logical\ncategories of the non-Buddhist Nyāya school. Like d. this text\nhas never attracted the attention of classical commentators. The Precious Garland (Ratnāvalī).  A long text\naddressed to a king containing a comprehensive discussion of ethical\nquestions. Because discussion of the theory of emptiness plays a\ncomparatively minor role in this text it is sometimes subsumed under\nthe epistolary works (see below). The hymns (Catuḥstava). There is some discussion\nwhich of the various hymns ascribed to Nāgārjuna actually\nmake up the quartet of ‘four hymns’ often referred to in\nthe commentarial literature. They differ in interesting respects from\nthe works mentioned in the preceding section. Common to many of them\nis a positive conception of ultimate truth which ascribes specific\nqualities to it and gets close to the theory of Buddha-nature\n(tathāgatagarbha) that became very important in the\nlater development of Buddhist thought. The epistolary works. The Friendly Letter\n(Suhṛllekha), like the Precious Garland\n(Ratnāvalī), which is sometimes assigned to this\ngroup is a work addressed to a king. This fact may explain why the\ntext is primarily concerned with ethical matters. It devotes\nrelatively little space to the kind of philosophical discussion which\nis Nāgārjuna’s most characteristic contribution to Buddhist\nthought. \n\nThe central concept around which all of Nāgārjuna’s\nphilosophy is built is the notion of emptiness\n(śūnyatā). Emptiness is of course always the\nemptiness of something, and the something Nāgārjuna has in\nmind here is svabhāva. Different terms have been used to\ntranslate this word into English: “inherent existence” and\n“intrinsic nature” appear to be the more popular choices,\nbut “substance” and “essence” have also been\nproposed. None of these cover the full complexity of the term,\nhowever. We therefore have to give some more detailed account of the\nway svabhāva is characterized in Nāgārjuna’s\nthought. By understanding what empty things are supposed to be empty\nof we simultaneously gain a more precise understanding of the concept\nof emptiness. \n\nWe can distinguish two main conceptual dimensions of the concept of\nsvabhāva, an ontological one, which refers to a\nparticular way in which objects exist, and a cognitive one, which\nrefers to a way in which objects are conceptualized by human beings.\nWithin the ontological dimension we can distinguish three different\nunderstandings of svabhāva: in terms of essence, in terms\nof substance, and in terms of absolute reality. (Even though this\ndistinction is largely based on Madhyamaka authors later than\nNāgārjuna it is still a useful heuristic tool for\nunderstanding the philosophical point he was trying to make.) \n\nIf we understand svabhāva in terms of essence it has\nto be considered a property an object could not lose without ceasing to\nbe that very object: the svabhāva of fire is to be hot,\nthe svabhāva of water to be wet: whatever ceases to be\nhot is no longer fire, whatever ceases to be wet is no longer water.\nAccording to this understading svabhāva is also\nidentified with the kind of specific qualities\n(svalakṣaṇa) that allow an observer to distinguish\nan object from other things: by knowing that something is hot, together\nwith a variety of other svalakṣaṇas we know that\nwhat we have in front of us is fire rather than something else. It is\nimportant to note that this concept of svabhāva (which\nplays only a small role in Nāgārjuna’s writings but becomes\nmore important in later Madhyamaka writers) is not the target of the\nMadhyamaka critique. When Nāgārjuna argues that things are\nempty of svabhāva it is not this notion of essence he is\nconcerned with. The philosophically more important understanding of\nsvabhāva is an understanding in terms of substance. \n\nIn Buddhist philosophical thought preceding Nāgārjuna we\nfind the distinction between primary existents (dravyasat)\nand secondary existents (prajñaptisat). Primary\nexistents constitute the objective and irreducible constituents of the\nworld out there while secondary existents depend on our conceptual and\nlinguistic practices. Some Buddhist schools would hold that only\natomic moments of consciousness are really real whereas everything\nelse, including shoes and ships and sealing-wax is a mere aggregate of\nsuch moments constructed by our conceptualizing mind. According to\nthis theory the entire world around us would be relegated to the\nstatus of mere secondary existents, apart from the moments of\nconsciousness which are primary existents. In this\ncontext svabhāva is equated with primary existence and\ndenotes a specific ontological status: to exist with\nsvabhāva means to be part of the basic furniture of the\nworld, independent of anything else that also happens to exist. Such\nobjects provide the ontological rock-bottom on which the diverse world\nof phenomena rests. They provide the end-point of a chain of\nontological dependence relations. \n\nNāgārjuna argues, however, that there is no such end-point\nand denies the existence of an ontological foundation (see Westerhoff\n2017). This fact is sometimes used as support of the accusation that\nMadhyamaka is really a nihilistic doctrine, a doctrine that nothing\nexists. For if the secondary existent is reduced to the primary, and\nif there is no primary, what is there left? This interpretation has a\nrelatively long history, beginning in ancient India and continuing to\nfind supporters nowadays (see Spackman 2014, Westerhoff\n2016). Nevertheless, there are powerful systematic and historical\nreasons against it. First of all, it is not clear that this kind of\nontological nihilism is in fact a consistent position (if there is\nnothing, is there not at least the fact that there is nothing,\ni.e. something?). Secondly, the Mādhyamikas themselves are very\nclear that their position avoids both of the extreme views, the view\nthat believes in the existence of svabhāva as well as\nits nihilistic opposite. \nIt is the understanding of svabhāva as a primary\nexistent or substance that constitutes the main target of\nNāgārjuna’s philosophical criticism. Before we have a closer\nlook at the form this criticism takes we must briefly mention the\nfinal ontological understanding of svabhāva,\nnamely svabhāva as absolute\nreality. If svabhāva is regarded as the true nature of\nphenomena it is sometimes characterized as not brought about by any\ncausal process, as unchangeable and as independent of any other\nobject. The interesting problem arising here is that for the\nMadhyamaka the true nature of phenomena is emptiness, i.e. the absence\nof svabhāva understood as substance, and that\nsvabhāva understood in this way is also\ncharacterized as not brought about by any causal process, as\nunchangeable and as independent of any other object. So it seems to be\nthe case that something that has all these properties must exist (since\nthere is svabhāva which is the true nature of phenomena)\nand must not exist (since, the Madhyamaka argues,\nsvabhāva understood as substance does not exist). In the\nBuddhist commentarial literature we find several different ways of\ndissolving this contradiction (for more discussion see Westerhoff\n2009: 40–46). One way of tackling the issue is by\ndifferentiating two senses in which svabhāva can be\n“independent of any other object”. This can be understood\nas the familiar understanding of substance as a primary existent noted\nabove. But it can also be understood as meaning “not dependent\non any specific phenomenon”. We could then argue that emptiness\nas the true nature of phenomena is to be understood\nas svabhāva and thus as independent only in the second,\nbut not in the first sense. This is due to the fact that\nsvabhāva in the sense rejected by Madhyamaka thinkers is\nregarded as a superimposition mistakenly projected onto objects which\nin fact lack it (see below). Thus emptiness only exists as long as\nsvabhāva understood as substance is mistakenly projected\nonto some object or other. Emptiness does not depend on any specific\nphenomenon to exist, but there has to be some phenomenon mistakenly\nconceived for emptiness to exist. Emptiness is not some kind of\nprimordial reality ante rem but a corrective to a mistaken\nview of how the world exists. This account boils down to saying that\nthere really are only two ways of understanding svabhāva:\nas essence and as substance. What was earlier called\nsvabhāva as absolute reality is only a specific form of\nsvabhāva understood as essence: in the same way as heat\nis an essential quality of fire emptiness is an essential quality of\nall phenomena. Things could not be the things they are without being\nempty. \n\nIn concluding our exposition of the different conceptual dimensions\nthat make up the concept of svabhāva in Madhyamaka\nthought we finally have to consider the cognitive understanding of the\nterm. This constitutes an indispensable component of\nNāgārjuna’s concept since for him the purpose of determining\nthe existence or non-existence of svabhāva is not just to\narrive at a theoretically satisfactory understanding of reality but is\ntaken to have far more comprehensive implications for how we interact\nwith the world. Realization of the non-existence of\nsvabhāva is supposed to have important soteriological\nconsequences as part of Buddhist practice; ultimately it is understood\nto be the way to the liberation from suffering, the final of the famous\nfour noble truths expounded by the Buddha. It is important to realize\nthat svabhāva understood as substance that\nNāgārjuna rejects is not a theoretical posit, an entity an\ninsufficiently sophisticated philosopher might postulate, but a kind\nof cognitive default, a way of superimposing something onto the world\nthat is automatic and immediate and not the result of detailed\ntheoretical reflection. We carry out such superimpositions when we\nregard the rapidly changing set of psycho-physical aggregates that\nconstitutes us as a single, permanent, independent self but also in our\ndaily interaction with other persons, medium-sized dry goods,\nlinguistic representations and so forth. These then lead to all sorts\nof painful emotional entanglements and constitute the key source of\nsuffering described in the Buddhist teachings. It is crucial to keep in\nmind in this context that the Madhyamaka distinguishes between the\nunderstanding of the absence of svabhāva or emptiness and\nits realization. The former is a purely intellectual response resulting\nfrom being convinced by the Madhyamaka arguments; it does not\nentail that phenomena will no longer appear as having\nsvabhāva. They will only cease to appear in this way as a\nresult of the realization of emptiness. The aim of Madhyamaka thought\nis therefore not simply to present an accurate account of the nature of\nthe world, but to bring about a cognitive change, a change in the way\nin which the world appears to us. It is useful to compare this\nsituation with the perception of an optical illusion such as the\nMüller-Lyer illusion in which two lines of equal length appear to\nbe of different length. By using a ruler we can convince ourselves that\nour perception deceives us; by learning more about perceptive\nmechanisms we can understand why we perceive the lines in the way they\ndo. But none of this implies that the lines will in the end\nlook as if they are equally long. \n\nAs we noted earlier the understanding of svabhāva in\nterms of substance (which is rejected by Nāgārjuna) conceives\nof it as an end-point in a series of dependence relations. Various\nkinds of dependence relations are discussed in the Madhyamaka\nliterature; the most important ones for our purposes are mereological\ndependence (the dependence of a composite object on its parts), causal\ndependence (the dependence of an effect on its cause) and conceptual\ndependence (the dependence of an object on the conceptualizing mind).\nFor the Madhyamaka these dependence relations are equivalent to the\nextent that none ever bottoms out. They do have different weight in\ntheir philosophical argumentation, however, since only establishing\nthat conceptual dependence does not have a foundation is sufficient for\nestablishing the absence of svabhāva in the comprehensive\nsense intended by the Madhyamaka philosophers. Even if there was no\nfoundation for mereological dependence, i.e. even if there were no\npartless particles, or no foundation of causal dependence, i.e. no\nfirst cause there would still remain an important sense in which things\nexist substantially, namely independent of human cognition and\nconceptualization. Only if we can show that no objects exist\nindependently with respect to conceptual dependence are we able to\nestablish Nāgārjuna’s anti-foundationalism in the full\nsense. \n\nIt is interesting to note that despite the fact that arguing for the\nnon-existence of svabhāva and the establishment of the\ntheory of universal emptiness is the central concern of\nNāgārjuna’s philosophy we do not find a “master\nargument” to accomplish this (see Siderits 2000: 228 and 2003:\n147). Of course we do find systematic lists of the core Madhyamaka\narguments, in particular in the later scholastic developments of this\nschool but none of them is regarded as the single argument that\nsettles the matter once and for all. The reason for this comes\ndirectly from the comprehensive rejection\nof svabhāva. If nothing has its nature intrinsically and\nindependently there can also be no argument for a particular thesis\nthat by its very nature establishes its conclusion independent of the\ncontext in which it is made and independent of the audience towards\nwhich it is directed. The Madhyamaka refutation of\nsvabhāva must proceed in a step-by-step manner. If there\nis someone who believes that some objects of kind x exist\nsubstantially the Madhyamaka will produce an argument to show that\nthese objects really lack svabhāva. For another opponent,\nwho thinks that not the xs but the ys are substantial\na different argument has to be used. It is plausible, however, that\nthere are certain areas of human thought in which human beings\ninevitably superimpose svabhāva on things which in fact\nlack it. A great deal of Madhyamaka literature is devoted to the\ndiscussion of these, and to arguments showing their lack of\nsvabhāva. The following section will examine some of\nthese areas more closely. \n\nIn Nāgārjuna’s discussion of causation we usually find him\ninvestigating a set of alternative ways in which cause and effect could\nbe related. Each of these is subsequently found to be unsatisfactory.\nAs a result Nāgārjuna does not conclude that causation is\nimpossible, but that our understanding of the causal relation must be\nbased on some faulty premiss. This premiss is the presupposition that\ncause and effect exist with their own svabhāva. What this\nmeans is that they are qualitatively distinct, independent objects:\nfirst the cause exists without the effect, later the effect can exist\nwithout the cause, once the cause has passed out of existence.\nApart from being independent of each other, cause and effect are also\nindependent of the cognizing mind. The chain of causes and conditions\nis something that exists out there in the world, independent of human\ninterests and concerns. Nāgārjuna intends to show that\nbecause there is something wrong with all the understandings\nof causation usually encountered, the difficulty is likely to lie in a\nmistaken supposition that underlies all of them. \n\nIn his most well-known discussion of causation Nāgārjuna\ndistinguishes four ways in which things could be causally be brought\nabout. They could be produced The idea that things are their own causes is a\nsomewhat peculiar one. The Buddhist discussion usually distinguishes\ntwo different views under this heading: that cause and effect are the\nvery same object, and that the effect is somehow contained in the\ncause. One plausible candidate for the identity of cause and effect is\npersistence through time. The idea here is that the cause of the\npresent rock is the rock one second ago, and that these two rocks are\nthe very same thing. Of course this only works if we are not\nendurantists, i.e. if we do not think that there are different temporal\nslices all of which make up the rock. If this is the case then what we\nare looking at here is one part of an object causing another, rather\nthan one object causing itself. For a perdurantist who believes there\nis some object wholly present during each time there is the difficulty\nthat we usually believe causes to temporally precede their effects. No\nobject can be temporally prior to itself, however. \n\nAssuming that the effect is somehow already contained in the cause\n(or in the causal field, that is in the collection of the cause and all\nthe necessary background conditions) might be a more interesting way of\nspelling out self-causation. This also entails that when the cause is\npresent, the effect is present too, contrary to our usual assumption\nthat it is the cause which brings about the effect at a later time.\nFurthermore we are not able to find the effect if we look amongst the\ncomponents of the causal field: amongst petrol, oxygen, a spark and so\nforth there is no explosion to be found. This does not mean that given\na sufficiently detailed description of the causal field we might not be\nable to infer the effect. But this would hardly be sufficient to allow\nus to speak of the containment of the effect in the cause. \n\nTo assume that cause and effect are distinct phenomena might strike\nus as the most natural understanding of causation. Yet\nNāgārjuna argues that cause and effect cannot be\nsubstantially distinct. This is because the effect depends\nexistentially on the cause (if the cause did not exist the\neffect would not exist) and cause depends at least notionally\non the effect (if there was no effect the cause would not be called\n“cause”). The kind of independence demanded by substantial\nexistence, by existence by svabhāva, is simply not\navailable for things which are cause and effect. On the other hand if\nwe had a set of objects that were distinct in the required sense it\nwould be hard to see how we could make sense of any of these being\neither cause or effect since no pair of objects from the set would be\nconnected by a dependence relation. For any two objects from this set\nthat we label “cause” and “effect” we can\nsimilarly imagine reversing the assignment as the existence of any one\ndoes not influence the existence of any other. But this implies that\nit cannot be the causal relation we are talking about, since in\ngeneral the roles of cause and effect cannot be switched. \n\nThe most convincing way of understanding this alternative is in\nterms of a cause that contains the effect in itself as a potentiality\nthat is actualized given certain conditions. A block of marble (the\ncause) may be said to contain a statue (the result) as a potentiality\nthat is made real by a variety of supporting conditions, namely the\nsculptor’s actions. Here cause and effect are not wholly distinct\n(since the block and the statue share some parts) nor are they\nidentical (since the block is not the statue), thereby avoiding the\ndifficulties implied by the preceding two accounts. This account is\nfine as far as it goes, but it would not support the contention that\neither cause or effect exist substantially, with\nsvabhāva. The supporting conditions could not exist\nwithout the block and the statue could not exist without either or\nthese. None of the objects involved have the roles they play from\ntheir own side, independently of one another. \n\nA final possibility to envisage is that causation is neither\nself-causation nor causation from a distinct object. This is usually\nregarded as the complete absence of causation since the first three\nalternatives are taken to be exhaustive: if these alternatives are\nruled out the only remaining possibility is that there are no causal\nrelata since there is no causal relation. A big difficulty with this\nview is that it fails to account for our ability to grasp facts about\nthe world, since our epistemic access is most plausibly understood as\ncausal. If there is no causal interaction between our sense-organs and\nthe objects out there how is knowledge of the world possible at all? A\nfurther concern is the fact that the world appears to us to be\ncausally ordered. It is not the case that more or less anything follows\nfrom anything else, but that certain things only follow from certain\nother things. As such an account that denies the existence of causal\nrelations altogether cannot be a satisfactory account of the world as\nwe experience it. \n\nNeither of the four alternatives just examined allows a plausible\nunderstanding of cause and effect as existing with\nsvabhāva. Nāgārjuna therefore argues that\nthere must be something wrong with the assumption that cause and\neffect exist in this way. They are not independent but mutually\ndependent. The dependence of the effect on the cause is easy to\nunderstand: if there was no cause there would not have been any\neffect. But how can we make sense of the reverse? Even if the cause\nhad not produced the effect if would still have existed (even though\nit would not have been called “cause”). There are three\ndifferent ways in which we can make sense of Nāgārjuna’s\nassertion that the cause depends existentially on the effect. \n\n(a) Firstly we can argue that if Nāgārjuna debates\nwith an opponent who holds that since a cause has its property of being\na cause essentially, its notional dependence on the effect will entail\nits existential dependence. For something being a cause essentially\nmeans that this is a property it could not lose without ceasing to be\nthat very object. But since the presence of this property depends on\nexistence of the effect, the existence of the cause as that very object\nalso depends on the existence of the effect. \n\n(b) A second interpretation which does not have to assume that causes\nare essentially causes argues that Nāgārjuna does not intend\nto refer to the existential dependence of some particular cause on its\neffect but rather to the existential dependence of the\nproperty of being a cause on the property of being an\neffect. If an object a falling under property P notionally\ndepends on something falling under Q this means that the\nproperty P existentially depends on the property Q,\nas P can only exist if some object falls under the property\n‘identical with the property Q’, i.e., if the\nproperty Q exists. \n\nThe property ‘being the left side of my body’ depends\nexistentially on the property ‘being the right side of my\nbody’, even though the objects falling under each do not\nexistentially depend on one another. This is due to the fact that one\nproperty could not exist without the other one, but the objects falling\nunder them could. In the case of cause and effect we could therefore\ninterpret Nāgārjuna as saying that the properties\n‘being a cause’ and ‘being an effect’ depend\nexistentially on one another, even though the existential dependence of\nobjects falling under them is not symmetric: the effect depends\nexistentially on the cause, but the cause does not need the effect for\nits existence. \n\n(c) The third and final reading claims that while Nāgārjuna\nundoubtedly also wanted to assert the existential dependence of the\nproperties ‘being a cause’ and ‘being an\neffect’ on each other he moreover made the claim that not only\nthe particular object which is the effect needs the cause for its\nexistence, but the cause also needs the effect. Such a reading can be\nsupported by considering an entire causal field, that is the cause\ntogether with the necessary background conditions, rather than just\nparticular causes. A causal field is a cognitive artefact, a collection\nof objects assembled with the sole purpose of explaining why a\nparticular effect came about. Divorced from this explanatory role there\nis no reason for introducing the concept at all. We might therefore\nwant to argue that the causal field also depends for its existence on\nthe effect it produces. This is of course not to say that every member\nof the causal field existentially depends on the effect they jointly\nbring about: the spark, petrol, and so forth would still exist, even if\nthey for some reason did not manage to bring about an explosion. But\nthe collection only exists if there is some effect it causes. Whether\nwe want to argue that a causal field depends for its existence on the\neffect it brings about is intimately connected with our view of the\nexistence of collections. We might either think that whenever the are\nsome objects there is the collection of those objects. Or we might deny\nthat every arbitrary assembly of objects constitutes a collection. We\nwould then argue that for some objects to form a collection there must\nbe something which makes them hold together as a collection, for\nexample that they all exemplify a property, or that they were put\ntogether for a specific purpose. If we adopt the first view of\ncollections then clearly a causal field will only depend nominally on\nits effect, since ‘being a causal field bringing about that\neffect’ is only one way in which we can refer to the pre-existent\ncollection that contains all the elements of the causal field, but not\nanything which brings it about. Adopting the second conception,\nhowever, it may be the case that the only thing that binds all\nthe members of the causal field together is that they are considered to\nbe the things that jointly bring about a particular effect. In the\nabsence of this effect the collection disintegrates and ceases to\nexist. \n\nNāgārjuna seems to favour the second interpretation when he\nasserts that a cause could not exist without an effect. (MMK 4.3) It\nis significant that what is denied here is not just the ascription of\nthe label ‘cause’ to some object because it is related to\nsome other object, the effect, but the existence of the cause in the\nabsence of the effect.  Nāgārjuna endorses not just the\nuncontroversial notional dependence of the cause on its effect, but\nits existential dependence as well. Applied to the discussion of\ncausal fields this implies that a causal field can only exist if the\neffect it brings about does, and for this reason cannot be taken to\nexist whenever all of its members do. If we adopt this third, stronger\nreading then we have to conclude that for Nāgārjuna causes\nand effects are both notionally and existentially dependent on one\nanother. They therefore cannot exist from their own side, irrespective\nof the existence of one another.  Moreover, they also depend for their\nexistence on us, because it is our cognitive act of cutting up the\nworld of phenomena in the first place that creates the particular\nassembly of objects that constitutes a causal field, which then in\nturn gives rise to the notions of cause and effect. This entails that\nthe causal field, cause and effect are empty\nof svabhāva. \n\nAn important point we must not lose sight of in the context of the\ndiscussion of causation is that while showing that objects stand in\ncausal relations is sufficient for showing that they are empty of\nsvabhāva in some way (since they do not exist\nindependently of one another), this on its own would not be sufficient\nsupport for Nāgārjuna’s thesis of universal emptiness. Just\nthe fact that some objects are cause and effect does not mean that they\nexist in any way dependent on human cognition, and it is this\ndependence on cognition or conceptualization that is generally regarded\nas the most profound understanding of emptiness. (It is also useful to\nnote in this context that the Ābhidharmikas, a Buddhist school\nthat was one of the main targets of Nāgārjuna’s criticism saw\nno conflict between objects being causally produced and their\npossessing svabhāva.) Mark Siderits (2004: 411) has\npointed out that what we have to argue first of all is that the objects\nwe usually interact with are causally produced so that speaking about\nthem involves essential reference to causality. We further need to\nappeal to the principle that if some object essentially involves a\nproperty that is conceptually constructed then the object is\nconceptually constructed too. Chess games are conceptually constructed,\nand since “the book describing the longest chess game ever played”\nessentially involves chess games it is conceptually constructed too.\nBut, as Nāgārjuna set out to show, since the causal relation\ndoes not exist from its own side, is conceptually constructed, and\ntherefore empty, each causally related object must be so constructed\nand therefore empty in the most profound sense of being conceptually\nconstructed. \n\nThe discussion of change, in particular that of spatio-temporal\nchange, of motion, occupies a prominent position in\nNāgārjuna’s arguments. In the second chapter of the MMK we\nfind a long discussion of the impossibility of motion. Parallels with\nZeno’s paradoxes have been drawn and it has been argued that\nNāgārjuna’s aim was to refute certain views of the structure\nof space and time (Siderits and O’Brien 1976). Nevertheless, there is\nsome evidence that Nāgārjuna two main aims were something\nelse: firstly, to reject a substantialist interpretation of some of the\nkey notions of the Buddhist teaching and, secondly, to defend a\nspecific view of the relation between individuals and their\nproperties. \n\nNāgārjuna employs two key arguments that we might want to\ncall the property-absence argument and the property-duplication\nargument. The first (MMK 2:3–3, 9–10) questions the suitability of such\nstatements like “the mover moves” because there are difficulties\nconceiving of a mover without motion. Nāgārjuna argues that\nthere is a difficulty with thinking of the individual (the mover) and\nthe property (the motion) in the familiar way, as mutually independent\nobjects. In the case of a blue vase the vase and the blueness can exist\nwithout each other (at least as long as we are not trope theorists)\nwhereas there clearly is no mover that does not move. The two stand in\na dependence relation since the individual depends on the property it\ninstantiates. It therefore cannot exist by svabhāva. \n\nThe second argument (MMK 2:5, 11) states that if we were to think in\nterms of a mover moving there would be two motions rather than one:\nthat motion which makes the mover a mover, and that motion by which it\nmoves. The reason for this is that a mover is an example of an\nindividual where a distinction between its constitutive and\ninstantiated properties cannot be drawn. The constitutive property is\nwhat constitutes an individual (something is a cube, or a pot, or a\nvase) and the instantiated properties are had by the individual (it is\nheavy, or round, or blue). If we apply these notions to the case of\nthe moving mover we would require two different motions: one which\nconstitutes the individual and one which is its property. But of\ncourse there is only one motion: that of the moving mover. The point\nNāgārjuna makes here is not just there are problems when\nanalyzing statements like “the mover moves”, “the\nthunder roars” and so forth in terms of an ontology of\nconstitutive and instantiated properties but the more general\nobservation that this has implications for the way we can apply these\nterms even to more usual statements like “the vase is\nblue”. That the distinction between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties makes no sense in the case of “the mover\nmoves” shows that there is no substantial distinction between\nthese properties, and that the conceptualization of a situation in\nterms of these is purely a result of cognitive convenience. Since we\nwant to stress certain features we speak of a blue, round vase instead\nof a vase-shaped, round, blue thing or a vase-shaped, blue, round\nthing, but this in no way implies that there is a fundamental\ndifference between the properties “being a vase”,\n“being round”, and “being blue” so that only\none of them is constitutive while the others are instantiated. There\nis no ready-made world that is already sliced in such a way. \n\nWhen Nāgārjuna argues that neither mover nor motion exist\nby svabhāva he first of all makes an important point\nabout some central concepts of the Buddhist world-view. The goal of\nthe Buddhist path is the liberation from cyclic existence, a form of\nexistence that is nothing but the moving about (samsṛ)\nthrough a succession of rebirths. When Nāgārjuna speaks\nabout the mover (gati) he has in mind both the familiar\nmotion from one end of the road to another one as well as the motion\nfrom one life to the next. Nāgārjuna’s arguments to the\neffect that mover and motion are interdependent, that the beginning\nand end of motion are not to be found “out there” in the\nworld entail that the person who is reborn, the cyclic existence he is\nreborn in and the liberation from that cyclic existence do not exist\nsubstantially. \n\nNāgārjuna’s second main point is that his analysis of\nmotion has specific implications for our view of individuals and\nproperties. The aim of his arguments is to show that the distinction\nbetween individuals and properties is not one which exists independent\nof our conceptualizations. As the talk about the ‘property’\ninstantiated by an individual like a mover or a clap of thunder had to\nbe explained in terms of a single feature seen in two different ways\n– as constitutive and as instantiating – in the same way\ntalk of the properties of ordinary individuals such as a blue vase\ncould be seen to be equally a reflection of the division of their\nfeatures into constitutive and instantiating properties, something\nwhich is just a reflection of our pragmatic concerns in conceptualizing\nthe individual in question, but not a reflection of its intrinsic\nnature. \n\nFor the Madhyamaka school conceiving of substances as individuals\ninstantiating properties is deeply unsatisfactory. For the sake of\nillustration (and using an Indian example) suppose that water-atoms are\nsubstances and that their only intrinsic property is wetness. Now what\nis the individual in which wetness inheres? As it is not characterized\nby any other properties it must be some kind of propertyless bare\nparticular. What makes it a bare particular? Given that we are dealing\nwith substances here it had better not depend on some other object. But\nif it is a bare particular by svabhāva and being a bare\nparticular is therefore its intrinsic nature we are in the same\nsituation as we were with the water-atoms and their wetness. For now we\ncan ask what the individual is in which being a bare particular\ninheres, and then we are well on our way into an infinite regress. Note\nthat this problem does not got away if we feel uneasy about the\nproperty ‘being a bare particular’ and do not want to admit\nit. For we have to assume that the individual has some determinate\nnature due to which it is a bearer of its properties and the difficulty\nwill just reappear with whatever we take such a nature to be. It does\nnot help much if we conceive of substances as particularized properties\nor tropes instead. For then it is unclear how we can individuate one\nwetness-trope from another. We cannot differentiate them according to\nthe individuals in which they inhere because we have just rejected the\nexistence of individuals at the level of substances. We cannot say that\nthis wetness-trope is different from that because they turn up in\ndifferent samples of water, since the samples of water are just\ncollections of tropes. Of course we could try to tell apart the various\ntrope-substances by the collections in which they occur (or, more\nprecisely, by which other tropes they are related to via a higher-order\ncompresence-trope). The difficulty for this is that it introduces\ndependence-relations via the back door, for every trope will\nexistentially depend on being connected to just these other tropes via\na compresence-trope — we cannot take a trope and\n‘move’ it to another collection. As we want to conceive of\nsubstances as entities that are not existentially dependent on one\nanother this approach inevitably introduces a certain tension into our\nsystem. It thus becomes apparent that once more a conceptual scheme\nthat can be more or less straightforwardly applied to non-substances\nbreaks down once we attempt to analyse the supposedly foundational\nobjects of our world in terms of it. While the analysis of a red apple\ninto an individual and the property it instantiates is at least on the\nface of it unproblematic, the same analysis cannot be carried out when\ndealing with ultimate existents. \n\n Nāgārjuna’s criticism of substance\ndoes not just apply to the world of objects, to the phenomena around\nus, but equally to the world of subjects, that is our own and other\npersons’ self. This is very much in harmony with the Buddha’s own\nconception of a person that rejected a self existing with\nsvabhāva. Such a self would have to be conceived of as\ndistinct from both our body and our psychological states, as\nessentially unchanging, as a unifier of our diverse beliefs, desires\nand sensory impressions, and as an agent that makes the decisions that\nshape our lives. The alternative presented by the Buddha is a view of\nthe self that regards it as a continuously changing array of five\npsycho-physical aggregates (the physical body, sensation, perception,\nintellect, and consciousness) without an inner core. Many of the\narguments Nāgārjuna presents in rejection the notion of a\nsubstantially existent subject bear a close resemblance to those\nbrought forward by the Buddha himself. \n Nevertheless his works also provide us with some arguments with\na distinctly Nāgārjunian slant. In MMK 18:2a the opponent\nwonders: ‘if there was no self, where would the self’s\nproperties come from?’ The worry behind this question is that the\nundeniable fact that there are properties of the self—since the\nMadhyamaka does not want to deny that seeing, feeling, tasting and so\nforth takes place — implies that there must be a bearer of such\nproperties, i.e. a self. Since properties depend existentially on\nsomething that instantiates them a self must be postulated as the\ninstantiator of all the mental properties we observe. It appears as if\nwe need a substratum for the psychological states, desires, beliefs and\nso on. However, the body, because of its continuously changing nature,\ncannot be regarded as adequate for such a substratumhood. Therefore\nsome kind of self has to be postulated. But if we take into account the\ndistinction between constitutive and instantiated properties described\nabove it seems possible to dissolve this worry. Nāgārjuna\ndifferentiates between the property we see as constituting an\nindividual (such as roundness in the case of a circle, treeness in the\ncase of a tree etc.) and those properties that the individual is then\ntaken to instantiate (such as redness in the case of the circle, and\ngreenness in the case of the tree). As became evident in the discussion\nof motion where Nāgārjuna introduces this distinction, the\ndifference between constitutive and instantiated properties is not\nregarded as bearing any ontological weight. It is rather a reflection\nof our epistemic priorities and practical concerns that we describe an\nobject as a tree which is green, rather that as a green object which\nhas the property of treeness. There is therefore no fundamental\nontological difference between a substratum (dravya) and the\nqualities (guṇa) that inhere in it, contrary to\nthe view that is e.g. held by the Naiyāyikas. \n(See the entry on \n  Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India (Navya-Nyāya).)\n When we speak of an individual having a property we nominalize\nthe predicate expressing the property we take to be constitutive and\nascribe the instantiating properties to the individual thus created.\nThere is, however, no deep ontological reason why we could not change\nour view of what the constitutive and what the instantiating properties\nare, and thereby describe the very same situation in terms of different\nindividuals and properties. But if we accept this picture of ontology\nit is evident that we are not obliged to infer the existence of a\nsubstratum or underlying individual from the existence of a quality. Of\ncourse the Mādhyamika does not deny that there are a variety of\nsensory and mental events that happen in close temporal and causal\nconnection. But our ascription of these to a single self does not\ncommit us to the existence of such a self at the ontological level, any\nmore than the ascription of redness to a circle commits us to the\nexistence of an individual — the circle — and the redness\nit instantiates. In the same way in which we select one property, such\nas circularity, as constitutive and then group all the other properties\naround this new-found ‘individual’, in the same way we\nselect certain properties of a causal nexus of sensory and mental\nevents, some ‘shifting coalition of psycho-physical\nelements’ and group the remainder of the properties around this\nnew-found ‘self’. To speak of the self and its properties\nin terms of substratum and quality is perfectly acceptable, as long as\nwe do not assume that such talk is based on a distinction with an\nontological grounding. \n\nAnother issue Nāgārjuna raises (in MMK 9:3) concerns the\nepistemic status of the self. A difficulty arises once we note that in\nits role as a unifier of our cognitive life a substantial self is the\nsubject of all experiences, but at the same time given the\ndistinctness of such a self from our body and all parts of our mental\nlife it must also be distinct from all experiences. So in order to\nhave epistemic access to our self it must be able to function as a\ncognitive object. Since we assume, however, that it is not only a\ncognitive subject but also intrinsically a cognitive subject it cannot\never occupy this role — at least if we make the plausible\nassumption that being an object and being a subject are mutually\nincompatible properties. Now given that we do not seem to be able to\nacquire knowledge of the self by introspection or by observation of\nthe outside world it appears that the only cognitive route left open\nto us is inference. We have to establish by an argument that the self\nexists. It might strike us as slightly curious that what seems to be\nthe most intimate object of our acquaintance has to be known by a most\nindirect route. We might also consider it as somewhat epistemically\nimplausible to assume that everybody’s belief in a self is arrived at\nby a process of drawing inferences from a set of clues. One Nyāya\nargument for the existence of the self based on the supposed\nexistential dependence of qualities on a substratum has already been\ndiscussed above. The Mādhyamika will be reluctant to accept it\nsince he does not agree with the Nyāya ontology of individuals\nand properties it presupposes. Other arguments would obviously have to\nbe dealt with on a case-by-case basis. But the Mādhyamika will\nargue here that in fact no such argument is needed, since it is\nperfectly possible to account for our self-awareness, as long as we\ngive up the conception of a substantial self. If we conceive of the\nself as a temporally stretched-out compound of psychophysical events\nthen there is no fundamental difficulty that the same type of event\nturns up on the cognizing subject side on one occasion, and on the\ncognized object side on another. Given that there is no unified\nsubstratum constituting the self there is also no necessity for\nsomething to be essentially a subject of experience. As different\nparts can play different roles at different times our self-knowledge\ncan be just explained by a momentary identification with a mental\nevent that presently functions as a cognizing subject. \n\nGiven that Nāgārjuna rejects the picture of a substantial\nself described above we have to consider which alternative picture we\nare presented with instead. The self is obviously seen as depending on\nthe five constituents, which rules out the assumption that any\nindependently existent substance could be regarded as a self. The\nemerging view of the self is characterized by two main properties. \n\nFirstly it is to be regarded as a sequence of events that stand in\nclose temporal and causal relations. Physical processes cause sensory\nevents, which are then framed by concepts, used as the basis of\ndecisions, which give rise to actions, which in turn set physical\nprocesses in motion which cause new sensory events and so forth. The\nself is not seen as a cognitive nucleus which stays constant amidst the\nstream of changing sensory impressions and mental deliberations, but\nrather as the entire set of such sensory and mental events which are\ninterconnected in complicated ways. \n\nNot only does the self depend for its existence on the constituents,\nbut the constituents only acquire their existence as distinct parts of\nthe stream of mental and physical events by being associated with a\nsingle self, which, regarded as a constitutive property, produces the\nbasis for postulating the individual in which the various properties\nof the self inhere. It is precisely this reason that keeps the\nMādhyamika from regarding the constituents as ultimate existents\n(dravya) and the self as merely imputed\n(prajñapti). For the Mādhyamika not only is there\nno substantial self, there is also no substantial basis on which a\nnon-substantial self could be built. Secondly, the self is\ncharacterized by a mistaken self-awareness. This means that the self\nwhich is essentially a sequence of events does not regard itself in\nthis way, but considers itself to be a substantial self, that is an\nessentially unchanging unified agent distinct from its physical and\nmental properties. To this extent it is deluded about its real\nnature. Nāgārjuna therefore compares the agent to an\nillusion created in a magical performance that in turn brings about\nanother illusion (MMK 17:31–32). This construction allows him to\nreconcile his rejection of a substantial self as an essentially\nunchanging unifier of our mental live distinct from both its physical\nand mental attributes with the acceptance of the self as an agent who\nwill experience the results of his actions, an assumption which could\nnot be relinquished within the Buddhist worldview. This is a very\nimportant point, since the identification of the self with a causally\ninterlinked set of events might tempt us to throw out all prudential\nconsiderations for our future selves, as well as those for other\nselves. Since none of these have any ultimate existence we might think\nthat all actions referring to them in some way (that is all our\nconscious actions) are all equally insubstantial too, so that in the\nultimate analysis it does not make any difference how we act.\nNāgārjuna counters this view by distinguishing the view from\nthe inside of an illusion from that from the outside. When we are\ndreaming and are not aware we are doing so we understandably prefer to\nleave a building by using the stairs, rather than jumping out of the\nwindow. For somebody who is not dreaming, however (and also for our\nlater, waking selves) it does not make any difference whether we jump\nor not since at the ultimate level (from the point of view of the\nawakened one) there is no fundamental difference between the two\nactions. This does not imply that whilst we are still under the thrall\nof the illusion we should leave all prudential and moral\nconsiderations behind. On the contrary, as long as we are under the\ninfluence of the illusion we have to act in accordance with its laws,\neven if we might suspect that it is an illusion. Unlike in the case of\ndreaming, where the mere wondering whether we are dreaming sometimes\nallows us to see through the nature of the dream the mere suspicion\nthat there is no substantial self is (unfortunately) not yet a\nrealization of the emptiness of the self. \n\nThe Indian philosophical tradition distinguishes a variety of\nepistemic instruments (pramāṇa) by which epistemic\nobjects (prameya) are accessed. Which epistemic instruments\nwere accepted and how their function is understood differs amongst\ndifferent philosophical theories. In his discussion of epistemology\nNāgārjuna lists four such instruments: perception\n(pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna),\nrecognition of likeness (upamāna), and testimony\n(āgama). His primary concern is not a discussion of the\nnature and interrelation of these different epistemic instruments, but\nthe question of how to establish any particular set of such\ninstruments, whether it is the one just indicated or a different one.\nOnce we have agreed that the existence of epistemic objects is\nestablished by the epistemic instruments (as for example the existence\nof the desk in front of me is established by my perceptual abilities,\nin this case primarily non-defective vision) we then have to address\nthe further question of how to establish the instruments. How do we\nknow that these instruments are good guides to the objects out there in\nthe world? \n\nThere are three different ways in which we can try to establish the\nmeans of knowledge. First of all we could regard them as established\nby mutual coherence. Secondly we could assume that the epistemic\ninstruments justify themselves. We do not have to go beyond perception\nto realize that perception usually delivers an accurate picture of the\nworld, but perception itself presents a faithful representation of the\nworld and of its own validity.  Finally one could regard the epistemic\ninstruments and objects as mutually establishing each other. The\ninstruments establish an object by giving us epistemic access to\nit. But we could also argue that the epistemic object in turn\nestablishes the epistemic instruments.  Given that we manage to\ninteract with the objects of knowledge more or less successfully (as\nconfirmed by the evolutionary success of our species) there must be\nsomething amongst our cognitive means which gives us a relatively\naccurate account of the way things are. In this way epistemic success\nallows us to establish the means of knowledge via the objects\nsuccessfully cognized. \n\nNāgārjuna does not devote a great deal of discussion of to\nthe first alternative, the establishment of the means of knowledge by\nmutual coherence. The reason for this is that this is hardly a position\nhis realist Naiyāyika opponent will want to adopt. There are,\nafter all, coherent fairy-tales. Let us therefore have a closer look at\nthe other two alternatives, paying particular attention whether there\nis any way in which the epistemic objects and instruments could be\nconstrued as having their nature intrinsically, that is, as existing\nwith svabhāva. \n\nRegarding the epistemic instruments as self-established has the\nimmediate advantage of avoiding two difficulties. Firstly we get\naround the infinite regress of establishing the instruments by other\ninstruments, which then in turn need yet other instruments to\nestablish them, and so forth. Unlike other forms of infinite regress\nwhich Nāgārjuna accepts (such as an infinitely extended\nchain of causes and conditions) this regress is vicious, since the\nburden of proof is transferred in its entirety to the preceding stage,\nas a epistemic instrument would have to establish all the succeeding\nones. Secondly the self-establishment of the epistemic instruments\nallows the opponent to hold on to the assumption that everything\nknowable is established by such instruments. It might be attractive to\ngive up this assumption in order to escape the vicious regress, but\nthis then makes it necessary to give a special reason explaining why\nordinary objects are by established epistemic instruments, but not the\ninstruments themselves. \n\nDespite these advantages, Nāgārjuna argues, there are some\nserious problems with the assumption that the epistemic instruments are\nself-established. First of all, if an epistemic instrument, such as\nvisual perception, was self-established it should be able to exist\nindependently of the existence of an object of vision. But if we then\nassume that it is an essential property of visual perception to see,\nvisual perception must be able to function as its own object, as\notherwise there might be no other object to be seen. This,\nNāgārjuna claims, then leads to a problem already encountered\nin his analysis of motion. The mover and the place being moved over\ncannot exist simultaneously, since motion takes time; vision cannot see\nsomething that exists simultaneously with it (such as itself), since\nvision takes time too (MMK 3:2–3, see also Garfield 1995: 139–139).\nSecondly, observing again that if the epistemic instruments are\nself-established they will be established independently of the objects\nknown, Nāgārjuna argues as follows. Assume that we wanted to\nchose those amongst all the different means of cognitive access to the\nworld that deliver accurate knowledge of the nature of the objects\nknown, that is, that qualify as epistemic instruments. We would select\nall those that have a specific internal quality. The possession of this\nquality would then guarantee that its possessor delivered accurate\ninformation about the nature of the objects cognized. But how is the\nconnection between the specific internal quality and the correct\nrepresentation of the object justified? After all there are all sorts\nof properties our means of cognitive access to the world can have, so\nhow do we know that a specific one is a guide to accurate\nrepresentation? \n\nSuppose we are presented with a set of fancy mechanical devices and\nare asked to select the five best tin openers from these. No detailed\nstudy of the internal properties of each will allow us to accomplish\nthat task. We have to analyse each in relation to a tin and try to\ndetermine the way in which it might open it. Only then would we be able\nto conclude which particular properties of the mechanisms are\ncorrelated with good tin-opening abilities. In the same way we can only\nregard an internal quality of a way of accessing the world as a\ncharacteristic of an epistemic instrument once we have assessed it in\nrelation to the objects cognized. Only then can we conclude that this\nparticular property really leads us to the knowledge of the nature of\nthe object, rather than doing something else. But in this case the\nestablishment of the epistemic instruments can no longer be regarded as\nself-establishment since it incorporates reference to other objects\n(namely the objects known) at an essential place. \n\nIf the argument for the self-establishment of the epistemic\ninstruments is not successful, the remaining option is to argue that\nthe instruments and objects mutually establish one another. Assume\nthat I see an apple on the table. The existence of the apple, the\nepistemic object, is established by the epistemic instrument which is\nperception. But we could equally argue the other way round: that the\nobject known establishes the epistemic instrument. This would invite\nthe immediate objection that we then need prior cognitive access to\nthe object known, and if we have this we must already have established\nthe epistemic instrument. We are therefore pointlessly establishing it\ntwice. But if we somehow gain this access without relying on the\nepistemic instruments the whole project of establishing these\ninstruments seems futile, since it is precisely the justification of\nour instruments used in gaining knowledge of the world that we have\nset out to scrutinize.  We will therefore need a different\nargumentative strategy to argue for the mutual establishment of\nobjects known and epistemic instruments, and in particular for the\nestablishment of the latter by the former.  One way of going about\nthis (which does not commit us to the viciously circular mutual\nestablishment criticized by Nāgārjuna) is to argue that\nbecause the epistemic object is perceived, there must be something\nbringing about such a perception, and this is the epistemic\ninstrument. In this case the apple establishes the existence of the\nepistemic instrument by which it is known. An essential prerequisite\nfor this latter direction of establishment is of course\nsuccess. Because we successfully apprehend an apple our means of\napprehension is regarded as an epistemic instrument. If we were\nsusceptible to frequent apple-hallucinations that disappeared once we\ntried to touch them we would not regard perception as a reliable\napple-detector, that is, as an epistemic instrument. But since we are\ngenerally successful in our cognitive interactions with the world and\nnormally only perceive the existence of apples that are indeed there\nthe very fact that we successfully apprehend a world of outside\nobjects serves as an argument for regarding the successful means of\napprehension as epistemic instruments. An immediate difficulty with\nthis procedure is that we also need an epistemic instrument for\nestablishing the success of our cognitive actions, that is to\nascertain whether we really are perceiving the apple or just an\napple-hallucination. \n\nNothing seems to rule out that some epistemic instrument first\ndeceives us about what we see, and later deceives us about the outcome\nof whatever procedure we use to establish whether the first cognition\nwas successful. But this need not rule out any attempts of mutually\nestablishing the epistemic instruments and objects if we do not use\nepistemically suspect procedures (which we know to have lead to\nunsuccessful cognitions in the past) to establish the success of our\ncognitive actions. A more worrying question is whether the mutual\nestablishment of instruments and objects – if successful –\nactually delivers the account of epistemic instruments\nNāgārjuna’s opponent wants to defend. In order to see this\nwe have to note first that the notion of ‘successful cognitive\napprehension’ referred to above cannot just be an act of\ncognition that leads to a successful action, as many of our cognitions\n(and many of the beliefs subsequently acquired) are never acted\nupon. We therefore also have to include coherence with other\ncognitions or beliefs as a criterion for the success of some epistemic\ninstruments as well. Our cognition of the apple on the table might\ntherefore be deemed successful if it either leads to a successful\naction (we reach out, grasp the apple, and eat it) or if it coheres\nwith other epistemic instruments (for example with my memory of buying\na bag of apples and putting them on the table). However, the\ndifficulty with employing coherence in this way is that we have to\nselect a certain set of cognitions or beliefs that we hold fixed, so\nthat we can then evaluate the status of other cognitions relative to\nthem. One problem now is of course how to assure the accuracy of this\nselected set: if they are not accurate themselves coherence with them\nhas very little argumentative weight. \n\nNāgārjuna’s account of epistemology is supposed to\nfulfill a purpose both at the object- as well as at the meta-level. At\nthe object-level epistemic instruments and objects are just another\nset of central concepts that have to be investigated as entities\npotentially existing with svabhāva. Nāgārjuna\nargues that the various ways in which the epistemic instruments and\nobjects could be established are either not satisfactory or fail to\nshow that they exist with svabhāva. At the meta-level\nNāgārjuna’s theory of epistemology is supposed to\nprovide the theoretical background of his own account of emptiness. As\nthe theory of emptiness is something we are supposed to acquire\nknowledge of it is essential to get clear about the means by which we\nare supposed to do so, and indeed about what our epistemic object\nconsists of in this case. These two projects are inherently\ninterconnected. For according to the standard Nyāya theory of\nepistemology Nāgārjuna encountered, knowledge is acquired by\nusing a set of procedures (such as perception or inference) the nature\nof which it is to produce knowledge and which convey information about\na set of objective, mind-independent set of individuals that are the\nbearers of specific qualities. But a theory that thus presupposes the\nexistence of objects of knowledge with distinct natures which the\nmeans of knowledge could adequately represent could hardly be used as\na basis for knowing emptiness, for it presupposes exactly what the\ntheory of emptiness denies. A substantial part of\nNāgārjuna’s epistemological discussion is therefore\ndedicated to a criticism of the standard Nyāya theory of\nknowledge. Nāgārjuna sets out to establish that nothing can\nbe regarded as intrinsically an epistemic instrument or object. The\ntwo have to be mutually established: the instrument establishes the\nobject by giving us cognitive access to it, our successful interaction\nwith the object establishes the instrument as a trustworthy route to\nthe object. Something will therefore be classified as an epistemic\ninstrument or object not because this is a reflection of its intrinsic\nnature, but because it is regarded as such once a reflective\nequilibrium has been reached. We use beliefs about the nature of the object\nin order to test our hypotheses concerning the instruments of acquiring such beliefs,\nthese hypotheses are then in turn used to assess our view of the nature of the object. \n\nLanguage is not a topic that is given much explicit discussion in\nNāgārjuna’s works. This does not mean that such matters\nwere not important to him, but merely that his extant writings do not\ncontain an extended connected discussion of the impact of his theory of\nemptiness on his view of language. \n\nNevertheless it is possible to extract some of\nNāgārjuna’s views on this philosophically highly\ninteresting issue from remarks found at different places in his\nworks. \n\nMost importantly it is apparent that the Madhyamaka theory of\nemptiness is not compatible with a the idea of a ‘ready-made\nworld’, that is of a world that exists independently of human\ninterests and concerns and already shows a particular kind of\nstructuring that our structured language could then set out to\nreflect.  If nothing exists with svabhāva nothing in the\nworld could exist from its own side and nothing could bear a structure\nthat is intrinsic to it, rather than something ascribed to it from the\noutside. Moreover, the Mādhyamika will reject the classic\ncorrespondence theory of truth, according to which the truth of a\nstatement is grounded in a similarity of structure between a statement\nand the bit of the world it refers to. This also entails a rejection\nof the corresponding view of how language works, namely that our\nsentences manage to connect up with the world via a set of objectively\nexistent structural similarities. The main reason for this rejection\nis that the Mādhyamika cannot find any sufficiently substantial\nrelation that would allow us to bind together world and word at the\nmost fundamental level. The most plausible candidate for linking words\nand their referents is the causal relation, for example by using it to\nconstruct a causal chain from an ‘initial baptism’ to our\npresent use of the term. But as Nāgārjuna has argued in\ndetail the causal relation itself is conceptually constructed. But if\ncausation cannot be regarded as a relation that functions objectively,\nindependent of the concepts we employ then it can hardly be regarded\nas a mind-independent way of founding the relationship between\nlanguage and the world. \n\nAn alternative account which the Mādhyamika might want to adopt\nis one which does not conceive of truth in terms of correspondence\nwith an exterior reality but rather in terms of assertability\nconditions. In this case a statement is regarded as true if conditions\nobtain that warrant our asserting the statement. What makes the\nstatement that water is wet true is not a structural correspondence\nbetween it and a fact about water, but that we have something that\njustifies us in making this statement. What this justification\nconsists in depends on the further details of our theory of truth; it\nmight be based on facts about empirical observation, about coherence\nwith other beliefs, about pragmatic success and so forth. This view of\ncourse implies that there could not be any truths that are in\nprinciple beyond our ability to know them. This is because we could\nnever have a warrant for asserting such statements, and the existence\nof such a warrant is precisely what we consider the truth of the\nstatements to consist in.  Such statements would have to be regarded\nas lacking a truth-value.  This kind of denial of\nverification-transcendent truths in turn agrees very well with\nNāgārjuna’s contextualist epistemology.  For if nothing is\nintrinsically an epistemic instrument nothing can be intrinsically\nbeyond the grasp of such instruments either. As what constitutes an\nepistemic instrument is context-dependent, that a certain truth cannot\nbe accessed by some instrument is context-dependent too. There is no\ncontext-independent concept of knowledge we could use to form the idea\nof a truth that lies beyond all epistemic contexts. \n\nAccording to the Madhyamaka view of truth there can be no such thing\nas ultimate truth, a theory describing how things really are,\nindependent of our interests and conceptual resources employed in\ndescribing it. All one is left with is conventional truth, truth which\nconsists in agreement with commonly accepted practices and conventions.\nThese are the truths that are arrived at when viewing the world through\nour linguistically formed conceptual framework. But we should be wary\nof denigrating these conventions as a distorting device that\nincorporates our specific interests and concerns. The very notion of\n‘distortion’ presupposes that there is a world untainted by\nconceptuality out there (even if our minds can never reach it) that is\ncrooked and bent to fit our cognitive grasp. But the very notion of\nsuch a ‘way things really are’ is argued by the\nMādhyamika to be incoherent. There is no way of investigating the\nworld apart from our linguistic and conceptual practices, if only\nbecause these practices generate the notion of the ‘world’\nand of the ‘objects’ in it in the first place. To speak of\nconventional reality as distorted is therefore highly misleading,\nunless all we want to say is that our way of investigating the world is\ninextricably bound up with the linguistic and conceptual framework we\nhappen to employ. \n\nThere are two worries one might have with the rejection of the notion\nof an ultimate truth. First of all one might think that progress in\nhuman inquiry requires that we question what we now believe to be\ntruths and perhaps replace them with other beliefs. Even a cursory\nacquaintance with the history of science will show that we are where\nwe are now only through a persistent process of replacing beliefs we\nonce held to be true, but no longer hold to be true. But it seems hard\nto explain what our justification for this is if it is not trying to\nbring our beliefs into greater accordance with the way things are. All\nwe ever seem to be dealing with according to the Madhyamaka view is a\npurely immanent notion of truth where the only kind of truth we have\naccess to is a reflection of conventional human practices and\nagreements. In response to this the Mādhyamika might want to make\nthe point that it is at least sometimes advantageous to treat truths\nas if they had a more than conventional grounding, that is as if they\nwere not just the product of agreement with commonly accepted\npractices and conventions.  This is precisely because such practices\nneed improvement from time to time, and since a spirit of inquiry is\nfacilitated more by the idea that there is a mind-independent truth\nwaiting to be discovered. The Mādhyamika could thus argue that\nfor pragmatic reasons we should conceive of truths as reflections of\nan objective, external reality even though we do not think that there\nare any such truths in fact. We might object at this point that if the\nnotion of the existence of at least some verification-transcendent\ntruths is pragmatically useful, whoever believes in truth as warranted\nassertability then has to believe that some truths are not\nconventional, since asserting this is now supported by a warrant. But\nthis will not just turn the anti-realist into a realist against his\nwill, since his embracing of non-conventional truths is dictated by\npurely practical concerns: we are considerably better off if we build\nour inquiries on the convenient fiction of non-conventional\ntruths. But they remain just that, namely convenient fictions; the\nanti-realist does not think, as the realist does, that the existence\nof such truths is in any way grounded by the way the world is\nindependent of our interests and concerns. \n\nAnother worry with the Mādhyamika’s rejection of an\nultimate truth is that emptiness cannot then be regarded as the\nultimate truth either. But surely, one will argue, for the\nMādhyamika emptiness is the end-product of the correct analysis of\nphenomena, and thereby indicative of the way things really are.\nHowever, emptiness is not to be understood as a description of reality\nas it is independent of human conceptual conventions, as its main\npurpose it to combat the wrong ascription of svabhāva to\nthings. The absence of svabhāva or emptiness is nothing\nphenomena have within themselves, but only something which is projected\nonto them from the outside in an attempt to rectify a mistaken\ncognition. Therefore the theory of emptiness is not to be regarded as\nan ultimately true theory either. Such a theory would describe things\nas they are independent of human interests and concerns. But the theory\nof emptiness is intricately bound up with such interests and concerns:\nif there were no human minds who mistakenly read the existence of\nsvabhāva into phenomena which lack it there would be no\npoint in having a theory to correct this. It is only due to our\nerroneous view of things that the theory of emptiness is required as a\ncorrective. \n\nThe preceding discussion has discussed some of the main topics\nNāgārjuna addresses in order to refute their existence by\nsvabhāva: causation, change, the self, knowledge,\nlanguage, and truth. This is not a comprehensive exposition of the\nMadhyamaka view, however, not just because there are aspects of\nNāgārjuna’s thought we have not mentioned here (such has his\ndiscussion of time and his account of ethics), but because Madhyamaka\nthought regards itself as a philosophical antidote against\nsuperimpositions of svabhāva wherever they arise. It is\ntherefore by necessity more comprehensive than the arguments found in\nNāgārjuna’s works. They provide examples of argumentative\nprocedures and discussions of putative examples of\nsvabhāva prominent amongst Nāgārjuna’s\nopponents. But the Madhyamaka project consists not just in the\nexplanation and defense of these arguments (even though most of the\npositions Nāgārjuna argues against are of more than\nhistorical importance) but has to be continued in the debate with the\ndefenders of svabhāva in the contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion. It is apparent that Madhyamaka philosophy is opposed to the\nbrand of realism currently found in much of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy (Michael Devitt (1997: 41) characterizes this succinctly as\nthe claim that ‘most current common-sense and scientific physical\nexistence statements are objectively and mind-independently\n(deflationary) true’). Things that exist in a mind-independent\nmanner exist with svabhāva, even though they might be\ndependent in all other kinds of ways. (Even if everything out there\ndepended on every other thing, as long as the entire network of\ndependence-relations was mind-independent it would exist with\nsvabhāva). Of course the Mādhyamika’s talk of\n“mind-dependence” does not refer to dependence on any\nindividual mind, as a solipsist would assume, but collective\ndependence on all the minds there are. This view raises a variety of\ninteresting questions that Madhyamaka philosophy has to address. First\nof all there is the question of how to make sense of objects like Mt\nEverest depending on all our minds collectively. It is clear how we\ncould say something like this about things existing merely by the\nforce of convention, such as the objects traded on the stock\nmarket. But how could something like a mountain be merely\nconventionally existent? Secondly, given the Madhyamaka rejection of a\ncorrespondence-theoretic account of truth, how can it come up with a\ntheory of meaning and truth that is not committed to some sort of\nstructural isomorphism between word and world but still gives us a\nrobust account of what distinguishes true from false sentences?\nThirdly, if it is not facts out there that settle what is true how can\nthe Mādhyamika avoid the unacceptable relativistic conclusion\nthat we cannot criticize epistemic or ethical practices which differ\nfrom ours? Fourthly, how can we make sense of an ontology without\nfoundations in which there are no substantially existent objects on\nwhich everything else depends? (For an interesting formal model of\nsuch an ontology see Priest 2009, 2014. This question has obvious systematics connections with the current discussion of grounding.) Many aspects of these\nquestions have been addressed in vast body of commentarial literature\nthat was written in the nearly two millenia since Nāgārjuna\ncomposed his key philosophical works. Other still remain to be\naddressed. One of these is the question to which extent Madhyamaka thought is essentially linked to Buddhism. This is a question that has attracted more interest recently especially from researchers that study Madhyamaka primarily as a philosophical, rather than as a religious tradition. (For some interesting reflections on matter this see McGuire 2017).\n\nIf we consider the lively status of Madhyamaka studies today it seems evident that the questions Nāgārjuna asked and the system of\nphilosophy he founded in the second century remain very much alive in\nthe twenty-first.","contact.mail":"jan.westerhoff@lmh.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"lmh.ox.ac.uk"}]
