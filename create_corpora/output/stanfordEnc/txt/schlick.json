Indeed, Schlick’s\nreputation was established well before the Circle went public. In\n1917, he published Space and Time in Contemporary Physics, a\nphilosophical introduction to the new physics of Relativity which was\nhighly acclaimed by Einstein himself as well as many others. The\nfollowing year, the first edition of his influential General\nTheory of Knowledge appeared and, in 1922, he was appointed to\nthe prestigious chair of Naturphilosophie at the University\nof Vienna. Upon his arrival at his new post, he immediately began to\ncollaborate with the mathematician Hans Hahn, the sociologist and\neconomist Otto Neurath, forming a discussion group known as the\n‘Schlick Zirkel’. In the 1930s, the intellectual\nenergy of the Circle was increased by newcomers like Rudolf Carnap and\nKurt Gödel, as well as the outside influences of thinkers from\nAmerica (Ernest Nagel, W. V. O. Quine), Britain (A. J.  Ayer), Poland\n(Alfred Tarski), and Germany (Hans Reichenbach), put Schlick in the\nmidst of a virtual whirlwind of philosophical activity which deepened,\nbroadened, and matured his thinking. As his international fame grew,\nSchlick found himself lecturing in London, teaching at Stanford, and\nreceiving offers to join the faculties of prestigious universities\nboth at home and abroad. At the same time, he produced a number of\nessays which exerted a deep and lasting influence on contemporary\nthought. But Schlick’s life was cut short by an assassin’s\nbullets in 1936, much to the loss of the intellectual world.\n\n\n\nMoritz Schlick is primarily remembered as the leader of the Vienna\nCircle of Logical Positivists, which flourished in the early\n1930s. Few philosophers of science today would deny that\ntheir views have been influenced – one way or the other – by the\npositions which emerged from the group of philosophers, mathematicians,\nand social scientists who gathered in between-wars Vienna. And\nwhile it cannot be denied that other Circle members were more prominent\nand influential over the long-term, none contributed more unity and\ncohesion to the Vienna group during its brief existence. Indeed,\nlong before 1930, when the Circle’s Manifesto,\n“Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung: Der Wiener\nKreis”, appeared, Schlick had already made contributions to\nscientific epistemology which exerted a profound influence on\nsubsequent generations of philosophers (Neurath 1973, Ch. 9). And while\nother Circle members quite deservedly continue to receive a great deal\nof attention, there has always been a steady interest in\nSchlick’s views on a range of issues, for there is much of\nlasting value to be discovered in them.  \n\nSchlick was born in Berlin in 1882 and grew up as the son of a\nmiddle-class factory manager. After gymnasium, he\nattended the University of Berlin, intent from the start to study\nphysics. His ambition led him to work with Max Planck and he\nreceived his Ph.D. in 1904. After a year of experimental work at\nGöttingen, he eventually made his way to Zurich where he took up\nthe study of Philosophy. In 1910, he secured a position at\nRostock, moving on to Kiel before assuming the Chair of\nNaturphilosophie at Vienna in 1922. Through all these\nchanges, as well as subsequent modifications of his thought, the\nevidence of Schlick’s training in Berlin remained just below the\nsurface. Schlick was, after all, the heir apparent to the\ntradition of philosophical physicists, a tradition founded by Hermann\nvon Helmholtz, the icon of 19th Century physics and an influential\nleader of the zurück zu Kant movement, and continued by\nhis student and (later) colleague Planck (Coffa 1991, 179–183). \nAlthough few professional philosophers embraced the methods and\nproblems of the philosophical physicists, they were highly influential\nthroughout the community of professional physicists, largely due to\ntheir prestige. \n\nAlthough Schlick was originally trained in Physics, it is important\nto remember that, in late 19th Century Germany, physicists\nwere deeply interested in philosophical issues, especially at\nBerlin. Schlick was the intellectual heir of both\n Hermann von Helmholtz,\na major figure among 19th Century physicists and a\nchampion of the zurück zu Kant movement and Max\nPlanck. In 1889, Planck succeeded Gustav Kirchhoff and became\nHelmholtz’ colleague. Both Helmholtz and Planck integrated\nKantian themes in their philosophical thinking and there can be no\ndoubt that, even though Schlick could never be considered much of a\nKantian, he was deeply sympathetic with many of Kant’s\nideas. To begin with, Kant’s interests in epistemological\nconcerns arising from the advanced mathematical sciences attracted\nSchlick’s admiration and respect, much as it had drawn the\ninterests of Helmholtz and Planck. And all three embraced the\ngoal of developing a philosophical understanding of recent developments\nin physical science in the spirit, if not the letter, of Kant’s\nthought. For the most part, their departures from Kant’s\noriginal doctrines may be viewed as innovations or improvements of\nKant’s insights, introduced without abandoning their own most\nfundamental philosophical commitments.  \n\nFor instance, one of Helmholtz’ most well-known innovations is\nthe study of perception in his monumental Handbook of Physiological\nOptics (1856–1867) (Helmholtz 1924–5). This work was the\nsource of his so-called ‘sign-theory’, based on the idea\nthat perceptions are signs or place-holders for what they signify, but\ndo not resemble or copy them in any way. In his early writings,\nHelmholtz thought sensations are signs of their external causes, so the\nassociations among sensations represent corresponding regularities\namong their sources. Consequently, it is the regular changes of\nsigns, their serial structure, which reflects the order of their\nunderlying causes. But this latter consequence implies a causal\ntheory of perception which is fundamentally antithetical to\nKant’s understanding of causality. After all, Kant had\nrestricted the operations of causality to the realm of appearances,\nthus excluding unobservable causes lying behind and causing observable\nphenomena. But this departure from a basic tenet of Kant’s\nthought was compounded by the fact that Helmholtz’ account of the\nknowledge of the location of objects in space is thoroughly empiricist,\nand also rests on the principle of causality, understood as a causal\nrealist would. But in his 1881 notes to his memoir, Helmholtz\ncorrected himself, recalling that Kant’s views on causality were\nlimited to lawfulness among appearances (Friedman 2010, 631; Friedman\n1997, 30–1). What Helmholtz then asserted, in his classic essay\n“On the Facts of Perception,” is that the inference to a\nhypostasized reality lying behind the appearances goes beyond what is\nwarranted by the lawfulness obtaining among appearances. Indeed,\nall localizations of objects in space are really nothing more than the\ndiscovery of the lawfulness of the connections obtaining among our\nmotions and our perceptions. The difference between what is\ngenuinely perceived and its realistic interpretation is just the\ndifference between the regularities in our perceptions and the\nhypothesis of enduring, substantial sources of the perceived\nregularities (Helmholtz 1977, 138–140).  \n\nAlthough Helmholtz’ philosophical work was not particularly\nwell-received by professional philosophers like\n Hermann Cohen,\nco-founder of the Marburg School of neo-Kantians, it exerted a powerful\ninfluence on physicists (Cohen 1885, 202–204). In particular, Max\nPlanck was an early supporter of the sign-theory. But Planck\nnever interpreted the sign-theory causally, like Helmholtz had in his\nearliest writings. Rather, Planck recognized that “our\nperceptions provide, not a representation of the external world”\nbut, rather, “measurements furnish the physicist with a sign\nwhich he must interpret” (Planck 1960, 53; Planck 1933,\n84). Furthermore, Planck generalized the sign-theory, arguing that\nit is not objects, in and of themselves, which are known, but the\nstructural relations in which they stand to one another. His\nfundamental idea was that what is known are not the natures of\n‘things’ but complex structures of relations connecting\n‘things’ to one another (Planck 1933, 84ff. and 1960,\n53). Thus, the ‘objects of knowledge’ are not objects\nat all but, rather, what is known are the relata of the structural\nnetworks of relations in which they stand to other relata. And,\nas recent developments have increased the level of abstraction of\nscientific thought, it has become further removed from its\nanthropomorphic origins. So the unification of the scientific\nworld-picture is achieved through increasing abstraction which, in\nturn, drives structural representation, thus reducing the\nanthropomorphic elements in the scientific image of the\nworld (Planck 1949, 105).  The result of\nPlanck’s effort is a theory of knowledge which is structuralist,\ngeneralized from Helmholtz’ sign-theory of perception, but which\nnonetheless preserves the themes of unification and objectivity derived\nfrom Kant. \n\nThese themes are particularly evident in Planck’s celebrated\n(1908) Leiden lecture on “The Unity of the Physical\nUniverse”, directed at Ernst Mach’s phenomenalistic\nNaturphilosophie (Planck 1960, 1–26). Without going into\ndetails, Mach regarded physical objects as unnecessary\nhypostasizations, implying that the mechanical view underlying physics\nis little more than an elaborate myth. The physics of the matter\nwere effectively settled when Planck secured the mechanical foundations\nof irreversibility in his Radiation Law of 1900 by relying on Ludwig\nBoltzmann’s statistical approach to thermodynamics which, in\nturn, implied atomism. Yet it remained to establish the\nphilosophical implications of these achievements. In his Leiden\nlecture, Planck argued that this result presented an objective\nworld-picture abstracted from its anthropomorphic origins to produce a\nsynthetically unified image of the world (Planck 1960, 6). Such a view, Planck argued, can\nonly be produced through the unification of the diverse fields of\nphysical phenomena if they are synthesized by means of mathematical\nabstraction. Such abstraction generalizes the sign-theory to\napply to theoretical as well as perceptual representations, resulting\nin a full-blown structuralist epistemology (Planck 1933, 84ff.; Planck\n1949, 105). And it is this method of abstraction that\nproduces the synthetic unity grounding scientific objectivity. \nThe result is that physical entities are ‘objective’, in\nthe Kantian sense, since they embody the lawfulness of\nappearances. Indeed, Planck insisted that what is\n‘objective’ is precisely what the heroes of the history of\nscience, from Copernicus to Faraday, would have regarded as\n‘real’ (Planck 1970, 25–6).  Despite the\nstrident Kantian themes of Planck’s argument, his conclusion has\nalways been regarded as a particularly virulent form of convergent\nrealism (Stölzner 2010). \n\nEmerging from the tradition of the philosophical physicists,\nSchlick’s early thought bears the marks of his intellectual\nlegacy. After the completion of his graduate study in physics,\nSchlick soon turned his attention to philosophy (Schlick 2006a). \nWithin a few short years he had written a youthfully enthusiastic\nethical tract in 1908, called Lebensweisheit, a lucid analysis\nof concept-formation called “The Boundaries of Scientific and\nPhilosophical Concept-Formation” (1910), as well as a substantial\nessay on “The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” (1910)\n(Schlick 2006b; Schlick 1979a, 25–40, 41–103). In “The\nBoundaries…”, Schlick provided a broad sketch of his\nunderstanding of scientific thought, which identifies the aim of\nscience as the reduction of phenomena to relationships governed by law,\nthus exhibiting individual events as special cases of universal,\nexceptionless regularities. Science is expressed mathematically, in\nspatio-temporal form to provide for exact measurement. And the\nindividual sciences are demarcated by distinctive intensive qualities,\nas ‘mass’ distinguishes mechanics, ‘heat’\nthermodynamics, etc. Although the methods of mathematico-scientific\nconcept-formation reduces the entire natural world to purely\nquantitative relations, it is powerless in the face of irreducible pure\nqualities. This is the task of philosophy so that philosophy\nbecomes the theory of qualities. Schlick’s work on\n“The Nature of Truth in Modern Logic” not only provides a\nbroad survey of treatments of truth then current in German philosophy,\nbut it also introduces an original view of truth as univocal\ndesignation. A judgment, as a structured complex of its\nconstituents, is coordinated with the fact which consists of the\nentities signified by the judgment’s constituents, arranged in a\nway which is coordinated with the structure of the particular\njudgment. When the constituents are structured in a judgment so\nthat the whole judgment univocally designates a situation in the world,\nthen the judgment is true; otherwise, it is false. The conception\nof truth as univocal coordination figured prominently in\nSchlick’s pre-Positivist theory of knowledge. \n\nThe centerpiece of Schlick’s early epistemology is a deep\ncleavage between intuitive acquaintance and conceptual knowledge. \nAlthough Schlick’s distinction is reminiscent of Kant’s\ncontrast between intuitions and concepts, Schlick regarded intuition as\nfully naturalized, much as Helmholtz had. When the elements of\njudgments are initially identified, they are grasped qualitatively, as\nsensory impressions, like the visual image of a particular dog or the\nmemory image of a horse. These intuitions of acquaintance\nare spatially qualitative, since they are not only extended but\nsituated with respect to one another in the space of the particular\nsensory modality through which they are perceived. They are also\ntemporal, since they succeed one another in time. For an example,\nSchlick considered the visual image of something in the distance which,\nas it approaches, is identified, first of all, as an animal, then it is\nrecognized as a dog and, when it comes close enough, it will be\nrecognized as my dog ‘Fritz’. Each of these cases\ninvolves the recognition of one thing – the image of that which is\napproaching – as something else, an animal, a dog, and (finally)\nFritz. Thus, each of these cases involves knowledge that the\nimage is that of an instance of some class (Schlick 1979a, 119–121;\nSchlick 2009, Sec. 2). And the same process, in which one thing is\nrecognized as another and therefore known, occurs in cases of\nscientific knowledge. For instance, the early explanations of\nlight recognized that its behavior was much the same as the behavior of\nwaves. Thus, in the work of Christian Huyghens, light came to be\nknown as a wave phenomenon or, in other words, as the wave-like\npropagation of a state. Later, through the work of Heinrich\nHertz, it was realized that light was unlike mechanical waves which\ntraveled through a medium (such as water or air) but, rather, light\nbehaved more like electrical waves. Accordingly, light became\nknown as an electromagnetic wave phenomenon. In this case, as in\nthe everyday case of the knowledge that the approaching animal is my\ndog Fritz, light was originally known as a wave phenomenon and only\nlater did it become known as an undulatory disturbance in an\nelectromagnetic field (Schlick 1979a, 121–2; Schlick 2009, Sec.\n3). \n\nIn the early stages of everyday knowing, what is re-discovered or\nrecognized when something is known is an intuitive idea.  Intuitive\nideas present images which are signs of their contents and are drawn\nfrom sensory experience. Of course, images are vague, blurred, and\nill-defined so that when one conjures up an image, say, of one’s\nfather, the expression on his face may not be clear and distinct, so that it\nmay be impossible to tell whether he is frowning or merely looking\npuzzled (Schlick 1979a, 126–7; Schlick 2009, Sec.  4). And while\nintuitive ideas are sufficient for the purposes of everyday life,\nscientific inquiry naturally demands more rigorous methods for\ncapturing and expressing ideas. For this reason, concepts –\nideas with precisely delineated contents – are used. And while\nthe meanings of terms used in everyday discourse are usually intuitive\nideas, in science they are almost exclusively concepts. This provides\nscientific judgments with content which is accurately circumscribed,\nwhile at the same time eliminating their intuitive content. In\nhis General Theory of Knowledge of 1918, Schlick explained\nthat concepts are formed in clusters, just as the primitive concepts\nof a mathematical field are defined in terms of one another by the\naxioms of the discipline. But in his earlier epistemological writings,\nhe explains concept-formation in a more traditional fashion, by\nreference to marks or characteristics (Merkmale) which belong\nto all the objects which fall under the concept. Concepts thus\nrepresent classes of objects, defined in terms of determinate traits,\nso that their scope is exactly demarcated. Thus they differ from\nintuitions, which are indistinct representations of what is presented\nto a particular sensory modality. So the intuition of a triangle in\ngeneral or a man in general can only be a hazy, fuzzy-edged visual\nrepresentation of some particular triangle or man. And while everyday\nknowing proceeds by comparisons of intuitions, scientific knowledge\nreplaces intuitions in these comparisons with precisely delineated\nconcepts. In short, it is through its reliance on concepts that\nscientific thinking takes knowledge to a higher level than everyday\nknowing. \n\nThus, in his earliest philosophical writings Schlick introduced an\ninnovative conception of truth as univocal designation and affirmed a\ncontrast between intuitions and concepts which was ultimately derived\nfrom Kant and naturalized by Helmholtz. Soon, Schlick was\npresented with an opportunity to display his scientific acumen, by\nexplaining the philosophical import of Special Relativity. \n\nSchlick availed himself of the opportunity to elaborate his\nepistemological views in application to the new physics of Relativity\nin his 1915 essay on “The Philosophical Significance of the\nPrinciple of Relativity” (1979a, 153–189). This essay\nis particularly significant in Schlick’s development since it\nfirst presented certain philosophical tenets which would figure in all\nhis subsequent work. Implicit in the general philosophical scheme\nin which Schlick discussed Relativity is an objective, logical\ndistinction between the representational framework in which scientific\nclaims may be formulated and those claims themselves. An\nintrinsic function of the representational scheme is the constitution\nof the very concepts in which the formulation of empirical claims is\nfirst made possible. Moreover, since the same empirical claims\nmay be expressed in distinct representational schemes, the content\nwhich is expressed by all the differing conceptual frameworks comprises\nthe common, objective content of scientific assertions. In\ncontrast, what varies from one description to another reflects the\nfeatures of the representational systems which distinguish them from\none another. \n\nSchlick applied these insights to the fact that no physical means\nsuffice to distinguish inertial frames or, in other words, no (uniform,\nrectilinear) motion can be detected relative to the ether. There\nare two alternative responses to this situation. The first\nalternative, due to Lorentz and Fitzgerald, accommodates experimental\nfindings through the postulation of compensating contractions of moving\nbodies in the direction of motion. Buttressed by additional\nauxiliary hypotheses, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald hypothesis preserves the\nabsolute space and time of Euclid and Newton, as well as Galilean\nkinematics, while explicating experimental failures to detect the\nabsolute rest of the ether by positing a real effect of absolute motion\non length. The alternative presented by Einstein in the Special\nTheory was simply to deny the presupposition of an absolute time\nreference, allowing that two spatially separated events may be\ntemporally ordered in one way for a given system of reference and may\nalso be ordered differently for a distinct, yet equally legitimate\nsystem. Contractions of length are then a consequence of the\nrelativity of reference frames: the length of a measuring rod depends\non its velocity for a given frame of reference (Schlick 1979a,\n160–1). Consequently, the facts of observation are accommodated\nequally well by the Principle of Special Relativity as they are by the\nLorentz-Fitzgerald hypotheses. In other words, they are\nequivalent or “both theories do the same thing”. \n(Schlick 1979a, 162) The principal advantage of Einstein’s\napproach is that his solution is clearly the simplest. At this\njuncture, it should be noted that Schlick did not argue that the choice\nbetween the available alternatives is conventional because they are\nempirically equivalent, implying all the same observational\nconsequences. Rather, Schlick repeatedly urged that there is an\nunderlying physical equivalence from which the empirical or\nobservational equivalence follows. And the fact that it is the\nphysical rather than observational equivalence which serves as premise\nof his argument is especially evident from his use of his earlier\nanalysis of the concept of truth to explicate the equivalence. \n\nSchlick thought the situation in physics presented a thorough-going\nanalogy with Poincaré’s treatment of the conventionality\nof geometry. Schlick noted, first of all, that\nPoincaré’s geometric conventionalism was founded on the\nKantian insight that it is only the behavior of bodies in space that\nforms the object of study, so that the resulting physics is “the\nproduct of two factors, namely the spatial properties of bodies and\ntheir physical properties in the narrower sense” (Schlick 1979a,\n169; Cf. also 1979a, 230–233). The point of Schlick’s\nreference to Poincaré is to illustrate the particular variety of\nconventionalism operative in Poincaré’s treatment of\ngeometry, in order to apply it to the case of Special Relativity. \nAnd just as Poincaré isolated two factors in the treatment of\nthe motion of rigid bodies, in general any true theory may be regarded\nas the product of a reference-system, or representational scheme, and\nthe judgments formulated in that system. Since there are\nalternative ways of securing univocal coordination, the components with\nrespect to which distinct but equivalent representations differ are\nartifices of the representational scheme. Parting from\nPoincaré, Schlick recognized that the representational framework\nthat appears simplest when regarded in isolation may nonetheless\nrequire excessively complicated formulations for the description of\nreality. And he insisted – contra\nPoincaré – that it is the simplicity of these formulations that\nis the most compelling desideratum, not the simplicity of the\nrepresentational scheme. Thus, the representational scheme that\nallows for the simplest description of reality is always to be\npreferred – so much the worse for Euclid, and Poincaré,\ntoo. \n\nSchlick’s earlier epistemological insights, as well as the\nconventionalist framework developed in his work on the Special Theory,\nset the stage for his thought in the two works which distinguish his\npre-Positivist era: General Theory of Knowledge (largely\ncomposed in 1916, with its first edition appearing in 1918 and the\nsecond edition in 1925) and Space and Time in Contemporary\nPhysics. (Engler 2009, 130 fn. 51)  (Space\nand Time … appeared for the first time in 1917 as an\nextended essay in the prestigious journal, Die\nNaturwissenschaften; soon it was re-issued in three more editions\nand eventually translated into eleven languages). Before\nexplaining how Schlick’s epistemology embraced the new physics,\nit is necessary, first of all, to consider how he further developed his\nearlier epistemological insights. \n\nGeneral Theory is notable for a key innovation in its\ntreatment of concepts, for they are defined in terms of mathematical\nequations rather than reducing them to complexes of intuitive images\n(Schlick 2009, Sec. 5). In order to articulate his ideas about the\nnature of concepts and how they are formed, Schlick borrowed the idea\nof definition by axioms from recent work in the foundations of geometry\nby Moritz Pasch, David Hilbert, and Henri Poincaré. In their\nwork on alternative geometries, these mathematicians came to regard the\neffects of altering the axioms of geometry as changing the meaning of\ntheir constituent terms, thus re-defining the primitive geometric\nconcepts. The idea is ingenious in its simplicity, for it treats\nthe geometric primitives as defined by the relations they bear to one\nanother according to the axioms, so the meanings of the terms\n‘point’, ‘lies between’, and ‘lies\nupon’ are fixed by the geometric axioms. The reason\nmathematicians adopted this method is to insure the certainty of\ngeometry by insuring that it was invulnerable to the criticism that its\nprimitive elements were defined by intuition. \n\nSchlick claimed the method of definition by axioms was implicit\nbecause, unlike explicit definition, occurrences of the defined term\ncannot necessarily be replaced by a combination of the expressions which define\nit. And he praised the method for its specification of\nmeanings independently of any intuitive content. Implicitly\ndefined terms possess a clarity and precision of scope which cannot be\nachieved by concepts defined by abstraction from\nexperience. Since, of course, axiomatic definitions\nstipulate the meanings of all their constituent concepts in terms of\nthe remaining ones, the axioms effectively define concepts by their\nrelations to one another. Thus implicit definitions are\nstructural definitions, and their constituent terms are structurally\ndefined (Schlick 2009, Sec. 7). The concepts thus defined are\nonly related to the other elements of the axiom system and are not\nrelated to anything external to the axiom system until the definition\nis coordinated with extra-linguistic things. In Schlick’s\nearlier writings, he had stated that concepts themselves are functions\nwhich signify or designate the items with which they are coordinated or\nassociated. Accordingly, even implicitly defined concepts must be\ncoordinated with objects, elements of the class of things to which it\napplies (Schlick 1979a, 130; Schlick 2009, 23; Ryckman 1991,\nSec. 3). Of course, these objects, like the concepts which\ndesignate them, are distinguished by possession of the properties in\nterms of which the designating concepts are defined. Such\ncoordinations give empirical content to implicitly defined concepts,\ntransforming them into full-blooded concepts rather than empty\nplace-holders. Moreover, the concepts which dominate\nscientific thought at any given stage of its development must be\nmodified, revised, and supplemented as science advances. Then a\nconceptual characterization of a given phenomena which was used at an\nearlier stage may not be at a later stage as, for instance, the\njudgment ‘A light-ray consists of a stream of moving\nparticles’, drawn from Newtonian optics was later replaced by\n‘A light-ray consists of electromagnetic waves’.  \n\nSchlick’s new understanding of concept-formation allows him to\nseriously address the question of how the respective intuitive spaces\nof each of the senses are coordinated in the construction of a general\nintuitive space, which is not specific to any particular sense\nmodality. The intuitive images of experience are spatially\nordered, since they exhibit relative locations as well as spatial\nextension. In addition, since experiences occur one after\nanother, they also exhibit an intuitive temporal order. This\nresults in a distinct spatio-temporal ordering for each of the sense\nmodalities, so that an intuitive order of smells, as well as an\nintuitive order of tastes (and so forth) are given in\nexperience. The first step in the advance from purely\nsubjective experiences to the transcendent reality of scientific\nobjects is to coordinate the spatio-temporal frameworks of the distinct\nsense modalities. Thus, when a sore spot on one’s leg is\ntouched by one’s forefinger, the feeling of the touch is\naccompanied by a visual image of the finger touching the leg. The\ncoincidence of these two separate and distinct types of sensory data\ncontributes evidence to the overall coordination of the spatio-temporal\norders of the different sense modalities. This is the\nmethod of point-coincidences which Schlick applied to characterize the\nadvance to knowledge of the transcendent world from the purely\nsubjective domain of qualitative images. Of course, the idea of\npoint-coincidences also plays a central role in General Relativity and\nit has generally been assumed that Schlick picked up the idea from his\nwork on the new physics. But recent scholarship has demonstrated\nthat, in fact, Schlick worked on the notion long before Einstein\npublished the General Theory and may well have been Einstein’s\nsource of the notion (Engler 2009, 135ff). The important\npoint in the present context is that the coordination of a single\nindividual’s sense modalities is but the first step in the\nconstruction of the transcendent order. The next phase consists\nof the coordination of point-coincidences among different\nindividuals. If an instructor wishes to draw attention to some\nfeature of a triangle on a blackboard at the front of a class, he\npoints to the feature, thus effecting a point-coincidence between the\ntip of his finger and the feature of the triangle. And even\nthough everyone witnessing the demonstration has a different\nperspective, what they all share is their observation of the\npoint-coincidence of finger-tip and the geometric feature. \nFurther, it is to be noted that not every sensory point-coincidence is\nan objective one and it is generally true that not every objective\npoint-coincidence is observed directly but is constructed or inferred\nfrom ones that are. Finally, all measurements, all determinations\nof space and time, are based on just such spatio-temporal\npoint-coincidences (Schlick 2009, Sec. 31). \n\nEarlier Schlick had argued that knowledge consists in the\nidentification of that which is known with that as which it is known\nor, in other words, knowledge consists in the relation of one\nthing to some other thing, as which it is known. And this is only\nachieved when one of the objects which is known is, in turn, related to\nstill others, as it is in the myriad spatio-temporal relations in which\nit stands to other objects. Ultimately, all these relations can\nbe known quantitatively by specifying a number of magnitudes, thus\nreducing the relations of the objective spatio-temporal order to\nquantities. Of course, this cannot be achieved within the\nqualitative order since the different relations of position and\ntemporal order are qualitatively different and cannot, for that very\nreason, be compared. But the entities populating the objective\nspatio-temporal order are wholly unlike the denizens of the subjective\nrealm which are the intuitive objects of experience, the immediately\ngiven sensory data. Both may be univocally designated by\nimplicitly defined concepts and both kinds of entities are, therefore,\nobjects of possible knowledge. As such, intuitive contents are\nattributed full reality and, in addition, the objects populating the\nspatio-temporal order, the entities of advanced theoretical science,\nare just as real as the contents of consciousness with which they are\ncorrelated. \n\nSchlick expended considerable effort discussing the differences between\nintuitive acquaintance and conceptual knowledge, insisting that, even\nthough intuitive images are real, acquaintance with them does not\nconstitute knowledge. This thesis directly confronts the idea,\nheld by a number of philosophers, that acquaintance with intuitive\ncontents is, indeed, a species of knowledge which is more direct and\nimmediate than conceptual knowledge. By comparison, scientific\nknowledge is regarded as a poor substitute, lacking the intimacy of\nintuitive acquaintance. Two champions of this belief are\n Henri Bergson,\nwho\nthought that direct access to intuitive contents could (somehow)\n‘unite’ the knower with the object known, and\n Edmund Husserl,\nwho\nproposed that a genuinely philosophical intuition could become the\nbasis of a kind of scientific cognition in which the subject is in\ndirect contact with its object, without any symbolism or mathematics,\nany inferences or proofs (Bergson 1955; Husserl 1965). \nBergson called this intimate perception of objects\n‘intuition’ and Husserl called it\n‘wesenschau’. But the reason why intuition\ncan never constitute knowledge is, of course, quite obvious to\nSchlick. On his view, knowledge requires two terms: that which is\nknown and that, as which, it is known. But intuition, considered\nas an act of consciousness, involves only that which is intuited. \nIn short, the attempt to identify intuition as a form of knowledge is\nsimply a conflation of knowledge with acquaintance, of unelaborated,\ndirect perception or sensation with conceptual knowledge, of\nkennen with erkennen (Schlick 2009, Sec. 12). \n\nSchlick’s discussion of the differences between intuition and\nknowledge laid the groundwork for his treatment of realism. He\ncautioned, at the outset of his discussion, that the question of\nrealism is not a philosophical problem, but an everyday one. And\nthe view that guides the comings and goings of ordinary life is\nnaïve realism, which assumes that reality consists simply of the\nobjects of sense perception. Of course, the demands of day-to-day\naffairs seldom require any distinction between the perception of an\nobject and the object perceived, until one encounters an illusion which\ndemands the differentiation of, say, a mirage from a puddle or\npond. Only then is a representation first distinguished from its\nobject. It is at this point that the ordinary person realizes\nthat the mirage was real but that the pond or puddle was not. \nThus refined, the naïve criterion of reality is extended beyond\nthe reach of the senses once it is realized that, even when an object\nis not perceived, its effects provide a sufficient condition of its\nreality, as when a hunter finds a ravaged animal in the forest and\nconcludes that a predator is in the neighborhood. And it is in\nprecisely this way that naïve realism is naturally extended to\ninclude, not just perceptions themselves as well as the objects\nperceived, but also the causal sources of observed effects. In\nthis way, naïve realism naturally leads to classical causal\nrealism. \n\nThen it simply becomes useful to refer to those objects which are not\ngiven in sensory experience – or at least not presently given\n– as ‘things-in-themselves’ since they are, by the\ncausal criterion, real. Things-in-themselves are just the transcendent\nentities of the objective, three-dimensional world of everyday\nmaterial objects, as well as the unobservable, theoretical entities\npostulated by contemporary science. Unsurprisingly, the reality of\nthese entities is contested by a variety of related views, which\nSchlick classifies as ‘immanence’ philosophies. The most\nprominent immanence view is the kind of phenomenalism found in\nthinkers from John Stuart Mill to contemporaries like Joseph Petzoldt,\nErnst Mach, and (as Schlick added in the second edition of General\nTheory …), Bertrand Russell. More curious, perhaps, is\nthat Schlick also indicted his intellectual forebear, Hermann von\nHelmholtz, as an immanence philosopher. Basically, these thinkers all\nrestrict reality to the given, so that reality consists exclusively of\ncolors, tastes, and smells, as well as other sensations, presented in\nconstantly changing combinations with one another. This is, of course,\njust to deny the reality of transcendent objects, thus abjuring the\ncausal realism implicit in everyday and scientific talk of\ntranscendent objects which exist and endure beyond momentary\nsensations. Instead, the immanence thinkers claim that all talk of\ntranscendent objects consists entirely of discourse about complexes of\nsensations which exhibit more stability and constancy than\nothers. Mach stated the common view of immanence philosophies that\nmaterial bodies do not produce sensations, because bodies are, at\nbottom, nothing more than complexes of sensations (Schlick 2009, Sec.\n25). Of course, immanence views differ among themselves in their\nefforts to identify which particular complexes of sensation are\nidentified with everyday material bodies and scientific entities,\nespecially when the latter are not perceived.  \n\nThe classic immanence view is one which identifies material bodies\nwith the combinations of sensations which would appear, in a given\nsituation, if a perceiver were present. Of course, this is just\nJohn Stuart Mill’s definition of bodies as ‘permanent\npossibilities of sensation’ – a treatment which persists in\nthe writings of many of his followers, in one form or another. \nFor instance, Bertrand Russell, in Our Knowledge of the External\nWorld, calls the stable combinations ‘aspects’,\ndeclaring that “Things are those series of aspects which obey the\nlaws of physics” (Russell 1922, 110). Specifically, Russell\nargued that so-called ‘ideal aspects’ – ones which are\nnot presently perceived – may be logically constructed from those which\nare. Their reality may then be readily assumed. But with\nthis assumption, any grounds of distinguishing between given aspects\nand assumed ones vanishes, nor is there any means of recovering them,\nwithout complicating the system beyond all recognition. Schlick\nnoted that, because of Russell’s sheer audacity in pushing his\naccount to the limit, the result is not prone to the inconsistencies\nwhich plague other accounts. Indeed, it is undeniable that\nRussell’s “bold position” is one of the most\nsuccessful efforts to carry out the immanence philosophy (Schlick\n2009, 502). In a different vein, Joseph Petzoldt acknowledged that\nesse is not the same as percipi, though he then\nendeavored to identify the existence of objects with some limited group\nof sensations, a different group for each perceiver. Despite the\ncountless problems this approach encountered, the critical point which\nPetzoldt missed is simply that it is impossible to simply identify any\nparticular sensation or group of sensations with a material body,\nwithout further conditions relating the sensation or sensations (as,\nfor instance, Russell provided) (Russell 1922, 106). And\nthat is because it is the lawful regularity among sensations which\nwarrants the collection of the series of changing sensations under a\nsingle material body. Mach very nearly realized this when, in\nThe Analysis of Sensation, he abandoned Mill’s\n‘possibilities’ and replaced them with the mathematical\nnotion of a functional relation. But such a purely\nmathematical idea can never be substituted for an empirically-based\nconcept of reality. Such efforts are, at bottom, attempts to\nconceptually embody a law, as epitomized in Helmholtz’ “The\nConservation of Force: A Memoir” (Kahl 1977, pp. 49–50). \nSpecifically, Helmholtz identified the objective power of a law with\nforce, thus reducing the reality of material bodies and scientific\nentities to a conceptual substitute. But concepts, according to\nSchlick, can never possess the reality of the contents of consciousness\nor transcendent things-in-themselves (Schlick 2009, Sec. 25).  \n\nIn correspondence with Einstein, Schlick explained that his\nmonograph on Space and Time in Contemporary Physics was\n“less a representation of the general theory itself than a\nthorough-going elucidation of the thesis that space and time have now\nforfeited all objectivity in physics” (Schlick 1917). Of\ncourse, Schlick is referring to Einstein’s remark in his 1916\npaper on the General Theory, that the admission of arbitrary\ncoordinative transformations “removes the last vestige of\nphysical objectivity from space and time” (Einstein 1916,\n117). In his monograph, Schlick first described the differences\nbetween the space of the older physics and the space postulated by\nEinstein. In Newtonian physics (as well as the physics of the\nSpecial Theory), all measurement was founded on the notion of a rigid\nrod and space was still regarded as Euclidean so long as measurements\nwere made within the same coordinate system. Thus, in the older\nphysics, space was conceived as complete with metrical properties,\ndefined by rigid rods which possess the same length in any place at any\ntime. It is particularly to be noted that the metrical properties\nof space were regarded as independent of the distribution of bodies in\nspace and their gravitational fields. It is precisely these\nconditions that are changed in General Relativity. Rather, in the\nGeneral Theory, the principle of general covariance implies that\nproperties cannot be ascribed to space independently of any\nconsideration of the things in it. Einstein showed that\nnon-Euclidean methods of determining measurements must be used in the\npresence of a gravitational field and this follows from the insight\nthat it is the things in space which give it a particular structure.\nThe result is a complete relativization of space (Schlick 2006a, Sec.\nVII).  \n\nIn classical mechanics, it was decided by convention (see above)\nthat a rigid rod was the same length throughout space and this\nconvention was modified in Special Relativity. But in General\nRelativity, the length of a rigid rod may also depend on its place and\nposition in such a way that consistency with Special Relativity is\nmaintained. Thus, to maintain the general postulate of\nrelativity, it is necessary to reduce the objective spatial structure\nof the earlier physics to a non-intuitive topology. This is a\nradical departure from the objectivity of the spatial structure of\nthese earlier systems, which was entirely an artifact of their fixed\nmetrical structure. But in Relativity Theory, the resulting\nconceptual construction admits of distinct metrical structures in\ndifferent regions depending on the gravitational field in that region.\nAs Schlick reflects in the closing pages of Space and Time\n…, the very possibility of the objectivity of this\nconceptual construction depends entirely on the method of\npoint-coincidences. Any features of the world-picture which do not\ncontribute to the systematization of point-coincidences are not\nphysically objective. And all world-pictures which contain laws\ngoverning point-coincidences are thoroughly equivalent. \nFurthermore, since any functional, single-valued deformation of the\nworld-picture leaves all point-coincidences undisturbed, the equations\nof physics retain their form under such transformations, implying that\nthey are covariant under all substitutions. These substitutions\nalso leave the form of physical equations unchanged for\ncoordinate-systems in motion, allowing for the relativity of space\nwithin such coordinate-systems, thus depriving space and time of the\n“last vestige of physical objectivity” (Schlick\n2006a, Sec. VII).  \n\nEinstein was so impressed with Schlick’s presentation that, in\na letter to Arnold Sommerfeld, Einstein described it as\n“masterly”, perhaps because Schlick was one of the first\ncommentators to see that space and time have no existence or reality\nprior to the metric field.  \n\nNor was it long before Space and Time … was succeeded\nby the first edition of Schlick’s General Theory of\nKnowledge. During the same period, Schlick spent a year\nengaged in war work at Aldershof airport outside Berlin followed, in\n1921, by an appointment at Kiel. Since rumors were already\nspreading about a possible appointment at Vienna, Schlick’s\nfamily stayed in Rostock until 1922, when they moved to Vienna where he\nassumed the Chair of Naturphilosophie which had previously\nbeen occupied by Ernst Mach and Ludwig Boltzmann (v. d.\nVelde-Schlick 2008; Ferrari 2009). Schlick’s selection for\nthe post was probably initiated by the mathematician Hans Hahn and the\nphysicist Phillip Frank, with a strong recommendation from\nEinstein. When Schlick arrived in Vienna, he immediately became\ninvolved with Hahn and Frank, as well as the economist Otto Neurath, in\ntheir Thursday night discussion meetings in the Chemistry Building of\nthe University of Vienna. Schlick was a welcome addition to the\ngroup, and together they formed the core of what would later become\nknown as ‘the Vienna Circle’ (Uebel 2003). Philosophy\nwould never be the same. \n\nHowever, before arriving in Vienna, Schlick engaged the\nneo-Kantians,\n Hans Reichenbach\nand\n Ernst Cassirer,\nwho had published their own philosophical understandings\nof the new physics of Relativity. In his Relativity Theory\nand Apriori Knowledge of 1920, Reichenbach had argued for a\nmodified conception of Kant’s synthetic apriori, which\nchallenged Schlick’s thought in a decisive way\n(Reichenbach 1920). At Einstein’s request, Schlick wrote to\nReichenbach in the Fall of 1920, hoping to air the differences between\nthem (Schlick 1920; Einstein 1920). In his own essays, Schlick had\nchallenged Kantian apriorism principally by identifying the\npresuppositions of the new physics as conventions, in\nPoincaré’s sense. Since the presuppositions of\nRelativity were alien to classical physics, they were nothing like the\nself-evident, eternal verities that comprised the Kantian\napriori. But while Schlick rejected Kant’s treatment of\nthe apriori altogether, Reichenbach claimed to have preserved\nits most important element, its constitutive function (Reichenbach\n1920, Ch. V; Friedman 1999, 59–70; Oberdan 2009). For Kant had\nattributed the apriori the far more philosophically\nsignificant function of constituting the object of experience or\nknowledge. Indeed, such principles are the general laws for ordering\nexperience to produce knowledge. Since all empirical knowledge\npresupposes these ordering principles, they can never conflict with\nexperience and are, in this sense, necessarily true.  (Reichenbach\n1920, pp. 55–56) Schlick first wrote Reichenbach in the Fall of\n1920, acknowledging that he regarded the assumption of constitutive\nprinciples as self-evident; indeed, he feared that the matter was so\nobvious that he might not have discussed it sufficiently in\nhis General Theory of Knowledge (Schlick 1920a, p. 1; Oberdan\n1994, pp. 109–110). Nonetheless, it is precisely the principles\nwhich Reichenbach himself had identified as synthetic\napriori that constitute an observation or measurement of an\nexperience. Yet, Schlick confessed, he was unable to discover\nany characteristics of these alleged synthetic apriori\nprinciples that genuinely distinguish them from conventions. Of\ncourse, it then follows that the precepts Reichenbach called\n“synthetic apriori” were just what Schlick had\nidentified as “conventions” and the differences between\nthem were, at most, terminological (Schlick 1920b, 2). But this\napparently terminological difference, Schlick thought, masked a far\ndeeper difference separating them since, on Reichenbach’s\nunderstanding, the apriori constitutes the objects of\nexperience and knowledge whereas, on Schlick’s, conventions only\nconstitute concepts, which may be applied to experiences and objects,\nbut do not constitute them. Thus Schlick insisted on\ndistinguishing his own realist epistemology from Reichenbach’s\nmodified Kantianism, because of the latter’s implicit\nanti-realism. \n\nSchlick also contributed a critical essay on Ernst Cassirer’s\n1921 work on Einstein’s Theory of Relativity to the\nprestigious journal Kant-Studien (Cassirer 1921; Schlick\n1979a, 322–334). In “Critical or Empiricist Interpretation\nof Modern Physics?” of 1921, Schlick explained that\nCassirer’s argument rested on a false dichotomy. On the one\nhand, Cassirer’s own Logical Idealism incorporates principles for\nthe ordering and measuring of sensations to constitute physical\nobjects. On the other hand, the only alternative Cassirer\nconsidered is a variety of phenomenalistic empiricism founded on\n“the sensualistic concept of experience”. In\nother words, Cassirer’s operative assumption is simply that the\nonly possible philosophical frameworks for understanding contemporary\nscience are a strict empiricism or one incorporating constitutive\nprinciples. Of course, Schlick regarded his own philosophical\nframework as a clear counterexample, since it is an empiricist\nepistemology distinguished by its inclusion of constitutive\nprinciples. Thus, Cassirer committed the same error as\nReichenbach by blithely ignoring the possibility of constitutive\nprinciples which are not synthetic apriori judgments.\n Naturally, a combination of empiricism with constitutive\nprinciples would fall somewhere between the strict empiricism Cassirer\nrefutes and the Logical Idealism Cassirer defends. At this point,\nSchlick first used what would eventually become a familiar complaint\nagainst Kant and the neo-Kantians among Logical Positivists, especially\ntheir characterization of the constitutive principles as synthetic\njudgments apriori. As Schlick understood constitutive\nprinciples, they are certainly not synthetic apriori\nprinciples, for they are conventions, which are neither\napriori nor synthetic (Schlick 1979a, 322–334). The\nresult of Schlick’s critique was, in Einstein’s words,\n“truly inspirational” (Einstein 1921). \n\nShortly after Schlick arrived in Vienna, he was invited by the\nmathematician Hans Hahn to participate in a seminar on Principia\nMathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Upon\nits conclusion, Schlick organized (at the request of his students,\nHerbert Feigl and Friedrich Waismann) organized an extra-curricular\ndiscussion group, which came to be called the ‘Schlick\nCircle’ and (eventually) the ‘Vienna Circle’. Their\nfirst reading was\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus, written by Russell’s\nstudent, Ludwig Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1961; Stadler 2001, Ch.\n5). Soon, Schlick was writing Wittgenstein, seeking additional\ncopies of his work, telling him about the study group in Vienna, and\nrequesting personal meetings. After several failed attempts, Schlick\nfinally arranged with Wittgenstein’s sister, Margarete\nWittgenstein Stonborough, to visit him in early 1927 (McGuinness 1967,\n14). The first clear evidence that Schlick had (at last!) obtained\na copy of the Tractatus was in a letter to Einstein in June of 1927.\n(Schlick 1927a) The following month, Schlick effusively described\nthe Tractatus as “the deepest” work of the new\nphilosophy (Schlick 1927b). Over the next few years, Schlick and\nWittgenstein met as time permitted, carrying on philosophical\ndiscussions ranging over a broad array of topics, from the idea of\ngeometry as syntax, to verificationist and operationalist theories of\nmeaning, topics in logic and mathematics, and even solipsism. \nOf course, the\ndiscussions of verifiability in the late 1920s led to widespread\ndisputes in later positivist thought. But even in the early years,\nSchlick and his students to wondered how ethical statements might be\nverifiable. In Problems of Ethics, Schlick attempted to\ninterpret ethical statements as empirical claims about the means for\nmaximizing happiness. Relying on relative judgments of values, Schlick\nargued that an empirical foundation of an ethical system based on\nmaximum happiness. On Schlick’s account, happiness is not to be\nconstrued superficially but as the elated sense of fulfillment that\naccompanies actions carried out for their own sake. Hence, there are no\napriori moral statements fixing absolute moral values. \n\nWittgenstein dictated some of his thoughts to Schlick, including a\nstrident verificationist series of remarks, and shared several\nmanuscripts with Schlick as well, including (perhaps) his so-called\n‘Big Typescript’ of 1932–1933 (Iven 2009,\nWittgenstein 2005).  Several other documents survive the period,\nparticularly notes taken by Schlick’s student, Friedrich\nWaismann, when he accompanied Schlick on his visits to Wittgenstein\n(McGuinness 1967). In addition, there were joint travels undertaken by\nWittgenstein and Schlick during the period of their interaction (Iven\n2009; Stadler 2001, Ch. 6). The principal effect of this influence on\nSchlick was the assimilation, into his already well-defined\nphilosophical views, of insights stimulated by these\nconversations.  \n\n During the same\nperiod, Rudolf Carnap joined the faculty of the University of Vienna as\nwell as the Schlick Zirkel. He brought a manuscript with him,\nwhich he called “Konstitutionstheorie”, and which was\neventually published, with Schlick’s help, as The Logical\nStructure of the World (Carnap 1928). Schlick even assisted\nCarnap in locating a publisher for the work. It was at this time\nthat Schlick penned the essay “Experience, Cognition, and\nMetaphysics” of 1926, which represents a particularly important\njuncture in his thinking. Schlick attempted to link current\ninfluences on his thought – Wittgenstein’s Tractatus \nand Carnap’s Aufbau – with his earlier ideas, especially the\ndistinction between intuitions and concepts (Schlick 2008, pp. 33–56;\nWittgenstein 1961; Carnap 1928; Schlick 2009, Sec. 7).  \n\nWithin a few years, Schlick wrote the essays which are characteristic\nof his early Positivist thought. The first one, “The Turning\nPoint in Philosophy,” appeared in 1930. It contains an early\nversion of the thesis that the function of philosophy is the analysis\nof meaning (Schlick 1979b, 154–160). A more decisive article was the\n1932 essay, “Positivism and Realism”, a classic piece\nwhich shaped some of the most characteristic philosophical work to\nemerge from the Positivist tradition (Schlick 1979b, 259–284). Schlick\ninterprets the verifiability principle strictly, by spelling out\nverification in terms of sensible experience, but at the same time\nbroadly, construed to admit any logically conceivable circumstances of\nverification (like the future verification of mountains on the far\nside of the moon). The basis of this principle, Schlick argues, is to\nbe found in scientific practice. He cites Einstein’s analysis of\n“simultaneity” in Special Relativity as his primary\nexample, an illustration which would become a staple of Positivist\nlore. Schlick also mentioned Planck, who acknowledged that experience\nwas the source of scientific knowledge.  Schlick called the\nphilosophical view founded on this principle, “Logical\nPositivism”, using the designation introduced by A. E. Blumberg\nand Herbert Feigl (Blumberg and Feigl, 1931). As Schlick explained it,\nLogical Positivism is essentially a realist epistemology, like the one\ndeveloped in Schlick’s General Theory of Knowledge, which shares\nlittle with the classical positivism of\n Auguste Comte,\n Ernst Mach,\nand Hans Vaihinger. Schlick’s principal conclusion was that\nLogical Positivism never denies the reality of material objects but,\nrather, equates physical reality with the lawfulness of\nexperience. Unfortunately, Planck, who had always supported\nSchlick in the past, misunderstood the essay, interpreting it as a\npolemic for Machian positivism, and harshly condemning it (Planck\n1932). \nThe celebrated ‘protocol sentence controversy’ in the\nVienna Circle was initiated by Carnap’s syntactic analysis of\nobservation sentences, or ‘protocols’ (Carnap 1932a). The\nsalient feature of Carnap’s analysis was its\n‘syntacticism’, the idea that meaning is wholly a function\nof the serial arrangements of symbols. Naturally, syntacticism\nprecludes any effort to explain protocols by their relation to\n‘experiences’, ‘sensory impressions’, or\n‘observations’. Otto Neurath criticisized Carnap’s\nanalysis, arguing that protocols should be understood\nphysicalistically, as sentences of the physical language, and their\norigins and grounds are to be explicated naturalistically, by means of\nbehaviorist psychology (Uebel 2007, Ch. 8). But Schlick recoiled at\nthe very idea that the relation between observation sentences and what\nthey describe should be explicated by any means other than\nphilosophical analysis. So, in his classic 1934 essay, “On the\nFoundations of Knowledge,” he introduced so-called\n‘affirmations’ (Konstatierungen) in the effort to\nexplicate the relation between physicalistic protocols and the\nexperiences on which they are grounded (Schlick 1979b, 370–387).\nOtto Neurath responded, in his 1934 essay “Radical Physicalism\nand the ‘Real World’”, condemning Schlick’s\nview as just so much metaphysics, while Carnap regarded affirmations\nas protocols of a phenomenal language, along the lines of one of the\nalternatives he had outlined in his 1932 paper, “On Protocol\nSentences” (Neurath 1983, 66; Carnap 1932b, 458–463). Still,\nCarnap objected that, unless Schlick could explain how affirmations\nmight be translated into sentences of the physical language, then\naffirmations violated the thesis of physicalism. Schlick responded\nthat affirmations, like “Here now white”, were the\nresponses of investigators when asked about their personal experiences\nin experimental situations. Thus construed, the demonstrative\ncharacter of affirmations ensures their incorrigibility (Schlick 2009,\n661–674). Although their demonstrative character prevents them\nfrom being regarded as proper physicalistic sentences, they are\nobviously translatable into statements of the physical language. But\nthen, even though they lose their distinctive epistemic character, for\nthey are no longer incorrigible or indubitable, they still convey\nepistemic warrant to their physicalistic translations.  \n\nTo Carnap, the deeper problem was that, by the lights of his 1934 work\non The Logical Syntax of Language, affirmations are not\nwell-formed expressions at all. Earlier, in his (1932a) contribution\nto the protocol sentence controversy, Carnap’s treatment of\nobservation was based on the Thesis of Metalogic, the idea that all\nphilosophical contentions (which are not nonsense) are metalinguistic\nclaims about linguistic expressions and their logical (particularly\nsyntactical) properties (Carnap 1932a, 435n). The function of the\nMetalogic Thesis was to isolate pseudo-theses or statements which seem\nto concern substantive matters but are really concerned with logical\nor linguistic matters. Of course, these pseudo-theses became known as\n‘pseudo-object sentences’ and their analysis became a\ncenterpiece of Carnap’s Logical Syntax-era philosophy (Carnap\n1937, Sec. 74). And the Metalogic Thesis, together with the Principle\nof Tolerance (which asserts that the choice of any specific language\nis a conventional decision), formed the principal theses of Carnap’s\nphilosophy of logic in the Thirties (Carnap 1937, 51–2). Otto\nNeurath, who endorsed the Metalogic Thesis and the Tolerance\nPrinciple, drew the obvious conclusion that Schlick’s defense of the\ncorrespondence conception of truth, explicated by his analysis of\naffirmations, committed him to the recognition of “the one, true\nreality” and “the real world” (Neurath 1983,\npp. 106–8; Uebel 2007, Sec. 8.2). In short, Schlick’s\nfoundations were spelled out in nothing more than philosophical\npseudo-statements. \n\nWhat Neurath and (presumably) Carnap both missed was that\nSchlick’s thinking about meaning and linguistic significance had\ncome a long way since his 1926 essay on “Experience, Cognition,\nand Metaphysics”, in which he tried to link Wittgenstein’s\nremarks about internal relations in the Tractatus with his own\ndoctrine of implicit definition (Wittgenstein 1921, 4.122, 4.125,\n4.1251, 5.232). There the goal was to apply both these ideas to the\ndistinction between intuitions and concepts. The result was\nsomething of a disaster. For it implied what Schlick called\n“The Incommunicability of Contents”, the idea that any\neffort to communicate non-formal contents, like the greenness of the\ncolor green or the distinctive smell of wood smoke, must forever remain\nineffable (Oberdan 1996, Sec. 2). But it was not long before\nSchlick’s efforts to explain linguistic meaning and scientific\nknowledge in terms of their ‘form’ and\n‘content’ were abandoned and by the 1934–1935 academic\nyear, he was developing what might well be called ‘a semantic\nconception’, spelled out in terms of grammars and the rules which\nconstitute them, and presenting his new vision of language in his\nlectures on “Logik und Erkenntnistheorie”\n(Schlick 1934–5). \n\nIn “Logik und Erkenntnistheorie,” Schlick thought\nthe most important component of languages are grammatical rules, which\nare of two kinds. First of all, there are ‘internal\nrules’, which govern the use of expressions in relation to other\nexpressions, much like the formation and transformation rules of formal\nlogic. In addition, Schlick conceived of a second type of\ngrammatical rule, which he called ‘application-rules’\n(Anwendungsregeln), regulating the use of expressions in\nconnection with, or application to, observable extra-linguistic\nsituations. Of course, application-rules govern not only\ndescriptions of observable situations, but the use of indexicals and\ndemonstratives as well, thus legitimizing Schlick’s affirmations\nby grounding them in grammar. And Schlick conceived grammar with\nsufficient breadth to encompass the natural languages of everyday life\nas well as the technical and highly regimented languages of\nscience. Concurring with Carnap’s Principle of Tolerance,\nSchlick regarded the choice of grammatical rules, the choice of a\nparticular grammar rather than an alternative, as conventional and\ntherefore independent of extra-linguistic matters. And his\nendorsement of grammatical conventionalism was specifically intended to\naccommodate choices between languages which differed radically, as\ndemonstrated in his treatment of philosophical pseudo-problems\n(Oberdan 1996, Sec. 3). \n\nSchlick presented his latest conception of grammar as well as its\napplication to philosophical pseudo-problems in his 1936 essay on\n“Meaning and Verification” (Schlick 1979b,\n456–481). In particular, he demonstrated that the criterion of\nverifiability is rooted in grammar and concerns any grammatically\nwell-formed proposition which is neither analytic nor\ncontradictory. He reiterated his conception of grammar as the\ncollection of rules governing the formation and use of meaningful\nexpressions, including the rules governing the use of language in\nconnection with experience, rules which are introduced by acts of\nostension (Schlick 1979b, 464–7). Although the result is an\nanalysis of language which provides a powerful treatment of many\n‘typical’ metaphysical theses, like Platonism,\npsychologism, and phenomenalism, in “Meaning and\nVerification” Schlick demonstrated its utility by applying it to\nsolipsism. The upshot is that solipsism is a contingent truth which is\ntreated by its defenders as unfalsifiable. But statements which are\ninsulated from the possibility of falsification are object-language\n‘mis-expressions’ of what are, at bottom, grammatical\nrules. The parallel with Carnap’s analysis of pseudo-object sentences\nas metalinguistic assertions rather than ‘real-object’\nsentences could not be more striking. And just as Carnap regarded the\nformal mode translations of philosophical theses as proposals to adopt\na certain language form, Schlick contended that the solipsist’s thesis\nwas not a bona fide contingent claim but simply an attempt to\nintroduce a particular mode of speech. Thus, by the time of\n“Meaning and Verification”, he had moved well beyond his\n‘Form and Content’ stage, modulating the virulent\nPositivism of his earlier thinking, to arrive at a more mature and\nbalanced conception of the issues at the focus of his philosophical\nconcerns (Oberdan 1996, Sec. 5). \n\nAs Schlick was leaving class on June 22, 1936, he was shot four times\nin the legs and abdomen by Johann Nelböck, a former philosophy\nstudent who had been threatening Schlick for several years. In fact,\nNelböck had been confined in an asylum for observation and\ndiagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Eventually, other factors\n–both social and political- emerged which may also have\ninfluenced Nelböck. The number of possible motivations make it\nnearly impossible to fully understand what was in Nelböck’s mind\nat the time of his murderous actions.  But the result of his misdeed\nis clear: with the death of Moritz Schlick, philosophy lost one of its\nmost creative thinkers. See Stadler 2001 (Part 2, Sec. 3–3.2) for a\ncomprehensive account of Schlick’s death. ","contact.mail":"oberdat@clemson.edu","contact.domain":"clemson.edu"}]
