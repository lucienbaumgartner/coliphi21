Being an exceptionally productive\nwriter, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato,\nsystematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at\nthat time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics,\nethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom\n(Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on\nthe development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens,\nbut also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of\nthe school.  In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic\nphilosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions\nof wisdom.  Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus\n(4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and\nfollowing the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate\nthe harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of\nHomer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and\nto integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and\nPlato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology\noffers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic\ntheology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus’\nphilosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly\ncommentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into\nthe Neoplatonic metaphysical system.\n\n\n\nSince Proclus’ extant works contain almost no evidence about\nhis biography, we have to rely on the information transmitted by his\ndirect pupil Marinus of Neapolis in the eulogy he devoted to his\npredecessor Proclus or on Happiness. Moreover, some scattered\nremarks on Proclus and valuable information about the schools in Athens\nand Alexandria can be found in Damascius’ Life of\nIsidorus (called by other scholars The Philosophical\nHistory). As with Porphyry’s Life of Plotinus, both\nMarinus’ and Damascius’ works are biographies written by\nstudents praising extensively the achievements of their teachers both\nin doctrine and in philosophical life. \n\nOn Proclus’ works see Beutler (1957), 190–208, Saffrey-Westerink\n(1968), lv–lx, Rosán (²2009), 266–274, and\nespecially Luna–Segonds–Endress (2012), as well as the\nshort overview given below (1.2). Although a large part of his\nnumerous writings is lost, some major commentaries on Plato have\nsurvived (though incomplete) and some important systematic\nworks. Moreover, later Neoplatonists such as Damascius, Olympiodorus,\nSimplicius, and Philoponus have conserved many extracts of lost work,\nbut these fragments have never been collected (see now, however,\nLuna–Segonds–Endress (2012)). \n\nProclus or On Happiness sets out to prove that Proclus\nreached in his life the culmination of happiness (eudaimonia)\nand wisdom because he ascended the scale of all virtues, the natural,\nthe ethical, the political, the purifying, the intellectual, and the\nso called theurgic virtues, the latter of which make humans ‘act\nwith the gods.’ (The different virtues have been interpreted in\nvarious ways in the Neoplatonic tradition; ultimately they refer to\ndifferent stages in the purification and ascent of the human soul, see\nSaffrey/Segonds 2001, lxix–c.)  \n\nProclus was born in\nConstantinople/Byzantium (now Istanbul) into a rich Lycian family in 412. Not\nlong after his birth his parents returned to their hometown Xanthos in\nLycia, a maritime area of what is now southwest Turkey. He began his\neducation in Xanthos and moved from there to Alexandria (Egypt) to\npursue the study of rhetoric in order to become a lawyer, as was his\nfather. However, during a journey to Byzantium he discovered philosophy\nas his vocation. Back in Alexandria he studied Aristotle and\nmathematics. Marinus reports that the very gifted pupil easily learned\nall of Aristotle’s logical writings by heart. \n\nIn 430–431, 18 years old, Proclus moved to Athens, attracted by the\nfame of the Platonic School there. He studied for two years under the\ndirection of Plutarch (of Athens; to be distinguished from the\n1st–2nd c. philosopher/biographer), reading with\nhim Plato’s Phaedo and Aristotle’s De\nanima. After Plutarch’s death in 432, Syrianus became\nthe head of the Academy. Proclus followed with him the usual curriculum\nof the school (going back to Iamblichus), reading first\nAristotle’s works and after that entering the ‘greater\nmysteries,’ the Platonic dialogues. Under Syrianus, Proclus also\ncame into contact with the older traditions of wisdom such as the\ntheology of the Orphics and the Chaldaean Oracles. Among\nSyrianus’ lost works we find a treatise On the harmony of\nOrpheus, Pythagoras and Plato with the Chaldaean Oracles. As the\nSuda lexicon attributes a work with this title also to Proclus, it is\nnot unlikely that he published Syrianus’ treatise, adding\ncomments of his own. Since Syrianus and Proclus worked intensively\ntogether for six years, Proclus was strongly influenced by his\nteacher. On many occasions Proclus praises the philosophical\nachievements of his teacher and he never criticizes him. Because of\nthis, it is almost impossible to distinguish between Proclus’\noriginal contribution and what he adopted from Syrianus. \n\nAfter Syrianus’ death (437), Proclus succeeded as head of the\nAthenian school, and he kept this position for almost fifty years until\nhis death in 485. His tight schedule of the day, starting with a prayer\nto the sun at sunrise (repeated at noontime and at sunset), included\nlectures, reading seminars, discussions with students, and literary\nwork of his own. Besides his philosophical activities, Marinus also\nportrays Proclus as an experienced practitioner of theurgy\n(Life of Proclus, § 28–29; on theurgy\nsee below 3.6). The practice of these pagan rites could only be\ncontinued in the private sphere of the School’s grounds. Though\nProclus was in Athens a highly respected philosopher and had some\nChristian students, he had to be prudent to avoid anti-pagan reactions.\nMarinus tells that he had to go into exile for about one year to Lydia\n(in Asia) to avoid difficulties (Life of Proclus §\n15). \n\nMarinus notes that Proclus was an extremely industrious writer,\nhaving an “unbounded love of work” (Life of\nProclus § 22). Apart from an impressive teaching-load and\nseveral other commitments, Proclus wrote every day about 700 lines\n(about 20–25 pages). It is unlikely that Proclus\npublished all of them. However that may be, from\nProclus’ extant works and the information about his lost works it\nemerges that he was a productive writer indeed. Roughly two thirds of\nProclus’ output is now lost and several works, especially his\ncommentaries on Plato, have been transmitted in a mutilated form. \n\nAmong Proclus’ surviving works we have five commentaries on\nPlato (on Alcibiades, Cratylus, Republic,\nTimaeus, and Parmenides), one commentary on Euclid,\ntwo manuals on physics and metaphysics respectively (Elements of\nPhysics, Elements of Theology), an astronomical work\n(Hypotypôsis), three monographs (Tria opuscula)\non providence, fate, and free will and the origin of evil, and the\nPlatonic Theology, which offers an impressive\nsumma of Plato’s theology, as well as theological\nHymns.  See the supplement on \n\nSome of his works have been completely lost, such as his commentaries\non Aristotle (the Organon), of others only a few fragments remain.\nSee the supplement on \n\nIt is difficult to establish a chronology of Proclus’ works.\nThe Platonic Theology is generally considered to be\nhis last work. In writing the Theology Proclus heavily depends\non his interpretation of the Parmenides and often refers to\nhis commentary on this dialogue, which must have been finished some\ntime before. We know from Marinus (Life of Proclus §13)\nthat Proclus finished his Commentary on the Timaeus by the age\nof 27. However, it cannot be excluded that Proclus rewrote or modified\nit later. As the Alcibiades came at the beginning of the\ncurriculum in the school, its commentary may also be an early work. The\nCommentary on the Republic is not a proper commentary, but a\ncollection of several essays on problems and sections in this dialogue.\nThese essays may have been written at different times in Proclus’\nlife and only later put together (by Proclus himself or by someone\nelse). The Hypotypôsis (Exposition of Astronomical Hypotheses)\nwas written in the year after Proclus’ exile in Lydia, but we do\nnot know when exactly that took place. The Tria\nopuscula all deal with similar topics, but they need not have\nbeen composed at the same time. There are plausible arguments to put\nthe second treatise, On What Depends on Us, some years\nafter the events forcing Proclus to go into exile. The first treatise,\nwhich in some parts depends very much on Plutarch (of Chaironea,\n1st–2nd c. C.E.), could be set earlier in his\ncareer. It also contains a discussion on the nature of evil, which is\nmuch simpler than what we find in the treatise On the Existence of\nEvils, which is more sophisticated and probably was composed\nlater. Because of its introductory character, one may be inclined to\nconsider the Elements of Physics as an early\nwork. This has also been claimed for the Elements of\nTheology, which, however, shows all the sophistication of\nProclus’s mature thought. It may be possible that Proclus revised\nthis text several times in his career. \n\nThe center of Proclus’ extensive oeuvre is without\ndoubt his exegesis of Plato, as is shown by the large commentaries he\ndevoted to major dialogues. This Platonic focus is also evident in the\ncomposition of his systematic works. The Platonic\nTheology offers a systematic exposition of theology based on\nan interpretation of all relevant sections on the gods and their\nattributes in Plato’s dialogues, and in particular on the\nParmenides, considered as the most theological of all\ndialogues. Proclus probably commented on all dialogues included in the\ncurriculum of the school since Iamblichus. In addition Proclus wrote\nthe commentary on the Republic mentioned above. The curriculum\nconsisted of altogether 12 dialogues distributed into two cycles. The\nfirst cycle started with Alcibiades (on self-knowledge) and\nended with the Philebus (on the final cause of everything: the\ngood), comprising two dialogues on ethics (the Gorgias and the\nPhaedo), two on logic (the Cratylus and the\nTheaetetus), two on physics (the Sophist and the\nStatesman), and two on theology (the Phaedrus and the\nSymposium). The second cycle included the two perfect\ndialogues that were considered to encompass Plato’s whole\nphilosophy (In Tim. I 13.14–17), namely, the Timaeus\n(on physics) and the Parmenides (on theology). \n\nIn the form and method of his commentaries, Proclus is again\ninfluenced by Iamblichus. He assumes that each Platonic dialogue must\nhave one main theme (skopos) to which all parts of the\narguments ought to be related. To interpret the text, different\napproaches are possible (theological, mathematical, physical, ethical\nexegesis), but they are all interconnected according to the principle\n‘everything in everything’ (panta en pasin). Thus,\nthe Timaeus has in all its parts as its purpose the\nexplanation of nature (physiologia). Even the introductory\nsections, the summary of the discussion in the Republic and\nthe anticipation of the story about Atlantis, must be understood from\nthis point of view; for they contain, in the mode of ‘images and\nexamples,’ a description of the fundamental forces that are at\nwork in the physical world. Also the long treatise on human nature,\nwhich concludes Timaeus’ exposition, has ultimately a\ncosmological meaning, as the human animal is a microcosmos wherein all\nelements and all causes of the great universe are found. More\nproblematic was the determination of the skopos of the\nParmenides. In a long discussion with the whole hermeneutical\ntradition since middle-Platonism, Proclus defends a theological\ninterpretation of the dialogue. According to him, the dialectical\ndiscussion on the One and the Many (ta alla) reveals the first divine principles\nof all things. \n\nWith the exception of the commentary on the Cratylus, of\nwhich only a selection of notes from the original commentary\nis preserved, the exegetical works of Proclus have a clear structure.\nThey divide the Platonic text in different lemmata or cited passages,\ndiscussing first the doctrine exposed in the particular section\n(pragmata, later called theoria), next commenting on\nthe formulation of the argument (called lexis) [see\nFestugière 1963]. Whereas modern scholars usually accept a\ndevelopment in Plato’s thought and distinguish between an early,\nmiddle, and late Plato, the Neoplatonists take the Platonic corpus as\nthe expression of a divinely inspired and unitary philosophical doctrine.\nThis enables them to connect different Platonic dialogues into one\nsystem and to see numerous cross-references within the Platonic\noeuvre. What may seem to be contradictions between statements\nmade in different dialogues, can be explained by different pedagogical\ncontexts, some dialogues being rather maieutic than expository, some\nelenctic of the sophistic pseudo-science, some offering a dialectical\ntraining to young students. \n\nA Neoplatonic commentary offers much more than a faithful\ninterpretation of an authoritative text of Plato. Plato’s text\ngives the commentator an opportunity to develop his own views on the\nmost fundamental philosophical questions, the first principles, the\nidea of the Good, the doctrine of the Forms, the soul and its\nfaculties, nature, etc. As was said, the two culminating dialogues, the\nTimaeus and the Parmenides, offer together a\ncomprehensive view of the whole of Platonic philosophy:  \n\nThe interpretation of the\nParmenides thus prepares the way for the Platonic\nTheology, offering the systematic structure for a scientific\ndemonstration of the procession of all the orders of gods from the first\nprinciple. As Proclus explains at Theol. Plat. I 2,\np. 9.8–19, the Platonic Theology falls into three\nparts (after a long methodological introduction). The first part\n(Theol. Plat. I 13–29) is an investigation into the\ncommon notions (koinai ennoiai) of the gods as we\nfind them in Plato’s dialogues: it is a treatise on the divine\nnames and attributes. The second part (Theol. Plat.\nII–VI), which is incomplete, unfolds in a systematic way the procession\nof the divine hierarchies, from the One, that is the first god, to the\n‘higher kinds,’ i.e., angels, daimones, and\nheroes, while the third part, which is altogether missing, was supposed\nto deal with the individual hypercosmic and encosmic gods. \n\nBefore presenting his own views, Proclus usually critically evaluates the\nopinions and interpretations of his predecessors. In this respect,\nhis commentaries are a rich and indispensible source for the\nhistory of Middle and Neo-Platonism. Thus, in his Commentary on the\nTimaeus Proclus reports and criticizes the views of Atticus,\nNumenius, Longinus, Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Theodorus of Asine\nand many others, ending usually in full agreement with the explanation\nof his master Syrianus. Besides, in explaining Plato’s text,\nProclus frequently seeks confirmation of his exegesis in the\nChaldaean Oracles or the Orphic tradition. As Syrianus (see Helmig\n2009), Proclus is often very critical of Aristotle and refutes his\ncriticism of Plato’s views. He is certainly not an advocate of\nthe “harmony of Plato and Aristotle,” which became the\nleading principle of the Alexandrian commentaries (of Ammonius and\nSimplicius). Proclus notes significant differences between the two\nphilosophers in epistemology (theory of abstraction vs. learning as\nrecollection), metaphysics (first principle, theory of Forms, theory of\nuniversals), physics (Plato’s Timaeus vs.\nAristotle’s Physics), political philosophy\n(Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s Republic), and\nlanguage (Cratylus vs. De Interpretatione).\nAccording to Proclus, Plato is not only far superior to Aristotle in\nhis theology (as only Plato ascended beyond the intellect to posit the\nOne as the ineffable principle of all things), but in all other\nphilosophical disciplines, where we owe to him all important\ndiscoveries. Whereas the Peripatetics were accustomed to defend the\nsuperiority of Aristotle over Plato with reference to his impressive\nphysical project, Proclus considers the latter as inferior to the great\nachievement of Plato in the Timaeus (see Steel 2003).\nAristotle’s natural philosophy is the work of a zealous admirer,\na disciple who tried to be better than the master:   \n\nFollowing Plato, Aristotle explains in his Physics the\ngeneral principles of natural things: form, matter, nature, the\nessence and principles of movement, time and place; again taking\ninspiration from the Timaeus, he studies in other works the\nspecific principles of the distinct regions of the physical world,\nthus in the De Caelo the celestial and the sublunary\nrealm, and in On generation and corruption and\nin Meteorologica the sublunary realm. In this domain, it\ncannot be denied, Aristotle did much more than his master. According\nto Proclus, however, he developed the subject ‘beyond what is\nneeded’. The same remark must be made about Aristotle’s\nextensive zoological research. Whereas Plato limited himself in\nthe Timaeus to an analysis of the fundamental principles of\nall living organisms, Aristotle gave most of his attention to the\nmaterial components of animals and scarcely, and only in few cases,\ndid he consider the organism from the perspective of the form. Plato,\non the contrary, when explaining the physical world, never got lost in\na detailed examination. \n\nWhen trying to determine Proclus’ profile as a philosopher, one has to\nkeep in mind that Platonists were not keen on introducing new elements\ninto the Platonic doctrine. They despised innovation\n(kainotomia). Yet it cannot be denied that Neoplatonic\nphilosophy differs considerably from what we read in Plato’s\ndialogues. There is also overwhelming evidence for continual\ndiscussions in the school on the right interpretation of Plato or on\ncertain doctrinal points (such as the transcendence of the One, or the\nquestion whether the soul wholly descended from the intelligible\nworld). In order to evaluate Proclus’ originality, one ought to\ncompare his views with those of the Neoplatonists before him, such as\nPlotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus. Only with regard to\nPlotinus is this possible to a great extent, because we still have the\nfull corpus of Plotinus’ writings. Proclus certainly admired the first\n‘founder’ of the new Platonism and even devoted a\ncommentary to the Enneads, of which, alas, we have only some\nfragments. He shared Plotinus’ views on the three\nprincipal hypostases the One, the Intellect and the Soul, and\noften uses language inspired by his reading of Plotinus, as in his\ndescription of the union of the soul with the ineffable One. Yet on\nmany points, he is very critical of Plotinus, pointing to\ncontradictions, rejecting provocative views such as the thesis that\nOne is cause of itself (causa sui), the doctrine of the\nundescended soul, or the identification of evil with matter. Another\nradical difference from Plotinus (and Porphyry) is the importance\nattributed to theurgy for the salvation of the soul and the authority\nof Chaldaean Oracles. \n\nAs said before, it is very difficult to mark off Proclus’\noriginality with regard to his teacher Syrianus, the only predecessor\nhe never criticizes. Of the literary production of the latter, we have\nonly his Commentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics. It is\npossible that most of Syrianus’ courses on Plato never were\npublished, but were continued and further worked out by\nProclus himself. We have, however, the commentary on the\nPhaedrus by Hermeias, who was sitting together with Proclus,\nin Syrianus’ course. One gets the impression that Syrianus was\nvery interested in Orphic theogony, whereas for Proclus the\nChaldaean Oracles are more authoritative when\ndeveloping a Platonic theology. But here again, it is difficult to\ncompare as we do not possess Proclus’ own commentary. Is Proclus\nafter all then not so original, but only an excellent teacher and\nwonderful systematizer of the new Platonic doctrines which became\ndominant in the school since Iamblichus on? We shall never know, and it\nis after all not so important when assessing the philosophical merits\nof his works. To praise Proclus’ philosophical achievements,\nMarinus devotes in Life of Proclus one chapter to the\ndiscussion of the doctrines we owe to him (§ 23). Surprisingly,\nfor all his admiration for the master, he can only enumerate a few\ninnovative doctrines; and they are of such a minor importance that we\nshall not even discuss them in this article. \n\nIn late antiquity, Aristotle’s Metaphysics was considered to\nbe a theological work, because Aristotle investigates in this treatise\nthe first principles of all being: Indeed, there is precedent for this in Aristotle himself, for\nin Metaphysics VI, 1, 1026a15ff, he classifies “first\nphilosophy,” or metaphysics, as theology. \n\nProclus himself often uses the term ‘theology’ in this\nmetaphysical sense for the study of the first (‘divine’)\nprinciples of all things. His Elements of Theology can in\nfact be considered an introduction to his metaphysics.  The work is a\nconcatenated demonstration of 217 propositions, which may be divided\ninto two halves: the first 112 propositions establish the One, unity\nwithout any multiplicity, as the ultimate cause of reality and lay\ndown basic metaphysical concepts/structures such as causality,\nparticipation, the relation of wholes to parts, infinity, and\neternity. The second half deals with the three kinds of true causes\nwithin reality recognized by Proclus: gods (which he calls henads or\n“unities,” see below), intellects, and souls.  This\nelaborate metaphysical framework makes it possible for Proclus to\ndevelop a scientific theology, i.e., a demonstration of the procession\nand properties of the different classes of gods. In what follows we\nwill only discuss some characteristic features of Proclus’ metaphysics\n(see further Steel 2011). \n\nOn the whole, Proclus’ doctrine of first principles is a further\ndevelopment of Plotinus’ innovative interpretation of Platonic\nphilosophy. With Plotinus, Proclus recognizes three fundamental levels\nof reality called ‘hypostases’ (or self-subsistent\nentities): One, Intellect, and Soul. However, following a concern of\nhis predecessor Iamblichus for greater precision in the relationship\nand distinction between the One and Intellect, Proclus distinguishes\nbetween the intelligible Being (to noêton—what is\nthe object of intellectual intuition) and the intellective (to\nnoeron—what is intelligizing), and introduces between both,\nas an intermediary level, the\nnoêton-noeron (what is being intelligized and\nintelligizing). These three ontological levels thus correspond to the\ntriad of Being, Life, and Intellect, which already play an important\nrole in Plotinus’ and Porphyry’s speculations about the procession or\n‘emanation’ of the intelligible world from the One,\nwithout, however, being hypostasized. Since Zeller (influenced by\nHegel) the application of the triadic structure to reality has been\nseen as the characteristic feature of Proclus’ system, but see Dodds\n19632, pp. xxii and 220, on possible sources of the doctrine. \n\nAlthough the distinction of aspects of reality as distinct\nhypostases and the multiplication of triads might suggest a\nloss of Plotinus’ intuition of the unity of reality, it is\nimportant to stress that each part of the triad of Being, Life and\nIntellect, mirrors within itself their triadic relationship.  This\nredoubled triadic structure must be understood as expressing an\nintrinsic and essential relation between successive levels of\nbeing. The intimate relation between Being, Life, and Intellect is the\norigin of the basic structure uniting all causes to their effects,\nnamely the relation of immanence, procession and reversion\n(monê-prohodos-epistrophê, see Elem.\nTheol. § 35). This triad has been called the “triad of\ntriads,” the underlying principle of all triadic structures: \n\nAnother fundamental triad is the triad\nUnparticipated-Participated-Participating\n(amethekton-metechomenon-metechon). Plato’s theory of\nparticipation, which explains the relation between the intelligible\nworld and the sensible reality it grounds, raised many problems,\nseveral of which Plato himself brings up in the first part of\nhis Parmenides. Most pressing was the puzzle: How can a Form\nbe at the same time one and the same and exist as a whole in many\nparticipants? (see Plato, Parmenides 131a-b). The basic idea\nof the triad of participation, which can also be seen as responding to\nAristotle’s criticism of participation, is to maintain the\ntranscendence, and hence, the unity of the Form, while allowing for\nits presence in the participants.  Thanks to the existence of an\n‘unparticipated’ principle, that is, one that is not such\nas to be participated in by anything, to which the\n‘participated’ entities, the ones that are participated in\nby something, are connected by means of “the triad of\ntriads” (Elem. Theol. § 23), the universal nature\nof the Form can be safeguarded. \n\nProclus, however, also applies this principle to explain the most\ndifficult problem facing Neoplatonic metaphysics, namely, how to\nunderstand the procession of the manifold from the One. How can the\nOne be wholly without multiplicity, when it must somehow be the cause\nof any and all multiplicity? The One remains in itself absolutely\nunparticipated; the many different beings proceeding from it\nparticipate in a series of participated henads or unities (gods).\nAccording to some scholars it was Iamblichus who introduced this\ninnovative doctrine, others attribute it to Proclus’ teacher\nSyrianus. Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from\nIamblichus himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows\nfrom his law of mean terms. This law states that “every\nproducing cause brings into existence things like to itself before the\nunlike.“ (Elem. Theol. § 28).  Thus there are no leaps in\nthe chain of being, but everything is linked together by similar\nterms. The henads fulfill this function, for as participated unities\nthey bridge the gap between the transcendent One and everything that\ncomes after it. The doctrine of the henads can thus be seen as a way\nof integrating the traditional gods of Greek polytheistic religion\ninto the Neoplatonic metaphysics of the One. \n\na. Auxiliary and true causes. From Middle Platonism onwards,\nvarious attempts were made to integrate the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses within the Platonic philosophy (see Steel 2003). In Plato’s\nwork, it was argued, one can find the four types of causality that\nAristotle distinguishes, to wit formal, material, efficient, final,\nand, besides, the paradigmatic cause, which Aristotle wrongly\nrejected. This system of causes (with the addition of the instrumental\ncause as a sixth) became standard in later Neoplatonism.  In his\ncommentary on the Timaeus, Proclus observes that Aristotle\nnever rises to the proper level of causality. For the four causes, as\nAristotle understands them, can only be applied to the explanation of\nprocesses in the sublunary world. In the Platonic view, however, the\nmaterial and formal causes are only subservient or instrumental\ncauses. Those causes are in fact immanent in their effects and\nconstitutive elements of the thing they produce. As Proclus asserts in\nprop. 75 of the\nElements of Theology, “that which exists in the effect\nis not so much a cause as an auxiliary cause (sunaition) or\nan instrument of the producer.” Causes in the proper sense must\nact upon their effects from outside, while transcending them. For a\nproper understanding of what the true causes are of all things,\nProclus argues, one must follow Plato, who lifts us up to the level of\nthe transcendent Forms and makes us discover the creative causality of\nthe demiurge and the finality of the Good as the ultimate explanation\nof all aspirations. \n\nAlthough Aristotle also discusses efficient and final causes, he\nfalls short of a true understanding of creative causality because he\nabandons the hypothesis of the Forms. Without the transcendent Forms,\nthere can be no explanation of the being of things, only an explanation\nof their movement and change. Given Aristotle’s narrow\nunderstanding of nature, it must come as no surprise, Proclus notices,\nthat he admits of cases of ‘spontaneous generation’ in the\nsublunary realm, which again restricts the purport of efficient\ncausality. Moreover, because of his rejection of the demiurge (and of the One),\nAristotle is also forced to limit efficient causality to the sublunary\nrealm. In fact, in his view there is no cause of existence of the\ncelestial bodies or of the sensible world as a whole: they exist\nnecessarily in all eternity. But, as Proclus argues, such a position\nwill force him to admit that the world has the capacity to constitute\nitself, which is absurd (see below). \n\nThe Neoplatonic concept of causality is therefore quite different from\nthat of the Peripatetics, even if both share the same terminology,\nsuch as final or efficient cause. Aristotle’s causes are primarily\nintended to explain how things move and change, come to be and cease\nto be, but also offer to explain what given things are. For\nthe Neoplatonists, generalizing a principle formulated in\nthe Philebus — “that everything that comes to be\ncomes to be through a cause” (26e, cf. Tim. 28a)\n— causality is of much wider application than the explanation of\nchange and motion, it is not only about what things are, but about\nwhat constitutes (hupostatikos) their being, and it can be,\nanalogously, used to explain relations between all levels of\nbeing. Thus we can say of the One that it is the cause of Intellect,\nand of Intellect that it is cause of Soul. In the Timaeus,\nhowever, the main interest is to understand what is the cause of the\nsensible world and all the cosmic beings: this is primarily the\ndemiurge or creator of the world (the One is not the\n‘creator’ of Intellect). \n\nb. Corporeal and incorporeal causes. According to the\nStoics only bodies and powers or qualities of bodies are capable of\nacting and being acted upon (see Steel 2002). The Platonists often\ncriticized the Stoic view and pointed to what they thought were the\nmany contradictions involved, in particular, in the materialistic\nexplanation of psychic activities or dispositions such as virtues. They\ndefended the opposite view: all forms of causality must ultimately be\nexplained as emanating from incorporeal entities. Proclus adopts\nPlotinus’ view (IV, 7 [2] 8a), that only incorporeal beings can\nbe causes in the strict sense, and includes it among the basic theorems\nof his metaphysics. See Elem. Theol. § 80 (cf.\nTheol. Plat. I 14, p. 61.23–62.1): \n\nIn this proposition Proclus first sets apart the corporeal and\nincorporeal as being active/impassible and passive/inactive\nrespectively. However, the two realms are not absolutely separate from\neach other. The soul, which is an incorporeal substance, enters into\nassociation with the body and thus becomes itself, though only\naccidentally, subject to different passions. The body, on the contrary,\nmay gain great profit from the association with the incorporeal. This\nis evident in the case of animated bodies, which owe all their vital\nactivities to the presence of the soul in them. But also inanimate\nnatural bodies acquire all capacities and powers from nature and its\ninherent logoi or organizing rational principles (see Steel\n2002). \n\nc. The relation of cause to its effect. The relation\nbetween a cause and its effect is characterized by both similarity and\ndissimilarity. For every cause produces something that is similar to\nit, and every effect thus resembles its cause, though in a secondary\nand less perfect way. But in so far as the effect is really\ndistinguished from its cause, it acquires its own characteristic form\nof being, which was not yet developed on the level of its cause. For\nthis reason each thing can be said to exist in three manners\n(Elem. Theol. § 65). First, it is in itself as\nexpressing formally its own character (kath’ hyparxin).\nSecond, it exists in a causal manner (kat’\naitian) being anticipated in its cause. Finally, it exists\nas being participated (kata methexin) by the\nnext level of being, which is its effect. Thus life is a property of a\nliving organism as being participated by it. Life characterizes the\nsoul formally. Life also exists qua Form in the divine\nmind. Finally, Proclus stresses that the higher a cause, the more\ncomprehensive it is, and the further its effects reach (Elem.\nTheol. § 57). All things, including matter, which\nhas in itself, apart from the forms existing in it, no\n‘being’, participate in the One; all beings participate in\nBeing; all plants and animals participate in Life; all rational souls\nparticipate in Intellect. \n\nProclus’ epistemology is firmly rooted in his theory of the\nsoul. For Proclus, souls as self-moving principles represent the lowest\nlevel of entities that are capable of reverting upon itself (so called\nself-constituted beings [authypostata], see Elem.\nTheol. § 40–51). They are incorporeal, separable from\nbodies and indestructible/immortal (Elem.\nTheol. § 186–7). Yet, they are principles of life and of\nmovement of bodies (Elem. Theol. § 188). In accordance\nwith Proclus’ general metaphysical principles (cf. above 3.1),\nfrom the unparticipated soul-monad proceed different kinds of\nparticipated soul: divine souls, daemonic souls, human souls, souls of\nanimals). As with other Platonists, Proclus frequently discusses the\nvexed question as to why a soul would descend into a body at all\n(‘fall of the soul’) (see Dörrie / Baltes (2002.2)\n163–218). Moreover, the Neoplatonist distinguishes between\naltogether three so-called vehicles (ochêmata) of the\nsoul. The rational soul is permanently housed in the luminous\nvehicle, while the non-rational soul is located in the pneumatic\nvehicle. By being incarnated in a human body, soul, or rather, the\nvegetative soul attains thus a (third) ‘shell-like’\nvehicle. The theory of the different vehicles or the psychic\n‘astral body,’ familiar nowadays from modern theosophic theories,\nfulfils several crucial functions in Neoplatonic psychology: it\nexplains (a) how an incorporeal soul can be linked to a body, (b) how\nsouls can move in space, (c) how souls can be punished after death (cf.\nPlato’s myths), (d) where certain faculties of\nthe soul such as imagination are located. Proclus distinguishes between two kinds\nof vehicles, one mortal and the other immortal (In\nTim. III 236.31 ff. and Elem. Theol. §\n207–210). Proclus also adheres to the Platonic theory of\ntransmigration, but argues that human souls never enter animal bodies\nas their constitutive forms. For only animal souls can be organizing\nprinciples of animal bodies. If some rational souls are\n‘degraded’ in the next life and forced to live in an animal\nbody because of their misdemeanour in this life, they are only\n‘relationally’ (schesei) present to this animal\nbody. \n\nProclus distinguishes between the following faculties of soul: sense\nperception, imagination (phantasia), opinion, discursive\nthought, and intellection. While sense perception and imagination\nbelong to the non-rational soul, opinion forms the lowest level of\nrationality. The aim of epistemological ascent is to free oneself\neventually from the lower psychic faculties, including the lower\nrational ones, in order to enjoy a state of pure contemplation. \n\nAs with many other Platonists, Proclus’ epistemology is based\non a theory of innate knowledge (in accordance with the\nPlatonic dictum that ‘all learning is recollection\n[anamnêsis]’). Proclus refers to the innate\ncontents of the soul as its reason-principles (logoi) or Forms\n(eidê). These innate reason-principles constitute the\nessence of soul. That is why they are called ‘essential\nreason-principles’ (logoi ousiôdeis)\n(Steel 1997). The traditional translation reason-principles\nwas chosen on purpose, because on an ontological level these same\nlogoi serve as principles of all things. They are extended or\nunfolded images of the Forms that exist in intellect; and by means of\nthem the world-soul with the assistance of Nature brings forth\neverything. In other words, the psychic logoi are\ninstantiations of Platonic Forms on the level of soul as are the\nlogoi in Nature and the forms immanent in matter. According to\nthe fundamental Neoplatonic axiom panta en\npasin (‘all things are in all things’), Forms\nexist on all levels of reality. But the logoi in soul also\noffer the principles of all knowledge and are the starting points of\ndemonstration. At In Parm. IV 894.3–18 (ed. Steel) Proclus\nargues that only with reference to these notions within the soul\npredication is possible (see Helmig 2008), since they are universal in\nthe true sense of the word. On the other hand, both transcendent\nPlatonic Forms and forms in matter are not taken to be universals\nproper by Proclus. The former are rather intelligible particulars, as\nit were, and cannot be defined (Steel 2004), while the latter are\nstrictly speaking instantiated or individualised universals that are\nnot shared by many particulars (see Helmig 2008, cf. above 3.1–2). For\nthis reason, it does not make much sense to talk about ‘the\nproblem of universals’ in Proclus. \n\nIt is another crucial assumption of Proclus’ epistemology that\nall souls share the same logoi (Elem. Theol.\n§ 194–195). In terms of concept-formation this entails that\npsychic concepts, once they are grasped correctly, are universal,\nobjective, and shareable (see Helmig (2012) 13–24). Moreover, if all souls share the same\nlogoi, and these logoi are the principles of\nreality (see above), then by grasping the logoi souls come to\nknow the true principles or causes of reality. Already Aristotle had\nwritten that to know something signifies to know its cause\n(Met. A 3, 983a25–26 and An.\nPost. I 2, 71b9–12). In his Commentary on\nPlato’s Timaeus, Proclus introduces an interesting\ndistinction. Taking his start from the problem of how we can recognise\ncertain objects, he considers the example of an apple. The different\nsenses tell us that there is something sweet, red, even, with a nice\nsmell. And while common sense (koinê\naisthêsis) can distinguish the different impressions of\nthe special senses, only opinion (doxa) is capable of saying\nthat the object there on the table is an apple. Doxa is able\nto do this, because it has access to the innate logoi of the\nsoul. However, as Proclus explains (In Tim. I 248.11\nff.), opinion only knows the ‘that’ (hoti), that\nis, it can recognize objects. Discursive thought (dianoia), on\nthe other hand, also knows the ‘why’ (dihoti),\nthat is, the causes of something. This distinction can also be\nrephrased in terms of concepts, implying a distinction between factual\nconcepts that allow us to identify or recognise certain objects, and\nconcepts that fulfil an explanatory role. On the whole, Proclus’\nreading and systematisation of Plato’s doctrine of learning as\nrecollection makes Platonic recollection not only concerned with higher\nlearning, since already on the level of object recognition we employ\nconcepts that originate from the innate logoi of the soul (Helmig (2012) 299–333). \n\nProclus argues at length that the human soul has to contain innate\nknowledge. Therefore, one should not consider it an empty writing\ntablet, as Aristotle does (Aristotle, De anima III 4). He is\nwrong in asserting that the soul contains all things\npotentially. According to Proclus, the soul contains all things (i.e.,\nall logoi) in actuality, though due to the ‘shock of\nbirth’ it may seem as if the soul has fallen to\npotentiality. At In\nCrat. § 61, Proclus asserts that the soul does not\nresemble an empty writing tablet (agraphon\ngrammateion) and does not possess all things in potentiality,\nbut in act. In Eucl. 16.8–13 expresses the same\nidea: “the soul is not a writing tablet void of logoi,\nbut it is always written upon and always writing itself and being\nwritten on by the intellect.” As with his philosophy of\nmathematics, Proclus presents a detailed criticism of the view that\nuniversal concepts are derived from sensible objects (by abstraction, induction, or\ncollection). In the fourth book of his Commentary on\nPlato’s Parmenides and in the two prologues of the\nCommentary on Euclid we find the most comprehensive criticism\nof abstractionism in antiquity (see Helmig (2010) and (2012) 205–221). \n\nProclus devoted three entire books or ‘monographs’\n(monobiblia) to problems of providence, fate, free choice, and\nevil. The first treatise (Ten problems concerning providence)\nexamines ten different problems on providence that were commonly\ndiscussed in the Platonic school. For Proclus providence\n(pronoia) is the beneficent activity of the first principle\n(the ‘source of goods’) and the gods (henads), who have\ntheir existence before intellect (pro-nou). One of\nthe problems discussed is the question of how divine foreknowledge and\nhuman free choice can be reconciled. For if god knows not only past and\npresent, but also future events, the outcome of future events is\nalready pre-determined (as god has a determinate knowledge of all\nthings), and hence there is no free choice for humans. Proclus’\nanswer, which ultimately goes back to Iamblichus, consists in applying\nthe principle that the mode of knowledge is not conditioned by the\nobject known but by the knower. In the case of gods, this entails\nthat they know the contingent event in a non contingent manner, the\nmutable immutably. They have an undivided knowledge of things divided\nand a timeless knowledge of things temporal (Elem.\nTheol. § 124, cf. De decem dub. § 6–8).\nProclus’ answer was later taken up by Ammonius in his\nCommentary on the De Interpretatione IX and in Boethius’\nConsolation of Philosophy V 6 as well as in his Commentary\non the De Interpretatione IX. \n\nThe second treatise (On providence fate and what depends on\nus) replies to a letter of Theodore, a former friend of Proclus.\nIn this letter Theodore, an engineer, had defended with several\narguments a radical determinism, thus entirely excluding free choice.\nBefore refuting Theodore’s arguments, Proclus introduces some\nfundamental distinctions in order to solve the problems raised by his\nold friend. The first distinction is between providence and fate: \n\nThe second distinction is that between two types of soul: the rational soul\nis separable from the body, the irrational resides in the body is\ninseparable from its substrate; “the latter depends in its being\nupon fate, the former upon providence” (De prov. §\n15 ff.). The third distinction concerns knowledge and truth:  \n\nThese three distinctions taken together make it possible for\nProclus to ultimately reconcile providence, fate, and free choice. In so\nfar as we are rational agents and let ourselves being determined in our\nchoices only by intelligible principles, we may transcend the\ndeterminism of fate to which we belong as corporeal beings. Yet, our\nactions are integrated into the providential order, as we willingly\nobey the divine principles. \n\nThe third treatise (On the existence of evils) asks why and\nhow evil can exist if the world is governed by divine providence.\nProclus argues that evil does not have an existence of its own, but\nonly a derivative or parasitic existence (par-hypostasis, sc.\non the good) (De mal. § 50).  \n\nThis is precisely the case with evils, which are shortcomings and mistakes.\nAs a failure is never intended qua failure by an agent, but is\nan unfortunate by-effect of its action, so is evil qua evil\nnever caused by a cause. Therefore, Proclus continues, it is better to\ncall its mode of existence a parhupostasis, rather than a hupostasis, a\nterm that belongs to those beings “that proceed from causes\ntowards a goal.” Parhupostasis or “parasitic\nexistence,” on the contrary, is the mode of existence of\n“beings that neither appear through causes in accordance with\nnature nor result in a definite end.”  \n\nDionysius the Areopagite adopted Proclus’ views on evil in his\nwork On the Divine Names. Thanks to this adaptation\nProclus’ doctrine of evil had an enormous influence on the later\nmedieval discussions on evil both in Byzantium and in the Latin West\nand dominated the philosophical debates on evil up to the\n19th century. \n\nAlthough Proclus composed a short (presumably early) treatise where\nhe summarises Aristotle’s theory of movement (Elements of\nPhysics), he does not understand Physics primarily as the\nstudy of movement and change of natural phenomena, but rather seeks to\nconnect these phenomena to their intelligible and divine causes\n(Physics as a kind of Theology, In\nTim. I 217.25). In the preface to his commentary on\nPlato’s Timaeus Proclus sets out to prove why\nPlato’s physics, as developed in the Timaeus, is\nsuperior to natural science in the Aristotelian sense (see Steel 2003).\nIn Proclus’ view Plato’s Timaeus not only offers a\nphysiologia, a science of nature in its many aspects, but also\npresents an explanation of the whole of nature by paying due attention\nto its incorporeal, divine causes: the natural world proceeds from the\ndemiurge as the expression of an ideal paradigm and aims at the ultimate\nGood. Therefore, Plato’s physio-logy is also a sort of\ntheo-logy: \n\nBefore offering an explanation of the generation of the world,\nTimaeus sets out the fundamental principles that will govern his whole\nexplanation of the physical world (Tim. 27d5–28b5). As Proclus\nobserves, it is the task of a scientist to formulate at the start of\nhis project the principles proper to the science in question, and not\njust to assume some general axioms. The science of nature too is based\non specific axioms and assumptions, which must be clarified before we\ncan move to the demonstration. In order to make phusiologia a\nreal science, the philosopher must deduce his explanation, as does the\ngeometer, from a set of fundamental propositions or axioms. \n\nStarting from these fundamental propositions, Proclus argues, Plato\ndeduces the different types of causality that are required for a truly\nscientific understanding of nature (efficient, exemplary, and final\ncause; see Steel 2003 and above 3.2). \n\nProclus discusses eternity and time in his commentary on the\nTimaeus and in propositions 53–55 of the Elements of\nTheology (see Steel 2001). Aristotle had defined time as a\n“measure of movement according to the before and after.”\nTherefore, anything measured by time must have a form of existence or\nactivity in which a past and a future state can be distinguished. In\nfact, an entity in time is never wholly and simultaneously what it is,\nbut has an existence extended in a process of before and after. Opposed\nto it stands the eternal, which exists as a simultaneous whole and\nadmits of no composition or change. “There is no part of\nit,” writes Proclus, “which has already subsisted and\nanother that will subsist later, but as yet is not. All that it is\ncapable of being, already possesses it in entirety without losing it or\nwithout accumulating” (Elem. Theol. § 52).\nOne must distinguish the temporality of things in process from the time\nby which they are measured. Temporal things participate in time,\nwithout being time. “Time exists prior to all things in\ntime” (Elem. Theol. § 53).  \n\nWith Iamblichus, Proclus distinguishes absolute time, which is not\nparticipated in and exists ‘prior’ to all temporal things,\nfrom participated time, or rather the many participated times. The same\ndistinctions must also be made regarding eternity. For Eternity\nprecedes as cause and measures the multiple eternal beings that\nparticipate in it. “Every Eternity is a measure of things\neternal, every Time of things in time; and these two are the only\nmeasures of life and movement in things” (Elem.\nTheol. § 54). To conclude, there are two measures of the\nduration of things. First there is eternity, which measures at once the\nwhole duration of a being. Second, there is time, which measures\npiecemeal the extension of a being that continually passes from one\nstate to another. Eternity can be seen as the prefiguration of time;\ntime as the image of eternity. Each of them governs a separate sphere\nof reality, eternity the intelligible being, time the temporal\n(corporeal and psychic) world of change.  \n\nNotwithstanding the sharp distinction between the temporal and the\neternal realm, there are beings that share in both eternity and\ntime. As Proclus notes in the corollary\nto Elem. Theol. § 55, “of the things\nwhich exist in time, some have a perpetual duration.” Thus the\nuniverse as a whole and the celestial spheres in it are\nboth eternal and temporal. They are eternal because\nthey never come to existence in time and never will cease to exist. But\nthey are temporal because they possess their being only through a\nprocess of change in a sequence of moments. The same holds true for the\npsychic realm: all souls are immortal and indestructible; nevertheless,\nthey are continually undergoing change. Therefore, as Proclus says,\n“‘perpetuity’ (aidiotês) is of two\nkinds, the one eternal (aiônion), the other in time;\n[…] the one having its being concentrated in a simultaneous\nwhole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension\n(paratasis); the one entire in itself, the other composed of\nparts, each of which exists separately in a sequence of prior and\nposterior.” (Elem. Theol. § 55, trans. Dodds,\nmodified). \n\nAgainst Aristotle’s critique in De Caelo I 10, Proclus\ndefends the view that the cosmos is “both eternal and generated\n(genêtos).” As a corporeal being, the universe\ncannot produce itself and maintain itself in being. It depends for its\nexistence upon a superior cause, and it is for that reason\n“generated.” This does not prevent it, however, from\nexisting for ever, in an infinite time. As we just saw, Proclus\ndistinguishes between what is eternal in an absolute sense (the\nintelligible realm) and what is eternal because it continues to exist\nfor the whole of time, what Boethius later called\n“aevum” in distinction from\n“aeternum.” As Proclus notices, at the end of the\nPhysics (8.10, 266a27–28), Aristotle himself\nestablishes that no body can possess from itself an unlimited power to\nexist. If the world exists eternally, it must have this power from an\nincorporeal principle. Therefore, Aristotle too is forced to admit that\nthe world is somehow generated, though it continues to exist for\neternity. For it always receives from its cause its infinite power and\nnever possesses it at once as a whole, because it is limited. The world\nis eternal, because it has an infinite power of coming to be,\nnot because it exists of infinite power (In Tim. I\n252.11–254.18). \n\nThis disagreement between Plato and Aristotle is ultimately due to a\ndifferent view about the first principles of all things. Aristotle\ndenies the existence of Platonic Forms and therefore cannot admit an\nefficient or creative cause of the universe in the true sense of the\nword. Efficient causality only concerns the sublunary world. The\ncelestial bodies and the world as a whole have no efficient cause of\ntheir being, but only a final cause. From this misunderstanding about\nthe first principles follow all the other views that distinguish\nAristotle from Plato. One gets the impression, Proclus says, that\nAristotle, because he could not grasp the first principle of all things\n- the One – has always to find an explanation of things on a\nlower level: \n\nRelated to the eternity of the world is the question of the nature of\nthe celestial bodies. Aristotle argues in De Caelo I 2 that\nthe celestial bodies, which move with a natural circular motion, must\nbe made of a simple substance different from the four sublunary simple\nbodies (whose natural movements are in a straight line: up or down).\nThis ‘fifth element,’ which is by nature imperishable, is\nthe ether. With this explanation Aristotle seems to oppose the view\nPlato defends in Timaeus where it is said that the Demiurge\nmade the divine celestial bodies “mostly out of fire”\n(40a2–4). Proclus admits that the heaven is composed out of the\nfour elements with a preponderance of fire, but he insists that the\nelements are not present in the celestial bodies in the same mode as\nthey exist in the sublunary bodies. Therefore Aristotle is right when\nhe considers the heavens to constitute a fifth nature besides the four\nelements. “For in the heavens the elements are not the same as\nthey are here, but are rather the summits of them”\n(In Tim. II 49.27–29). If one counts the whole\nheaven composed out of the best of the elements as one nature and adds\nto it the four sublunary elements, we may speak of five natures\naltogether. \n\nContrary to Aristotle, Proclus argues that the whole universe (to\npan) is in a place (topos). He can do this because his\nconception of place differs in many respects from Aristotle’s own. The\nlatter defined place as “the unmoved limit of the surrounding\nbody” (Physics IV 4, 212a21–22). From\nthis it follows as a necessary corollary that the universe as a whole\ncannot be in a place, because there is simply nothing outside\nit. Aristotle’s definition, as we learn from Simplicius’ and\nPhiloponus’ Corollary on Place, had been criticized by all\nlater Neoplatonists (Syrianus, Proclus, Damascius, Simplicius, and\nPhiloponus). It is notable that Proclus’ own theory of place, as\nreported by Simplicius, differs considerably from other Neoplatonic\ntheories in that he considered place an immaterial ‘body’,\nnamely a special kind of immobile light. As emerges from\nProclus’ Commentary on Plato’s Republic, his theory took\ninspiration from the column of light mentioned at\nRepublic X, 616b. \n\nSince the heavenly bodies were considered divine, because they are\neternal and living beings, the study of the heavens was of special\nimportance to Neoplatonists. In the preface to his treatise On\nAstronomical Hypotheses (a summary and evaluation of astronomical\nviews of his time), Proclus makes it clear that his approach is based\non Plato’s remarks on astronomy (especially in the\nRepublic and in the Laws). He feels the need to go\nthrough the different theories, because one can observe a great\ndisagreement among ancient astronomers on how to explain the different\nphenomena (Hyp. I § 33). Fundamental to Proclus’\napproach is the distinction between two kinds of astronomy\n(Hyp. I § 1–3). The first kind contents itself with\nobserving the heavenly phenomena and formulating mathematical\nhypotheses to explain them and make calculations and prognostics\npossible. This is the astronomy as practiced by the most famous\nastronomers before Proclus’ time (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and\nPtolemy). The second, which is developed by Plato in the\nTimaeus, and is confirmed by the tradition of the\n“Chaldaeans and Egyptians,” investigates into the\nintelligible causes of heavenly movements. An example for this approach\ncan be found in his Commentary on Plato’s Republic\n(In Remp. II 227.23–235.3). There,\nProclus explains that the seemingly irregular movements of the\nplanets ought not to be explained by means of Ptolemy’s\ncomplicated theory of excentric spheres and epicycles, but are rather\ndue to the fact that the planets are moved by intelligent souls which\nexpress in the movements of their bodies “the invisible powers of\nthe Forms” (232.1–4). Yet Proclus appreciates Ptolemy’s\nastronomy as long as it is seen only as a mathematical-mechanical\nconstruction making it possible to calculate and predict the positions\nof planets, and as long as it does not claim to have any real\nexplanatory value. For the history of astronomy Proclus’\nAstronomical Hypotheses remains a most valuable document,\nsince it represents one of the best introductions to Ptolemy’s\nAlmagest extant from antiquity and since it explains the most\nimportant ancient astronomical theories, in order finally (in chapter\nseven of the work) to evaluate them critically. Proclus’\narguments also played an important role in the scientific discussion of\nthe Ptolemaic hypotheses in the 16th and 17th\ncentury. \n\nProclus’ distinctively non-empirical approach towards physics\nand astronomy also influences his philosophy of mathematics, which is\nset out in the two prologues to his commentary on the first book of\nEuclid’s Elements. The first prologue deals with the\nmathematical sciences in general, while the second prologue focuses on\ngeometry proper. Proclus argues in great detail that the objects of\nmathematical sciences cannot be derived from sensible particulars by\nmeans of abstraction. Because of the imperfect and deficient\ncharacter of the sensible objects one cannot derive from them objects\nthat are as perfect and as precise as mathematical objects are.\nTherefore, mathematical objects reside primarily in intellect and\nsecondarily in souls (as logoi). As universal concepts (cf.\n3.2) we can grasp mathematical objects by means of recollection\n(anamnêsis). Since geometrical objects are not\nuniversal, but particulars, and since by definition they possess\nextension, Proclus argues that their place is human imagination\n(phantasia). Imagination acts as a mirror and provides the\nmathematical objects which are projected into it by the soul with\nintelligible matter. By means of the latter geometrical objects gain\nextension and particularity. As with physics and astronomy, the\nultimate aim of geometry is not the study of these extended, material\nobjects. Rather, geometry serves an anagogical task (just as in\nPlato’s Republic), leading the soul upwards to a study\nof the true and unextended causes of geometrical objects in the divine\nmind (In Eucl. 54.14–56.22). \n\nRelying on Plato, Theaetetus 176a-b late Platonists saw the\nassimilation to god (homoiôsis theôi) as\nthe goal (telos) of philosophy. Proclus was faithful to this\nideal, as is attested by his biographer Marinus (Life of\nProclus § 25). There was a fundamental discussion in late\nNeoplatonism on how this assimilation to the divine was\npossible for humans. Damascius (In Phaed. I § 172\nWesterink) distinguishes two tendencies: Plotinus and Porphyry\npreferred philosophy, which makes us understand the divine principles\nof reality through rational explication, while others like Iamblichus\nand his followers, Syrianus, and Proclus, gave priority to hieratic\npractice or theurgy (theourgia, hieratikê [sc.\ntechnê]). Their different evaluation of respectively\ntheory and theurgy as means of salvation may be explained by their\ndifferent views on the human soul and its possibilities of ascent to\nthe divine realm. While Plotinus and Porphyry claimed that the\nsuperior part of the human soul always remains within the intelligible\nrealm, in touch with the divine principles, and never completely\ndescends into the body, Iamblichus, followed by Proclus, criticised\nsuch a view.  The soul does indeed wholly descend into the body (Steel\n1978, 34–51). Hence the importance of theurgic rites established\nby the gods themselves, to make it possible for the human soul to\novercome the distance between the mortal and the divine, which cannot\nbe done through increasing philosophical\nunderstanding. In Theol. Plat. I 25, Proclus\nexpresses his great admiration for the power of theurgy, which\nsurpasses all human knowledge. \n\nAllegedly, Neoplatonic theurgy originated with Julian the theurgist,\nwho lived in the time of emperor Marcus Aurelius. At first sight,\ntheurgy seems to share many characteristics with magic (theory of\ncosmic sympathy, invocations, animation of statues of gods and demons),\nbut it is, as far as we can judge from the extant sources, clearly\ndifferent from it. In his De Mysteriis Iamblichus\ndeveloped a theology of the hieratic rituals from Platonic principles,\nwhich clearly sets them apart from the vulgar magical practices. While\nmagic assumes that the gods can be rendered subservient to the\nmagicians, Platonic philosophers consider this impossible. According to\nPlato’s principles of theology (Republic II and\nLaws X), the gods are immutable, unchangeable, and cannot be\nbribed by means of sacrifices. Proclus’ views on theurgy (of which\nonly some fragments belonging to his treatise On Hieratic Art\n[i.e., theurgy] survived) are fully in line with these fundamental\nPlatonic axioms. But how, then, does theurgy work? The theurgists take\nup an old belief, shared also by many philosophers, namely the natural\nand cosmic ‘sympathy’ (sumpatheia) pervading all\nreality. As with an organism, all parts of reality are somehow linked\ntogether as one. Another way of expressing this idea is in the\nNeoplatonic principle, going back at least to Iamblichus, that\neverything is in everything (panta\nen pasin). According to Proclus, all reality,\nincluding its most inferior level, matter, is directed upwards towards\nthe origin from which it proceeds. To say it in the words of Theodorus\nof Asine, whom Proclus quotes in his Commentary on the Timaeus\n(I 213.2–3): “All things pray except the First.”  \n\nAs stated before (cf. 3.3), the human soul contains the principles\n(logoi) of all reality within itself. The soul carries,\nhowever, also sumbola or sunthêmata which\ncorrespond to the divine principles of reality. The same symbols also\nestablish the secret correspondences between sensible things (stones,\nplants, and animals) and celestial and divine realities. Thanks to\nthese symbols, things on different levels (stones, plants, animals,\nsouls) are linked in a ‘chain’ (seira) to the divine principle on\nwhich they depend, as the chain of the sun and the many solar beings,\nor the chain of the moon. Of great importance in the rituals was also\nthe evocation of the secret divine names. In his Commentary on the\nCratylus, Proclus compares divine names to statues of the gods\nused in theurgy (In Crat. § 46), pointing to\nthe fact that also language is an important means in the ascent to the\ndivine. \n\nProclus evokes the Platonic background of his theurgical beliefs,\nnamely his theory of love (erôs) as expressed in\nthe Symposium and the Phaedrus, in his\ntreatise On Hieratic Art: \n\nIn the wake of an article of Anne Sheppard (1982), scholars usually\ndistinguish between three kinds of theurgy in Proclus. The first kind,\nas described in the above quoted treatise On Hieratic Art, was\nmainly concerned with animating statues (in order to obtain oracles or\nto evoke divine apparitions) or, in general, with activities related to\nphysical phenomena or human affairs (influencing the weather, healing\nillnesses etc.) (see Life of Proclus § 28–29). As emerges\nfrom our sources, it is this kind of theurgy that involved much\nritualistic practice, including hymns and prayers. The second kind of\ntheurgy makes the soul capable of ascending up to the level of the\nhypercosmic gods and the divine intellect. This second kind too\noperates by means of prayers and invocations and it seems especially\ncharacteristic of Proclus’ Hymns. And finally, the third\nkind of theurgy establishes unity with the first principles, that is\nthe One itself. This third kind corresponds to the level of the highest\nvirtues (i.e., ‘theurgic virtues’) in the scale of virtues.\nIt is not clear whether some form of ritual is involved here at all.\nFor this last stage of the Platonic homoiôsis\ntheôi the following elements are of major importance:\nnegative theology (culminating in the negation of the negation), mystic\nsilence and the intriguing notion of faith (pistis), which\nthus enters with a non-Platonic meaning - though even for the latter\nnotion Proclus will search for confirmation in the Platonic\ndialogues. \n\nIn his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, in the\nchapter on Alexandrian Philosophy, Hegel said that “in Proclus we\nhave the culminating point of the Neo-Platonic philosophy; this method\nin philosophy is carried into later times, continuing even through the\nwhole of the Middle Ages. […] Although the Neo-Platonic school\nceased to exist outwardly, ideas of the Neo-Platonists, and specially\nthe philosophy of Proclus, were long maintained and preserved in the\nChurch.” \n\nThat Proclus, who set up his elaborate Platonic\nTheology in an attempt to rationally justify a pagan religious\ntradition whose existence was threatened by the upcoming Christian\ncivilization, would have had such an influence in Christian medieval\nthought might seem surprising. His influence, however, is mainly\nindirect, as his ideas circulated under the names of other\nphilosophers. There was, of course, a direct confrontation with the\nworks of Proclus in the later Neoplatonic school (via Damascius and\nAmmonius, 5th–6th century) and in Byzantium. In the\n11th century, Michael Psellus studied Proclus intensively\nand even preserved fragments of his lost works. One of his disciples\nwas the Georgian Ioanne Petritsi, who translated Proclus’\nElements into Georgian and composed a commentary on it\n(Gigineishvili 2007). In the 12th century, bishop Nicolaus\nof Methone wrote a Christian reply to Proclus’ Elements,\nthus showing indirectly that the work was still attracting interest.\nMoreover, Isaac Sebastocrator (11–12th century) produced a\nChristian adaption of the Tria opuscula. Around 1300 Proclus\nattracted the interest of the philosopher George Pachymeres, who\nprepared an edition of Proclus’ Commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which was only preserved in a very corrupt\ntradition, and even composed a commentary to the last part of the\ndialogue where Proclus’ commentary was lacking. Cardinal\nBessarion was an attentive reader of Proclus’ works and possessed\nseveral manuscripts. We owe to the interest of scholars such as\nPsellus, Pachymeres, and Bessarion, the preservation of the work of the\npagan Proclus, who had not such a good reputation in theological\ncircles in Byzantium. And yet, the number of direct readers of Proclus\nbefore the Renaissance was very limited. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages Proclus’ influence was mainly indirect, above all\nthrough the writings of the Christian author Dionysius the Areopagite\nand the Arabic Liber de causis. Dionysius was a Christian\nauthor writing around 500, who was deeply fascinated by Proclus. He\nfully exploited Proclus’ works – which he must have read\nintensively — to develop his own original Christian Platonic theology.\nHe presented himself as a disciple of Saint Paul, a pretence which was\ngenerally accepted until the late 19th century, thus giving\nhis works, and indirectly Proclus’ theology, an almost apostolic\nauthority. As Dodds 1963², xxviii, has nicely put it:\n“Proclus was […] conquering Europe in the guise of an\nearly Christian.” The well known Book of Causes is an\nArabic adaption of the Elements of Theology, made in the\n9th century. Translated in the 12th century, the\nLiber de causis circulated in the Middle Ages under the name\nof Aristotle, and was considered as a complement to the\nMetaphysics, offering a treatise on the divine causes. The\ntext entered the corpus of Aristotelian works and was intensively\nstudied and commented at the universities. Thomas Aquinas is the first\nto have discovered that this work derived in fact from Proclus’\nElements of Theology, of which he had obtained a Latin\ntranslation made by his Dominican confrere William of Moerbeke in 1268\n(see Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Liber de causis,\nintroduction). Moerbeke also translated the Tria\nopuscula and the huge commentary on the Parmenides,\nbut these works had almost no readers in the Middle Ages. Berthold of\nMoosburg wrote in the 14th century a comprehensive\ncommentary on the Latin Elements of Theology . The real\nrediscovery of Proclus started in the Italian Renaissance, mainly\nthanks to Marsilio Ficino who followed Proclus’ influence in his\nPlatonic commentaries and even composed, in imitation of Proclus, a\nChristian Platonic Theology on the immortality of the soul.\nBefore Ficino, Nicolaus Cusanus had already intensively studied\nProclus in translations. Proclus continued to enjoy wide interest at\nthe turn of the 18th century. Thomas Taylor (1758–1835)\ntranslated all of Proclus’ works into English (reprinted by the\nPrometheus Trust [London]) and tried to reconstruct the lost seventh\nbook of the\nPlatonic Theology. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) aimed at\na complete edition of his preserved work. At the beginning of the\n20th century we have the great editions of commentaries in\nthe Teubner collection. Renewed philosophical interest in Proclus in\nthe last century started with the edition of the Elements of\nTheology by Eric Robertson Dodds, and carried on with the edition of the\nPlatonic Theology by Henry Dominique Saffrey, Leendert\nGerrit Westerink and, not least, in Germany with the works of Werner\nBeierwaltes. \nLists of Proclus’ works are available in the two supplements on  and","contact.mail":"helmigc@uni-koeln.de","contact.domain":"uni-koeln.de"},{"date.published":"2011-03-16","date.changed":"2020-08-03","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/proclus/","author1":"Christoph Helmig","author1.info":"https://hiw.kuleuven.be/dwmc/people/00013953","entry":"proclus","body.text":"\n\n\n\nProclus of Athens (*412–485 C.E.) was the most authoritative\nphilosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the\ntransmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages.\nFor almost fifty years, he was head or ‘successor’\n(diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic\n‘Academy’ in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive\nwriter, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato,\nsystematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at\nthat time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics,\nethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom\n(Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on\nthe development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens,\nbut also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of\nthe school.  In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic\nphilosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions\nof wisdom.  Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus\n(4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and\nfollowing the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate\nthe harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of\nHomer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and\nto integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and\nPlato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology\noffers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic\ntheology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus’\nphilosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly\ncommentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into\nthe Neoplatonic metaphysical system.\n\n\n\nSince Proclus’ extant works contain almost no evidence about\nhis biography, we have to rely on the information transmitted by his\ndirect pupil Marinus of Neapolis in the eulogy he devoted to his\npredecessor Proclus or on Happiness. Moreover, some scattered\nremarks on Proclus and valuable information about the schools in Athens\nand Alexandria can be found in Damascius’ Life of\nIsidorus (called by other scholars The Philosophical\nHistory). As with Porphyry’s Life of Plotinus, both\nMarinus’ and Damascius’ works are biographies written by\nstudents praising extensively the achievements of their teachers both\nin doctrine and in philosophical life. \n\nOn Proclus’ works see Beutler (1957), 190–208, Saffrey-Westerink\n(1968), lv–lx, Rosán (²2009), 266–274, and\nespecially Luna–Segonds–Endress (2012), as well as the\nshort overview given below (1.2). Although a large part of his\nnumerous writings is lost, some major commentaries on Plato have\nsurvived (though incomplete) and some important systematic\nworks. Moreover, later Neoplatonists such as Damascius, Olympiodorus,\nSimplicius, and Philoponus have conserved many extracts of lost work,\nbut these fragments have never been collected (see now, however,\nLuna–Segonds–Endress (2012)). \n\nProclus or On Happiness sets out to prove that Proclus\nreached in his life the culmination of happiness (eudaimonia)\nand wisdom because he ascended the scale of all virtues, the natural,\nthe ethical, the political, the purifying, the intellectual, and the\nso called theurgic virtues, the latter of which make humans ‘act\nwith the gods.’ (The different virtues have been interpreted in\nvarious ways in the Neoplatonic tradition; ultimately they refer to\ndifferent stages in the purification and ascent of the human soul, see\nSaffrey/Segonds 2001, lxix–c.)  \n\nProclus was born in\nConstantinople/Byzantium (now Istanbul) into a rich Lycian family in 412. Not\nlong after his birth his parents returned to their hometown Xanthos in\nLycia, a maritime area of what is now southwest Turkey. He began his\neducation in Xanthos and moved from there to Alexandria (Egypt) to\npursue the study of rhetoric in order to become a lawyer, as was his\nfather. However, during a journey to Byzantium he discovered philosophy\nas his vocation. Back in Alexandria he studied Aristotle and\nmathematics. Marinus reports that the very gifted pupil easily learned\nall of Aristotle’s logical writings by heart. \n\nIn 430–431, 18 years old, Proclus moved to Athens, attracted by the\nfame of the Platonic School there. He studied for two years under the\ndirection of Plutarch (of Athens; to be distinguished from the\n1st–2nd c. philosopher/biographer), reading with\nhim Plato’s Phaedo and Aristotle’s De\nanima. After Plutarch’s death in 432, Syrianus became\nthe head of the Academy. Proclus followed with him the usual curriculum\nof the school (going back to Iamblichus), reading first\nAristotle’s works and after that entering the ‘greater\nmysteries,’ the Platonic dialogues. Under Syrianus, Proclus also\ncame into contact with the older traditions of wisdom such as the\ntheology of the Orphics and the Chaldaean Oracles. Among\nSyrianus’ lost works we find a treatise On the harmony of\nOrpheus, Pythagoras and Plato with the Chaldaean Oracles. As the\nSuda lexicon attributes a work with this title also to Proclus, it is\nnot unlikely that he published Syrianus’ treatise, adding\ncomments of his own. Since Syrianus and Proclus worked intensively\ntogether for six years, Proclus was strongly influenced by his\nteacher. On many occasions Proclus praises the philosophical\nachievements of his teacher and he never criticizes him. Because of\nthis, it is almost impossible to distinguish between Proclus’\noriginal contribution and what he adopted from Syrianus. \n\nAfter Syrianus’ death (437), Proclus succeeded as head of the\nAthenian school, and he kept this position for almost fifty years until\nhis death in 485. His tight schedule of the day, starting with a prayer\nto the sun at sunrise (repeated at noontime and at sunset), included\nlectures, reading seminars, discussions with students, and literary\nwork of his own. Besides his philosophical activities, Marinus also\nportrays Proclus as an experienced practitioner of theurgy\n(Life of Proclus, § 28–29; on theurgy\nsee below 3.6). The practice of these pagan rites could only be\ncontinued in the private sphere of the School’s grounds. Though\nProclus was in Athens a highly respected philosopher and had some\nChristian students, he had to be prudent to avoid anti-pagan reactions.\nMarinus tells that he had to go into exile for about one year to Lydia\n(in Asia) to avoid difficulties (Life of Proclus §\n15). \n\nMarinus notes that Proclus was an extremely industrious writer,\nhaving an “unbounded love of work” (Life of\nProclus § 22). Apart from an impressive teaching-load and\nseveral other commitments, Proclus wrote every day about 700 lines\n(about 20–25 pages). It is unlikely that Proclus\npublished all of them. However that may be, from\nProclus’ extant works and the information about his lost works it\nemerges that he was a productive writer indeed. Roughly two thirds of\nProclus’ output is now lost and several works, especially his\ncommentaries on Plato, have been transmitted in a mutilated form. \n\nAmong Proclus’ surviving works we have five commentaries on\nPlato (on Alcibiades, Cratylus, Republic,\nTimaeus, and Parmenides), one commentary on Euclid,\ntwo manuals on physics and metaphysics respectively (Elements of\nPhysics, Elements of Theology), an astronomical work\n(Hypotypôsis), three monographs (Tria opuscula)\non providence, fate, and free will and the origin of evil, and the\nPlatonic Theology, which offers an impressive\nsumma of Plato’s theology, as well as theological\nHymns.  See the supplement on \n\nSome of his works have been completely lost, such as his commentaries\non Aristotle (the Organon), of others only a few fragments remain.\nSee the supplement on \n\nIt is difficult to establish a chronology of Proclus’ works.\nThe Platonic Theology is generally considered to be\nhis last work. In writing the Theology Proclus heavily depends\non his interpretation of the Parmenides and often refers to\nhis commentary on this dialogue, which must have been finished some\ntime before. We know from Marinus (Life of Proclus §13)\nthat Proclus finished his Commentary on the Timaeus by the age\nof 27. However, it cannot be excluded that Proclus rewrote or modified\nit later. As the Alcibiades came at the beginning of the\ncurriculum in the school, its commentary may also be an early work. The\nCommentary on the Republic is not a proper commentary, but a\ncollection of several essays on problems and sections in this dialogue.\nThese essays may have been written at different times in Proclus’\nlife and only later put together (by Proclus himself or by someone\nelse). The Hypotypôsis (Exposition of Astronomical Hypotheses)\nwas written in the year after Proclus’ exile in Lydia, but we do\nnot know when exactly that took place. The Tria\nopuscula all deal with similar topics, but they need not have\nbeen composed at the same time. There are plausible arguments to put\nthe second treatise, On What Depends on Us, some years\nafter the events forcing Proclus to go into exile. The first treatise,\nwhich in some parts depends very much on Plutarch (of Chaironea,\n1st–2nd c. C.E.), could be set earlier in his\ncareer. It also contains a discussion on the nature of evil, which is\nmuch simpler than what we find in the treatise On the Existence of\nEvils, which is more sophisticated and probably was composed\nlater. Because of its introductory character, one may be inclined to\nconsider the Elements of Physics as an early\nwork. This has also been claimed for the Elements of\nTheology, which, however, shows all the sophistication of\nProclus’s mature thought. It may be possible that Proclus revised\nthis text several times in his career. \n\nThe center of Proclus’ extensive oeuvre is without\ndoubt his exegesis of Plato, as is shown by the large commentaries he\ndevoted to major dialogues. This Platonic focus is also evident in the\ncomposition of his systematic works. The Platonic\nTheology offers a systematic exposition of theology based on\nan interpretation of all relevant sections on the gods and their\nattributes in Plato’s dialogues, and in particular on the\nParmenides, considered as the most theological of all\ndialogues. Proclus probably commented on all dialogues included in the\ncurriculum of the school since Iamblichus. In addition Proclus wrote\nthe commentary on the Republic mentioned above. The curriculum\nconsisted of altogether 12 dialogues distributed into two cycles. The\nfirst cycle started with Alcibiades (on self-knowledge) and\nended with the Philebus (on the final cause of everything: the\ngood), comprising two dialogues on ethics (the Gorgias and the\nPhaedo), two on logic (the Cratylus and the\nTheaetetus), two on physics (the Sophist and the\nStatesman), and two on theology (the Phaedrus and the\nSymposium). The second cycle included the two perfect\ndialogues that were considered to encompass Plato’s whole\nphilosophy (In Tim. I 13.14–17), namely, the Timaeus\n(on physics) and the Parmenides (on theology). \n\nIn the form and method of his commentaries, Proclus is again\ninfluenced by Iamblichus. He assumes that each Platonic dialogue must\nhave one main theme (skopos) to which all parts of the\narguments ought to be related. To interpret the text, different\napproaches are possible (theological, mathematical, physical, ethical\nexegesis), but they are all interconnected according to the principle\n‘everything in everything’ (panta en pasin). Thus,\nthe Timaeus has in all its parts as its purpose the\nexplanation of nature (physiologia). Even the introductory\nsections, the summary of the discussion in the Republic and\nthe anticipation of the story about Atlantis, must be understood from\nthis point of view; for they contain, in the mode of ‘images and\nexamples,’ a description of the fundamental forces that are at\nwork in the physical world. Also the long treatise on human nature,\nwhich concludes Timaeus’ exposition, has ultimately a\ncosmological meaning, as the human animal is a microcosmos wherein all\nelements and all causes of the great universe are found. More\nproblematic was the determination of the skopos of the\nParmenides. In a long discussion with the whole hermeneutical\ntradition since middle-Platonism, Proclus defends a theological\ninterpretation of the dialogue. According to him, the dialectical\ndiscussion on the One and the Many (ta alla) reveals the first divine principles\nof all things. \n\nWith the exception of the commentary on the Cratylus, of\nwhich only a selection of notes from the original commentary\nis preserved, the exegetical works of Proclus have a clear structure.\nThey divide the Platonic text in different lemmata or cited passages,\ndiscussing first the doctrine exposed in the particular section\n(pragmata, later called theoria), next commenting on\nthe formulation of the argument (called lexis) [see\nFestugière 1963]. Whereas modern scholars usually accept a\ndevelopment in Plato’s thought and distinguish between an early,\nmiddle, and late Plato, the Neoplatonists take the Platonic corpus as\nthe expression of a divinely inspired and unitary philosophical doctrine.\nThis enables them to connect different Platonic dialogues into one\nsystem and to see numerous cross-references within the Platonic\noeuvre. What may seem to be contradictions between statements\nmade in different dialogues, can be explained by different pedagogical\ncontexts, some dialogues being rather maieutic than expository, some\nelenctic of the sophistic pseudo-science, some offering a dialectical\ntraining to young students. \n\nA Neoplatonic commentary offers much more than a faithful\ninterpretation of an authoritative text of Plato. Plato’s text\ngives the commentator an opportunity to develop his own views on the\nmost fundamental philosophical questions, the first principles, the\nidea of the Good, the doctrine of the Forms, the soul and its\nfaculties, nature, etc. As was said, the two culminating dialogues, the\nTimaeus and the Parmenides, offer together a\ncomprehensive view of the whole of Platonic philosophy:  \n\nThe interpretation of the\nParmenides thus prepares the way for the Platonic\nTheology, offering the systematic structure for a scientific\ndemonstration of the procession of all the orders of gods from the first\nprinciple. As Proclus explains at Theol. Plat. I 2,\np. 9.8–19, the Platonic Theology falls into three\nparts (after a long methodological introduction). The first part\n(Theol. Plat. I 13–29) is an investigation into the\ncommon notions (koinai ennoiai) of the gods as we\nfind them in Plato’s dialogues: it is a treatise on the divine\nnames and attributes. The second part (Theol. Plat.\nII–VI), which is incomplete, unfolds in a systematic way the procession\nof the divine hierarchies, from the One, that is the first god, to the\n‘higher kinds,’ i.e., angels, daimones, and\nheroes, while the third part, which is altogether missing, was supposed\nto deal with the individual hypercosmic and encosmic gods. \n\nBefore presenting his own views, Proclus usually critically evaluates the\nopinions and interpretations of his predecessors. In this respect,\nhis commentaries are a rich and indispensible source for the\nhistory of Middle and Neo-Platonism. Thus, in his Commentary on the\nTimaeus Proclus reports and criticizes the views of Atticus,\nNumenius, Longinus, Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Theodorus of Asine\nand many others, ending usually in full agreement with the explanation\nof his master Syrianus. Besides, in explaining Plato’s text,\nProclus frequently seeks confirmation of his exegesis in the\nChaldaean Oracles or the Orphic tradition. As Syrianus (see Helmig\n2009), Proclus is often very critical of Aristotle and refutes his\ncriticism of Plato’s views. He is certainly not an advocate of\nthe “harmony of Plato and Aristotle,” which became the\nleading principle of the Alexandrian commentaries (of Ammonius and\nSimplicius). Proclus notes significant differences between the two\nphilosophers in epistemology (theory of abstraction vs. learning as\nrecollection), metaphysics (first principle, theory of Forms, theory of\nuniversals), physics (Plato’s Timaeus vs.\nAristotle’s Physics), political philosophy\n(Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s Republic), and\nlanguage (Cratylus vs. De Interpretatione).\nAccording to Proclus, Plato is not only far superior to Aristotle in\nhis theology (as only Plato ascended beyond the intellect to posit the\nOne as the ineffable principle of all things), but in all other\nphilosophical disciplines, where we owe to him all important\ndiscoveries. Whereas the Peripatetics were accustomed to defend the\nsuperiority of Aristotle over Plato with reference to his impressive\nphysical project, Proclus considers the latter as inferior to the great\nachievement of Plato in the Timaeus (see Steel 2003).\nAristotle’s natural philosophy is the work of a zealous admirer,\na disciple who tried to be better than the master:   \n\nFollowing Plato, Aristotle explains in his Physics the\ngeneral principles of natural things: form, matter, nature, the\nessence and principles of movement, time and place; again taking\ninspiration from the Timaeus, he studies in other works the\nspecific principles of the distinct regions of the physical world,\nthus in the De Caelo the celestial and the sublunary\nrealm, and in On generation and corruption and\nin Meteorologica the sublunary realm. In this domain, it\ncannot be denied, Aristotle did much more than his master. According\nto Proclus, however, he developed the subject ‘beyond what is\nneeded’. The same remark must be made about Aristotle’s\nextensive zoological research. Whereas Plato limited himself in\nthe Timaeus to an analysis of the fundamental principles of\nall living organisms, Aristotle gave most of his attention to the\nmaterial components of animals and scarcely, and only in few cases,\ndid he consider the organism from the perspective of the form. Plato,\non the contrary, when explaining the physical world, never got lost in\na detailed examination. \n\nWhen trying to determine Proclus’ profile as a philosopher, one has to\nkeep in mind that Platonists were not keen on introducing new elements\ninto the Platonic doctrine. They despised innovation\n(kainotomia). Yet it cannot be denied that Neoplatonic\nphilosophy differs considerably from what we read in Plato’s\ndialogues. There is also overwhelming evidence for continual\ndiscussions in the school on the right interpretation of Plato or on\ncertain doctrinal points (such as the transcendence of the One, or the\nquestion whether the soul wholly descended from the intelligible\nworld). In order to evaluate Proclus’ originality, one ought to\ncompare his views with those of the Neoplatonists before him, such as\nPlotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus. Only with regard to\nPlotinus is this possible to a great extent, because we still have the\nfull corpus of Plotinus’ writings. Proclus certainly admired the first\n‘founder’ of the new Platonism and even devoted a\ncommentary to the Enneads, of which, alas, we have only some\nfragments. He shared Plotinus’ views on the three\nprincipal hypostases the One, the Intellect and the Soul, and\noften uses language inspired by his reading of Plotinus, as in his\ndescription of the union of the soul with the ineffable One. Yet on\nmany points, he is very critical of Plotinus, pointing to\ncontradictions, rejecting provocative views such as the thesis that\nOne is cause of itself (causa sui), the doctrine of the\nundescended soul, or the identification of evil with matter. Another\nradical difference from Plotinus (and Porphyry) is the importance\nattributed to theurgy for the salvation of the soul and the authority\nof Chaldaean Oracles. \n\nAs said before, it is very difficult to mark off Proclus’\noriginality with regard to his teacher Syrianus, the only predecessor\nhe never criticizes. Of the literary production of the latter, we have\nonly his Commentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics. It is\npossible that most of Syrianus’ courses on Plato never were\npublished, but were continued and further worked out by\nProclus himself. We have, however, the commentary on the\nPhaedrus by Hermeias, who was sitting together with Proclus,\nin Syrianus’ course. One gets the impression that Syrianus was\nvery interested in Orphic theogony, whereas for Proclus the\nChaldaean Oracles are more authoritative when\ndeveloping a Platonic theology. But here again, it is difficult to\ncompare as we do not possess Proclus’ own commentary. Is Proclus\nafter all then not so original, but only an excellent teacher and\nwonderful systematizer of the new Platonic doctrines which became\ndominant in the school since Iamblichus on? We shall never know, and it\nis after all not so important when assessing the philosophical merits\nof his works. To praise Proclus’ philosophical achievements,\nMarinus devotes in Life of Proclus one chapter to the\ndiscussion of the doctrines we owe to him (§ 23). Surprisingly,\nfor all his admiration for the master, he can only enumerate a few\ninnovative doctrines; and they are of such a minor importance that we\nshall not even discuss them in this article. \n\nIn late antiquity, Aristotle’s Metaphysics was considered to\nbe a theological work, because Aristotle investigates in this treatise\nthe first principles of all being: Indeed, there is precedent for this in Aristotle himself, for\nin Metaphysics VI, 1, 1026a15ff, he classifies “first\nphilosophy,” or metaphysics, as theology. \n\nProclus himself often uses the term ‘theology’ in this\nmetaphysical sense for the study of the first (‘divine’)\nprinciples of all things. His Elements of Theology can in\nfact be considered an introduction to his metaphysics.  The work is a\nconcatenated demonstration of 217 propositions, which may be divided\ninto two halves: the first 112 propositions establish the One, unity\nwithout any multiplicity, as the ultimate cause of reality and lay\ndown basic metaphysical concepts/structures such as causality,\nparticipation, the relation of wholes to parts, infinity, and\neternity. The second half deals with the three kinds of true causes\nwithin reality recognized by Proclus: gods (which he calls henads or\n“unities,” see below), intellects, and souls.  This\nelaborate metaphysical framework makes it possible for Proclus to\ndevelop a scientific theology, i.e., a demonstration of the procession\nand properties of the different classes of gods. In what follows we\nwill only discuss some characteristic features of Proclus’ metaphysics\n(see further Steel 2011). \n\nOn the whole, Proclus’ doctrine of first principles is a further\ndevelopment of Plotinus’ innovative interpretation of Platonic\nphilosophy. With Plotinus, Proclus recognizes three fundamental levels\nof reality called ‘hypostases’ (or self-subsistent\nentities): One, Intellect, and Soul. However, following a concern of\nhis predecessor Iamblichus for greater precision in the relationship\nand distinction between the One and Intellect, Proclus distinguishes\nbetween the intelligible Being (to noêton—what is\nthe object of intellectual intuition) and the intellective (to\nnoeron—what is intelligizing), and introduces between both,\nas an intermediary level, the\nnoêton-noeron (what is being intelligized and\nintelligizing). These three ontological levels thus correspond to the\ntriad of Being, Life, and Intellect, which already play an important\nrole in Plotinus’ and Porphyry’s speculations about the procession or\n‘emanation’ of the intelligible world from the One,\nwithout, however, being hypostasized. Since Zeller (influenced by\nHegel) the application of the triadic structure to reality has been\nseen as the characteristic feature of Proclus’ system, but see Dodds\n19632, pp. xxii and 220, on possible sources of the doctrine. \n\nAlthough the distinction of aspects of reality as distinct\nhypostases and the multiplication of triads might suggest a\nloss of Plotinus’ intuition of the unity of reality, it is\nimportant to stress that each part of the triad of Being, Life and\nIntellect, mirrors within itself their triadic relationship.  This\nredoubled triadic structure must be understood as expressing an\nintrinsic and essential relation between successive levels of\nbeing. The intimate relation between Being, Life, and Intellect is the\norigin of the basic structure uniting all causes to their effects,\nnamely the relation of immanence, procession and reversion\n(monê-prohodos-epistrophê, see Elem.\nTheol. § 35). This triad has been called the “triad of\ntriads,” the underlying principle of all triadic structures: \n\nAnother fundamental triad is the triad\nUnparticipated-Participated-Participating\n(amethekton-metechomenon-metechon). Plato’s theory of\nparticipation, which explains the relation between the intelligible\nworld and the sensible reality it grounds, raised many problems,\nseveral of which Plato himself brings up in the first part of\nhis Parmenides. Most pressing was the puzzle: How can a Form\nbe at the same time one and the same and exist as a whole in many\nparticipants? (see Plato, Parmenides 131a-b). The basic idea\nof the triad of participation, which can also be seen as responding to\nAristotle’s criticism of participation, is to maintain the\ntranscendence, and hence, the unity of the Form, while allowing for\nits presence in the participants.  Thanks to the existence of an\n‘unparticipated’ principle, that is, one that is not such\nas to be participated in by anything, to which the\n‘participated’ entities, the ones that are participated in\nby something, are connected by means of “the triad of\ntriads” (Elem. Theol. § 23), the universal nature\nof the Form can be safeguarded. \n\nProclus, however, also applies this principle to explain the most\ndifficult problem facing Neoplatonic metaphysics, namely, how to\nunderstand the procession of the manifold from the One. How can the\nOne be wholly without multiplicity, when it must somehow be the cause\nof any and all multiplicity? The One remains in itself absolutely\nunparticipated; the many different beings proceeding from it\nparticipate in a series of participated henads or unities (gods).\nAccording to some scholars it was Iamblichus who introduced this\ninnovative doctrine, others attribute it to Proclus’ teacher\nSyrianus. Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from\nIamblichus himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows\nfrom his law of mean terms. This law states that “every\nproducing cause brings into existence things like to itself before the\nunlike.“ (Elem. Theol. § 28).  Thus there are no leaps in\nthe chain of being, but everything is linked together by similar\nterms. The henads fulfill this function, for as participated unities\nthey bridge the gap between the transcendent One and everything that\ncomes after it. The doctrine of the henads can thus be seen as a way\nof integrating the traditional gods of Greek polytheistic religion\ninto the Neoplatonic metaphysics of the One. \n\na. Auxiliary and true causes. From Middle Platonism onwards,\nvarious attempts were made to integrate the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses within the Platonic philosophy (see Steel 2003). In Plato’s\nwork, it was argued, one can find the four types of causality that\nAristotle distinguishes, to wit formal, material, efficient, final,\nand, besides, the paradigmatic cause, which Aristotle wrongly\nrejected. This system of causes (with the addition of the instrumental\ncause as a sixth) became standard in later Neoplatonism.  In his\ncommentary on the Timaeus, Proclus observes that Aristotle\nnever rises to the proper level of causality. For the four causes, as\nAristotle understands them, can only be applied to the explanation of\nprocesses in the sublunary world. In the Platonic view, however, the\nmaterial and formal causes are only subservient or instrumental\ncauses. Those causes are in fact immanent in their effects and\nconstitutive elements of the thing they produce. As Proclus asserts in\nprop. 75 of the\nElements of Theology, “that which exists in the effect\nis not so much a cause as an auxiliary cause (sunaition) or\nan instrument of the producer.” Causes in the proper sense must\nact upon their effects from outside, while transcending them. For a\nproper understanding of what the true causes are of all things,\nProclus argues, one must follow Plato, who lifts us up to the level of\nthe transcendent Forms and makes us discover the creative causality of\nthe demiurge and the finality of the Good as the ultimate explanation\nof all aspirations. \n\nAlthough Aristotle also discusses efficient and final causes, he\nfalls short of a true understanding of creative causality because he\nabandons the hypothesis of the Forms. Without the transcendent Forms,\nthere can be no explanation of the being of things, only an explanation\nof their movement and change. Given Aristotle’s narrow\nunderstanding of nature, it must come as no surprise, Proclus notices,\nthat he admits of cases of ‘spontaneous generation’ in the\nsublunary realm, which again restricts the purport of efficient\ncausality. Moreover, because of his rejection of the demiurge (and of the One),\nAristotle is also forced to limit efficient causality to the sublunary\nrealm. In fact, in his view there is no cause of existence of the\ncelestial bodies or of the sensible world as a whole: they exist\nnecessarily in all eternity. But, as Proclus argues, such a position\nwill force him to admit that the world has the capacity to constitute\nitself, which is absurd (see below). \n\nThe Neoplatonic concept of causality is therefore quite different from\nthat of the Peripatetics, even if both share the same terminology,\nsuch as final or efficient cause. Aristotle’s causes are primarily\nintended to explain how things move and change, come to be and cease\nto be, but also offer to explain what given things are. For\nthe Neoplatonists, generalizing a principle formulated in\nthe Philebus — “that everything that comes to be\ncomes to be through a cause” (26e, cf. Tim. 28a)\n— causality is of much wider application than the explanation of\nchange and motion, it is not only about what things are, but about\nwhat constitutes (hupostatikos) their being, and it can be,\nanalogously, used to explain relations between all levels of\nbeing. Thus we can say of the One that it is the cause of Intellect,\nand of Intellect that it is cause of Soul. In the Timaeus,\nhowever, the main interest is to understand what is the cause of the\nsensible world and all the cosmic beings: this is primarily the\ndemiurge or creator of the world (the One is not the\n‘creator’ of Intellect). \n\nb. Corporeal and incorporeal causes. According to the\nStoics only bodies and powers or qualities of bodies are capable of\nacting and being acted upon (see Steel 2002). The Platonists often\ncriticized the Stoic view and pointed to what they thought were the\nmany contradictions involved, in particular, in the materialistic\nexplanation of psychic activities or dispositions such as virtues. They\ndefended the opposite view: all forms of causality must ultimately be\nexplained as emanating from incorporeal entities. Proclus adopts\nPlotinus’ view (IV, 7 [2] 8a), that only incorporeal beings can\nbe causes in the strict sense, and includes it among the basic theorems\nof his metaphysics. See Elem. Theol. § 80 (cf.\nTheol. Plat. I 14, p. 61.23–62.1): \n\nIn this proposition Proclus first sets apart the corporeal and\nincorporeal as being active/impassible and passive/inactive\nrespectively. However, the two realms are not absolutely separate from\neach other. The soul, which is an incorporeal substance, enters into\nassociation with the body and thus becomes itself, though only\naccidentally, subject to different passions. The body, on the contrary,\nmay gain great profit from the association with the incorporeal. This\nis evident in the case of animated bodies, which owe all their vital\nactivities to the presence of the soul in them. But also inanimate\nnatural bodies acquire all capacities and powers from nature and its\ninherent logoi or organizing rational principles (see Steel\n2002). \n\nc. The relation of cause to its effect. The relation\nbetween a cause and its effect is characterized by both similarity and\ndissimilarity. For every cause produces something that is similar to\nit, and every effect thus resembles its cause, though in a secondary\nand less perfect way. But in so far as the effect is really\ndistinguished from its cause, it acquires its own characteristic form\nof being, which was not yet developed on the level of its cause. For\nthis reason each thing can be said to exist in three manners\n(Elem. Theol. § 65). First, it is in itself as\nexpressing formally its own character (kath’ hyparxin).\nSecond, it exists in a causal manner (kat’\naitian) being anticipated in its cause. Finally, it exists\nas being participated (kata methexin) by the\nnext level of being, which is its effect. Thus life is a property of a\nliving organism as being participated by it. Life characterizes the\nsoul formally. Life also exists qua Form in the divine\nmind. Finally, Proclus stresses that the higher a cause, the more\ncomprehensive it is, and the further its effects reach (Elem.\nTheol. § 57). All things, including matter, which\nhas in itself, apart from the forms existing in it, no\n‘being’, participate in the One; all beings participate in\nBeing; all plants and animals participate in Life; all rational souls\nparticipate in Intellect. \n\nProclus’ epistemology is firmly rooted in his theory of the\nsoul. For Proclus, souls as self-moving principles represent the lowest\nlevel of entities that are capable of reverting upon itself (so called\nself-constituted beings [authypostata], see Elem.\nTheol. § 40–51). They are incorporeal, separable from\nbodies and indestructible/immortal (Elem.\nTheol. § 186–7). Yet, they are principles of life and of\nmovement of bodies (Elem. Theol. § 188). In accordance\nwith Proclus’ general metaphysical principles (cf. above 3.1),\nfrom the unparticipated soul-monad proceed different kinds of\nparticipated soul: divine souls, daemonic souls, human souls, souls of\nanimals). As with other Platonists, Proclus frequently discusses the\nvexed question as to why a soul would descend into a body at all\n(‘fall of the soul’) (see Dörrie / Baltes (2002.2)\n163–218). Moreover, the Neoplatonist distinguishes between\naltogether three so-called vehicles (ochêmata) of the\nsoul. The rational soul is permanently housed in the luminous\nvehicle, while the non-rational soul is located in the pneumatic\nvehicle. By being incarnated in a human body, soul, or rather, the\nvegetative soul attains thus a (third) ‘shell-like’\nvehicle. The theory of the different vehicles or the psychic\n‘astral body,’ familiar nowadays from modern theosophic theories,\nfulfils several crucial functions in Neoplatonic psychology: it\nexplains (a) how an incorporeal soul can be linked to a body, (b) how\nsouls can move in space, (c) how souls can be punished after death (cf.\nPlato’s myths), (d) where certain faculties of\nthe soul such as imagination are located. Proclus distinguishes between two kinds\nof vehicles, one mortal and the other immortal (In\nTim. III 236.31 ff. and Elem. Theol. §\n207–210). Proclus also adheres to the Platonic theory of\ntransmigration, but argues that human souls never enter animal bodies\nas their constitutive forms. For only animal souls can be organizing\nprinciples of animal bodies. If some rational souls are\n‘degraded’ in the next life and forced to live in an animal\nbody because of their misdemeanour in this life, they are only\n‘relationally’ (schesei) present to this animal\nbody. \n\nProclus distinguishes between the following faculties of soul: sense\nperception, imagination (phantasia), opinion, discursive\nthought, and intellection. While sense perception and imagination\nbelong to the non-rational soul, opinion forms the lowest level of\nrationality. The aim of epistemological ascent is to free oneself\neventually from the lower psychic faculties, including the lower\nrational ones, in order to enjoy a state of pure contemplation. \n\nAs with many other Platonists, Proclus’ epistemology is based\non a theory of innate knowledge (in accordance with the\nPlatonic dictum that ‘all learning is recollection\n[anamnêsis]’). Proclus refers to the innate\ncontents of the soul as its reason-principles (logoi) or Forms\n(eidê). These innate reason-principles constitute the\nessence of soul. That is why they are called ‘essential\nreason-principles’ (logoi ousiôdeis)\n(Steel 1997). The traditional translation reason-principles\nwas chosen on purpose, because on an ontological level these same\nlogoi serve as principles of all things. They are extended or\nunfolded images of the Forms that exist in intellect; and by means of\nthem the world-soul with the assistance of Nature brings forth\neverything. In other words, the psychic logoi are\ninstantiations of Platonic Forms on the level of soul as are the\nlogoi in Nature and the forms immanent in matter. According to\nthe fundamental Neoplatonic axiom panta en\npasin (‘all things are in all things’), Forms\nexist on all levels of reality. But the logoi in soul also\noffer the principles of all knowledge and are the starting points of\ndemonstration. At In Parm. IV 894.3–18 (ed. Steel) Proclus\nargues that only with reference to these notions within the soul\npredication is possible (see Helmig 2008), since they are universal in\nthe true sense of the word. On the other hand, both transcendent\nPlatonic Forms and forms in matter are not taken to be universals\nproper by Proclus. The former are rather intelligible particulars, as\nit were, and cannot be defined (Steel 2004), while the latter are\nstrictly speaking instantiated or individualised universals that are\nnot shared by many particulars (see Helmig 2008, cf. above 3.1–2). For\nthis reason, it does not make much sense to talk about ‘the\nproblem of universals’ in Proclus. \n\nIt is another crucial assumption of Proclus’ epistemology that\nall souls share the same logoi (Elem. Theol.\n§ 194–195). In terms of concept-formation this entails that\npsychic concepts, once they are grasped correctly, are universal,\nobjective, and shareable (see Helmig (2012) 13–24). Moreover, if all souls share the same\nlogoi, and these logoi are the principles of\nreality (see above), then by grasping the logoi souls come to\nknow the true principles or causes of reality. Already Aristotle had\nwritten that to know something signifies to know its cause\n(Met. A 3, 983a25–26 and An.\nPost. I 2, 71b9–12). In his Commentary on\nPlato’s Timaeus, Proclus introduces an interesting\ndistinction. Taking his start from the problem of how we can recognise\ncertain objects, he considers the example of an apple. The different\nsenses tell us that there is something sweet, red, even, with a nice\nsmell. And while common sense (koinê\naisthêsis) can distinguish the different impressions of\nthe special senses, only opinion (doxa) is capable of saying\nthat the object there on the table is an apple. Doxa is able\nto do this, because it has access to the innate logoi of the\nsoul. However, as Proclus explains (In Tim. I 248.11\nff.), opinion only knows the ‘that’ (hoti), that\nis, it can recognize objects. Discursive thought (dianoia), on\nthe other hand, also knows the ‘why’ (dihoti),\nthat is, the causes of something. This distinction can also be\nrephrased in terms of concepts, implying a distinction between factual\nconcepts that allow us to identify or recognise certain objects, and\nconcepts that fulfil an explanatory role. On the whole, Proclus’\nreading and systematisation of Plato’s doctrine of learning as\nrecollection makes Platonic recollection not only concerned with higher\nlearning, since already on the level of object recognition we employ\nconcepts that originate from the innate logoi of the soul (Helmig (2012) 299–333). \n\nProclus argues at length that the human soul has to contain innate\nknowledge. Therefore, one should not consider it an empty writing\ntablet, as Aristotle does (Aristotle, De anima III 4). He is\nwrong in asserting that the soul contains all things\npotentially. According to Proclus, the soul contains all things (i.e.,\nall logoi) in actuality, though due to the ‘shock of\nbirth’ it may seem as if the soul has fallen to\npotentiality. At In\nCrat. § 61, Proclus asserts that the soul does not\nresemble an empty writing tablet (agraphon\ngrammateion) and does not possess all things in potentiality,\nbut in act. In Eucl. 16.8–13 expresses the same\nidea: “the soul is not a writing tablet void of logoi,\nbut it is always written upon and always writing itself and being\nwritten on by the intellect.” As with his philosophy of\nmathematics, Proclus presents a detailed criticism of the view that\nuniversal concepts are derived from sensible objects (by abstraction, induction, or\ncollection). In the fourth book of his Commentary on\nPlato’s Parmenides and in the two prologues of the\nCommentary on Euclid we find the most comprehensive criticism\nof abstractionism in antiquity (see Helmig (2010) and (2012) 205–221). \n\nProclus devoted three entire books or ‘monographs’\n(monobiblia) to problems of providence, fate, free choice, and\nevil. The first treatise (Ten problems concerning providence)\nexamines ten different problems on providence that were commonly\ndiscussed in the Platonic school. For Proclus providence\n(pronoia) is the beneficent activity of the first principle\n(the ‘source of goods’) and the gods (henads), who have\ntheir existence before intellect (pro-nou). One of\nthe problems discussed is the question of how divine foreknowledge and\nhuman free choice can be reconciled. For if god knows not only past and\npresent, but also future events, the outcome of future events is\nalready pre-determined (as god has a determinate knowledge of all\nthings), and hence there is no free choice for humans. Proclus’\nanswer, which ultimately goes back to Iamblichus, consists in applying\nthe principle that the mode of knowledge is not conditioned by the\nobject known but by the knower. In the case of gods, this entails\nthat they know the contingent event in a non contingent manner, the\nmutable immutably. They have an undivided knowledge of things divided\nand a timeless knowledge of things temporal (Elem.\nTheol. § 124, cf. De decem dub. § 6–8).\nProclus’ answer was later taken up by Ammonius in his\nCommentary on the De Interpretatione IX and in Boethius’\nConsolation of Philosophy V 6 as well as in his Commentary\non the De Interpretatione IX. \n\nThe second treatise (On providence fate and what depends on\nus) replies to a letter of Theodore, a former friend of Proclus.\nIn this letter Theodore, an engineer, had defended with several\narguments a radical determinism, thus entirely excluding free choice.\nBefore refuting Theodore’s arguments, Proclus introduces some\nfundamental distinctions in order to solve the problems raised by his\nold friend. The first distinction is between providence and fate: \n\nThe second distinction is that between two types of soul: the rational soul\nis separable from the body, the irrational resides in the body is\ninseparable from its substrate; “the latter depends in its being\nupon fate, the former upon providence” (De prov. §\n15 ff.). The third distinction concerns knowledge and truth:  \n\nThese three distinctions taken together make it possible for\nProclus to ultimately reconcile providence, fate, and free choice. In so\nfar as we are rational agents and let ourselves being determined in our\nchoices only by intelligible principles, we may transcend the\ndeterminism of fate to which we belong as corporeal beings. Yet, our\nactions are integrated into the providential order, as we willingly\nobey the divine principles. \n\nThe third treatise (On the existence of evils) asks why and\nhow evil can exist if the world is governed by divine providence.\nProclus argues that evil does not have an existence of its own, but\nonly a derivative or parasitic existence (par-hypostasis, sc.\non the good) (De mal. § 50).  \n\nThis is precisely the case with evils, which are shortcomings and mistakes.\nAs a failure is never intended qua failure by an agent, but is\nan unfortunate by-effect of its action, so is evil qua evil\nnever caused by a cause. Therefore, Proclus continues, it is better to\ncall its mode of existence a parhupostasis, rather than a hupostasis, a\nterm that belongs to those beings “that proceed from causes\ntowards a goal.” Parhupostasis or “parasitic\nexistence,” on the contrary, is the mode of existence of\n“beings that neither appear through causes in accordance with\nnature nor result in a definite end.”  \n\nDionysius the Areopagite adopted Proclus’ views on evil in his\nwork On the Divine Names. Thanks to this adaptation\nProclus’ doctrine of evil had an enormous influence on the later\nmedieval discussions on evil both in Byzantium and in the Latin West\nand dominated the philosophical debates on evil up to the\n19th century. \n\nAlthough Proclus composed a short (presumably early) treatise where\nhe summarises Aristotle’s theory of movement (Elements of\nPhysics), he does not understand Physics primarily as the\nstudy of movement and change of natural phenomena, but rather seeks to\nconnect these phenomena to their intelligible and divine causes\n(Physics as a kind of Theology, In\nTim. I 217.25). In the preface to his commentary on\nPlato’s Timaeus Proclus sets out to prove why\nPlato’s physics, as developed in the Timaeus, is\nsuperior to natural science in the Aristotelian sense (see Steel 2003).\nIn Proclus’ view Plato’s Timaeus not only offers a\nphysiologia, a science of nature in its many aspects, but also\npresents an explanation of the whole of nature by paying due attention\nto its incorporeal, divine causes: the natural world proceeds from the\ndemiurge as the expression of an ideal paradigm and aims at the ultimate\nGood. Therefore, Plato’s physio-logy is also a sort of\ntheo-logy: \n\nBefore offering an explanation of the generation of the world,\nTimaeus sets out the fundamental principles that will govern his whole\nexplanation of the physical world (Tim. 27d5–28b5). As Proclus\nobserves, it is the task of a scientist to formulate at the start of\nhis project the principles proper to the science in question, and not\njust to assume some general axioms. The science of nature too is based\non specific axioms and assumptions, which must be clarified before we\ncan move to the demonstration. In order to make phusiologia a\nreal science, the philosopher must deduce his explanation, as does the\ngeometer, from a set of fundamental propositions or axioms. \n\nStarting from these fundamental propositions, Proclus argues, Plato\ndeduces the different types of causality that are required for a truly\nscientific understanding of nature (efficient, exemplary, and final\ncause; see Steel 2003 and above 3.2). \n\nProclus discusses eternity and time in his commentary on the\nTimaeus and in propositions 53–55 of the Elements of\nTheology (see Steel 2001). Aristotle had defined time as a\n“measure of movement according to the before and after.”\nTherefore, anything measured by time must have a form of existence or\nactivity in which a past and a future state can be distinguished. In\nfact, an entity in time is never wholly and simultaneously what it is,\nbut has an existence extended in a process of before and after. Opposed\nto it stands the eternal, which exists as a simultaneous whole and\nadmits of no composition or change. “There is no part of\nit,” writes Proclus, “which has already subsisted and\nanother that will subsist later, but as yet is not. All that it is\ncapable of being, already possesses it in entirety without losing it or\nwithout accumulating” (Elem. Theol. § 52).\nOne must distinguish the temporality of things in process from the time\nby which they are measured. Temporal things participate in time,\nwithout being time. “Time exists prior to all things in\ntime” (Elem. Theol. § 53).  \n\nWith Iamblichus, Proclus distinguishes absolute time, which is not\nparticipated in and exists ‘prior’ to all temporal things,\nfrom participated time, or rather the many participated times. The same\ndistinctions must also be made regarding eternity. For Eternity\nprecedes as cause and measures the multiple eternal beings that\nparticipate in it. “Every Eternity is a measure of things\neternal, every Time of things in time; and these two are the only\nmeasures of life and movement in things” (Elem.\nTheol. § 54). To conclude, there are two measures of the\nduration of things. First there is eternity, which measures at once the\nwhole duration of a being. Second, there is time, which measures\npiecemeal the extension of a being that continually passes from one\nstate to another. Eternity can be seen as the prefiguration of time;\ntime as the image of eternity. Each of them governs a separate sphere\nof reality, eternity the intelligible being, time the temporal\n(corporeal and psychic) world of change.  \n\nNotwithstanding the sharp distinction between the temporal and the\neternal realm, there are beings that share in both eternity and\ntime. As Proclus notes in the corollary\nto Elem. Theol. § 55, “of the things\nwhich exist in time, some have a perpetual duration.” Thus the\nuniverse as a whole and the celestial spheres in it are\nboth eternal and temporal. They are eternal because\nthey never come to existence in time and never will cease to exist. But\nthey are temporal because they possess their being only through a\nprocess of change in a sequence of moments. The same holds true for the\npsychic realm: all souls are immortal and indestructible; nevertheless,\nthey are continually undergoing change. Therefore, as Proclus says,\n“‘perpetuity’ (aidiotês) is of two\nkinds, the one eternal (aiônion), the other in time;\n[…] the one having its being concentrated in a simultaneous\nwhole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension\n(paratasis); the one entire in itself, the other composed of\nparts, each of which exists separately in a sequence of prior and\nposterior.” (Elem. Theol. § 55, trans. Dodds,\nmodified). \n\nAgainst Aristotle’s critique in De Caelo I 10, Proclus\ndefends the view that the cosmos is “both eternal and generated\n(genêtos).” As a corporeal being, the universe\ncannot produce itself and maintain itself in being. It depends for its\nexistence upon a superior cause, and it is for that reason\n“generated.” This does not prevent it, however, from\nexisting for ever, in an infinite time. As we just saw, Proclus\ndistinguishes between what is eternal in an absolute sense (the\nintelligible realm) and what is eternal because it continues to exist\nfor the whole of time, what Boethius later called\n“aevum” in distinction from\n“aeternum.” As Proclus notices, at the end of the\nPhysics (8.10, 266a27–28), Aristotle himself\nestablishes that no body can possess from itself an unlimited power to\nexist. If the world exists eternally, it must have this power from an\nincorporeal principle. Therefore, Aristotle too is forced to admit that\nthe world is somehow generated, though it continues to exist for\neternity. For it always receives from its cause its infinite power and\nnever possesses it at once as a whole, because it is limited. The world\nis eternal, because it has an infinite power of coming to be,\nnot because it exists of infinite power (In Tim. I\n252.11–254.18). \n\nThis disagreement between Plato and Aristotle is ultimately due to a\ndifferent view about the first principles of all things. Aristotle\ndenies the existence of Platonic Forms and therefore cannot admit an\nefficient or creative cause of the universe in the true sense of the\nword. Efficient causality only concerns the sublunary world. The\ncelestial bodies and the world as a whole have no efficient cause of\ntheir being, but only a final cause. From this misunderstanding about\nthe first principles follow all the other views that distinguish\nAristotle from Plato. One gets the impression, Proclus says, that\nAristotle, because he could not grasp the first principle of all things\n- the One – has always to find an explanation of things on a\nlower level: \n\nRelated to the eternity of the world is the question of the nature of\nthe celestial bodies. Aristotle argues in De Caelo I 2 that\nthe celestial bodies, which move with a natural circular motion, must\nbe made of a simple substance different from the four sublunary simple\nbodies (whose natural movements are in a straight line: up or down).\nThis ‘fifth element,’ which is by nature imperishable, is\nthe ether. With this explanation Aristotle seems to oppose the view\nPlato defends in Timaeus where it is said that the Demiurge\nmade the divine celestial bodies “mostly out of fire”\n(40a2–4). Proclus admits that the heaven is composed out of the\nfour elements with a preponderance of fire, but he insists that the\nelements are not present in the celestial bodies in the same mode as\nthey exist in the sublunary bodies. Therefore Aristotle is right when\nhe considers the heavens to constitute a fifth nature besides the four\nelements. “For in the heavens the elements are not the same as\nthey are here, but are rather the summits of them”\n(In Tim. II 49.27–29). If one counts the whole\nheaven composed out of the best of the elements as one nature and adds\nto it the four sublunary elements, we may speak of five natures\naltogether. \n\nContrary to Aristotle, Proclus argues that the whole universe (to\npan) is in a place (topos). He can do this because his\nconception of place differs in many respects from Aristotle’s own. The\nlatter defined place as “the unmoved limit of the surrounding\nbody” (Physics IV 4, 212a21–22). From\nthis it follows as a necessary corollary that the universe as a whole\ncannot be in a place, because there is simply nothing outside\nit. Aristotle’s definition, as we learn from Simplicius’ and\nPhiloponus’ Corollary on Place, had been criticized by all\nlater Neoplatonists (Syrianus, Proclus, Damascius, Simplicius, and\nPhiloponus). It is notable that Proclus’ own theory of place, as\nreported by Simplicius, differs considerably from other Neoplatonic\ntheories in that he considered place an immaterial ‘body’,\nnamely a special kind of immobile light. As emerges from\nProclus’ Commentary on Plato’s Republic, his theory took\ninspiration from the column of light mentioned at\nRepublic X, 616b. \n\nSince the heavenly bodies were considered divine, because they are\neternal and living beings, the study of the heavens was of special\nimportance to Neoplatonists. In the preface to his treatise On\nAstronomical Hypotheses (a summary and evaluation of astronomical\nviews of his time), Proclus makes it clear that his approach is based\non Plato’s remarks on astronomy (especially in the\nRepublic and in the Laws). He feels the need to go\nthrough the different theories, because one can observe a great\ndisagreement among ancient astronomers on how to explain the different\nphenomena (Hyp. I § 33). Fundamental to Proclus’\napproach is the distinction between two kinds of astronomy\n(Hyp. I § 1–3). The first kind contents itself with\nobserving the heavenly phenomena and formulating mathematical\nhypotheses to explain them and make calculations and prognostics\npossible. This is the astronomy as practiced by the most famous\nastronomers before Proclus’ time (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and\nPtolemy). The second, which is developed by Plato in the\nTimaeus, and is confirmed by the tradition of the\n“Chaldaeans and Egyptians,” investigates into the\nintelligible causes of heavenly movements. An example for this approach\ncan be found in his Commentary on Plato’s Republic\n(In Remp. II 227.23–235.3). There,\nProclus explains that the seemingly irregular movements of the\nplanets ought not to be explained by means of Ptolemy’s\ncomplicated theory of excentric spheres and epicycles, but are rather\ndue to the fact that the planets are moved by intelligent souls which\nexpress in the movements of their bodies “the invisible powers of\nthe Forms” (232.1–4). Yet Proclus appreciates Ptolemy’s\nastronomy as long as it is seen only as a mathematical-mechanical\nconstruction making it possible to calculate and predict the positions\nof planets, and as long as it does not claim to have any real\nexplanatory value. For the history of astronomy Proclus’\nAstronomical Hypotheses remains a most valuable document,\nsince it represents one of the best introductions to Ptolemy’s\nAlmagest extant from antiquity and since it explains the most\nimportant ancient astronomical theories, in order finally (in chapter\nseven of the work) to evaluate them critically. Proclus’\narguments also played an important role in the scientific discussion of\nthe Ptolemaic hypotheses in the 16th and 17th\ncentury. \n\nProclus’ distinctively non-empirical approach towards physics\nand astronomy also influences his philosophy of mathematics, which is\nset out in the two prologues to his commentary on the first book of\nEuclid’s Elements. The first prologue deals with the\nmathematical sciences in general, while the second prologue focuses on\ngeometry proper. Proclus argues in great detail that the objects of\nmathematical sciences cannot be derived from sensible particulars by\nmeans of abstraction. Because of the imperfect and deficient\ncharacter of the sensible objects one cannot derive from them objects\nthat are as perfect and as precise as mathematical objects are.\nTherefore, mathematical objects reside primarily in intellect and\nsecondarily in souls (as logoi). As universal concepts (cf.\n3.2) we can grasp mathematical objects by means of recollection\n(anamnêsis). Since geometrical objects are not\nuniversal, but particulars, and since by definition they possess\nextension, Proclus argues that their place is human imagination\n(phantasia). Imagination acts as a mirror and provides the\nmathematical objects which are projected into it by the soul with\nintelligible matter. By means of the latter geometrical objects gain\nextension and particularity. As with physics and astronomy, the\nultimate aim of geometry is not the study of these extended, material\nobjects. Rather, geometry serves an anagogical task (just as in\nPlato’s Republic), leading the soul upwards to a study\nof the true and unextended causes of geometrical objects in the divine\nmind (In Eucl. 54.14–56.22). \n\nRelying on Plato, Theaetetus 176a-b late Platonists saw the\nassimilation to god (homoiôsis theôi) as\nthe goal (telos) of philosophy. Proclus was faithful to this\nideal, as is attested by his biographer Marinus (Life of\nProclus § 25). There was a fundamental discussion in late\nNeoplatonism on how this assimilation to the divine was\npossible for humans. Damascius (In Phaed. I § 172\nWesterink) distinguishes two tendencies: Plotinus and Porphyry\npreferred philosophy, which makes us understand the divine principles\nof reality through rational explication, while others like Iamblichus\nand his followers, Syrianus, and Proclus, gave priority to hieratic\npractice or theurgy (theourgia, hieratikê [sc.\ntechnê]). Their different evaluation of respectively\ntheory and theurgy as means of salvation may be explained by their\ndifferent views on the human soul and its possibilities of ascent to\nthe divine realm. While Plotinus and Porphyry claimed that the\nsuperior part of the human soul always remains within the intelligible\nrealm, in touch with the divine principles, and never completely\ndescends into the body, Iamblichus, followed by Proclus, criticised\nsuch a view.  The soul does indeed wholly descend into the body (Steel\n1978, 34–51). Hence the importance of theurgic rites established\nby the gods themselves, to make it possible for the human soul to\novercome the distance between the mortal and the divine, which cannot\nbe done through increasing philosophical\nunderstanding. In Theol. Plat. I 25, Proclus\nexpresses his great admiration for the power of theurgy, which\nsurpasses all human knowledge. \n\nAllegedly, Neoplatonic theurgy originated with Julian the theurgist,\nwho lived in the time of emperor Marcus Aurelius. At first sight,\ntheurgy seems to share many characteristics with magic (theory of\ncosmic sympathy, invocations, animation of statues of gods and demons),\nbut it is, as far as we can judge from the extant sources, clearly\ndifferent from it. In his De Mysteriis Iamblichus\ndeveloped a theology of the hieratic rituals from Platonic principles,\nwhich clearly sets them apart from the vulgar magical practices. While\nmagic assumes that the gods can be rendered subservient to the\nmagicians, Platonic philosophers consider this impossible. According to\nPlato’s principles of theology (Republic II and\nLaws X), the gods are immutable, unchangeable, and cannot be\nbribed by means of sacrifices. Proclus’ views on theurgy (of which\nonly some fragments belonging to his treatise On Hieratic Art\n[i.e., theurgy] survived) are fully in line with these fundamental\nPlatonic axioms. But how, then, does theurgy work? The theurgists take\nup an old belief, shared also by many philosophers, namely the natural\nand cosmic ‘sympathy’ (sumpatheia) pervading all\nreality. As with an organism, all parts of reality are somehow linked\ntogether as one. Another way of expressing this idea is in the\nNeoplatonic principle, going back at least to Iamblichus, that\neverything is in everything (panta\nen pasin). According to Proclus, all reality,\nincluding its most inferior level, matter, is directed upwards towards\nthe origin from which it proceeds. To say it in the words of Theodorus\nof Asine, whom Proclus quotes in his Commentary on the Timaeus\n(I 213.2–3): “All things pray except the First.”  \n\nAs stated before (cf. 3.3), the human soul contains the principles\n(logoi) of all reality within itself. The soul carries,\nhowever, also sumbola or sunthêmata which\ncorrespond to the divine principles of reality. The same symbols also\nestablish the secret correspondences between sensible things (stones,\nplants, and animals) and celestial and divine realities. Thanks to\nthese symbols, things on different levels (stones, plants, animals,\nsouls) are linked in a ‘chain’ (seira) to the divine principle on\nwhich they depend, as the chain of the sun and the many solar beings,\nor the chain of the moon. Of great importance in the rituals was also\nthe evocation of the secret divine names. In his Commentary on the\nCratylus, Proclus compares divine names to statues of the gods\nused in theurgy (In Crat. § 46), pointing to\nthe fact that also language is an important means in the ascent to the\ndivine. \n\nProclus evokes the Platonic background of his theurgical beliefs,\nnamely his theory of love (erôs) as expressed in\nthe Symposium and the Phaedrus, in his\ntreatise On Hieratic Art: \n\nIn the wake of an article of Anne Sheppard (1982), scholars usually\ndistinguish between three kinds of theurgy in Proclus. The first kind,\nas described in the above quoted treatise On Hieratic Art, was\nmainly concerned with animating statues (in order to obtain oracles or\nto evoke divine apparitions) or, in general, with activities related to\nphysical phenomena or human affairs (influencing the weather, healing\nillnesses etc.) (see Life of Proclus § 28–29). As emerges\nfrom our sources, it is this kind of theurgy that involved much\nritualistic practice, including hymns and prayers. The second kind of\ntheurgy makes the soul capable of ascending up to the level of the\nhypercosmic gods and the divine intellect. This second kind too\noperates by means of prayers and invocations and it seems especially\ncharacteristic of Proclus’ Hymns. And finally, the third\nkind of theurgy establishes unity with the first principles, that is\nthe One itself. This third kind corresponds to the level of the highest\nvirtues (i.e., ‘theurgic virtues’) in the scale of virtues.\nIt is not clear whether some form of ritual is involved here at all.\nFor this last stage of the Platonic homoiôsis\ntheôi the following elements are of major importance:\nnegative theology (culminating in the negation of the negation), mystic\nsilence and the intriguing notion of faith (pistis), which\nthus enters with a non-Platonic meaning - though even for the latter\nnotion Proclus will search for confirmation in the Platonic\ndialogues. \n\nIn his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, in the\nchapter on Alexandrian Philosophy, Hegel said that “in Proclus we\nhave the culminating point of the Neo-Platonic philosophy; this method\nin philosophy is carried into later times, continuing even through the\nwhole of the Middle Ages. […] Although the Neo-Platonic school\nceased to exist outwardly, ideas of the Neo-Platonists, and specially\nthe philosophy of Proclus, were long maintained and preserved in the\nChurch.” \n\nThat Proclus, who set up his elaborate Platonic\nTheology in an attempt to rationally justify a pagan religious\ntradition whose existence was threatened by the upcoming Christian\ncivilization, would have had such an influence in Christian medieval\nthought might seem surprising. His influence, however, is mainly\nindirect, as his ideas circulated under the names of other\nphilosophers. There was, of course, a direct confrontation with the\nworks of Proclus in the later Neoplatonic school (via Damascius and\nAmmonius, 5th–6th century) and in Byzantium. In the\n11th century, Michael Psellus studied Proclus intensively\nand even preserved fragments of his lost works. One of his disciples\nwas the Georgian Ioanne Petritsi, who translated Proclus’\nElements into Georgian and composed a commentary on it\n(Gigineishvili 2007). In the 12th century, bishop Nicolaus\nof Methone wrote a Christian reply to Proclus’ Elements,\nthus showing indirectly that the work was still attracting interest.\nMoreover, Isaac Sebastocrator (11–12th century) produced a\nChristian adaption of the Tria opuscula. Around 1300 Proclus\nattracted the interest of the philosopher George Pachymeres, who\nprepared an edition of Proclus’ Commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which was only preserved in a very corrupt\ntradition, and even composed a commentary to the last part of the\ndialogue where Proclus’ commentary was lacking. Cardinal\nBessarion was an attentive reader of Proclus’ works and possessed\nseveral manuscripts. We owe to the interest of scholars such as\nPsellus, Pachymeres, and Bessarion, the preservation of the work of the\npagan Proclus, who had not such a good reputation in theological\ncircles in Byzantium. And yet, the number of direct readers of Proclus\nbefore the Renaissance was very limited. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages Proclus’ influence was mainly indirect, above all\nthrough the writings of the Christian author Dionysius the Areopagite\nand the Arabic Liber de causis. Dionysius was a Christian\nauthor writing around 500, who was deeply fascinated by Proclus. He\nfully exploited Proclus’ works – which he must have read\nintensively — to develop his own original Christian Platonic theology.\nHe presented himself as a disciple of Saint Paul, a pretence which was\ngenerally accepted until the late 19th century, thus giving\nhis works, and indirectly Proclus’ theology, an almost apostolic\nauthority. As Dodds 1963², xxviii, has nicely put it:\n“Proclus was […] conquering Europe in the guise of an\nearly Christian.” The well known Book of Causes is an\nArabic adaption of the Elements of Theology, made in the\n9th century. Translated in the 12th century, the\nLiber de causis circulated in the Middle Ages under the name\nof Aristotle, and was considered as a complement to the\nMetaphysics, offering a treatise on the divine causes. The\ntext entered the corpus of Aristotelian works and was intensively\nstudied and commented at the universities. Thomas Aquinas is the first\nto have discovered that this work derived in fact from Proclus’\nElements of Theology, of which he had obtained a Latin\ntranslation made by his Dominican confrere William of Moerbeke in 1268\n(see Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Liber de causis,\nintroduction). Moerbeke also translated the Tria\nopuscula and the huge commentary on the Parmenides,\nbut these works had almost no readers in the Middle Ages. Berthold of\nMoosburg wrote in the 14th century a comprehensive\ncommentary on the Latin Elements of Theology . The real\nrediscovery of Proclus started in the Italian Renaissance, mainly\nthanks to Marsilio Ficino who followed Proclus’ influence in his\nPlatonic commentaries and even composed, in imitation of Proclus, a\nChristian Platonic Theology on the immortality of the soul.\nBefore Ficino, Nicolaus Cusanus had already intensively studied\nProclus in translations. Proclus continued to enjoy wide interest at\nthe turn of the 18th century. Thomas Taylor (1758–1835)\ntranslated all of Proclus’ works into English (reprinted by the\nPrometheus Trust [London]) and tried to reconstruct the lost seventh\nbook of the\nPlatonic Theology. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) aimed at\na complete edition of his preserved work. At the beginning of the\n20th century we have the great editions of commentaries in\nthe Teubner collection. Renewed philosophical interest in Proclus in\nthe last century started with the edition of the Elements of\nTheology by Eric Robertson Dodds, and carried on with the edition of the\nPlatonic Theology by Henry Dominique Saffrey, Leendert\nGerrit Westerink and, not least, in Germany with the works of Werner\nBeierwaltes. \nLists of Proclus’ works are available in the two supplements on  and","contact.mail":"carlos.steel@kuleuven.be","contact.domain":"kuleuven.be"}]
