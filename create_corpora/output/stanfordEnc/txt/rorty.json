One is negative—a critical diagnosis of what Rorty takes\nto be defining projects of modern philosophy. The other is\npositive—an attempt to show what intellectual culture might look\nlike, once we free ourselves from the governing metaphors of mind and\nknowledge in which the traditional problems of epistemology and\nmetaphysics (and indeed, in Rorty's view, the self-conception of\nmodern philosophy) are rooted. The centerpiece of Rorty's critique is\nthe provocative account offered in Philosophy and the Mirror of\nNature (1979, hereafter PMN). In this book, and in the closely\nrelated essays collected in Consequences of Pragmatism (1982,\nhereafter CP), Rorty's principal target is the philosophical idea of\nknowledge as representation, as a mental mirroring of a mind-external\nworld.  Providing a contrasting image of philosophy, Rorty has sought\nto integrate and apply the milestone achievements of Dewey, Hegel and\nDarwin in a pragmatist synthesis of historicism and naturalism.\nCharacterizations and illustrations of a post-epistemological\nintellectual culture, present in both PMN (part III) and CP\n(xxxvii-xliv), are more richly developed in later works, such as\nContingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989, hereafter CIS), in\nthe popular essays and articles collected in Philosophy and Social\nHope (1999), and in the four volumes of philosophical papers,\nObjectivity, Relativism, and Truth (1991, hereafter ORT);\nEssays on Heidegger and Others (1991, hereafter EHO);\nTruth and Progress (1998, hereafter TP); and Philosophy\nas Cultural Politics (2007, hereafter PCP). In these writings,\nranging over an unusually wide intellectual territory, Rorty offers a\nhighly integrated, multifaceted view of thought, culture, and\npolitics, a view that has made him one of the most widely discussed\nphilosophers in our time. \n\n\n\nRichard Rorty was born on October 4th, 1931, in New York City. He grew\nup, as he recounts in Achieving Our Country (1998, hereafter\nAC), \"on the anti-communist reformist Left in mid-century\" (AC 59),\nwithin a circle combining anti-Stalinism with leftist social activism.\n\"In that circle,\" Rorty tells us, \"American patriotism,\nredistributionist economics, anticommunism, and Deweyan pragmatism went\ntogether easily and naturally.\" (AC 61) In 1946 Rorty went to the\nUniversity of Chicago, to a philosophy department which at that time\nincluded Rudolph Carnap, Charles Hartshorne, and Richard McKeon, all of\nwhom were Rorty's teachers. After receiving his BA in 1949, Rorty\nstayed on at Chicago to complete an M.A. (1952) with a thesis on\nWhitehead supervised by Hartshorne. From 1952 to 1956 Rorty was at\nYale, where he wrote a dissertation entitled \"The Concept of\nPotentiality.\" His supervisor was Paul Weiss. After the completion of\nhis Ph.D., followed by two years in the army, Rorty received his first\nacademic appointment, at Wellesley College. In 1961, after three years\nat Wellesley, Rorty moved to Princeton University where he stayed until\nhe went to the University of Virginia, in 1982, as Kenan Professor of\nthe Humanities. Rorty left the University of Virginia in 1998,\naccepting an appointment in the Department of Comparative Literature at\nStanford University. In the course of his career, Rorty received\nseveral academic awards and honours, including a Guggenheim Fellowship\n(1973-74) and a MacArthur Fellowship (1981-1986). He  held a number\nof prestigious lectureships, giving, among others, the Northcliffe\nLectures at University College, London (1986), the Clark Lectures at\nTrinity College, Cambridge (1987), and the Massey Lectures at Harvard\n(1997).  Rorty died June 8, 2007.  \n\nOn Rorty's account, modern epistemology is not only an attempt to\nlegitimate our claim to knowledge of what is real, but also an attempt\nto legitimate philosophical reflection itself—a pressing task,\non many accounts, once the advent of the so-called new\nscience of the sixteenth and seventeenth century gradually gave\ncontent to a notion of knowledge obtained by the methodological\ninterrogation of nature herself. Because the result of this kind of\ninterrogation, theoretical empirical knowledge, is so obviously\nfruitful, and also carries with it seemingly uncontentious norms of\nprogress, its mere presence poses a legitimation challenge to a form\nof thought, and claim to knowledge, that is distinct from\nit. Cartesian epistemology, in Rorty's picture, is designed to meet\nthis challenge. It is sceptical in a fundamental way; sceptical doubts\nof a Cartesian sort, that is, doubts that can be raised about any set\nof empirical claims whatever, and so cannot be alleviated by\nexperience, are tailor-made to preserve at once a domain and a job for\nphilosophical reflection. Rorty's aim in PMN is to undermine the\nassumptions in light of which this double legitimation project makes\nsense. \n\nThat any vocabulary is optional and mutable is the basic conviction\nbehind Rorty's attack on representationalist epistemology carried out\nin PMN. It informs, for instance, the genealogy (chapter one) and\ndeconstruction (chapter two) of the concept of mind offered in the\nbook's first part, \"Our Glassy Essence.\" This historicist conviction,\nhowever, is not itself a central theme of PMN, and it emerges for\nexplicit discussion only in the final section of the book,\n\"Philosophy,\" which is the shortest and in some ways least developed of\nits three parts. The argumentative core of PMN is found in its second\npart, \"Mirroring\". Here Rorty develops and extends a diverse lot of\narguments—notably from Wilfrid Sellars, Willard van Orman Quine,\nThomas Kuhn, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Donald Davidson—into a general\ncritique of the defining project of modern epistemology, viz. the\nconceptions of mind, of knowledge and of philosophy bequeathed by the\n17th and 18th centuries. Rorty's key claim is\nthat \"the Kantian picture of concepts and intuitions getting together\nto produce knowledge is needed to give sense to the idea of\n‘theory of knowledge’ as a specifically philosophical\ndiscipline, distinct from psychology.\" (PMN 168). According to Rorty,  \n\nEpistemology, in Rorty's account, is wedded to a picture of mind's\nstructure working on empirical content to produce in itself\nitems—thoughts, representations—which, when things go\nwell, correctly mirror reality. To loosen the grip of this picture on\nour thinking is to challenge the idea that epistemology—whether\ntraditional Cartesian or 20th century linguistic—is the essence\nof philosophy. To this end, Rorty combines a reading of Quine's attack\non a version of the structure-content distinction in \"Two Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\" (1952), with a reading of Sellars' attack on the idea of\ngivenness in \"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\" (1956/1997). On\nRorty's reading, though neither Sellars nor Quine is able fully to\ntake in the liberating influence of the other, they are really\nattacking the same distinction, or set of distinctions. While Quine\ncasts doubt on the notion of structure or meaning which\nlinguistically-turned epistemology had instated in place of mental\nentities, Sellars, questioning the very idea of givenness, came at the\ndistinction from the other side: \n\nThe upshot of Quine's and Sellars' criticisms of the myths and dogmas\nof epistemology is, Rorty suggests, that \"we see knowledge as a matter\nof conversation and of social practice, rather than as an attempt to\nmirror nature.\" (PMN 171) Rorty provides this view with a label:\n\"Explaining rationality and epistemic authority by reference to what\nsociety lets us say, rather than the latter by the former, is the\nessence of what I shall call ‘epistemological\nbehaviorism,’ an attitude common to Dewey and Wittgenstein.\"\n(PMN 174) \n\nEpistemological behaviorism leaves no room for the kind of\npractice-transcending legitimation that Rorty identifies as the\ndefining aspiration of modern epistemology. Assuming that epistemic\npractices do, or at least can, diverge, it is not surprising that\nRorty's commitment to epistemological behaviorism should lead to\ncharges of relativism or subjectivism. Indeed, many who share Rorty's\nhistoricist scepticism toward the transcending ambitions of\nepistemology—friendly critics like Hilary Putnam, John McDowell\nand Daniel Dennett—balk at the idea that there are no\nconstraints on knowledge save conversational ones. Yet this is a\ncentral part of Rorty's position, repeated and elaborated as recently\nas in TP and PCP. Indeed, in TP he invokes it precisely in order to\ndeflect this sort of criticism. In \"Hilary Putnam and the Relativist\nMenace,\" Rorty says: \n\nThat epistemological behaviorism differs from traditional forms of\nrelativism and subjectivism is easier to see in light of Rorty's\ncriticism of the notion of representation, and the cluster of\nphilosophical images which surround it.  \n\nRorty's enduring attitude to relativism and subjectivism is that both\nare products of the representationalist paradigm. Though the theme is\nexplicit in PM and CP (\"Pragmatism, Relativism, Irrationalism\"), it is\nwith Rorty's later and further appropriation of Davidson that his\ncriticism of the idea of knowledge as representation becomes fully\nelaborated (ORT \"Introduction\" and Part II). Drawing on Davidson's\ncriticism of the scheme-content distinction (\"On the Very Idea of a\nConceptual Scheme\") and of the correspondence theory of truth (\"The\nStructure and Content of Truth\"), Rorty is able to back up his\nrejection of any philosophical position or project which attempts to\ndraw a general line between what is made and what is found, what is\nsubjective and what is objective, what is mere appearance and what is\nreal. Rorty's position is not that these conceptual contrasts never\nhave application, but that such application is always context and\ninterest bound and that there is, as in the case of the related notion\nof truth, nothing to be said about them in general. Rorty's commitment\nto the conversationalist view of knowledge must therefore be\ndistinguished from subjectivism or relativism, which, Rorty argues,\npresuppose the very distinctions he seeks to reject. Equally, Rorty's\nepistemological behaviorism must not be confused with an idealism that\nasserts a primacy of thought or language with respect to the unmediated\nworld, since this, too, is a position that is undercut by Rorty's\nDavidsonian position. In light of the view of truth and of meaning that\nRorty appropriates from Davidson, his conversationalism is not a matter\nof giving priority to the subjective over the objective, or to mind's\npower over world's constraint. Rather it is the other side of his\nanti-representationalism, which denies that we are related to the world\nin anything other than causal terms. Differently put, Rorty argues\nthat we can give no useful content to the notion that the world, by its\nvery nature, rationally constrains choices of vocabulary with which to\ncope with it. (TP \"The Very Idea of Human Answerability to the World:\nJohn McDowell's Version of Empiricism\").  \n\nAttacking the idea that we must acknowledge the world's normative\nconstraint on our belief-systems if we are to be rational subjects,\nRorty has drawn a great deal of criticism that takes science,\nparticularly natural science, as its chief reference point. Two general\nkinds of criticisms are often raised. The first insists that science\nconsists precisely in the effort to learn the truth about how things\nare by methodically allowing us to be constrained in our beliefs by the\nworld. On this view, Rorty is simply denying the very idea of science.\nThe other kind of criticism seeks to be internal: if Rorty's view of\nscience were to prevail, scientists would no longer be motivated to\ncarry on as they are; science would cease to be the useful sort of\nthing that Rorty also thinks it is (see, eg., Bernard Williams, \"Auto\nda Fe\" in Malachowski). However, Rorty's view of science is more\ncomplicated than he himself sometimes implies. He says: \"I tend to view\nnatural science as in the business of controlling and predicting\nthings, and as largely useless for philosophical purposes.\" (\"Reply to\nHartshorne,\" Saatkamp 32) Yet he spends a good deal of time drawing an\nalternative picture of the intellectual virtues that good science\nembodies (ORT Part I). This is a picture which eschews the notion that\nscience succeeds, when it does, in virtue of being in touch with\nreality in a special way, the sort of way that epistemologists, when\nsuccessful, can clarify. It is in this sense specifically that Rorty\ndisavows science as philosophically significant. Good science may\nnevertheless be a model of rationality, in Rorty's view, exactly in so\nfar as scientific practice has succeeded in establishing institutions\nconducive to democratic exchange of view.  \n\nThe provocative and counterintuitive force of Rorty's treatment of\nrationality and science in terms of conversational ethics is\nundeniable. It is important to realize, though, that Rorty is not\ndenying that there is any bona fide use of notions like truth,\nknowledge, or objectivity. Rather his point is that our ordinary uses\nof these notions always trade for their content and point on particular\nfeatures of their varying contexts of application. His further point is\nthat when we abstract away from these different contexts and practices,\nin search of general notions, we are left with pure abstract\nhypostatizations incapable of providing us with any guide to action at\nall. The upshot, Rorty holds, is that we simply do not have a concept\nof objective reality which can be invoked either to explain the success\nof some set of norms of warrant, or to justify some set of standards\nover against others. This is perhaps clearest in Rorty's treatment of\nthe concept of truth. With regard to truth, Rorty's rhetoric and\nphilosophical strategy has indeed shifted over the last three decades.\nAs late as in 1982 (in CP) he still attempted to articulate his view of\ntruth by drawing on William James's famous definition in terms of what\nis good in the way of belief. Soon after this, however, Rorty comes to\ndoubt the point of any theory of truth, and, following Davidson's lead\nexplicitly rejects all attempts to explicate the notion of truth in\nterms of other concepts. Rorty's mature view of the point and\nsignificance of the concept of truth is first elaborated in \"Davidson,\nPragmatism and Truth,\" in ORT. Recent expressions are found in the\nfirst of the two Spinoza Lectures given at the University of Amsterdam\nin 1997, \"Is it Desirable to Love truth?\", in the paper, \"Is Truth a\nGoal of Inquiry? Donald Davidson versus Crispin Wright\" (TP), as well\nas in the introductions to, respectively, TP and PSH. In these writings\nRorty argues that while \"truth\" has various important uses, it does not\nitself name a goal towards which we can strive, over and above warrant\nor justification. His argument is not that truth is reducible to\nwarrant, but that the concept has no deep or substantive criterial\ncontent at all. That is, there are only semantic explanations to be\noffered for why it is the case that a given sentence is true just when\nits truth conditions are satisfied. So aiming for truth, as opposed to\nwarrant, does not point to a possible line of action, just as we have\nno measure of our approximation to truth other than increasing warrant.\nIndeed, for Rorty, this is part of what makes the concept so useful, in\na manner not coincidentally analogous with goodness; it ensures that no\nsentence can ever be analytically certified as true by virtue of its\npossession of some other property. Rorty's attitude to the concept of\ntruth has been much criticized, often on the grounds that the very\nnotion of warrant, indeed the concept of belief in general, presupposes\nthe notion of truth. However, it may be that we can do justice to these\nconnections without supposing that the notion of truth thus involved\nbacks up the notions of belief and warrant with any substantive\nnormative content of its own. Indeed, that neither the concept of\ntruth, nor those of objectivity and of reality, can be invoked to\nexplain or legitimate our inferential practices and our standards of\nwarrant, is the essence of Rorty's conversationalism, or\nepistemological behaviorism. \n\nTaking epistemological behaviorism to heart, Rorty urges, means that we\ncan no longer construe the authority of science in terms of ontological\nclaims. Though many disagree, this is not, for Rorty, to denigrate or\nweaken the authority of science. Indeed, a prominent feature of Rorty's\npost-metaphysical, post-epistemological culture, is a thoroughgoing\nDarwinian naturalism.  \n\nTo be a naturalist in Rorty's sense,  \n\nIn Rorty's view, both Dewey's pragmatism and Darwinism encourage us to\nsee vocabularies as tools, to be assessed in terms of the particular\npurposes they may serve. Our vocabularies, Rorty suggests, \"have no\nmore of a representational relation to an intrinsic nature of\nthings than does the anteater's snout or the bowerbird's skill at\nweaving.\" (TP 48)  \n\nPragmatic evaluation of various linguistically infused practices\nrequires a degree of specificity. From Rorty's perspective, to suggest\nthat we might evaluate vocabularies with respect to their ability to\nuncover the truth, would be like claiming to evaluate tools for their\nability to help us get what we want—full stop. Is the hammer or the\nsaw or the scissors better—in general? Questions about usefulness can\nonly be answered, Rorty points out, once we give substance to our\npurposes. \n\nRorty's pragmatist appropriation of Darwin also defuses the\nsignificance of reduction. He rejects as representationalist the sort\nof naturalism that implies a program of nomological or conceptual\nreduction to terms at home in a basic science. Rorty's naturalism\nechoes Nietzsche's perspectivism; a descriptive vocabulary is useful\ninsofar as the patterns it highlights are usefully attended to by\ncreatures with needs and interests like ours. Darwinian naturalism, for\nRorty, implies that there is no one privileged vocabulary whose purpose it\nis to serve as a critical touchstone for our various descriptive\npractices. \n\nFor Rorty, then, any vocabulary, even that of evolutionary\nexplanation, is a tool for a purpose, and therefore subject to\nteleological assessment. Typically, Rorty justifies his own commitment\nto Darwinian naturalism by suggesting that this vocabulary is suited to\nfurther the secularization and democratization of society that Rorty\nthinks we should aim for. Accordingly, there is a close tie between\nRorty's construal of the naturalism he endorses and his most basic\npolitical convictions. \n\nRorty is a self-proclaimed romantic bourgeois liberal, a believer in\npiecemeal reforms advancing economic justice and increasing the\nfreedoms that citizens are able to enjoy. The key imperative in Rorty's\npolitical agenda is the deepening and widening of solidarity. Rorty is\nsceptical toward radicalism; political thought purporting to uncover\nhidden, systematic causes for injustice and exploitation, and on that\nbasis proposing sweeping changes to set things right. (ORT Part III;\nEHO; CIS Part II; AC) The task of the intellectual, with respect to\nsocial justice, is not to provide refinements of social theory, but to\nsensitize us to the suffering of others, and refine, deepen and expand\nour ability to identify with others, to think of others as like\nourselves in morally relevant ways. (EHO Part III; CIS Part III)\nReformist liberalism with its commitment to the expansion of democratic\nfreedoms in ever wider political solidarities is, on Rorty's view, an\nhistorical contingency which has no philosophical foundation, and needs\nnone. Recognizing the contingency of these values and the vocabulary in\nwhich they are expressed, while retaining the commitments, is the\nattitude of the liberal ironist. (CIS essays 3,4) Liberal ironists have\nthe ability to combine the consciousness of the contingency of their\nown evaluative vocabulary with a commitment to reducing suffering—in\nparticular, with a commitment to combatting cruelty. (CIS essay 4, ORT\nPart III) They promote their cause through redescriptions, rather than\narguments. The distinction between argumentative discourse and\nredescription corresponds to that between propositions and\nvocabularies. Change in belief may result from convincing argument. A\nchange in what we perceive as interesting truth value candidates\nresults from acquiring new vocabularies. Rorty identifies romanticism\nas the view that the latter sort of change is the more significant one.\n(CIS \"Introduction\", essay 1).  \n\nRorty's romantic version of liberalism is expressed also in the\ndistinction he draws between the private and the public. (CIS) This\ndistinction is often misinterpreted to imply that certain domains of\ninteraction or behaviour should be exempted from evaluation in moral or\npolitical or social terms. The distinction Rorty draws, however, has\nlittle to do with traditional attempts to draw lines of demarcation of\nthis sort between a private and a public domain—to determine which\naspects of our lives we do and which we don't have to answer for\npublically. Rorty's distinction, rather, goes to the purposes of\ntheoretical vocabularies. We should, Rorty urges, be \"content to treat\nthe demands of self-creation and of human solidarity as equally valid,\nyet forever incommensurable.\" (CIS xv) Rorty's view is that we should\ntreat vocabularies for deliberation about public goods and social and\npolitical arrangements, on the one hand, and vocabularies developed or\ncreated in pursuit of personal fulfilment, self-creation, and\nself-realization, on the other, as distinct tools. \n\nRorty's liberal ironist, recognizing—indeed, affirming—the\ncontingency of her own commitments, is explicitly ethnocentric. (ORT\n\"Solidarity or Objectivity\") For the liberal ironist,  \n\nSo the liberal ironist accepts that bourgeois liberalism has no\nuniversality other than the transient and unstable one which time,\nluck, and discursive effort might win for it. This view looks to many\nreaders like a version of cultural relativism. True, Rorty does not say\nthat what is true, what is good, and what is right is relative to some\nparticular ethnos, and so in that sense he is no relativist. But the\nworry about relativism, that it leaves us with no rational way to\nadjudicate conflict, seems to apply equally to Rorty's ethnocentric\nview. Rorty's answer is to say that in one sense of \"rational\" that is\ntrue, but that in another sense it is not, and to recommend that we\ndrop the former. Rorty's position is that we have no notion of rational\nwarrant that exceeds, or transcends, or grounds, the norms that liberal\nintellectuals take to define thorough, open-minded, reflective\ndiscussion. It is chimerical, Rorty holds, to think that the force or\nattractiveness of these norms can be enhanced by argument that does not\npresuppose them. It is pointless, equally, to look for ways of\nconvicting those who pay them no heed of irrationality. Persuasion\nacross such fundamental differences is achieved, if at all, by concrete\ncomparisons of particular alternatives, by elaborate description and\nredescription of the kinds of life to which different practices\nconduce.  \n\nThe broad scope of Rorty's metaphilosophical deconstruction, together\nwith a penchant for uncashed metaphor and swift, broad-stroke\nhistorical narrative, has gained Rorty a sturdy reputation as an\nanti-philosopher's philosopher. While his writing enjoys an unusual\ndegree of popularity beyond the confines of the profession, Rorty's\nwork is often regarded with suspicion and scepticism within academic\nphilosophy.  \n\nAs we have seen in connection with Rorty's attitude to science, it is\nparticularly Rorty's treatment of truth and knowledge that has drawn\nfire from philosophers. While a great variety of philosophers have\ncriticized Rorty on this general score in a great variety of ways, it\nis not very difficult to discern a common concern; Rorty's\nconversationalist view of truth and knowledge leaves us entirely unable\nto account for the notion that a reasonable view of how things are is a\nview suitably constrained by how the world actually is. This criticism\nis levelled against Rorty not only from the standpoint of metaphysical\nand scientific realist views of the sort that Rorty hopes will soon be\nextinct. It is expressed also by thinkers who have some sympathy with\nRorty's historicist view of intellectual progress, and his critique of\nKantian and Platonist features of modern philosophy. Frank B. Farrell,\nfor instance, argues that Rorty fails to appreciate Davidson's view on\njust this point, and claims that Rorty's conversationalist view of\nbelief-constraint is a distorted, worldless, version of Davidson's\npicture of how communication between agents occurs. Similarly, John\nMcDowell, while also critical of Davidson's epistemological views,\nclaims that Rorty's view of the relation between agent and world as\nmerely causal runs foul of the notion that our very concept of a\ncreature with beliefs involves the idea of a rational constraint of the\nworld on our epistemic states.  \n\nHowever, critics are concerned not only with what they see as a\nmisguided view of belief, truth, and knowledge, whether relativist,\nsubjectivist, or idealist in nature. An important reason for the high\ntemperature of much of the debate that Rorty has inspired is that he\nappears to some to reject the very values that are the basis for any\narticulation of a philosophical view of truth and knowledge at all.\nRorty is critical of the role of argument in intellectual progress, and\ndismissive of the very idea of theories of truth, knowledge,\nrationality, and the like. Philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and Susan\nHaack have increasingly focussed on this aspect of Rorty's views.\nHaack, in particular, frames criticism of Rorty along these lines in\nmoral terms; to her mind, Rorty's efforts to abandon the basic concepts\nof traditional epistemology are symptoms of a vulgar cynicism, which\ncontributes to the decline of reason and intellectual integrity that\nHaack and others find to be characteristic of much contemporary\nthought. The charge of intellectual irresponsibility is sometimes\nraised, or at last implied, in connection with Rorty's use of\nhistorical figures. Rorty's reading of Descartes and of Kant in PMN have\noften been challenged, as has his more constructive uses of Hegel,\nNietzsche, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein. The kind of appropriation of\nother writers and thinkers that Rorty performs will at times seem to do\nviolence to the views and intentions of the protagonists. Rorty,\nhowever, is quite clear about the rhetorical point and scholarly limitations\nof these kinds of redescriptions, as he explains in \"The Historiography\nof Philosophy: Four Genres.\" \n\nOne particularly contentious issue has arisen in connection with\nRorty's appropriation of earlier philosophers; prominent readers of\nthe classical American pragmatists have expressed deep reservations\nabout Rorty's interpretation of Dewey and Peirce, in particular, and\nthe pragmatist movement in general. Consequently, Rorty's entitlement\nto the label \"pragmatist\" has been challenged. For instance Susan\nHaack's strong claims on this score have received much attention, but\nthere are many others. (See, for example, the discussions of Rorty in\nThomas M.  Alexander, 1987; Gary Brodsky, 1982; James Campbell, 1984;\nAbraham Edel, 1985; James Gouinlock, 1995; Lavine 1995; R.W: Sleeper,\n1986; as well as the essays in Lenore Langdorf and Andrew R. Smith,\n1995.) For Rorty, the key figure in the American pragmatist movement\nis John Dewey, to whom he attributes many of his own central\ndoctrines. In particular, Rorty finds in Dewey an anticipation of his\nown view of philosophy as the hand-maiden of a humanist politics, of a\nnon-ontological view of the virtues of inquiry, of a holistic\nconception of human intellectual life, and of an anti-essentialist,\nhistoricist conception of philosophical thought. To read Dewey his\nway, however, Rorty explicitly sets about separating the \"good\" from\nthe \"bad\" Dewey. (See \"Dewey's Metaphysics,\" CP, 72-89, and \"Dewey\nbetween Hegel and Darwin\", in Saatkamp, 1-15.) He is critical of what\nhe takes to be Dewey's backsliding into metaphysics in Experience\nand Nature, and has no patience for the constructive attempt of\nLogic: The Theory of Inquiry. Rorty thus imposes a scheme of\nevaluation on Dewey's works which many scholars object to. Lavine, for\ninstance, claims that \"scientific method\" is Dewey's central concept\n(Lavine 1995, 44). R.W. Sleeper holds that reform rather than\nelimination of metaphysics and epistemology is Dewey's aim (Sleeper\n1986, 2, chapter 6). \n\nRorty's least favourite pragmatist is Peirce, whom he regards as\nsubject to both scheme-content dualism and to a degree of scientism. So\nit is not surprising that Haack, whose own pragmatism draws inspiration\nfrom Peirce, finds Rorty's recasting of pragmatism literally unworthy\nof the name. Rorty's key break with the pragmatists is a fundamental\none; to Haack's mind, by situating himself in opposition to the\nepistemological orientation of modern philosophy, Rorty ends up\ndismissing the very project that gave direction to the works of the\nAmerican pragmatists. While classical pragmatism is an attempt to\nunderstand and work out a novel legitimating framework for scientific\ninquiry, Haack maintains, Rorty's \"pragmatism\" (Haack consistently uses\nquotes) is simply an abandonment of the very attempt to learn more\nabout the nature and adequacy conditions of inquiry. Instead of aiding\nus in our aspiration to govern ourselves through rational thought,\nRorty weakens our intellectual resilience and leaves us even more\nvulnerable to rhetorical seduction. To Haack and her sympathisers,\nRorty's pragmatism is dangerous, performing an end-run on reason, and\ntherefore on philosophy. \n\nNevertheless, the founding impulses of Western philosophy clearly\nexpress themselves in Rorty's fundamental concern with the connection\nbetween philosophical thinking and the pursuit of human happiness.\nRorty's relationship to the traditions of Western philosophy is more\nnuanced than his reputation might suggest. So, too, is Rorty's relation\nto analytical philosophy in particular. Rorty is sometimes portrayed as\na renegade, as someone who went through a transformation from bona fide\nanalytical philosopher to something else, and then lived to tell a tale\nof liberation from youthful enchantment. This portrayal, however,\ndistorts both Rorty's view of analytical philosophy and the trajectory\nof his thinking.  \n\nIn the mid nineteen sixties, Rorty gained attention for his\narticulation of eliminative materialism (cf., \"Mind-Body Identity,\nPrivacy and Categories,\" 1965). Around that time, he also edited, and\nwrote a lengthy introduction to, a volume entitled The Linguistic\nTurn (1967, reissued with a new introduction in 1992). Though the\nintroduction to the 1967 volume and the early papers in philosophy of\nmind show Rorty adopting frameworks for philosophical problems he has\nsince dispensed with, these writings at the same time clearly bear the\nmark of the fundamental metaphilosophical attitude which becomes\nexplicit in the next decade. In the \"Preface\" to PMN, referring to\nHartshorne, McKeon, Carnap, Robert Brumbaugh, Carl Hempel, and Paul\nWeiss, Rorty says, \n\nThis way of stating the lesson, however, appears to leave open the\npossibility that certain philosophical problems eventually may\nlegitimately be taken seriously—that is, at face value in the sense\nthat they require constructive solutions—provided the assumptions\nwhich sustain their formulation stand up to proper critical scrutiny.\nTaken this way, the attitude Rorty here expresses would be more or less\nthe same as that of all those philosophers who have diagnosed their\npredecessors' work as mixtures of pseudo-questions and genuine problems\ndimly glimpsed, problems which now, with the proper frame of\nquestioning fully clarified, may be productively addressed. But the\nfull force of the lesson Rorty learned emerges only with the view that\nthis notion of proper critical scrutiny is illusory. For Rorty, to\nlegitimate the assumptions on which a philosophical problem is based,\nwould be to establish that the terms we require to pose it are\nmandatory, that the vocabulary in which we encounter it is in principle\ninescapable. But Rorty's construal of the linguistic turn, as well as\nhis proposals for eliminating the vocabulary of the mental, are really\nat odds with the idea that we might hope to construct a definitive\nvocabulary for philosophy. Even in his early days, Rorty's approach to\nphilosophy is shaped by the historicist conviction that no vocabularies\nare inescapable in principle. This means that progress in philosophy is\ngained less from constructive solutions to problems than through\ntherapeutic dissolution of their causes, that is, through the invention\nof new vocabularies by the launch of new and fruitful metaphors. (PMN\n\"Introduction\"; ORT \"Unfamiliar Noises: Hesse and Davidson on\nMetaphor\")  \n\nTo hold that no vocabulary is final is also to hold that no\nvocabulary can be free of unthematized yet optional assumptions. Hence\nany effort to circumvent a philosophical problem by making such\nassumptions visible is subject to its own circumvention. Accordingly,\nthe fact that Rorty often distances himself from the terms in which he\nearlier framed arguments and made diagnoses is in itself no reason to\nimpose on him, as some have done, a temporal dichotomy. It may be that\nRorty's early work, inspired by a less critical, less dialectical\nreading of Quine and Sellars than that offered in PMN, is more\nconstructive than therapeutic in tone and jargon, and therefore from\nRorty's later perspective in an important sense misguided. However,\nwhat ties together all Rorty's work, over time and across themes, is\nhis complete lack of faith in the idea that there is an ideal\nvocabulary, one which contains all genuine discursive options. Rorty\ndesignates this faith Platonism (an important theme in CIS). That there\nare no inescapable forms of description is a thought which permeates\nRorty's work from the 1960s right through his later therapeutic\narticulations of pragmatism. These characterizations of pragmatism in\nterms of anti-foundationalism (PMN), of anti-representationalism (ORT),\nof anti-essentialism (TP) are explicitly parasitic on constructive\nefforts in epistemology and metaphysics, and are intended to high-light\nthe various ways that these efforts remain under the spell of a\nPlatonic faith in ideal concepts and mandatory forms of\ndescriptions. \n\nRorty's use of Quine and Sellars to make his fundamental points\nagainst the idea of philosophy as a knowledge legitimation project, as\nwell as his articulation of his critique in terms of typically\n\"analytical\" philosophical problems, has contributed to an impression\nof PMN as an internal indictment of analytic philosophy as such.\nMany—some gleeful, some chagrined—have read PMN as a purported\ndemonstration of the bankruptcy of one of the two contemporary main\nstreams of Western philosophy. Such readers draw support for this view\nalso from the fact that much of Rorty's writings since PMN has been\nconcerned to show the virtues in thinkers like Heidegger and Derrida.\n(EHO) Twenty years later, however, it seems better not to superimpose\nthe analytic-continental divide onto the message of PMN, or on Rorty.\nIn PMN, his central point is that philosophy needs to break free from\nthe metaphor of mind as a medium of appearances, appearances that\nphilosophy must help us sort into the mere and the\nreality-corresponding ones. Rorty made this point in a vocabulary that\nwas developed by Anglo-American (whether by birth, naturalization, or\nlate adoption) philosophers in the course of the preceding\nhalf-century. It is not necessary, and probably misleading, to see\nRorty's criticism of epistemology and the assumptions that make it\nappear worthwhile as a criticism of a particular philosophical style of\nphilosophy or set of methodological habits. Reading PMN in conjunction\nwith the essays in CP (see particularly essay 4, \"Professionalized\nPhilosophy and Transcendentalist Culture\", essay 12, \"Philosophy in\nAmerica Today\", and also \"Introduction\"), one quickly sees that the\ntarget of PMN cannot be a putative school or branch of the subject\ncalled \"Analytic Philosophy\". Because Rorty thinks philosophy has no\nessence, has no defining historical task, fails to mark out a special\ndomain of knowledge, and is not, in short, a natural kind (CP 226), he\nleaves no ground from which to level that sort of critique. Nor is it\nhis intention to do so. Around the time of the publication of PMN,\nRorty's view of the matter was ‘that \"analytic philosophy\" now\nhas only a stylistic and sociological unity’ (CP 217). He then\nqualifies this point as follows: \"In saying….[this], I am not\nsuggesting that analytic philosophy is a bad thing, or is in bad shape.\nThe analytic style is, I think, a good style. The esprit\nde corps among analytic philosophers is healthy and useful.\" (CP\n217) However, while Rorty apparently bears no prejudice against\nanalytic philosophy in particular, the very reason for his\ntolerance—his antiessentialist, historicist view of philosophy and its\nproblems—has for many critics been a point of objection. After his\nfaint praise, Rorty goes on: \n\nThis is perfectly consonant with the attitude to the notion of\nphilosophical method Rorty expresses 20 years later: \"So-called\nmethods are simply descriptions of the activities engaged in by the\nenthusiastic imitators of one or another original mind—what Kuhn\nwould call the \"research programs\" to which their works gave rise.\"\n(TP 10) Rorty's metaphilosophical critique, then, is directed not at\nparticular techniques or styles or vocabularies, but toward the idea\nthat philosophical problems are anything other than transient tensions\nin the dynamics of evolving, contingent vocabularies. If his critique\nhas bite specifically against analytic philosophy, this may be because\nof a lingering faith in philosophical problems as lasting intellectual\nchallenges that any honest thinker has to acknowledge, and which may\nbe met by making progress in methodology. Rorty himself, however,\nnowhere says that this faith is part of the essence of analytical\nphilosophy.  On the contrary, it would seem that analytical\nphilosophers, people like Sellars, Quine, and Davidson, have provided\nRorty with indispensable critical tools in his attack on the\nepistemological legitimation-project which has been a central concern\nin philosophy since Descartes.","contact.mail":"b.t.ramberg@ifikk.uio.no","contact.domain":"ifikk.uio.no"}]
