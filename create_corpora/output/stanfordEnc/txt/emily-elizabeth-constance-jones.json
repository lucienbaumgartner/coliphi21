E. Moore at Cambridge University, worked\nprimarily in philosophical logic and ethics. Her most significant\ncontribution to the former area is her application of the\nintension-extension distinction to singular terms, anticipating\nFrege’s related distinction between sense and reference and\nRussell’s pre-“On Denoting” distinction between\nmeaning and denotation. Widely regarded as an authority on\nphilosophical logic by figures as diverse as F. C. S. Schiller and G.\nF. Stout on the one hand and C. S. Peirce on the other, Jones appeared\nin published symposia alongside such eminent contemporaries as W. E.\nJohnson and Bernard Bosanquet and became, in 1896, the first woman to\npresent a paper at the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club. Her major\npublication, A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearings,\npublished in 1911 by Cambridge University Press, contained an\nenthusiastic preface by Stout and was received favorably in\nMind, where the reviewer, Schiller, remarked: “Miss\nJones has made a great discovery.” In the same year, Russell\ndelivered a paper to the Moral Sciences Club, subsequently published\nas “Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription”, responding to a critical paper by Jones, delivered\nto the same society some months earlier. In ethics, Jones was well\nknown as a defender and expositor of the views of her teacher and\nmentor, Henry Sidgwick. (Sidgwick regarded Jones as one of his prize\nstudents.) Yet, despite the fact that she published numerous articles,\na monograph and several textbooks (some going into multiple editions),\nand was a very visible member of the English philosophical community\nfrom the 1890s until her death in 1922, she is now almost entirely\nforgotten.\n\n\nFollowing a biographical sketch (section 1), sections 2–6 focus on\nJones’s work in philosophical logic—in particular, her law\nof significant assertion and her criticisms of Russell; section 7 is\ndevoted to Jones’s contributions to ethical theory. A closing\nsection provides a brief survey of women’s contributions to\nearly analytic philosophy.\n\nBorn in Wales in 1848, Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones matriculated at\nGirton College, Cambridge University’s newly established\nwomen’s college, in 1875. She studied for the Moral Sciences\nTripos under Henry Sidgwick, James Ward and John Neville Keynes,\nreceiving a “First Class”, Sidgwick being among her\nexaminers. (Her brothers’ education took priority over her own,\ndelaying her entry into the academy and occasioning subsequent\ninterruptions.) It was due to the interventions of Sidgwick and Ward\nthat Jones, fluent from childhood in both German and French, was\noffered to complete, upon graduation, the remaining half of a\ntranslation of Hermann Lotze’s massive Mikrocosmos,\nleft unfinished by Elizabeth Hamilton (the recently deceased daughter\nof Sir William Hamilton). Jones later went on to become\nSidgwick’s literary executor. Her research in philosophical\nlogic dates from 1884, when she began her career at Girton College as\nResident Lecturer in Moral Sciences and was called upon to teach\ncourses in logic; she later became Vice-Mistress and, subsequently,\nMistress of Girton. During this period, Jones wrote a number of\nintroductory logic texts, some of which went through several\nprintings. By 1890, in her Elements of Logic as a Science of\nPropositions, whose main philosophical themes are summarized in\n“The Import of Categorical Propositions” (Jones 1893a),\nshe developed her “law of significant assertion”—the\n“new law of thought” which would become the focus of her\nsubsequent work in philosophical logic, culminating in the\neponymously-titled monograph, published by Cambridge University Press\nin 1911. During the same period Jones also published numerous papers,\nas well as an introductory text (Jones 1909), in ethics. While her\nwork in this area was primarily devoted to the exposition,\ninterpretation and defense of Sidgwick’s work, she arguably broke\nnew ground in her attempt at resolving Sidgwick’s dualism of\npractical reason. Jones was also a capable administrator. When she\nbecame Mistress of Girton in 1903, the college was £43,000 in\ndebt (equivalent to £5,185,069 in 2020); at the time of her\nretirement in 1916, the debt had been paid off and funds had been\nraised to finance several fellowships. Her death in 1922 was marked by\nthe appearance of substantial obituaries in Mind,\nProceedings of the Aristotelian Society and The\nInternational Journal of Ethics (now Ethics). \nIn her autobiography, Jones wrote of an early fascination with issues\nrelated to the nature and structure of content: \nPart of what fascinated her concerned (what I’ll call) the\nparadox of predication—a paradox that Jones traced to\nPlato’s Sophist. To understand Jones’s main\ncontributions to philosophical logic, it is useful to review Hermann\nLotze’s influential discussion, well known to Jones, of this\nparadox: \nTo predicate P of S is either to say of S\nwhat it is not, or it is to say of S what it is. That is, it\nis to say that S is not S (because it is\nP), or it is to say that it is S. We either get a\ncontradiction—we say, in effect, that S is not\nS—or an instance of the law of identity—we say\nthat S is S. Neither option is satisfactory. \nFor Lotze, the paradox has an immediate upshot: that the ‘is’ of\npredication be expunged from logic. Grammatical appearances\nnotwithstanding, the basic form an assertion takes is that of an\nidentity statement or of its negation. This, however, renders him\nincapable of making sense of (what Jones called) “significant\nassertion”. The content of an assertion, if it is not to be an\nabsurdity (A is not A), must be a triviality\n(A is A). (Lotze vaguely hints at a pragmatic\naccount of the apparent significance of what he counts as\ntrivialities, remarking that, perhaps, “what we mean by\nthem will eventually justify itself.”) As we shall see, Jones\ndoes not depart from Lotze’s austere conception of logical form:\nan affirmative proposition S is P states an identity, and is\ntrue just in case the extension of S = the extension of\nP. However, she is able to graft a notion of intensional\ncontent onto Lotze’s logical skeleton, thus avoiding his\nparadoxical conclusion that, despite appearances, all positive\nassertion is analyzed in terms of A is not A. \nThe debate surrounding this paradox was not marginal, but at the\ncenter of contemporary discussion. Although Jones’s own solution\nfalls squarely within the framework of nineteenth century logic, she\nseems to be responding to worries that were shared by Russell and\nMoore. Indeed, Dreben and Floyd (1991), who provide a useful\ndiscussion of the historical context, argue that the paradox is\nimplicated in Russell and Moore’s break with idealism. \nThe distinction between the intension (or connotation) and extension\n(or denotation) of names, which traces back to the\n Port Royal Logic,\n was widely acknowledged by nineteenth century logicians. But the\ndistinction was applied, as a rule, to general names, not\nproper names. With regard to proper names, logicians\ngenerally sided with John Stuart Mill in holding that they lack\nconnotation. Keynes, for example, writes that proper names are\n“non-connotative”—that is, “their application\nis not determined by a conventionally assigned set of\nattributes” (Keynes 1906, 42). \nJones’s “New Law of Thought”—the law of\nsignificant assertion—incorporates the distinction as\nfollows. \nThe general idea is quite straightforward and will have a familiar\nring to anyone acquainted with Frege’s sense-reference\ndistinction (or Russell’s pre-“On Denoting”\ndistinction between meaning and denotation), even if the formulation\nis slightly clumsy: when we predicate a property of an individual or\ncollection x, we first identify x via an intension\nf and then assert its identity with an individual or\ncollection y, where y is itself identified via a\ndistinct intension, g. We thus combine “identity of\ndenotation” or “denotational oneness” with\n“diversity of intension”. As she puts it as early as 1893,\n“the very essence of Categorical statements… is the\nreference (in affirmatives) of two terms to one object, in such a way\nas to indicate that the object (or group) pointed out by the one term\nhas also the characteristics signified by the other…”\n(1893a, 219). Or, as Stout writes in his Preface to Jones (1911b),\n“every affirmative proposition asserts, and every negative\nproposition denies, the union of different attributes within the unity\nof the same thing” (Stout 1911, v). \nAs noted, Jones’s conception of logical form is austere: every\npositive proposition asserts an identity. Accordingly, she takes the\nterms of all F is G to be the quantifier phrase all\nF and the predicate G. (“I understand the\nterms to include the whole of any proposition except\nthe copula” [1893–94, 36].) This departs from the\nthen-standard view, which distinguishes, in addition to the copula,\nsubject term (F), predicate term (G) and quantifier\nor “term indicator” (all). The quantifier, she\nalso notes, is optional, citing ‘Cicero is Tully’ as a\ncase of an identity proposition in which it is absent (1890, 5). \nThere are thus only two forms that can properly be referred to as\nlogical forms for Jones—identities and their negations.\nWhile Jones holds that S is P asserts an “identity of\ndenotation” in “diversity of intension”, S\nis not P asserts “difference of denotation” in\n“intensional diversity”. (Even if one accepts the former\nanalysis, however, the latter is problematic. As Augusta Klein (1911)\nnotes, for a statement of the form S is not P to be\ninformative, more is required than the mere “intensional\ndiversity” of S and P. To see this note that,\nwhile ‘Horses are not house plants’ gives us a case of\n“difference of denotation” in “intensional diversity”, it is\nno more informative than ‘Horses are horses.’ For Klein,\nthe intensions must overlap to a significant degree for the claim of\ntheir diversity to have any cognitive value.) \nJones thus solves a problem that must be faced by anyone espousing the\nview that predication is, at root, identity. If assertively uttering a\nsentence exemplifying ‘S is P’ is\nconstrued as asserting a proposition that A is\nA, then we fail to capture the point of the assertion. The\nassertion appears significant and informative; yet the content is\ntrifling—something about which we can hardly be\n“informed”. If we take the general form of assertion to be\nan informative identity—to be “an identity of denotation\nin diversity of intension”—then the problem disappears.\nThe solution, of course, applies to the cases that interested\nFrege—sentences that are explicitly of the form A =\nA. Indeed, Jones’s proposal here is in rough outline that\nof Frege (1892). (See the entry on\n Frege—in\n particular, the section\n Frege’s Philosophy of Language.)\n  \nIt is worth remarking, however, that Jones’s label “a new\nlaw of thought” is somewhat misleading. In the nineteenth\ncentury, the laws of thought were commonly understood to be the\nfollowing: the law of identity, the law of\nnon-contradiction, and the law of excluded middle. These\nare all easily statable in a first-order language. But Jones does not\nstate a new firs-order law, in addition to these three; nor does she\nexplain how the new “law” can supplant the law of\nidentity.  \nWhat then is the status of her law, vis-à-vis the\nother laws? The following passage provides some help: \nFor Jones, the laws of contradiction and excluded middle apply\nexclusively to contentful assertions. Jones’s worry is that the\nconception of content inherited from Lotze, on which S is P\nis, effectively, A is A, is a poor model not only for\nordinary assertions, but also of instances of the laws of\ncontradiction and excluded middle. These laws tell us, respectively,\nthat it cannot be the case, for example, both that Socrates\nis mortal and that he is not, and that it must be the case that\neither Socrates is mortal or he is not. In short, they tell\nus, of a significant assertion Φ, that either Φ or its\nnegation obtains, and that Φ and its negation cannot both obtain.\n \nAlthough Jones calls her law a “prior principle”, this\ndoes not mean that she takes her law to be logically prior to\nthe other laws. These other laws provide us with logical forms that\ncannot have false instances. Jones’s law does something else: it\nplaces a constraint on significant assertion, whether true or false,\ntelling us what conditions an assertion has to meet for it to be a\nsignificant instance, not only of identity, but also of contradiction\nand excluded middle.  \nAlthough the concept of intension plays an important role in\nJones’s theory, she recognizes that grasping the intension of a\nname is neither necessary nor sufficient for grasping its extension.\nOne may grasp the intension of a term and not grasp its extension, or\nconversely, grasp its extension but not its intension. Although\nundeveloped, her observations here are remarkably prescient. \nConcerning the possibility that grasping an expression’s\nextension does not require grasping its intension, she writes: \nI know that metal in extension denotes gold, silver, copper,\niron, lead, tin, mercury, aluminium, etc., and I know these when I see\nthem, but I am not able to give a satisfactory statement of the\nintension which they have in common… \nOr again I know, or I may know, all the inhabitants of a country\nparish and be able to greet them correctly by name when I meet them,\nbut may be entirely unable to give a recognizable description of any\nof them. Or I may know real diamonds from paste, or one disease from\nanother, and always apply the names rightly, and yet be unable to set\nout even to myself the connotation or intension. (1911b, 13) \nThe point applies to the intensions of proper names as well as natural\nkind terms. What these considerations suggest, as similar\nconsiderations later suggested to Gareth Evans (1982), Saul Kripke\n(1980) and Hilary Putnam (1975), is that names and natural kind terms\ndo not pick out their referents descriptively: mastery of either\nproper names or natural kind terms does not require that we associate\nwith them any reference-determining description. Jones, however,\ndoesn’t draw this bold conclusion. In fact, she thinks the\nobservation is harmless, since, on her view, the intension of a term\ncan be reconstructed by reflecting on its extension: \nIt doesn’t appear, however, that Jones is committing herself to\nany strong thesis here—that, contra Russell, there is a\n“backward road” from referent to sense; only that, in\npractice, a term’s intension can often be gleaned from\nexamination of its extension. \nIn addition, grasping a term’s intension does not guarantee\nbeing able to identify its extension: \nTo connect this observation with the previous, we must assume that the\ncompetent use of N, where N is a name or natural\nkind term, involves a capacity to recognize N’s\nreferent. What this passage then shows is that this recognitional\ncapacity is not grounded in our grasping any reference-securing\ndescription or intension. But then grasping a name’s intension\ndoes not, by itself, put one in a position to use it to refer. \nOf course, the points are, as indicated, undeveloped, and the above\ninterpretation, written in the light of later discussions by Kripke,\nPutnam and Gareth Evans, may put more weight on Jones’s remarks\nthan they can plausibly bear. But the passage’s placement early\non in the monograph reflects an awareness of its significance. (The\npassage does, of course, fail to register the thought that her\nobservations could undermine a key aspect of her proposal—that\nnames and natural kind terms have intensions, or sense.) \nAs we have seen, Jones holds that all affirmative propositions are\nidentities. Applying the analysis can be less than straightforward,\nhowever. Consider her analysis of (1): \nOn her view, ‘this small fragrant wild flower’ and\n‘Clematis’ have the same extension, yet they possess\ndistinct intensions (Jones 1893–94, 36). Jones doesn’t\nfully work out the details of this proposal, but the idea seems to be\nthat the extension of the subject term is identical to some\nClematis—a subset of the things in the extension of\n‘Clematis’. \nAs can be seen, the analysis assumes that predicate terms are\nimplicitly quantified. Jones held, following William Hamilton, that\nquantification is not restricted to subject terms, but applies to\npredicate terms as well (although the quantifier attaching to the\npredicate is never articulated). While Hamilton’s doctrine of\nthe quantification of the predicate allowed for all sorts of\nmonstrosities (Kneale and Kneale, 1962, 352–4), the only cases\nthat Jones discusses involve quantifying the predicate with\n‘some’, and assigning truth conditions to\n‘Q + S are some P’ is\nrelatively straightforward: \nIn each case, we get precisely the truth conditions we would have with\na quantifier-free predicate. E.g., ‘All S is some\nP’ is true just in case all S are\nP. \nThe endorsement of Hamilton’s view might seem\nperverse—and, in fact, Jones is elsewhere critical of his view\n(1906, 35–6)—but it is necessary if Jones is to retain the\nview that significant assertion is, at root, the assertion of an\nidentity. After all, if ‘All humans are mortal’ asserts an\nidentity, then, given that identity is commutative, it entails the\napparently nonsensical ‘Mortals are all humans.’ The\nresult is at least intelligible if we suppose that the predicate is\nalso quantified—if, that is, ‘All humans are mortal’\nis just ‘All humans are some mortals.’ For then, the\nconsequence would be ‘Some mortals are all humans,’ which\nis just the claim that some subset of the set of mortals is identical\nto the set of (all) humans. (This, of course, is not quite an identity\nstatement, since one of the terms is quantified, but it is the closest\nwe can get to a workable version of Jones’s proposal.) \nHamilton’s doctrine provides a straightforward explanation of\nthe validity of conversion. Indeed, Jones go so far as to claim that\nconversion itself presupposes some such approach: “The\npossibility of conversion… implies that the predicate, as well\nas the subject, of any proposition has denotation, and a denotation\nthat is implicitly quantified” (1911b, 3; see also Jones, et al.\n1914–15, 364). To be clear, Jones has a non-standard conception of\nconversion, on which the converse of ‘All humans are\nmortals’ is ‘Some mortals are humans’ and not, as\nusually understood, ‘All mortals are humans’ (she follows\nKeynes 1906, §96). Jones takes the former, fully articulated, to be\n‘All humans are some mortals.’ Conversion switches the\npositions of the subject and predicate terms, giving us ‘Some\nmortals are all humans’. Of course, since the original and its\nconverse are both, at logical form, identity statements, this is just\nan instance of the commutativity of identity (Keynes 1906, §142).\n \nThe analysis is applied to a variety of statement forms (see 1911b,\n48–53). One cannot escape the impression, however, that Jones,\nlike the Oxbridge logicians generally, “dissected with some\ncrude instruments” (Grattan-Guinness 1985–86, 113). Indeed, as\nW. E. Johnson objected in an early exchange with Jones, the analysis\nseems to presuppose the very notion it seeks to\neliminate—predication (Johnson 1892, 23). Consider (2): As Johnson notes, in thus specifying the set of mortals (‘the\nset of things x such that x is a mortal’), we are invoking the\nrelation of predication—the very notion that Lotze, and by\nimplication Jones, rejected as\n unintelligible.[1]\n (Jones responds in Jones 1893a.) \nStill, while the Law of Significant Assertion cannot be true in its\nfull generality, a restriction of the law to identity sentences is\nworth considering. Accordingly, in discussing Jones in relation to\nFrege and Russell, I will construe The Law of Significant Assertion as\na doctrine concerning identity sentences—sentences of the form\na is b (where a and b are names,\ndemonstratives or descriptions and is functions accordingly\nas the is of identity, not predication)—and not as a\nclaim about subject-predicate sentences generally. \nJones’s analysis of identity sentences has obvious affinities\nwith similar analyses advanced by Frege and the early Russell. In\nlight of this, it is instructive to review how Frege and Russell argue\nfor their respective analyses and compare their arguments with\nJones’s own. \nIn the opening paragraph of “On Sense and Reference”\n(Frege 1892), Frege argues that a theory that identifies the semantic\nvalue of a name with its referent—the naïve\ntheory—cannot differentiate between the contents of\n‘Hesperus = Hesperus’ and ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’. Given the plausible assumption that the proposition\nexpressed by a sentence is a function of the semantic values of its\nconstituent expressions together with their mode of combination, it\nseems inevitable that what the latter sentence says is just what the\nformer sentence says—assuming, with the naïve theory, that\n‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ possess the same\nsemantic value. Of course, the latter sentence is potentially\ninformative, whereas the former sentence is not. This leads Frege to\nreject the naïve theory. He also rejects, for reasons that need\nnot detain us, a view according to which identity is a relation\nbetween the names ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’. The view he settles on is that the\ncontribution that ‘Hesperus’ makes to the propositions\nexpressed by the above-quoted identity sentences is a sense\n—a way of thinking of the referent. (While one might say that\nthe semantic value of ‘Hesperus’ is the\nassociated sense, this would be incorrect, since, on Frege’s\nview, ‘Hesperus’ has two semantic values—its sense,\nand the referent determined by this sense. The proposition expressed\nby, e.g., ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is partly determined by\nthis sense, whereas the referent of this sentence—for Frege, its\ntruth-value—is partly determined by the associated\nreferent.) \nJones’s argument is similar, but not identical, to\nFrege’s. She argues that a theory that assimilates all assertion\nto A is A must fail to account for cases of\nsignificant assertion—cases in which we go beyond “pure\ntautology”. Frege’s argument is more sophisticated, making\nimplicit appeal to a principle of compositionality, and considering\nalternative theories of the semantic contents of singular terms.\nStill, both are concerned to correct a similar—perhaps the\nsame—mistake. Indeed, Jones’s and Frege’s interest\nin identity may derive from a common source, namely Lotze. (See\nGabriel 2002 and Heis 2013 for assessments of Lotze’s role in the\ndevelopment of Frege’s thought.) \nRussell’s analysis of identity sentences in Principles\n§64 falls out of his theory of denoting concepts—concepts\nthat, like intensions, determine an extension. In this section Russell\nshows how the theory of denoting concepts can explain “why it is\never worthwhile to affirm identity”: \nThis bears a striking similarity to Jones’s proposal. When an\nidentity statement relates two “terms”, or individuals, it\nis trivial and “is never made outside the logic-books”;\nbut when at least one denoting concept is involved, the statement is\nsignificant. While these cases “involve” a relation of\nco-reference between the denoting concepts, or between one denoting\nconcept and the term denoted, this relation is not part of what is\nstated: the one relation stated remains “pure identity”.\nThus, even in the case of an identity statement involving a denoting\nconcept, such as ‘the present Pope is the last survivor of his\ngeneration,’ we nonetheless assert an identity involving the\nindividual determined by the denoting concept. \nIn “The Existential Import of Propositions” (Russell\n1905a), the theory of denoting concepts is applied to the problem of\nvacuous singular terms. Russell explains how the failure of a singular\nterm to denote is compatible with the term’s nonetheless having\nmeaning, if we assume that denoting phrases (such as ‘the\npresent King of France’) and at least certain names\n(‘Apollo’) express denoting concepts. Jones seems not to\nhave considered the application of her denotation-connotation\ndistinction to the problem of vacuous terms and does not appeal to its\nutility in this connection in arguing for her proposal. \nAs we have seen, Jones’s and Russell’s respective analyses\nof identity statements are similar and, moreover, similarly motivated.\nThis raises a question: did Russell, prior to their public exchange\n(discussed below), have any awareness of Jones’s work? Complete\nignorance on Russell’s part seems unlikely, considering that her\nteacher, Ward, and her champion, Stout, were Russell’s teachers\nat\n Cambridge.[2]\n It seems plausible that they would have attempted to interest Russell\nin the work of someone whose concerns overlapped with his so\nsignificantly. Moreover, Russell was a regular reader of the journals\nto which Jones contributed; in several cases, the two appeared in the\nsame issue of Mind or of the Proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society. (In fact, Jones’s contribution to\nThe Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for\n1906–07, which occurs in the same issue as Russell’s\n“On the Nature of Truth”, is in part a commentary on\nRussell’s paper.) But then we have another question—why\ndoes he never cite her distinction? Surely his audience, in particular\nreaders of Mind, members of the Aristotelian Society and\nmembers of the Moral Sciences Club (see below), could be expected to\nbe acquainted with it. If so, then it would make sense to mention it,\nif only to show how his (or Frege’s) version of the distinction\nis markedly different. Even if there is disagreement with the\nframework in which the distinction is grounded, Russell’s total\nsilence demands an explanation. After all, in “On\nDenoting” Russell cites approvingly Bradley’s account of\nuniversal generalizations in terms of conditionals, even though he has\ndecisively parted ways with Bradley’s logic. So he was clearly\ncapable of separating a valuable idea from the framework in which it\nis expressed. \nOne document of interest concerning the question of influence is a\nletter to Philip Jourdain, dated September 5, 1909. Jourdain had sent\nRussell the draft of a long survey article on Frege’s work, in\nwhich he mentions Jones’s distinction, in Jones (1890) and\n(1982a), between intension and denotation—a distinction\nendorsed, as he noted in the published version of the article, by\nKeynes in the fourth (and final) edition of his influential text,\nStudies and Exercises in Formal Logic (Jourdain,\n1911–12, 201–2, footnote 153). Although Jourdain’s\nletter is now lost, it appears he is querying Russell about the\nrelation between Jones’s distinction and Frege’s (and,\nquite possibly, Russell’s related distinction between meaning\nand denotation). Here Russell responds: \nThe note displays a remarkable lack of charity. Russell, instead of\nexpressing interest in the possibility that Jones anticipated Frege on\nsense and reference, dismisses the distinction as “a commonplace\nof logic.” Going by what he writes here, how it is\nmade, and not the distinction itself, is what is crucial. But until\nRussell developed the theory of descriptions, the distinction was made\ninformally, both in his own case and in the case of Frege (1892).\n(While Frege 1893, §11, does present a formal theory of definite\ndescriptions, one which could conceivably be employed as a formal\ntheory of sense, it is doubtful that Russell had this version of\nFrege’s theory in mind when writing the above.) Surely the\ndistinction had been worth making in the cases of Frege and of his\nearlier self, even though no particular form seems to have been given\nto the distinction in either case. Russell’s dismissal is\ntherefore puzzling. \nMoreover, had Russell consulted Keynes’ account of Jones’s\ndistinction, he would have encountered an example that is quite\nsimilar to one used by Frege in the opening paragraph of “On\nSense and Reference”: \nWhether or not Keynes and Frege give the same “form” to\nthe distinction, Keynes’s presentation is sufficiently close to\nFrege’s to suggest that one could hardly be in a position to\ndismiss the one, but not the other, as\n “commonplace”.[3] \nOne explanation of Russell’s dismissal of Jones’s\ndistinction has to do with his correspondent. Jourdain, a former\nstudent of Russell’s, was quite conversant with the developing\nmathematical logic (at least to a degree—he was a competent, but\nnot quite first-rate, practitioner), went on to publish informed\nsurvey articles on (in addition to the piece on Frege already\nmentioned) Boole, Jevons, MacColl, and Peano, and had written on\nRussell’s earlier work on the principles of mathematics.\nIt’s conceivable that Russell resented the fact that Jourdain,\nexpert in both Oxbridge logic and mathematical logic, took Jones to be\ntouching on a point that he and Frege had already laid claim\nto—perhaps even beating them to a crucial insight. Matters are\nmade worse by the suggestion that Jones had—however casually and\nindirectly—influenced Russell. Any indication either that he was\ninfluenced by Jones, or that she anticipated him in some small way,\nwould detract from Russell’s own contribution. It is one thing\nto acknowledge a debt to a Frege or to a Peano. Russell saw these men\nnot only as intellectual giants, but also as introducing genuinely\nrevolutionary ideas and techniques into the study of logic and the\nfoundations of mathematics. Not only was Jones manifestly not\nof their caliber, she was also philosophically quite retrograde. For\nRussell, mindful both of the figures he was allying himself with and\nof the innovation in thought that they were introducing, acknowledging\nthat Jones had anticipated some of his ideas may have been repugnant.\nSmall wonder, then, that he kept silent on the matter in his published\nwork and correspondence. As it turns out, Jones was quickly\nto take credit (in print) for first giving expression to the\ndistinction (see Jones 1910–11), although she sensibly refrained\nfrom suggesting that her work influenced Russell. \nNone of this is to deny that there may have been entirely intellectual\nreasons for Russell’s dismissal. As indicated, Russell clearly\nsaw Jones as a throwback to an earlier period. Thus, even if there was\nsome recognition that she had come upon a distinction quite similar to\nthat between sense and reference or meaning and denotation,\nRussell’s indifference could quite easily be attributed to the\nfact that the insight was grafted onto a system of logic that he\n rejected.[4] \nSee Waithe and Cicero (1995, 37–43) for an extended discussion\nof the relation between Russell and Jones.  \nOn December 2, 1910, Jones delivered a paper to the Cambridge Moral\nSciences Club, titled “Categorical Propositions and the Law of\nIdentity” (later published, under a different title, as Jones\n1911a). Russell responded at a meeting three months later, on March\n10, 1911, delivering “Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription”. While Russell did not acknowledge being influenced\nby Jones in his earlier work, nor did he compare her view to\nFrege’s, it is significant that he took her work seriously\nenough to merit a public response, one that would be recorded in one\nof his most influential papers. \nThe main point of their exchange concerns the following well-known\npassage in “On Denoting”: \nOf this passage, Jones writes: \nWhen George IV asked whether Scott was the author of\nWaverley, what he wanted to know was, whether the intension\n(‘meaning’, connotation) of Author of\n‘Waverley’ could be assigned to\nScott—i.e.,—whether identity of denotation could\nbe asserted between Scott and Author of\n‘Waverley’. The “first gentleman of\nEurope” did not want to know whether Scott was Scott …\n. \nNo doubt, ‘if a is identical [in denotation] with\nb,’ whatever is true of the thing denoted by a\nis true of the same thing denoted by\nb—with the obvious reservation that\na is a does not convey the information that a has\nthe intension (or connotation) b. (Jones 1910a, 379–80;\nthe insertion is Jones’s)  \nI quote Russell’s response at length: \nMiss Jones argues that ‘Scott is the Author of\nWaverley’ asserts identity of denotation between\nScott and the author of Waverley. But there is some\ndifficulty in choosing among alternative meanings of this contention.\nIn the first place, it should be observed that the Author of\nWaverley is not a mere name, like Scott.\nScott is merely a noise, or shape conventionally used to\ndesignate a certain person; it gives no information about that person,\nand has nothing that can be called meaning as opposed to denotation.\n(I neglect the fact, considered above, that names, as a rule, really\nstand for descriptions.) But the author of Waverley is not\nmerely conventionally a name for Scott; the element of mere convention\nbelongs here to the separate words, the and author\nand of and Waverley. Given what these words stand\nfor, the author of Waverley is no longer arbitrary. When it\nis said that Scott is the author of Waverley, we are not\nstating that these are two names for one man, as we should be\nif we said ‘Scott is Sir Walter’. A man’s name is\nwhat he is called, but however much Scott had been called the author\nof Waverley, that would not have made him be the author; it\nwas necessary for him to actually write Waverley, which was a\nfact having nothing to do with names. (Russell 1910–11,\n27–28)  \nThis passage expands on a point made in “On Denoting”,\nwhere Russell writes: \nIn his response, Russell explains why it is that the relation between\na name and its referent is “merely linguistic through the\nphrase”, whereas the relation between a description and its\ndenotation must be “logical”. The relation between a name\nß and what it stands for is (merely) linguistic in that it is\nacceptable to specify what ß stands for with the phrase\n‘the referent/denotation of ß’. The reason that it\nis acceptable is because ß has its reference or denotation\ndetermined conventionally. Thus, since no analysis is possible, all we\ncan do is state the brute fact captured by the schema ‘ß\nstands for the referent/denotation of ß’. In contrast, the\nrelation between a description and what it denotes is\nlogical—the denotation relation is constrained by the\nmeanings of the constituents of the description and their mode of\ncombination. Thus, if ß is a description, ‘ß stands\nfor the referent/denotation of ß’ does not state a brute\nfact about our use of ß. Rather, it states a fact that holds in\nvirtue of other facts—facts about the meanings of\nß’s constituents and their mode of combination. \nA bit later, he continues: \nLet’s unpack this. Russell is here evaluating a hypothesis\naccording to which a description such as ‘the author of\nWaverley’ is, contrary to his own view, meaningful in\n isolation.[5]\n To assume that this description is meaningful in isolation is to\nassume that, for some M, ‘the author of\nWaverley’ means M. Let’s call this\nmeaning M*. Since we accept the following: \nwe also accept \nNow the meaning-in-isolation theorist might suggest that our original\nsentence, ‘Scott is the author of Waverley’,\nmeans that Scott is the denotation of M*. But, as Russell\nobserves, all this does is to replace one description with another.\nSince the theorist fails to tell us what ‘the author of\nWaverley’ means in terms that don’t involve an\nexpression equally in need of analysis, we have been given no evidence\nthat this, or any, description is meaningful in isolation. \nJones responds: \nJones rejects the proposal that what is denoted by the F =\nwhat is denoted by the meaning of ‘the F’. While\nher reasoning is obscure, the point seems to be that these\ndescriptions cannot co-refer, since they involve different\nconcepts—one, but not the other, involves the concept of\ndenotation. The point is confused, however; clearly, the descriptions\nare co-denoting—relative to the assumption that ‘the\nmeaning of the F’ has a denotation. \nHer second point is more intriguing: Jones objects to the regress\nargument’s conclusion that no real explanation of the\nmeaning of denoting phrases can be achieved if we explain a\nproposition containing such a phrase with another proposition\ncontaining a phrase of the same form. Once again, however, the point\nis undeveloped. Nonetheless, it is implied that a categorical\nproposition can indeed be explained by another categorical\nproposition, so from the fact that p and q share the\nsame form it does not follow that (e.g.) q fails to explain\np (in the relevant sense of ‘explain’). (Recall\nthat she takes all categorical propositions to possess the same form.)\nEchoing Jones’s sentiment, R. M. Sainsbury writes, “it is\nunclear what sort of explanation is needed, and why the circularity is\nvicious. This objection [i.e., Russell’s] must be regarded as\ntherefore inconclusive” (Sainsbury 1979, 105). (Broad (1912)\nresponds similarly.) Hylton (1990, 252–53), on the other hand,\nargues quite persuasively that there is a vicious regress\nhere (Hylton’s remarks are concerned specifically with the\npassage in “On Denoting”, however). \nThe point is developed further in Jones’s reply to Broad (1912),\nresponding to Jones (1910–11): \nIf I say that the import of, e.g. Scott is the Author of\nWaverley, is to assert identity of denotation with diversity\nof intension, I can of course also say that: What is denoted by\n‘what is denoted by “Scott”’, is identical\nwith what is denoted by ‘what is denoted by “Author of\nWaverley”’. As Mr. Broad suggests, the repetition\nin Subject and Predicate is ineffective, and \nhave all three the same identical denotation. \nIf my analysis (as far as denotation is concerned) is applied to this,\nwe get:— \nIf the same analysis is applied to (2) we have :— \nand so on. We have simply a repetition, for each successive more\ncomplicated proposition, of the analysis adopted. \nI think that a regress equally “infinite,” equally\ninevitable, equally innocuous, equally useless, would emerge in the\ncase of any propositional analysis treated in the same way…\n(Jones 1913, 528)  \nJones seems to miss an important point here. The existence of a\nsequence such as (1′)–(3′) is predicted on both\nanalyses—one according to which ‘Author of\nWaverley’ (or ‘the author of\nWaverley’) has meaning in isolation, and one according\nto which it does not. Thus, the inevitability of the sequence is of no\nconsequence, as it fails to tell against Russell’s theory. \nTo see this, note that Russell could easily acknowledge that a\nsequence of the following form will exist when\n‘a’ is either a name or a definite\ndescription \na is the referent of ‘a’\na is the referent of “the referent of ‘a’”\na is the referent of ‘the referent of “the\nreferent of ‘a’”’\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n \nIn the case of names, the first clause provides the ultimate\nexplanation for the truth of each succeeding clause. This is not true,\nhowever, when ‘a’ is a description. \nConsider, for example, the following segment of an infinite\nsequence: \nWe can say that: \nNotice, however, that each member of the latter sequence\nafter (4*) holds because (4*) holds. (Unless, of\ncourse, one wants to deny that even ‘Scott’ has meaning in\nisolation; but this is obviously not Jones’s position.) That is,\n‘Scott’ refers to the referent of ‘Scott’\n(i.e., (5)) because ‘Scott’ refers to Scott (i.e.,\n(4)). \nNow consider the following initial segment of an infinite sequence,\n(7)–(9), together with the corresponding reference assignments,\n(7*)–(9*): \nHere we see a contrast with (4*)–(6*): to explain the fact\nreported by (8*) by citing the fact reported by (7*) is unsatisfying,\nsince (7*) is left unexplained. Moreover, (7*), unlike (4*), does not\nstate a brute semantic fact–a fact that cannot be further\nexplained in semantic terms. It is clear that, if ‘the author of\nWaverly’ is a singular term and, contra Russell, has\nmeaning in isolation, then the relation between it and its denotation,\nScott, cannot be like the one that obtains between ‘Scott’ and\nScott. \nThis disanalogy between the two cases may not settle the case in\nRussell’s favor—perhaps, ‘the author of\nWaverly’, like ‘Scott’, is\nmeaningful in isolation after all, even though its meaning (or\ndenotation), unlike that of ‘Scott’, can’t be\nassigned directly (indeed, Richard Montague provided the tools for\nconstructing precisely such a meaning). Even so, Jones is wrong in\nthinking that the mere existence of a sequence such as (7*)–(9*)\nis dispositive. \nAn important related criticism, not acknowledged by Russell in\nsubsequent writings (it appeared after his response to Jones in\n“Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description”)\nis a critique of a famous passage in Principia Mathematica.\nIn arguing that descriptions are incomplete symbols and have no\nmeaning in isolation, Russell claims that although ‘Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley’ expresses an identity, ‘the\nauthor of Waverley’ cannot be a name. If it were, then\nit would be a value of c in the propositional function\n‘Scott is c’. But this would mean that\n‘Scott is the author of Waverley’ expresses what\n‘Scott is Scott’ expresses, which is absurd: \nJones observes: \nJones’s point can be summarized as follows. When Russell argues\nthat ‘author of Waverly’ cannot mean the same as\n‘Scott’ because this would imply that ‘Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley’ and ‘Scott is Scott’\nexpress the same proposition, he uses ‘meaning’ in an\nintensional sense: “plainly intension (or connotation) of\nthe author of Waverley and of Scott, cannot be the\nsame.” But when he argues that ‘the author of\nWaverly’ must mean the same thing as\n‘Scott’, he uses ‘meaning’ in the denotational\nsense. Russell’s premises, disambiguated, can be recast as\nfollows: ‘the author of Waverly’ and\n‘Scott’ cannot have the same intension; ‘the author\nof Waverly’ and ‘Scott’ must have the same\ndenotation. From these, it does not follow that ‘the author of\nWaverly’ has neither denotation nor\nconnotation—that it lacks meaning. \nJones seems to be perfectly correct here. The Principia\nargument intending to show that descriptions such as ‘the author\nof Waverly’ have no meaning in isolation assumes that\nan expression can only possess one kind of meaning—and thus that\nsameness of meaning is either sameness of intension or sameness of\ndenotation—and Jones is quite right to challenge this. (But see Perkins 2011 both for an alternative reading of the text as well as a useful history of the debate surrounding its interpretation.)  \nAs indicated above, Jones also made significant contributions to\nethics and moral psychology. This section will focus on her major\ncontribution to these areas—her attempt at a resolution to a\nproblem that Sidgwick stated in his The Methods of Ethics\n(ME), but which he never resolved to his satisfaction: the\ndualism of practical reason. \nA central goal of ME is to determine the rules guiding\npractical rationality and to present these as\n“methods”—“rational procedures for determining\nright conduct in any particular case” (78). ME argues at\nlength for the rationality of benevolence: that our actions should\nhave “Universal Good or Happiness” as their goal (507).\nBut, alongside this primary rule or method, Sidgwick also recognizes a\nsecondary rule of self-love or egoism. The latter rule, he is forced\nto acknowledge, is equally rational: “even if a man admits the\nself-evidence of the principle of Rational Benevolence, he may still\nhold that his own happiness is an end which it is irrational for him\nto sacrifice to any other; and that therefore a harmony between\nthe maxim of Prudence and the maxim of Rational Benevolence must be\nsomehow demonstrated, if morality is to be made completely\nrational” (498; emphasis added).  \nThe dualism of practical reason is precisely this fact, that practical\nreason is guided by two distinct but potentially incompatible rules.\nThis incompatibility will not always rise to the surface, but there is\na possibility that the two methods give divergent results. As Sidgwick\nwrites, in such a case, “practical reason, being divided against\nitself, would cease to be a motive on either side”(508). This\nwould be unacceptable for a moral rationalist like Sidgwick, who, in\nrequiring self-evidence of his methods would surely also require that\ntheir conjunction meet the same requirement.  \nSidgwick’s dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was not simply\nintellectual. As Bart Schultz notes in his biography:  \nSidgwick rejected a “metaphysical” resolution of the\ndualism. On this view, selfless actions are rewarded in the afterlife,\nwith God or some other force guaranteeing that self-interest and\nbenevolence coincide. He similarly dismissed the view that the methods\ncoincide due to facts about our evolutionary history—that\nselectional pressures have seen to it that what we desire for\nourselves is precisely what benefits the species as a whole. In each\ncase, we are asked to believe that the circumstances in which the\nmethods deliver conflicting results will simply not arise, either due\nto “the moral government of the universe” or to the\ncontingencies of natural selection.  \nSidgwick’s rationalism had him set a high bar for ethical\npropositions—that they have the certainty of “any axiom in\nArithmetic or Geometry” (507). Since the above resolutions fall\nfar short of these standards, he could not accept them.  \nJones addressed the dualism on various occasions throughout her career\n(Jones 1894, 1894–95, 1895, 1909, 1917–18, 1920), and a full survey of\nthese discussions is not possible here. This section will focus on her\nmost considered response to the dualism, her late publication\n“Practical Dualism” (Jones 1917–18). Where relevant, I\nwill also quote from her roughly coeval entry on Sidgwick for the\nEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (Jones 1920).  \nJones’s stated aim in “Practical Dualism” is to\n“deduce” the rule of prudence (or rational self-interest)\nfrom benevolence (Jones 1917–18, 323): “The reasonableness of\nbenevolence implies the reasonableness of self-love” (1920,\n504). The upshot is that we have reduced our fundamental principles to\none, thus solving the problem of the dualism of two methods.  \nThe claim that benevolence entails self-love might strike us as\npuzzling. At least since The Republic, the thought has been\nthat, if there is an entailment, it should go in the opposite\ndirection: self-love entails benevolence, and, accordingly, it is in\nmy interest to promote the happiness of others. But as the following\nmakes clear, Jones’s point is slightly different:  \nWhat Jones is claiming here is that the very formulation of\nbenevolence presupposes the rationality of self-love. If we\nhad no independent conception of the value of happiness, then neither\nself-love nor benevolence would be rationally binding. But the only\nway that I can come to grasp the value of happiness is by grasping it\nin my own case. If I grasp the value of your happiness for\nyou, it is only because I already grasp the value of my happiness\nfor me:  \nMy appreciation of the intrinsic value of others’ happiness to them\nis grounded in my appreciation of the intrinsic value of my happiness\nfor me. What this means logically is that the principle\npresupposes self-love. That is, the principle of benevolence\nis neither true nor false if the principle of self-love is false. (See\nthe entry on\n Presupposition.)\n  \nThus it appears that when Jones writes that “rational\nbenevolence implies or includes the rationality of self-love”\n(328; emphasis added) she does not have logical implication in mind\nbut rather the relation of presupposition. Moreover, this claim is\nitself far more plausible on the face of it than the claim of logical\nentailment.  \nStill, the question arises, what does the claim of presupposition\nshow? It shows at least this much, that the two principles are\nconsistent—relative to the assumption, as Jones is quick to\npoint out, that benevolence is itself non-contradictory (324). This is\na significant development, since Sidgwick’s central concern was with\nthe compatibility of the two principles. If benevolence requires that\nself-love be true for it to be true (or false), then the two\nmust be consistent (assuming benevolence is).  \nOne might challenge Jones’s response in two ways. One might question\nher assumption that the rule of benevolence presupposes self-love in\nprecisely the way that the Golden Rule presupposes self-love. Broad\n(1930, 158–9), for example, held that benevolence has no such\npresupposition. On his view, the ethical hedonist (who advocates\nbenevolence) and the rational egoist have different conceptions of the\ngood—“my Good [says the egoist] and your Good… are\nnot parts of a total Good.” Since they involve distinct\nconceptions of the good, the formulation of the one position cannot\npresuppose the truth of the other. Nonetheless, since they make\nconflicting commands regarding certain conceivable situations, we\ncannot rationally subscribe to both.  \nThe other concern is that she has, at best, shown that one who\nembraces benevolence cannot consistently reject self-love. But this\ndoes not give us a positive argument for the rational egoist to accept\nbenevolence. Jones does argue, in “Practical Dualism,”\nthat as humans we are by nature empathetic, often, through an innate\nimpulse, identifying our happiness with the happiness of others. While\nit may be possible to argue, on such a basis, that the mere possession\nof the concept of happiness makes us value it in others as much as we\nvalue it in ourselves, it remains the case that this is a\npsychological fact. While it may be so that we by nature are drawn to\nvalue in others what we value in ourselves, it does not follow that we\nrationally ought to do so simply because we do so—or even that\nwe ought to do so—in our own case.  \nOstertag and Favia (2020) presents a more comprehensive account of\nJones’s responses. See Soames (2014, 263–69) and the entries on\n Henry Sidgwick\n and\n Bertrand Russell’s Moral Philosophy\n for more on the Sidgwickian background.  \nJones was not the only woman approaching philosophical logic and\nethics from a broadly analytic perspective during this period:\nPeirce’s student, Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847–1930), made\nsignificant contributions to logic and psychology (see Russinoff 1999\nfor Ladd-Franklin’s contributions to the algebra of logic), and\nthe writings of Lady Victoria Welby (1837–1912) on meaning were\nwidely read. Indeed, Peirce wrote a joint review of her What is\nMeaning? and Russell’s Principles of Mathematics\nfor The Nation. (Dale 1996 discusses Welby’s role in\nthe development of the theory of meaning.) Later figures include the\nphilosopher of science, Dorothy Wrinch (1894–1976), a Girton\nstudent who went on to study under Russell, and Susanne Langer\n(1895–1985), who wrote a dissertation under Alfred North\nWhitehead at Radcliff in 1926. Wrinch, who published papers in\nMind on, among other things, the unity of the proposition and\nthe theory of relativity, later abandoned philosophy for chemistry,\nteaching for many years at Smith College. Langer, who would achieve\nprominence in the philosophy of art beginning in the 1940s, published\nseveral technical articles on type theory and related topics early in\nher career (Langer 1926, 1927; McDaniel 2017 is a useful guide to her\nearly work). Possibly the most prominent woman analytic philosopher of\nthe first half of the twentieth century, however, was another Girton\nstudent,\n L. Susan Stebbing\n (1885–1943), Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College,\nLondon, and co-founder of the journal Analysis. Stebbing,\nthrough her most successful student, Max Black, is responsible for one\nof the largest “families” in Josh Dever’s Philosophy\nFamily Tree (see Other Internet Resources). \nWaithe (1995) is an important resource for research into these women,\nas well as numerous minor figures; see also van der Schaar and\nSchliesser (2017). On the larger question of the erasure of women from\nthe history of philosophy, from antiquity to the French Revolution,\nEileen O’Neill’s essay, “Disappearing Ink”\n(O’Neill 1998), remains indispensable.","contact.mail":"gostertag@gc.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"gc.cuny.edu"}]
