While this scholarly response continues to\nbe challenged by the rapidly evolving nature of social networking\ntechnologies, the urgent need for attention to this phenomenon is\nunderscored by the fact that it is reshaping how many human beings initiate\nand/or maintain virtually every type of ethically significant social\nbond or role: friend-to-friend, parent-to-child, co-worker-to\nco-worker, employer-to-employee, teacher-to-student,\nneighbor-to-neighbor, seller-to-buyer, and doctor-to-patient, to offer\njust a partial list. Nor are the ethical implications of these\ntechnologies strictly interpersonal. The complex web of interactions\nbetween social networking service users and their online and offline\ncommunities, social network developers, corporations, governments and\nother institutions—along with the diverse and sometimes\nconflicting motives and interests of these various stakeholders—will\ncontinue to require rigorous philosophical analysis for decades to\ncome.\n\n\nSection 1 of the entry outlines the history and working definition\nof social networking services (hereafter referred to as SNS). Section 2\nidentifies the early philosophical foundations of reflection on the\nethics of online social networks, leading up to the emergence of Web\n2.0 standards (supporting user interactions) and full-fledged SNS.\nSection 3 reviews the primary ethical topic areas around which\nphilosophical reflections on SNS have, to date, converged: privacy;\nidentity and community; friendship, virtue and the good life; democracy\nand the public sphere; and cybercrime. Finally, Section 4 reviews some\nof the metaethical issues potentially impacted by the emergence of\nSNS.\n\n\n\n‘Social networking’ is an inherently ambiguous term\nrequiring some clarification. Human beings have been socially\n‘networked’ in one manner or another for as long as we have\nbeen on the planet, and we have historically availed ourselves of\nmany successive techniques and instruments for facilitating and\nmaintaining such networks. These include structured social affiliations\nand institutions such as private and public clubs, lodges and churches\nas well as communications technologies such as postal and courier\nsystems, telegraphs and telephones. When philosophers speak today,\nhowever, of ‘Social Networking and Ethics’, they usually\nrefer more narrowly to the ethical impact of an evolving and loosely\ndefined group of information technologies, most based on or inspired by\nthe ‘Web 2.0’ software standards that emerged in the first\ndecade of the 21st century. \n\nPrior to the emergence of Web 2.0 standards, the computer had\nalready served for decades as a medium for various forms of social\nnetworking, beginning in the 1970s with social uses of the U.S.\nmilitary’s ARPANET and evolving to facilitate thousands of\nInternet newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, BBS (bulletin board\nsystems), MUDs (multi-user dungeons) and chat rooms dedicated to an\neclectic range of topics and social identities (Barnes 2001; Turkle\n1995). These early computer social networks were systems that grew up\norganically, typically as ways of exploiting commercial, academic or\nother institutional software for more broadly social purposes. In\ncontrast, Web 2.0 technologies evolved specifically to facilitate\nuser-generated, collaborative and shared Internet content, and while\nthe initial aims of Web 2.0 software developers were still largely\ncommercial and institutional, the new standards were designed\nexplicitly to harness the already-evident potential of the Internet for\nsocial networking. Most notably, Web 2.0 social interfaces have\nredefined the social topography of the Internet by enabling users to\nbuild increasingly seamless connections between their online social\npresence and their existing social networks offline—a trend that has\nbegun to shift the Internet away from its original function as a haven\nfor largely anonymous or pseudonymous identities forming sui\ngeneris social networks (Ess 2011). \n\nAmong the first websites to employ the new standards explicitly for\ngeneral social networking purposes were Orkut, MySpace, LinkedIn,\nFriendster, Bebo, Habbo and Facebook. More recent and specific trends\nin online social networking include the rise of sites dedicated to\nmedia sharing (YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, Vine), microblogging (Tumblr, Twitter),\nlocation-based networking (Foursquare, Loopt, Yelp, YikYak)\nand interest-sharing (Pinterest). \n\nThe study of the ethical implications of SNS can be considered a\nsubpart of Computer and Information Ethics (Bynum 2018). While\nComputer and Information Ethics certainly accommodates an\ninterdisciplinary approach, the direction and problems of that field\nhave largely been defined by philosophically-trained scholars. Yet\nthis has not been the early pattern for the ethics of social\nnetworking. Partly due to the temporal coincidence of the social\nnetworking phenomenon with emerging empirical studies of the patterns\nof use and effects of computer-mediated-communication (CMC), a field\nnow called ‘Internet Studies’ (Consalvo and Ess, 2011),\nthe ethical implications of social networking technologies were\ninitially targeted for inquiry by a loose coalition of sociologists,\nsocial psychologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, media scholars\nand political scientists (see, for example, Giles 2006; Boyd 2007;\nEllison et al. 2007; Ito 2009).   Consequently, those\nphilosophers who have turned their attention to social networking and\nethics have had to decide whether to pursue their inquiries\nindependently, drawing only from traditional philosophical resources\nin applied computer ethics and the philosophy of technology, or to\ndevelop their views in consultation with the growing body of empirical\ndata and conclusions already being generated by other\ndisciplines. While this entry will primarily confine itself to\nreviewing existing philosophical research on social networking ethics,\nlinks between those researches and studies in other disciplinary\ncontexts continue to be highly significant. \n\nAmong the first philosophers to take an interest in the ethical\nsignificance of social uses of the Internet were phenomenological\nphilosophers of technology Albert Borgmann and Hubert Dreyfus. These\nthinkers were heavily influenced by Heidegger’s (1954/1977) view of\ntechnology as a monolithic force with a distinctive vector of\ninfluence, one that tends to constrain or impoverish the human\nexperience of reality in specific ways. While Borgmann and Dreyfus were\nprimarily responding to the immediate precursors of Web 2.0 social\nnetworks (e.g., chat rooms, newsgroups, online gaming and email), their\nconclusions, which aim at online sociality broadly construed, are\ndirectly relevant to SNS. \n\nBorgmann’s early critique (1984) of modern technology\naddressed what he called the device paradigm, a\ntechnologically-driven tendency to conform our interactions with the\nworld to a model of easy consumption. By 1992’s Crossing the\nPostmodern Divide, however, Borgmann had become more narrowly\nfocused on the ethical and social impact of information technologies,\nemploying the concept of hyperreality to critique (among other\naspects of information technology) the way in which online social\nnetworks may subvert or displace organic social realities by allowing\npeople to “offer one another stylized versions of themselves for\namorous or convivial entertainment” (1992, 92) rather than\nallowing the fullness and complexity of their real identities to be\nengaged. While Borgmann admits that in itself a social hyperreality\nseems “morally inert” (1992, 94), he insists that the\nethical danger of hyperrealities lies in their tendency to leave us\n“resentful and defeated” when we are forced to return from\ntheir “insubstantial and disconnected glamour” to the\norganic reality which “with all its poverty inescapably asserts\nits claims on us” by providing “the tasks and blessings\nthat call forth patience and vigor in people.” (1992, 96) This\ncontrast between the “glamour of virtuality” and the\n“hardness of reality” continues to be a motif in his 1999\nbook Holding On to Reality, in which he describes online\nsociality in MUDs (multi-user dungeons) as a “virtual\nfog” which seeps into and obscures the gravity of real human\nbonds (1999, 190–91). \n\nThere might be an inherent ambiguity in Borgmann’s analysis,\nhowever. On the one hand he tells us that it is the\ncompetition with our organic and embodied social presence that\nmakes online social environments designed for convenience, pleasure and\nease ethically problematic, since the latter will inevitably be judged\nmore satisfying than the ‘real’ social environment. But he\ngoes on to claim that online social environments are\nthemselves ethically deficient: \n\nCritics of Borgmann have seen him as adopting Heidegger’s\nsubstantivist, monolithic model of technology as a singular,\ndeterministic force in human affairs (Feenberg 1999; Verbeek 2005).\nThis model, known as technological determinism, represents\ntechnology as an independent driver of social and cultural change,\nshaping human institutions, practices and values in a manner largely\nbeyond our control. Whether or not this is ultimately Borgmann’s\nview (or Heidegger’s), his critics are likely responding to\nremarks of the following sort: “[Social hyperreality] has already\nbegun to transform the social fabric…At length it will lead to a\ndisconnected, disembodied, and disoriented sort of life…It is\nobviously growing and thickening, suffocating reality and rendering\nhumanity less mindful and intelligent.” (Borgmann 1992,\n108–9) \n\nCritics assert that the ethical force of Borgmann’s analysis\nsuffers from his lack of attention to the substantive differences\nbetween particular social networking technologies and their varied\ncontexts of use, as well as the different motivations and patterns of\nactivity displayed by individual users in those contexts. For example,\nBorgmann is charged with ignoring the fact that physical reality does\nnot always enable or facilitate connection, nor does it do so equally\nfor all persons. As a consequence, Andrew Feenberg (1999) claims that\nBorgmann has missed the way in which online social networks might\nsupply sites of democratic resistance for those who are physically or\npolitically disempowered by many ‘real-world’ networks. \n\nPhilosopher Hubert Dreyfus (2001) joined Borgmann in early critical\nengagement with the ethical possibilities of the Internet; like\nBorgmann, Dreyfus’s reflections on the ethical dimension of online\nsociality evince a general suspicion of such networks as an\nimpoverished substitute for the real thing. Like Borgmann,\nDreyfus’s suspicion is also informed by his phenomenological\nroots, which lead him to focus his critical attention on the\nInternet’s suspension of fully embodied presence. Yet\nrather than draw upon Heidegger’s metaphysical framework, Dreyfus\n(2004) reaches back to Kierkegaard in forming his criticisms of life\nonline. Dreyfus suggests that what online engagements intrinsically\nlack is exposure to risk, and without risk, Dreyfus tells us,\nthere can be no true meaning or commitment found in the electronic\ndomain. Instead, we are drawn to online social environments precisely\nbecause they allow us to play with notions of identity,\ncommitment and meaning, without risking the irrevocable consequences\nthat ground real identities and relationships. As Dreyfus puts\nit: \n\nWhile Dreyfus acknowledges that unconditional commitment and\nacceptance of risk are not excluded in principle by online\nsociality, he insists that “anyone using the Net who was led to\nrisk his or her real identity in the real world would have to act\nagainst the grain of what attracted him or her to the Net in the first\nplace” (2004, 78). \n\nWhile Borgmann and Dreyfus’s views continue to inform the\nphilosophical conversation about social networking and ethics, both of\nthese early philosophical engagements with the phenomenon manifest\ncertain predictive failures (as is perhaps unavoidable when reflecting\non new and rapidly evolving technological systems). Dreyfus did not\nforesee the way in which popular SNS such as Facebook, LinkedIn and\nGoogle+ would shift away from the earlier online norms of anonymity and\nidentity play, instead giving real-world identities an online presence\nwhich in some ways is less ephemeral than bodily presence (as\nthose who have struggled to erase online traces of past acts or to\ndelete Facebook profiles of deceased loved ones can attest). \n\nLikewise, Borgmann’s critiques of “immobile\nattachment” to the online datastream did not anticipate the rise\nof mobile social networking applications which not only encourage us to\nphysically seek out and join our friends at those same concerts, plays\nand political events that he envisioned us passively digesting from an\nelectronic feed, but also enable spontaneous physical gatherings in\nways never before possible. That said, such predictive failures\nmay not, in the long view, turn out to be fatal to their\njudgments. It is worth noting that one of the earliest and most\naccomplished researchers of Internet sociality whose early championing\nof its liberating social possibilities (Turkle 1995) was directly\nchallenged by Dreyfus (2004, 75) has since articulated a far more\npessimistic view of the trajectory of new social technologies (Turkle\n2011)—one that now resonates in several respects with\nBorgmann’s earlier concerns about electronic networks\nincreasingly leading to experiences of alienation in\nconnectedness. \n\nWhile scholarship in the social and natural sciences has tended to\nfocus on the impact of SNS on psychosocial markers of\nhappiness/well-being, psychosocial adjustment, social capital, or\nfeelings of life satisfaction, philosophical concerns about social\nnetworking and ethics have generally centered on topics less amenable\nto empirical measurement (e.g., privacy, identity, friendship, the\ngood life and democratic freedom). More so than ‘social\ncapital’ or feelings of ‘life satisfaction,’ these\ntopics are closely tied to traditional concerns of ethical theory\n(e.g., virtues, rights, duties, motivations and consequences). These\ntopics are also tightly linked to the novel features and distinctive\nfunctionalities of SNS, more so than some other issues of interest in\ncomputer and information ethics that relate to more general Internet\nfunctionalities (for example, issues of copyright and intellectual\nproperty). \n\nSocial networking technologies have added a new sense of urgency and\nnew layers of complexity to the existing debates among philosophers\nabout\n privacy and information technology.\n For example, standing philosophical\ndebates about whether privacy should be defined in terms of control\nover information (Elgesem 1996), restricting access to information\n(Tavani 2007) or contextual integrity (Nissenbaum 2004) must now be\nre-examined in the light of the privacy practices of Facebook, Twitter and other\nSNS. This has become a locus of much critical attention. \n\nSome fundamental practices of concern include: the potential\navailability of users’ data to third parties for the purposes of\ncommercial marketing, data mining, research, surveillance or law\nenforcement; the capacity of facial-recognition software to\nautomatically identify persons in uploaded photos; the ability of\nthird-party applications to collect and publish user data without\ntheir permission or awareness; the frequent use by SNS of automatic\n‘opt-in’ privacy controls; the use of\n‘cookies’ to track online user activities after they have\nleft a SNS; the potential use of location-based social networking for\nstalking or other illicit monitoring of users’ physical movements; the\nsharing of user information or patterns of activity with government\nentities; and, last but not least, the potential of SNS to encourage\nusers to adopt voluntary but imprudent, ill-informed or unethical\ninformation sharing practices, either with respect to sharing their\nown personal data or sharing data related to other persons and\nentities. Facebook has been a particular lightning-rod for criticism\nof its privacy practices (Spinello 2011), but it is just the most\nvisible member of a far broader and more complex network of SNS actors\nwith access to unprecedented quantities of sensitive personal\ndata. \n\nThese new actors in the information environment create particular\nproblems with respect to privacy norms. For example, since it is the\nability to access information freely shared by others that makes SNS\nuniquely attractive and useful, and given that users often minimize or\nfail to fully understand the implications of sharing information on\nSNS, we may find that contrary to traditional views of information\nprivacy, giving users greater control over their\ninformation-sharing practices may actually lead to decreased\nprivacy for themselves or others. Moreover, in the shift from (early\nWeb 2.0) user-created and maintained sites and networks to (late Web\n2.0) proprietary social networks, many users have yet to fully process\nthe potential for conflict between their personal motivations for using\nSNS and the profit-driven motivations of the corporations that possess\ntheir data (Baym 2011). Jared Lanier frames the point cynically when he\nstates that: “The only hope for social networking sites from a\nbusiness point of view is for a magic formula to appear in which some\nmethod of violating privacy and dignity becomes acceptable”\n(Lanier 2010). \n\nScholars also note the way in which SNS architectures are often\ninsensitive to the granularity of human sociality (Hull, Lipford &\nLatulipe 2011). That is, such architectures tend to treat human\nrelations as if they are all of a kind, ignoring the profound\ndifferences among types of social relation (familial,\nprofessional, collegial, commercial, civic, etc.). As a consequence,\nthe privacy controls of such architectures often fail to account for\nthe variability of privacy norms within different but overlapping\nsocial spheres. Among philosophical accounts of privacy, Nissenbaum’s\n(2010) view of contextual integrity has seemed to many to be\nparticularly well suited to explaining the diversity and complexity of\nprivacy expectations generated by new social media (see for example\nGrodzinsky and Tavani 2010; Capurro 2011). Contextual integrity\ndemands that our information practices respect context-sensitive\nprivacy norms, where‘context’ refers not to the overly\ncoarse distinction between ‘private’ and\n‘public,’ but to a far richer array of social settings\ncharacterized by distinctive roles, norms and values. For example, the\nsame piece of information made ‘public’ in the context of\na status update to family and friends on Facebook may nevertheless be\nconsidered by the same discloser to be ‘private’ in other\ncontexts; that is, she may not expect that same information to be\nprovided to strangers Googling her name, or to bank employees\nexamining her credit.  \n\nOn the design side, such complexity means that attempts to produce\nmore ‘user-friendly’ privacy controls face an uphill\nchallenge—they must balance the need for simplicity and ease of\nuse with the need to better represent the rich and complex structures\nof our social universes. A key design question, then, is how SNS\nprivacy interfaces can be made more accessible and more\nsocially intuitive for users. \n\nHull et al. (2011) also take note of the apparent plasticity of user\nattitudes about privacy in SNS contexts, as evidenced by the pattern\nof widespread outrage over changed or newly disclosed privacy\npractices of SNS providers being followed by a period of accommodation\nto and acceptance of the new practices (Boyd and Hargittai 2010). A\nrelated concern is the “privacy paradox,” in which\nusers’ voluntary actions online seem to belie their own stated\nvalues concerning privacy. These phenomena raise many ethical\nconcerns, the most general of which may be this: how can static\nnormative conceptions of the value of privacy be used to evaluate the\nSNS practices that are destabilizing those very conceptions? More\nrecently, working from the late writings of Foucault, Hull (2015) has\nexplored the way in which the ‘self-management’ model of\nonline privacy protection embodied in standard ‘notice and\nconsent’ practices only reinforces a narrow neoliberal\nconception of privacy, and of ourselves, as commodities for sale and\nexchange. \n\nIn an early study of online communities, Bakardjieva and Feenberg\n(2000) suggested that the rise of communities predicated on the\nopen exchange of information may in fact require us to relocate our\nfocus in information ethics from privacy concerns to concerns about\nalienation; that is, the exploitation of information for\npurposes not intended by the relevant community. Heightened concerns\nabout data mining and other third-party uses of information shared on\nSNS would seem to give further weight to Bakardjieva and\nFeenberg’s argument. Such considerations give rise to the\npossibility of users deploying “guerrilla tactics” of\nmisinformation, for example, by providing SNS hosts with false names,\naddresses, birthdates, hometowns or employment information. Such\ntactics would aim to subvert the emergence of a new “digital\ntotalitarianism” that uses the power of information rather than\nphysical force as a political control (Capurro 2011). \n\nFinally, privacy issues with SNS highlight a broader philosophical\nproblem involving the intercultural dimensions of information ethics;\nRafael Capurro (2005) has noted the way in which narrowly Western\nconceptions of privacy occlude other legitimate ethical concerns\nregarding new media practices. For example, he notes that in addition\nto Western worries about protecting the private domain from public\nexposure, we must also take care to protect the public sphere\nfrom the excessive intrusion of the private. Though he illustrates the\npoint with a comment about intrusive uses of cell phones in public\nspaces (2005, 47), the rise of mobile social networking has amplified\nthis concern by several factors. When one must compete with Facebook or\nTwitter for the attention of not only one’s dinner companions and\nfamily members, but also one’s fellow drivers, pedestrians,\nstudents, moviegoers, patients and audience members, the integrity of\nthe public sphere comes to look as fragile as that of the private. \n\nSocial networking technologies open up a new type of ethical space\nin which personal identities and communities, both ‘real’\nand virtual, are constructed, presented, negotiated, managed and\nperformed. Accordingly, philosophers have analyzed SNS both in terms of\ntheir uses as Foucaultian “technologies of the self”\n(Bakardjieva and Gaden 2012) that facilitate the construction and\nperformance of personal identity, and in terms of the distinctive kinds\nof communal norms and moral practices generated by SNS (Parsell\n2008). \n\nThe ethical and metaphysical issues generated by the formation of virtual identities\nand communities have attracted much philosophical interest (see Introna\n2011 and Rodogno 2012). Yet as noted by Patrick Stokes (2012), unlike earlier forms of\nonline community in which anonymity and the construction of alter-egos\nwere typical, SNS such as Facebook increasingly anchor member\nidentities and connections to real, embodied selves and offline\n‘real-world’ networks. Yet SNS still enable users to manage\ntheir self-presentation and their social networks in ways that offline\nsocial spaces at home, school or work often do not permit. The result,\nthen, is an identity grounded in the person’s material reality\nand embodiment but more explicitly “reflective and\naspirational” (Stokes 2012, 365) in its presentation. This raises a\nnumber of ethical questions: first, from what source of normative\nguidance or value does the aspirational content of an SNS user’s\nidentity primarily derive? Do identity performances on SNS generally\nrepresent the same aspirations and reflect the same value profiles as\nusers’ offline identity performances? Do they display any notable\ndifferences from the aspirational identities of non-SNS users? Are the\nvalues and aspirations made explicit in SNS contexts more or less\nheteronomous in origin than those expressed in non-SNS contexts? Do the\nmore explicitly aspirational identity performances on SNS encourage\nusers to take steps to actually embody those aspirations offline, or do\nthey tend to weaken the motivation to do so? \n\nA further SNS phenomenon of relevance here is the persistence and\ncommunal memorialization of Facebook profiles after the user’s\ndeath; not only does this reinvigorate a number of classical ethical\nquestions about our ethical duties to honor and remember the dead, it\nalso renews questions about whether our moral identities can persist\nafter our embodied identities expire, and whether the dead have ongoing\ninterests in their social presence or reputation (Stokes 2012). \n\nMitch Parsell (2008) has raised concerns about the unique\ntemptations of ‘narrowcast’ social networking communities\nthat are “composed of those just like yourself, whatever your\nopinion, personality or prejudices.” (41) He worries that among\nthe affordances of Web 2.0 tools is a tendency to constrict our\nidentities to a closed set of communal norms that perpetuate increased\npolarization, prejudice and insularity. He admits that in\ntheory the many-to-many or one-to-many relations enabled by SNS\nallow for exposure to a greater variety of opinions and attitudes, but\nin practice Parsell worries that they often have the opposite\neffect. Building from de Laat (2006), who suggests that members of\nvirtual communities embrace a distinctly hyperactive style of\ncommunication to compensate for diminished informational cues, Parsell\nclaims that in the absence of the full range of personal identifiers\nevident through face-to-face contact, SNS may also promote the\ndeindividuation of personal identity by exaggerating and\nreinforcing the significance of singular shared traits (liberal,\nconservative, gay, Catholic, etc.) that lead us to see ourselves and\nour SNS contacts more as representatives of a group than as unique\npersons (2008, 46). \n\nParsell also notes the existence of inherently pernicious\nidentities and communities that may be enabled or enhanced by some Web\n2.0 tools—he cites the example of apotemnophiliacs, or would-be\namputees, who use such resources to create mutually supportive networks\nin which their self-destructive desires receive validation (2008, 48).\nRelated concerns have been raised about “Pro-ANA” sites\nthat provide mutually supportive networks for anorexics seeking\ninformation and tools to allow them to perpetuate and police disordered\nidentities (Giles 2006; Manders-Huits 2010). While Parsell believes\nthat certain Web 2.0 affordances enable corrupt and destructive\nvarieties of personal freedom, he claims that other Web 2.0 tools offer\ncorresponding solutions; for example, he describes Facebook’s\nreliance on long-lived profiles linked to real-world identities as a\nway of combating deindividuation and promoting responsible contribution\nto the community (2008, 54). \n\nSuch tools, however, come at some cost to user autonomy—a value\nthat in other circumstances is critical to respecting the ethical\ndemands of identity, as noted by Noemi Manders-Huits (2010).\nManders-Huits explores the tension between the way in which SNS treat\nusers as profiled and forensically reidentifiable “objects of\n(algorithmic) computation” (2010, 52) while at the same time\noffering those users an attractive space for ongoing identity\nconstruction. She argues that SNS developers have a duty to protect and\npromote the interests of their users in autonomously constructing and\nmanaging their own moral and practical identities. \n\nThe ethical concern about SNS constraints on user autonomy is also\nvoiced by Bakardjieva and Gaden (2012) who note that whether they wish\ntheir identities to be formed and used in this manner or not, the\nonline selves of SNS users are constituted by the categories\nestablished by SNS developers, and ranked and evaluated according to\nthe currency which primarily drives the narrow “moral\neconomy” of SNS communities: popularity (2012, 410). They note,\nhowever, that users are not rendered wholly powerless by this schema;\nusers retain, and many exercise, “the liberty to make informed\nchoices and negotiate the terms of their self constitution and\ninteraction with others,” (2012, 411) whether by employing means\nto resist the “commercial imperatives” of SNS sites (ibid.)\nor by deliberately restricting the scope and extent of their personal\nSNS practices. \n\nSNS such as Facebook can also be viewed as enabling authenticity in\nimportant ways. While the ‘Timeline’ feature (which\ndisplays my entire online personal history for all my friends to see)\ncan prompt me to ‘edit’ my past, it can also prompt me to\nface up to and assimilate into my self-conception thoughts and actions\nthat might otherwise be conveniently forgotten. The messy collision of\nmy family, friends and coworkers on Facebook can be managed with\nvarious tools offered by the site, allowing me to direct posts only to\nspecific sub-networks that I define. But the far simpler and less\ntime-consuming strategy is to come to terms with the\ncollision—allowing each network member to get a glimpse of who I\nam to others, while at the same time asking myself whether these\nexpanded presentations project a person that is more multidimensional\nand interesting, or one that is manifestly insincere. As Tamara Wandel\nand Anthony Beavers put it: \n\nEven so, Dean Cocking (2008) argues that many online social\nenvironments, by amplifying active aspects of self-presentation under\nour direct control, compromise the important function of\npassive modes of embodied self-presentation beyond our\nconscious control, such as body language, facial expression, and\nspontaneous displays of emotion (130). He regards these as important\nindicators of character that play a critical role in how others see us,\nand by extension, how we come to understand ourselves through\nothers’ perceptions and reactions. If Cocking’s view is\ncorrect, then as long as SNS continue to privilege text-based and\nasynchronous communications, our ability to use them to cultivate and\nexpress authentic identities may be significantly hampered. \n\nEthical preoccupations with the impact of SNS on our authentic\nself-constitution and representation may also be regarded as assuming a\nfalse dichotomy between online and offline identities; the\ninformational theory of personal identity offered by Luciano Floridi\n(2011) problematizes this distinction. Soraj Hongladarom (2011) employs\nsuch an informational metaphysic to deny that any clear boundary can be\ndrawn between our offline selves and our selves as cultivated through\nSNS. Instead, our personal identities online and off are taken as\nexternally constituted by our informational relations to other selves,\nevents and objects. \n\nLikewise, Charles Ess makes a link between relational models of the\nself found in Aristotle, Confucius and many contemporary feminist\nthinkers and emerging notions of the networked individual as a\n“smeared-out self” (2010, 111) constituted by a shifting\nweb of embodied and informational relations. Ess points out that by\nundermining the atomic and dualistic model of the self upon which\nWestern liberal democracies are founded, this new conception of the\nself forces us to reassess traditional philosophical approaches to\nethical concerns about privacy and autonomy—and may even\npromote the emergence of a much-needed “global information\nethics” (2010, 112). Yet he worries that our ‘smeared-out\nselves’ may lose coherence as the relations that constitute us\nare increasingly multiplied and scattered among a vast and expanding\nweb of networked channels. Can such selves retain the capacities of\ncritical rationality required for the exercise of liberal democracy, or\nwill our networked selves increasingly be characterized by political\nand intellectual passivity, hampered in self-governance by\n“shorter attention spans and less capacity to engage with\ncritical argument” (2010, 114)? Ess suggests that we hope for,\nand work to enable the emergence of, ‘hybrid selves’ that\ncultivate the individual moral and practical virtues needed to flourish\nwithin our networked and embodied relations (2010, 116). \n\nSNS can facilitate many types of relational connections: LinkedIn\nencourages social relations organized around our professional lives,\nTwitter is useful for creating lines of communication between ordinary\nindividuals and figures of public interest, MySpace was for a time a\npopular way for musicians to promote themselves and communicate with\ntheir fans, and Facebook, which began as a way to link university\ncohorts and now connects people across the globe, has seen a\nsurge in business profiles aimed at establishing links to existing and\nfuture customers. Yet the overarching relational concept in the SNS\nuniverse has been, and continues to be, the ‘friend,’ as\nunderscored by the now-common use of this term as a verb to refer to\nacts of instigating or confirming relationships on SNS. \n\nThis appropriation and expansion of the concept ‘friend’\nby SNS has provoked a great deal of scholarly interest from\nphilosophers and social scientists, more so than any other ethical\nconcern except perhaps privacy. Early concerns about SNS friendship\ncentered on the expectation that such sites would be used primarily to\nbuild ‘virtual’ friendships between physically separated\nindividuals lacking a ‘real-world’ or\n‘face-to-face’ connection. This perception was an\nunderstandable extrapolation from earlier patterns of Internet\nsociality, patterns that had prompted philosophical worries about\nwhether online friendships could ever be ‘as good as the real\nthing’ or were doomed to be pale substitutes for embodied\n‘face to face’ connections (Cocking and Matthews 2000).\nThis view is robustly opposed by Adam Briggle (2008), who notes that\nonline friendships might enjoy certain unique advantages. For example,\nBriggle asserts that friendships formed online might be more candid\nthan offline ones, thanks to the sense of security provided by physical\ndistance (2008, 75). He also notes the way in which asynchronous\nwritten communications can promote more deliberate and thoughtful\nexchanges (2008, 77). \n\nThese sorts of questions about how online friendships measure up to\noffline ones, along with questions about whether or to what extent\nonline friendships encroach upon users’ commitments to embodied,\n‘real-world’ relations with friends, family members and\ncommunities, defined the ethical problem-space of online friendship as\nSNS began to emerge. But it did not take long for empirical studies of\nactual SNS usage trends to force a profound rethinking of this\nproblem-space. Within five years of Facebook’s launch, it was\nevident that a significant majority of SNS users were relying on these\nsites primarily to maintain and enhance relationships with those with\nwhom they also had a strong offline connection—including close\nfamily members, high-school and college friends and co-workers\n(Ellison, Steinfeld and Lampe 2007; Ito et al. 2009; Smith 2011). Nor\nare SNS used to facilitate purely online exchanges—many SNS users\ntoday rely on the sites’ functionalities to organize everything\nfrom cocktail parties to movie nights, outings to athletic or cultural\nevents, family reunions and community meetings. Mobile SNS applications\nsuch as Foursquare, Loopt and Google Latitude amplify this type of\nfunctionality further, by enabling friends to locate one another in\ntheir community in real-time, enabling spontaneous meetings at\nrestaurants, bars and shops that would otherwise happen only by\ncoincidence. \n\nYet lingering ethical concerns remain about the way in which SNS can\ndistract users from the needs of those in their immediate physical\nsurroundings (consider the widely lamented trend of users obsessively\nchecking their social media feeds during family dinners, business\nmeetings, romantic dates and symphony performances). Such phenomena,\nwhich scholars like Sherry Turkle (2011) worry are indicative of a\ngrowing cultural tolerance for being ‘alone together,’\nbring a new complexity to earlier philosophical concerns about the\nemergence of a zero-sum game between offline relationships and their\nvirtual SNS competitors. They have also prompted a shift of ethical\nfocus away from the question of whether online relationships are\n“real” friendships (Cocking and Matthews 2000), to how\nwell the real friendships we bring to SNS are being served there\n(Vallor 2012). The debate over the value and quality of online\nfriendships continues (Sharp 2012; Froding and Peterson 2012; Elder\n2014); in large part because the typical pattern of those friendships,\nlike most social networking phenomena, continues to evolve.  \n\nSuch concerns intersect with broader philosophical questions about\nwhether and how the classical ethical ideal of ‘the good\nlife’ can be engaged in the 21st century. Pak-Hang\nWong claims that this question requires us to broaden the standard\napproach to information ethics from a narrow focus on the\n“right/the just” (2010, 29) that defines ethical action\nnegatively (e.g., in terms of violations of privacy,\ncopyright, etc.) to a framework that conceives of a positive\nethical trajectory for our technological choices. Edward Spence (2011)\nfurther suggests that to adequately address the significance of SNS and\nrelated information and communication technologies for the good life,\nwe must also expand the scope of philosophical inquiry beyond its\npresent concern with narrowly interpersonal ethics to the more\nuniversal ethical question of prudential wisdom. Do SNS and\nrelated technologies help us to cultivate the broader intellectual\nvirtue of knowing what it is to live well, and how to best pursue it?\nOr do they tend to impede its development? \n\nThis concern about prudential wisdom and the good life is part of a\ngrowing philosophical interest in using the resources of classical\nvirtue ethics to evaluate the impact of SNS and related technologies,\nwhether these resources are broadly Aristotelian (Vallor 2010),\nConfucian (Wong 2012) or both (Ess 2008). This program of research\npromotes inquiry into the impact of SNS not merely on the cultivation\nof prudential virtue, but on the development of a host of other moral\nand communicative virtues, such as honesty, patience, justice, loyalty,\nbenevolence and empathy. \n\nAs is the case with privacy, identity, community and friendship on\nSNS, ethical debates about the impact of SNS on civil discourse,\nfreedom and democracy in the public sphere must be seen as extensions\nof a broader discussion about the political implications of the\nInternet, one that predates Web 2.0 standards. Much of the literature\non this subject focuses on the question of whether the Internet\nencourages or hampers the free exercise of deliberative public reason,\nin a manner informed by Jürgen Habermas’s (1992/1998) account of\ndiscourse ethics and deliberative democracy in the public sphere (Ess\n1996 and 2005b; Dahlberg 2001; Bohman 2008). A related topic of\nconcern is the potential of the Internet to fragment the public sphere\nby encouraging the formation of a plurality of ‘echo\nchambers’ and ‘filter bubbles’: informational silos\nfor like-minded individuals who deliberately shield themselves from\nexposure to alternative views. The worry is that such insularity will\npromote extremism and the reinforcement of ill-founded opinions, while\nalso preventing citizens of a democracy from recognizing their shared\ninterests and experiences (Sunstein 2008). Finally, there is the\nquestion of the extent to which SNS can facilitate political activism,\ncivil disobedience and popular revolutions resulting in the overthrow\nof authoritarian regimes.  Commonly referenced examples include the\n2011 North African revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, with which\nFacebook and Twitter were respectively associated (Marturano 2011;\nFrick and Oberprantacher 2011). \n\nWhen SNS in particular are considered in light of these questions,\nsome distinctive considerations arise. First, sites like Facebook and\nTwitter (as opposed to narrower SNS utilities such as LinkedIn)\nfacilitate the sharing of, and exposure to, an extremely diverse range\nof types of discourse. On any given day on Facebook a user\nmay encounter in her NewsFeed a link to an article in a respected\npolitical magazine followed by a video of a cat in a silly costume,\nfollowed by a link to a new scientific study, followed by a lengthy\nstatus update someone has posted about their lunch, followed by a\nphoto of a popular political figure overlaid with a clever and\nsubversive caption.  Vacation photos are mixed in with political\nrants, invitations to cultural events, birthday reminders and\ndata-driven graphs created to undermine common political, moral or\neconomic beliefs. Thus while a user has a tremendous amount of liberty\nto choose which forms of discourse to pay closer attention to, and\ntools with which to hide or prioritize the posts of certain members of\nher network, she cannot easily shield herself from at least a\nsuperficial acquaintance with a diversity of private and public\nconcerns of her fellows. This has the potential to offer at least some\nmeasure of protection against the extreme insularity and fragmentation\nof discourse that is incompatible with the public sphere. \n\nSecond, while users can often ‘defriend’ or systematically\nhide the posts of those with whom they tend to disagree, the high\nvisibility and perceived value of social connections on these sites\nmakes this option less attractive as a consistent strategy.\nPhilosophers of technology often speak of the affordances or\ngradients of particular technologies in given contexts (Vallor\n2010) insofar as they make certain patterns of use more attractive or\nconvenient for users (while not rendering alternative patterns\nimpossible). In this respect, social networks like those on Facebook,\nin which users must take actions somewhat contrary to the site’s\npurpose in order to effectively shield themselves from unwelcome or\ncontrary opinions, may be viewed as having a modestly democratic\ngradient in comparison to networks deliberately constructed\naround a particular political cause or identity. However, this\ngradient may be undermined by Facebook’s own algorithms, which curate\nusers’ News Feed in ways that are opaque to them, and which almost\ncertainly prioritize the appeal of the ‘user experience’\nover civic benefit or the integrity of the public sphere. \n\nThird, one must ask whether SNS can skirt the dangers of a\nplebiscite model of democratic discourse, in which minority voices are\ninevitably dispersed and drowned out by the many. Certainly, compared\nto the ‘one-to-many’ channels of communication favored by\ntraditional media, SNS facilitate a ‘many-to-many’ model of\ncommunication that appears to lower the barriers to participation in\ncivic discourse for everyone, including the marginalized. However, if\none’s ‘Facebook friends’ or people you\n‘follow’ are sufficiently numerous, then minority opinions\nmay still be heard as lone voices in the wilderness, perhaps valued for\nproviding some ‘spice’ and novelty to the broader\nconversation but failing to receive serious public consideration of\ntheir merits. Existing SNS lack the institutional structures necessary\nto ensure that minority voices enjoy not only free, but\nqualitatively equal access to the deliberative function of the\npublic sphere. \n\nFourth, one must also consider the quality of informational\nexchanges on SNS and the extent to which they promote a genuinely\ndialogical public sphere marked by the exercise of critical\nrationality. While we have noted above that exposure to well-informed\nopinions and reliable evidential sources is facilitated by many of the\nmost popular SNS, exposure does not guarantee attention or\nconsumption.  For example, the number of contacts in the average\nFacebook user’s network is sufficiently large to make it virtually\nimpossible for a typical user to see every relevant post even among\nthose which Facebook’s algorithm selects for their News Feed, and only\na very small number of those may be closely attended or responded\nto. Many scholars worry that in SNS environments, substantive\ncontributions to civic discourse increasingly function as flotsam on a\nvirtual sea of trivially amusing or shallow content, weakening the\ncivic habits and practices of critical rationality that we need in\norder to function as well-informed and responsible democratic citizens\n(Carr 2010; Ess 2010). Furthermore, while the most popular SNS do\npromote norms of responsive practice, these norms tend to privilege\nbrevity and immediate impact over substance and depth in\ncommunication; Vallor (2012) suggests that this bodes poorly for the\ncultivation of those communicative virtues essential to a flourishing\npublic sphere. This worry is only reinforced by empirical data\nsuggesting that SNS perpetuate the ‘Spiral of Silence’ phenomenon that\nresults in the passive suppression of divergent views on matters of\nimportant political or civic concern (Hampton et. al. 2014). In a\nrelated critique, Frick and Oberprantacher (2011) claim that the\nability of SNS to facilitate public ‘sharing’ can obscure\nthe deep ambiguity between sharing as “a promising, active\nparticipatory process” and “interpassive, disjointed acts\nof having trivia shared.” (2011, 22) A fifth issue for online democracy relates to the contentious\ndebate emerging on social media platforms about the extent to which\ncontroversial or unpopular speech ought to be tolerated or punished by\nprivate actors, especially when the consequences manifest in\ntraditional offline contexts and spaces such as the university. For\nexample, the norms of academic freedom in the U.S. have been greatly\ndestabilized by the ‘Salaita Affair’ and several other\ncases in which academics were censured or otherwise punished by their\ninstitutions as a result of their controversial social media posts. It\nremains to be seen what equilibrium can be found between civility and\nfree expression in communities increasingly mediated by SNS\ncommunications. \n\nThere is also the question of whether SNS will necessarily preserve a\ndemocratic ethos as they come to reflect increasingly pluralistic and\ninternational social networks.  The current split between networks\nsuch as Facebook and Twitter dominant in Western liberal society and\ndedicated SNS in countries such as China (RenRen) and Russia\n(VKontakte) with more communitarian and/or authoritarian regimes may\nnot endure; if SNS become increasingly multinational or global in\nscale, will that development tend to disseminate and enhance\ndemocratic values and practices, dilute and weaken them, or perhaps\nprecipitate the recontextualization of liberal democratic values in a\nnew ‘global ethics’ (Ess 2010)?  An even more pressing question is whether civic discourse and\nactivism on SNS will be compromised or manipulated by the commercial\ninterests that currently own and manage the technical\ninfrastructure. This concern is driven by the growing economic power\nand political influence of companies in the technology sector, and the\npotentially disenfranchising and disempowering effects of an economic\nmodel in which users play a fundamentally passive role (Floridi\n2015). Indeed, the relationship between social media users and service\nproviders has become increasingly contentious, as users struggle to\ndemand more privacy, better data security and more effective\nprotections from online harassment in an economic context where they\nhave little or no direct bargaining power. This imbalance was\npowerfully illustrated by the revelation in 2014 that Facebook\nresearchers had quietly conducted psychological experiments on users\nwithout their knowledge, manipulating their moods by altering the\nbalance of positive or negative items in their News Feeds (Goel\n2014). The study adds yet another dimension to growing concerns about\nthe ethics and validity of social science research that relies on\nSNS-generated data (Buchanan and Zimmer 2012). Ironically, in the power struggle between users and SNS providers,\nsocial networking platforms themselves have become the primary\nbattlefield, where users vent their collective outrage in an attempt\nto force service providers into responding to their demands. The\nresults are sometimes positive, as when Twitter users, after years of\ncomplaining, finally shamed the company in 2015 into providing better\nreporting tools for online harassment. Yet by its nature the process\nis chaotic and often controversial, as when later that year, Reddit\nusers successfully demanded the ouster of CEO Ellen Pao, under whose\nleadership Reddit had banned some of its more repugnant ‘subreddit’\nforums (such as “Fat People Hate,” devoted to the shaming\nand harassment of overweight persons.) \nThe only clear consensus emerging from the considerations outlined\nhere is that if SNS are going to facilitate any enhancement of a\nHabermasian public sphere, or the civic virtues and praxes of reasoned\ndiscourse that any functioning public sphere must presuppose, then\nusers will have to actively mobilize themselves to exploit such an\nopportunity (Frick and Oberprantacher 2011). Such mobilization may\ndepend upon resisting the “false sense of activity and\naccomplishment” (Bar-Tura, 2010, 239) that may come from merely\nclicking ‘Like’ in response to acts of meaningful\npolitical speech, forwarding calls to sign petitions that one never\ngets around to signing oneself, or simply ‘following’ an\noutspoken social critic on Twitter whose ‘tweeted’ calls\nto action are drowned in a tide of corporate announcements, celebrity\nproduct endorsements and personal commentaries. Some argue that it\nwill also require the cultivation of new norms and virtues of online\ncivic-mindedness, without which online ‘democracies’ will continue to\nbe subject to the self-destructive and irrational tyrannies of mob\nbehavior (Ess 2010). \n\nSNS are hosts for a broad spectrum of ‘cybercrimes’ and\nrelated offenses, including but not limited to:\ncyberbullying/cyberharassment, cyberstalking, child exploitation,\ncyberextortion, cyberfraud, illegal surveillance, identity theft,\nintellectual property/copyright violations, cyberespionage,\ncybersabotage and cyberterrorism. Each of these forms of criminal or\nantisocial behavior has a history that well pre-dates Web 2.0\nstandards, and perhaps as a consequence, philosophers have tended to\nleave the specific correlations between cybercrime and SNS as an\nempirical matter for social scientists, law enforcement and Internet\nsecurity firms to investigate. Nevertheless, cybercrime is an enduring\ntopic of philosophical interest for the broader field of computer\nethics, and the migration to and evolution of such crime on SNS\nplatforms raises new and distinctive ethical issues. \nAmong those of great ethical importance is the question of how SNS\nproviders ought to respond to government demands for user data for\ninvestigative or counterterrorism purposes. SNS providers are caught\nbetween the public interest in crime prevention and their need to\npreserve the trust and loyalty of their users, many of whom view\ngovernments as overreaching in their attempts to secure records of\nonline activity. Many companies have opted to favor user security by\nemploying end-to-end encryption of SNS exchanges, much to the chagrin\nof government agencies who insist upon ‘backdoor’ access\nto user data in the interests of public safety and national security\n(Friedersdorf 2015). \nAnother emerging ethical concern is the increasingly political\ncharacter of cyberharassment and cyberstalking. In the U.S., women who\nspeak out about the lack of diversity in the tech and videogame\nindustries have been particular targets, in some cases forcing them to\ncancel speaking appearances or leave their homes due to physical\nthreats after their addresses and other personal info were posted\nonline (a practice known as ‘doxxing’). A new political\nvernacular has emerged among online contingents such as\n‘MRAs’ (men’s rights activists), who perceive themselves\nas locked in a fierce ideological battle against those they derisively\nlabel as ‘SJWs’ (‘social justice warriors’):\npersons who advocate for equality, security and diversity in and\nthrough online mediums. For victims of doxxing and associated\ncyberthreats of physical violence, traditional law enforcement bodies\noffer scant protection, as these agencies are often ill-equipped or\nunmotivated to police the blurry boundary between virtual and physical\nharms. \n\nA host of metaethical questions are raised by the rapid emergence of\nSNS as a dominant medium of interpersonal connection. For example, SNS\nlend new data to the existing philosophical debate (Tavani 2005; Moor\n2008) about whether classical ethical traditions such as\nutilitarianism, Kantian ethics or virtue ethics possess sufficient\nresources for illuminating the ethical implications of emerging\ninformation technologies, or whether we require a new ethical framework\nto handle such phenomena. One novel approach commonly employed to\nanalyze SNS (Light, McGrath and Gribble 2008; Skog 2011) is Philip\nBrey’s (2000) disclosive ethics. This\ninterdisciplinary ethical framework aims to analyze how particular\nmoral values are embedded in specific technologies, allowing\nfor the disclosure of otherwise opaque tendencies of a technology to\nshape moral practice. Ess (2006) has suggested that a new, pluralistic\n“global information ethics” may be the appropriate context\nfrom which to view emerging information technologies. Other scholars\nhave suggested that technologies such as SNS invite renewed attention\nto existing ethical approaches such as pragmatism (van den Eede 2010),\nvirtue ethics (Vallor 2010) feminist or care ethics (Hamington 2010;\nPuotinen 2011) that have often been neglected by applied ethicists in\nfavor of conventional utilitarian and deontological resources. \n\nA related metaethical project relevant to SNS is the development of\nan explicitly intercultural information ethics (Ess 2005a;\nCapurro 2008; Honglaradom and Britz 2010). SNS and other emerging\ninformation technologies do not reliably confine themselves to national\nor cultural boundaries, and this creates a particular challenge for\napplied ethicists. For example, SNS practices in different countries\nmust be analyzed against a conceptual background that recognizes and\naccommodates complex differences in moral norms and practices\nconcerning, for example, privacy (Capurro 2005; Hongladarom 2007).\nOther SNS phenomena that one might expect to benefit from intercultural\nanalysis and that are relevant to the ethical considerations outlined\nin Section 3 include: varied cultural patterns and preference/tolerance\nfor affective display, argument and debate, personal exposure,\nexpressions of political, interfamilial or cultural criticism,\nreligious expression and sharing of intellectual property.\nAlternatively, the very possibility of a coherent information ethics\nmay come under challenge, for example, from a constructivist view that\nemerging socio-technological practices like SNS continually\nredefine ethical norms—such that our analyses of SNS and\nrelated technologies are not only doomed to operate from shifting\nground, but from ground that is being shifted by the intended\nobject of our ethical analysis. \n\nFinally, there are pressing practical concerns about whether and how\nphilosophers can actually have an impact on the ethical profile of\nemerging technologies such as SNS. If philosophers direct their\nethical analyses only to other philosophers, then such analyses may\nfunction simply as ethical postmortems of human-technology relations,\nwith no opportunity to actually pre-empt, reform or redirect unethical\ntechnological practices. But to whom else can, or should, these\nethical concerns be directed: SNS users? Regulatory bodies and\npolitical institutions? SNS software developers? How can the\ntheoretical content and practical import of these analyses be made\naccessible to these varied audiences? What motivating force are they\nlikely to have? The profound urgency of such questions becomes\napparent once we recognize that unlike those ‘life or\ndeath’ ethical dilemmas with which applied ethicists are\nunderstandably often preoccupied (e.g., abortion, euthanasia and\ncapital punishment), emerging information technologies such as SNS\nhave in a very short time worked themselves into the daily moral\nfabric of virtually all of our lives, transforming the social\nlandscape and the moral habits and practices with which we\nnavigate it. The ethical concerns illuminated here are, in a very real\nsense, anything but ‘academic,’ and neither philosophers\nnor the broader human community can afford the luxury of treating them\nas such.","contact.mail":"svallor@ed.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ed.ac.uk"}]
