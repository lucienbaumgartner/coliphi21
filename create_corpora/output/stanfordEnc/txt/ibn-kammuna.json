Sa‘d ibn Mansur Ibn Kammuna, a Jew from Baghdad,\nactively participated in the lively discourse of his day. In his\ncopious writings he takes up the entire gamut of philosophical issues\ndiscussed by his contemporaries. Editions, translations and studies of\nworks by Ibn Kammuna and other thinkers of the time have appeared in\nrecent years. Nonetheless, it remains\ndifficult at this stage to contextualize Ibn Kammuna’s work, or to\ndecide wherein lies his most noteworthy contribution.\n\n\nNo topic so engaged Ibn Kammuna more than the study of the human soul,\nespecially its proper characterization and the proofs for its survival\nafter the death of the body. So, after first surveying Ibn Kammuna’s\nbiography, writings, and image, we will present Ibn Kammuna’s views on\nthe soul and its afterlife. Then we shall follow the thread of one\nconcept whose significance for the thought of the age has been firmly\nestablished, namely, hads [properly transcribed with a dot\nunder the “h”, and most usually translated as\n“intuition”], through his major writings. At the very\nleast, this shall afford us a glimpse at the way Ibn Kammuna handles a\nkey notion of psychology, epistemology, and the theory of prophecy, in\nvarious literary formats. Following that, we will present the\nfirst-ever survey of his religious ethics; the key texts have only\nrecently been published. Finally, we will have a look at some of the\nsophistries and paradoxes that are attributed to him.\n\n\n\nAll agree that the publication of editions of Ibn Kammuna’s writings\n(all of which are in Arabic) are a necessary first step in the study\nof his contribution. There is far less agreement as to how to assess\nthe worth of editions, as well as the need or lack thereof for redoing\neditions that are already available. Discussion of these and related\nissues are essential to our topic, and bear upon the proper\nunderstanding of Ibn Kammuna’s position on the issues of his day. With\nthis in mind, we will end with a short, critical discussion of some\neditions that have appeared, just before the bibliography.\n\n\n\nFew facts of Ibn Kammuna’s biography are confirmed (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 8–22, for most biographical details and bibliography). He is\npresumed to have been born in Baghdad and to have spent most of his\nlife there. However, there is good evidence that he spent some time in\nAleppo; his presence in that important intellectual center explains\ncertain facets of his activity that are otherwise difficult to account\nfor (Langermann 2007). He may have been descended from a family of\ncourtiers; he certainly had connections to some high officials, some of\nwhom were his patrons. Ibn Kammuna also corresponded with some leading\nintellectuals, notably Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Shortly before his death\nin 1284, Ibn Kammuna fled Baghdad for the nearby town of Hilla. This\nmove has long been thought to have been forced upon Ibn Kammuna by\nhostile reaction to one of his books. However, it has recently been\nsuggested that it is more likely to be connected to the execution of\none of his patrons. \n\nIbn Kammuna was certainly born into a Jewish family. Though his\nwritings as a rule do not betray his Judaism—if anything, they\nread like the work of a devout, if philosophically inclined,\nMuslim—his two forays into comparative religion exhibit a clear\nbias in favor of rabbinic Judaism. Some subtle polemics are detectable\nin glosses that he wrote to an important work of Islamic\ntheology. (This is discussed in the next section.) On the other hand,\nhis attraction to Sufi-style piety does not betray any influences of\nearlier Jewish ventures in the same direction, notably by the\ndescendants of Maimonides. But did he remain Jewish until his death?\nThe evidence from citations in later writers, who generally refer to\nhim as a Jew, would indicate so.  However, there are\ncounter-indications; one may also take note of numerous pious\nreferences to the Prophet in Ibn Kammuna’s writings, not all of which\ncan easily be ascribed to later scribes. The great bibliographer\nMoritz Steinschneider opined that Ibn Kammuna in fact converted; his\narguments were countered by some of the great pioneers of\nJudaeo-Arabic studies, notably D.H. Baneth. Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke, in their recent book-length study (2006), doubt the story\nof Ibn Kammuna’s conversion. \n\nThe latest studies on Ibn Kammuna have focused mainly on his\npsychology; his writings and doctrines in that field will be discussed\nbelow. Judging in terms of its impact on modern scholarship,\nespecially when one moves beyond the rather narrow confines of\nspecialists in late medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, as well\nits impact upon his own personal life, Ibn Kammuna’s Tanqih\n(Examination of the Three Faiths, English translation by\nPerlmann) is his most important work. The fundamental premise of the\ntreatise, and one that informs other of his writings as well, is that\nthere is a single theory of prophecy that is accepted by Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims alike, and which, moreover, meets the truth\nstandards of philosophy. What remains, then, is to compare the claims\nthat are particular to each of the three faiths. Though\nthe Examination should not be classified as a polemical work,\nas it contains no outright attack on any faith, its pro-Jewish bias is\nquite evident. Ibn Kammuna constructed the Jewish view he presents by\nmeans of a combination of ideas drawn from Maimonides and Judah\nHallevi. While this seems at first to be an odd mismatch of\nauthorities, Ibn Kammuna was not the only Jewish thinker to harmonize\nthe two eminent Andalusians. Christians and Muslims rejected the way\ntheir tenets were presented, and representatives of both penned\nrebuttals (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 106–113). On the other\nhand, no Jewish reaction of any sort to the Examination has\nreached us. It should be added that neither in the\nExamination, nor in any other work, does Ibn Kammuna make any\nunambiguous reference to Buddhism; given the political realities of\nMongol rule (the Mongols had not yet converted to Islam) as well as\nIbn Kammuna’s broad interests, one might have expected him to exhibit\nsome curiosity. \n\nIbn Kammuna wrote a much shorter treatise on the differences between\nthe two main Jewish groupings, Rabbinites and Karaites (English\ntranslation by Nemoy). Here again, despite the absence of any open\npolemics, it is clear that Ibn Kammuna’s sympathies lie with the\nRabbinic majority. \n\nIbn Kammuna’s most significant contribution to the history of\nphilosophy is his detailed commentary to Suhrawardi’s\nal-Talwihat.  (Several editions have appeared and are\ndiscussed in the last section of this entry). This is the first known\ncommentary to that work, which, though more Aristotelian than other\nwritings of Suhrawardi, still conveys essential points of the Ishraqi\nphilosophy. Directly through his commentary, and indirectly by means\nof his influence upon Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311), Ibn Kammuna\nwas very instrumental in the initial phases of the exposition and\ndiffusion of Suhrawardi’s thought. \n\nAl-Jadid fi ‘l-hikma (The New Wisdom); is a\ncomprehensive exposition of thirteenth century science and\nphilosophy. (For a preliminary study, see Langemann 2005; the titles\nof this book are discussed in the final sections below.)  Numerous\nmanuscript copies exist (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 87–92). Ibn\nKammuna experimented with different formats and especially different\nlengths in his philosophical writing. He adhered to the traditional\ntri-partite classification of logic, physics, and metaphysics, in a\nlengthy format (al-Jadid), a highly condensed version\n(Talkhis; see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 94, for\nbibliography, and an edition of the Arabic text, 196–206), and quite\nlikely a middle length version (Risala fi ‘l-hikma),\nwhose authenticity is still unresolved (Langermann 2005, 279–286). \n\nSimilarly, he has left us a medium length pietistic work (Kalimat\nwajiza) and a much shorter version of the same treatise\n(Ithbat al-mabda); but he also confides that he may expand\nupon the Kalimat wajiza (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n140). Even if that plan never came to fruition (no evidence of this\nlonger version has as yet turned up), it indicates his conviction that\nimportant topics ought to be discussed in all three formats, which\npresumably take into consideration the varying abilities of people to\ndevote time to study. The two extant pietistic texts are published\n(with no discussion of the contents) by Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 139–195. Langermann (2017) has published an annotated\ntranslation of the Ithbat. These are discussed further below,\nin the penultimate section. \n\nIbn Kammuna wrote glosses to an important work of Islamic theology,\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi’s al-Ma‘alim (Schmidtke & Pourjavady\n2007). In part this is a supercommentary, that is, a response to an\nearlier set of glosses prepared by his contemporary, Najm al-Din\nal-Katibi al-Qazwini (d. 1277). In some places Ibn Kammuna defends\nal-Razi against the strictures of al-Katibi al-Qazwini, but in others\nraises criticisms of his own against al-Razi. Some of the latter\nbetray upon close reading a subtle anti-Islamic polemic. For example,\nhis long gloss on the first query in chapter seven (Schmidtke &\nPourjavady 2007, 96–98) is a critique of the role of miracles in\nestablishing the prophetic mission. Ibn Kammuna names no prophets,\nconcentrating instead on the precise definition of mu‘jiza (the Arabic\nterm for miracle) given by al-Razi himself in other writings, which\ncontradicts his definition in this particular work; and further\narguing, again on theoretical grounds, that a tradition can be false\n(or at least contain some falsity) even if the transmitters are\nmany. However, in the query under scrutiny, al-Razi is speaking\nspecifically about Muhammad. Thus Ibn Kammuna’s critiques amount in\neffect to a rejection of the proofs for Muhammad’s prophetic\nmission. Later on, though, Ibn Kammuna makes specific criticisms of\nJudaism and Christianity (Schmidtke & Pourjavady 2007, 226). The\nglosses are written in a the highly technical language of Islamic\ntheology, which is very different from the philosophical diction he\nuses in other writings. Ibn Kammuna has clearly mastered both\nidioms.   \n\nSeveral paradoxes are associated with Ibn Kammuna, and these continue\nto exercise Iranian thinkers down to the present. These are discussed\nin the final section of this entry.  He has also left us some minor\nwritings and correspondence; some pieces of a medical writings have\nalso been recovered (see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006 for\nbibliography; medical fragments published, translated, and analyzed in\nLangermann 2007, 14–19). \n\nIbn Kammuna’s work in psychology attracted the interest of the great\npioneer in Islamic studies, Ignace Goldziher (1896), who devoted a\nshort study to Ibn Kammuna’s arguments for the soul’s\nimmortality. However, Ibn Kammuna’s main claim to fame in the\ntwentieth century was certainly his Examination, which was\nwidely hailed as the first dispassionate, scientific, non-polemical\ncomparative study of its sort.  Henri Corbin’s (1945) 2-volume work in\nFrench opened up the world of Suhrawardi and the Ishraqi philosophers\nfor western scholarship, and signaled Ibn Kammuna’s key role in the\ndiffusion of Suhrawardi’s thought. Nonetheless, we still have no clear\npicture of a distinctive Ibn Kammunian interpretation of Suhrawardi,\nif such a thing exists. His philosophy belongs to the elaboration,\nrefinement, and defense of the Avicennian tradition, led in his day by\nNasir al-Din al-Tusi, with whom he corresponded. On the other hand, he\nevidently accepted some of the criticisms leveled at Avicenna by\nAbu-l-Barakat al-Baghdadi and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Finally, the\npresent article hopes to add to his intellectual portrait the deep\npiety evident in his ethical treatises, which draw upon Jewish,\nIslamic, and non-denominational philosophic sources. The science of the soul (‘ilm al-nafs) is an important topic in all of Ibn\nKammuna’s philosophical treatises.  In addition, he wrote three\nmonographs, two of which aim to prove that the soul is eternal, and a\nthird which refutes the claim that the soul is nothing but the\ntemperament or mixture of the bodily humours, as well as the view that\nthe soul comes into being along with the body.  (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 100–106). His special interest in studying the soul\n(nafs) calls for explanation. Like so many other features of\nhis work, it can be understood only in the context of the Avicennan\nlegacy. Avicenna took his perception of his own self to be the most\ncertain piece of knowledge that he possessed. (It may be noted in\npassing that in Arabic, nafs means both “soul”\nand “self”; though Avicenna took care to be as precise as\npossible in his terminology, this double-entendre has an inevitable\npresence in Arabic psychological literature, especially in the wake of\nAvicenna). This approach is totally at odds with the Aristotelianism\nthat, in all of its flavors, was the foundation of Islamic\nphilosophies. Throughout his life Avicenna struggled with the complex\nof problems ensuing from his insight, especially in the realms of\npsychology and epistemology, without ever arriving at a satisfactory\nsolution. The conundrum reverberated in the work of the following\ngenerations.[1] \n\nIbn Kammuna took the Avicennan reformulation as his basic conception\nof the soul. In lengthier writings he would of course review the\nfaculties, properties, and so forth associated with the soul; but the\nfundamental notion was that of the individual’s self-awareness. For\nexample, in the introduction to his essay On the Immortality of\nthe Soul, he writes “The (word) soul is a designation of\nthe essence of the individual, to which one refers when one employs\nthe pronoun ‘I’ in saying ‘I have done thus and\nso’, ‘I have reached such and such’”\n[trans. Nemoy 1958, p. 86]. In his pietistic Brief words\n(Kalima wajiza, to be discussed at length later on in this\nessay), Ibn Kammuna complains that a full discussion of the soul’s\nproperties, mode of binding to the body, and so forth, would be\n“lengthy”; he is content to refers the reader “to\nbooks by those who have preceded [us]”. For his purposes,\n“the most important [point] that has been made, and the closest\nto comprehension…is that the soul is that to which each one\nrefers when saying ‘I’, as in ‘I perceived’,\n‘I did this’”…) (Schmidtke and Pourjavady 2007,\np. 151). \n\nNonetheless, Ibn Kammuna parted ways with Avicenna, and with the\nmainstream philosophical tradition, on the key issue of the soul’s\npre-existence. Avicenna denied that the soul existed before the human\nwas born, but Ibn Kammuna held that the soul’s pre-existence is\nintimately connected with its immateriality, and a doctrine that must\nbe accepted in order to prove the soul’s survival after the death of\nthe body. And, indeed, as Lukas Muehlethaler has shown in a series of\npublications, Ibn Kammuna labored to shore up the demonstrations of\npsychological doctrines throughout. In his commentary to Avicenna’s\nIsharat (“Pointers”), where the “Flying Man”\nthought experiment is displayed, Ibn Kammuna puts Avicenna’s verbal\nargument into syllogistic form. (Whether the syllogism is productive,\nand, in general, just how well Ibn Kammuna has succeeded in answering\nthe modern critics of Avicenna, remain open questions; see Muhlethaler\n2009 for full discussion). Ibn Kammuna boldly claims to have\nformulated the first demonstrative proof for the soul’s eternity a\nparte ante. Indeed, for Ibn Kammuna the soul is really an intellect (‘aql)\nthat is called “soul” when it is associated with a\nparticular body (Muehlethaler 2012). \n\nIbn Kammuna looms as a philosophical writer, a learned and keen\nstudent, who bequeathed to posterity not a “philosophy”\nbut rather a rich assortment of philosophical studies. Some, such as\nhis New Wisdom, aimed at a synthesis; others, like his\ncommentary to Suhrawardi, are primarily an essay in the interpretation\nof the thought of others; yet others, e.g., the monographs mentioned\nin the preceding section, address specific issues to whose resolution\nIbn Kammuna feels he can contribute. Scholarship on his output,\nhowever, has displayed less interest in literary form, intended\naudience, and specific objectives; instead, in keeping with an\nacademic tradition, it has focused by and large upon the\nidentification of his “sources”, even at the level of\nsentence by sentence, or phrase by phrase, analysis. This approach has\nreaped some important insights, for example, the combination of\nAvicennan and Suhrawardian statements in connection with the notion of\nexistence. \n\nOne drawback of this approach is the patchwork image it impresses upon\nthe modern student, as if Ibn Kammuna set out to prepare a quiltwork of\nphilosophical sources rather than to take a stand on the issues. But is\nthis the way his writings present themselves to the reader who is\ninnocent of academic scholarship? Ibn Kammuna is aware of the\nquestions that are under debate, and as a rule he formulates a clear\npoint of view.  Nonetheless, his views may well have changed over the\nyears—not at all surprising, if, as some think, he made the more\ntraumatic act of switching religious affiliation. It is in any event\nclear enough that his expressions, emphases, agreements and\ndisagreements, inclusions and exclusions, were in part functions of\nthe literary genre which he chose for any given work. He could be\ncritical in his commentaries, insofar as he would look closely at the\ntext he was explicating and cite alternative views, but he would not\nreject outright the views of the author whose work he was commenting\nupon. In his original writings he was freer to take a personal\nstand. \n\nIf we also keep in mind the nascent state of scholarship on the man\nand the period in which he flourished, the best course of action for\nthe present essay seems to be this.  We shall take one very central\nconcept, hads, most often translated “intuition”, and\nfollow it through Ibn Kammuna’s major works. (It will become clear\nthat in this context, intuition is a sui generis state, which, on the\nepistemological scale, falls between the discursive reasoning of very\nbright individuals and the gift of prophecy.) This will allow us to\nget a handle on a key feature of his philosophical thinking, as well\nas to observe the different ways the same concept is treated within\nthe different projects that Ibn Kammuna undertook. Note that we shall\nbe alert to the utilization of the concept, even if the\nterm hads does not appear in the text under scrutiny. \n\nStrictly speaking, hads is the revelation—some would add\ninstantaneously—of the middle term of the syllogism, leading to\nan infallible conclusion. In practice, though, it had much wider\napplication and less precise definition. Rare indeed is the case,\nwhen hads is cited as the source of knowledge, that the\nwriter will display the full syllogism and specify the middle term\n(see Langermann 2005, 286–302, and Gutas 2001). In effect, it is of\nthe same species as the “revelations” by which Avicenna\nlearned of his own existence (and indeed the great bulk of his\neducation) and, like that Avicennan moment, it shifted epistemology in\nthe direction of a reliance upon a person’s sense of security in his\npersonal illuminations . In the work of later thinkers, including Ibn\nKammuna, the evaluation of hads served to legitimize alchemy and\nastrology and, more generally, to blur the distinction between\ndemonstrative knowledge and revelation. \n\nHads was not just one more function to be added to the basket\nof terminologies used to explain psychological processes. Two\napplications in particular must be singled out. First of all,\nhads offered an analogy to prophecy; no other phenomenon from\nthe world of humans, extraordinary as it may be, seemed as close to\nprophetic revelation. Second, it offered a way to account for great\nscientific acumen. Prophecy, scientific discovery, and intuition in\ngeneral all lead those who experience them to certain knowledge\nin a moment of\nrevelation, in general, knowledge that had not been available before. \n\nEarlier attempts to explain the phenomenon of prophecy in terms of the then-accepted workings of the human psyche, for example, that of\nMaimonides, found analogous or proto-prophetic symptoms in two types\nof human inspiration. The first of these includes veridical dreams,\ndivination, and other cases in which the unknown is revealed. The\nsecond comprises instances where people spontaneously perform acts of\nbravery, leadership, or literary creativity, and thus act in a manner\nthat appears to be above the ordinary. These ideas were helpful in\ndeveloping a political theory of prophecy; the prophet, like the\nphilosopher-king, is a visionary, gifted with bold leadership as well\nas the ability to impose a code of behavior upon his people. The main\ndifference is that the code of the prophet is expressly not of his own\ndevise, but rather revealed by some supernal source. On the whole, Ibn\nKammuna downplays the political function of prophecy. The prophet does\nhave an important role to play in organizing and ordering society.\nHowever, the thrust of Ibn Kammuna’s analysis emphasizes the\nepistemological advantages of the prophet rather than his political\nskill. Moreover, as political leader, he is charged with inculcating\ncorrect religious belief; Ibn Kammuna sharply distinguishes between\nthe prophet on the one hand, and rulers of jahiliyya\n(uncultured, lacking a proper revealed code) cities on the other. \n\nThe prophet’s distinction from others is to be explained in\npsychological terms by the perfection of his hads. In\ndeveloping this theme, Ibn Kammuna makes the bold claim that\nhads is the ultimate basis of all human knowledge. All\nknowledge that is acquired is either a direct intuition, acquired by\nsomeone suitably equipped, or instruction in items of knowledge that\nhas been acquired by someone else by intuition: \n\nHumans exhibit the full range of endowments, from the dull witted who\nnever intuit, to those who are able to satisfy all or nearly all of\ntheir quests by means of intuition. The variation is seen both in the\nquantity of percepts that are obtained intuitively as well as in the\nspeed of intuitive act. (Nonetheless, it should be added that Ibn\nKammuna places the limit at “the quickest and shortest\ninstant”; unlike Ibn Sina, for example, he does not claim here\nthat intuition takes no time at all.) It is certainly possible that,\nat the upper bounds of human capacity, one may find an individual\nblessed with “an intense purity and an intense connection to the\nsupernal sources” such that he can intuit all or most of what\nhumans are capable of knowing, “not by means of an uncertain\ntradition, but by means of middle terms and demonstrative\nproofs.” Hads accounts not only for the quickness and\nindependence of the prophet’s knowledge, but for its certainty as\nwell. It meets the requirements of formal logic, since it supplies the\nmiddle term of the syllogism, and hence is demonstrative. \n\nWe examine first the theoretical discussions (following Langermann\n2005, 286–302). In the chapter dealing with demonstration\n(burhan), Ibn Kammuna lists the seven types of judgment\n(hukm) by means of which one asserts or verifies\n(tasdiq) premises that are to be employed in a syllogism.\nHadsiyyāt, intuitive judgments, are the last on the list,\nand Ibn Kammuna defines them simply as “what the soul judges\nto be certain on the basis of evidence (qara’in) other\nthan that found in the [six] sources (mabadi’) that have\nbeen mentioned above” (al-Kabisi 1982, 196; author’s\ntranslation). Ibn Sina does not include hadsiyyāt in his\nclassification of premises; Suhrawardī does include\nhadsiyyāt in two of his lists, but neither is identical\nto the one found in al-Jadīd. Despite all of these\ndevelopments, however, Ibn Kammuna supplies here exactly the same\ntime-worn example used by Ibn Sina (and before him by Aristotle), i.e.,\nthe fact that the moon’s light derives from the sun. \n\nIn a later section of The New Wisdom Ibn Kammuna reproduces\nalmost word-for-word the final definition of hads given by Ibn\nSina in his Pointers (al-Isharat), one of his later\nwritings. He begins by noting that progress from first intelligibles to\nsecondary ones can be either by means of fikr (cogitation or\nreflection) or by hads, “in that the middle term\npresents itself to the mind all at once, either as the result of a\nsearch and desire [shawq] for it, without any [corresponding]\nmotion [of the soul], or without any impulse [ishtiyaq] or\nmotion.” Ibn Kammuna continues, “Along with it, the\nobject of the search [i.e. the conclusion of the syllogism] and that\nwhich it entails present themselves. There is no difference between\nreflection and intuition, other than the presence of motion in\nreflection and its absence in intuition” [ed. 441]. \n\nIt is not difficult to find numerous examples of the application of\nhads in The New Wisdom; it has much harder to see how\nhads is to be integrated consistently into a comprehensive\nscientific program. Here follow some items of knowledge that are said\nto derive from hads. Hads indicates to astronomers,\neven where logical necessity does not, that the planets require more\nthan one orb in order to complete their motions [ed. 402]. In the life\nsciences, we know by means of hads that irrational animals\ncarry out their biological functions unconsciously [ed. 424]. As for\nmetaphysics and psychology, we conclude by means of hads that\nintellect is more perfect than soul [ed. 517], and that bodies (or\ntheir species) are but shadows of spiritual entities [ed. 522].\nHads and repeated experience (tajriba) together\nindicate that the body is the only impediment to the soul’s conjunction\nwith the pure forms [ed. 492]. \n\nThe last example is particularly important because it illustrates\nthe intimate connection between hads and tajriba, a\nconnection maintained by Ibn Kammuna (and others) throughout.\nTajriba is the most usual justification for the knowledge\nclaimed by astrologers and alchemists. Hence both hads and\ntajriba aim to function as sources for hidden knowledge within\nscientific systems that are based upon (ultimately) Aristotelian logic.\nAlthough it is repeatedly invoked as the source for scientific\nknowledge, hads is not a tool of scientific inquiry, but\nrather a way of explaining, post facto, how a thinker hit upon\nthe solution to a difficult problem. As such its function in science is\nvery much the same as its function in explaining religious inspiration\nand prophecy. \n\nThe Ishraqi philosophy of which Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi (d. 1191)\nis considered the founder, has intuition as the basis of its\nepistemology, at least in\n theory.[2]\nIllumination (ishraq in Arabic), in a\nword, describes the event, which many speakers of English would also\ncall intuition, which yields knowledge swiftly and certainly. Intuition\nplays a major role in al-Talwihat, which is considered to be\none of Suhrawardi’s more peripatetic writings. It is not surprising,\nthen, that Ibn Kammuna frequently mentions intuition in his commentary\nto al-Talwihat. It should be borne in mind, though, that true\nto his role as commentator, Ibn Kammuna will as a rule try to flesh out\nand expand upon Suhrawardi’s intentions, rather than expressly\ndeveloping his own ideas. \n\nWe shall limit ourselves here to a few examples drawn from the partial\nedition of this commentary published by H. Ziai and A. Alwishah, which\ncovers part two of al-Talwihat and whose subject is natural\nscience or physics. Ibn Kammuna describes in one place quotes\napprovingly Suhrawardi’s account of how greatly people differ in this\nrespect: “People differ with regard to\nhads. There are the doltish, who have never had any success\nin thinking; and there are those with powerful hads. Many of\nthe latter exceed others in quantity and quality; but there is no\nlimit, at which one must perforce stop. It is possible for there to be\nsomeone who perceives by means of hads most of the\nintelligibles in a short time and without a teacher; and there is a\n[type of] soul called ‘holy’ whose capacity is as powerful\nas that of the prophets” (Ziai & Alwishah 2003, 456). \n\nOther passages afford us an opportunity to sample how hads\nis employed in various scientific, or, as we would judge today, occult\ncontexts. In laying forth an account of some twelve phenomena,\nincluding various optical effects in the atmosphere, thunder,\nlightning, and comets, all of which are produced by “vapors”\noriginating in the earth (much as Aristotle had argued in his\nMeteorology), Ibn Kammuna adds that, conjoined to those\ncauses, hads judges that there must be “spiritual\nforces” that are due to celestial configurations (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 254). Animals other than man have a rational soul; this\nties in to the question of metemsomatosis. The reasoning will be\nevident to someone who employs\nhads, but not to someone who either willfully shuts off\nhads, or was simply not born with that gift (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 346–7). \n\nThis treatise is concise in length but encyclopedic in character. (See\nthe edition by Musawi 2003; see also Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n92–3.)  It is divided into seven sections. Here as always logic\nis the first topic to be discussed, but hads is not mentioned\nat all in the section on logic. It does however figure in the seventh\nand final section, which deals with psychology. In line with some\ntrends of the time, Ibn Kammuna here ranks “the science of the\nsoul” as the most sublime of the sciences, because the human\nsoul is analogous to the deity. \n\nThe fifth “query” of the final section focuses upon the\ncognitive capacities of the human soul. These vary from person to\nperson, just as bodily endowments vary. However, at the high end of\nthe spectrum, there exists a human soul whose cognitive ability is for\nall practical purposes unlimited. At this level, human cognition is a\n“taste” of the divine. Ibn Kammuna explains: \n\nHere as elsewhere, hads is paired to tajriba\n(“experience”) and is described as an innate gift. Here,\nhowever, Ibn Kammuna adds adds an important point. Those who did not\nreceive the gift of hads at birth can get a taste of the\ndivine if they cultivate the Sufi methods of isolation, mediation,\nmusic and prayer. \n\nThe Arabic originals of these two intimately related treatises were\npublished for the first time by Pourjavady & Schmidtke (2006); an\nannotated translation of the Ithbat was published by\nLangermann (2017).  In these writings, Ibn Kammuna pays far less\nattention to questions of cognition than he does in his other\nwritings. However, here as elsewhere, he takes note of the abilities\nof gifted people to grasp issues that remain recalcitrant to others\nwho are not so endowed. Here again Ibn Kammuna connects this special\nmode of cognition with tajriba, repeated experience. In\naddition, he emphasizes here that the fruits of this special type of\nknowledge can be fully appreciated only by someone who has experienced\nthem. It is thus striking that he does not employ the technical\nterm hads in the course of his exposition, or, indeed,\nanywhere at all in these two writings. \n\nConsider this passage from the Kalimat (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 158, author’s translation): “If, however, a\nweakening of the bodily impediments were to be joined to the strength\nof the soul, whether this [strength] be original [asli, here\nmeaning ‘inborn’] or acquired, the way the soul is\nstrengthened by practice or the training that is associated with\n‘those who know’ [i.e., the Sufis], then the bond is made\nfirm in such a way that the soul will attain many hidden things,\ncopious items of knowledge, and illuminative pleasures, whose true\nnature can be apprehended only by someone who has found them\nhimself.” A few lines down tajriba is mentioned:\n“Many wonderful things of the souls are known by means of\nrepeated experiences (tajarib), repetition, and some form of\nreasoning (qiyas).” \n\nTajriba does appear in the passage just cited, but it is not\nmentioned at all in the shorter pietistic treatise, Ithbat\nal-mabda (Establishing the First Principle). On the\nother hand, Ibn Kammuna does employ in the shorter work several\ncognate terms to describe the person who can grasp a certain fact\nimmediately and without the need for lengthy demonstration: dhihn\nsalim (“healthy mind,” Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 188), dhu fitana (“clever,” Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 189), dhu lubb\n(“understanding,” Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n189). \n\nThe terminological conundrum intensifies when we bring into the\ndiscussion another term, dhawq, literally “taste”.\nDhawq is a Sufi term and refers to a usually fleeting, intense\nreligious experience, which leaves the adept knowing something more\nthan he knew beforehand. Viewed as a phenomenon of the human mind, it\nis essentially the same thing as intuition. It is used in exactly this\nsense by Ibn Sīnā—significantly, in the monograph on\nthe rational soul considered to be his very last\n work.[3]\nSuhrawardī adopted the term\nfor his version of knowledge based upon intuition, hikma\ndhawqiyya; in Ibn Kammuna’s New Wisdom, hads and\ndhawq are synonymous (Langermann 2005, 300). Yet in the\npietistic writings, where one would expect to find the usual Sufi term,\ndhawq is not employed. \n\nThere is little difference between the ideas expressed in these two\ntreatises and those in the other writings. In all cases the basic\nthought is that some people are born with an innate ability to swiftly\narrive at conclusions that are certainly true. There remains the technical\ndistinction, in that hads, and hads specifically, is\nsaid to disclose the middle term of the syllogism. However, one should\nnot make too much of this. For one matter, even in cases\nwhere hads is invoked, we rarely if ever can determine just\nwhat the syllogism is for which hads has revealed the middle\nterm. One important exception is the reasoning that leads to the\nmomentous conclusions drawn from the “Flying Man”\nexperiment (see Muehlethaler 2009). Moreover, whether or\nnot hads is specifically mentioned, intuition or spontaneous\ncomprehension is paired to tajriba. \n\nThe chronology of Ibn Kammuna’s writings will not solve the problem\neither. The Kalimat seems to have been written well after Ibn\nKammuna had already been exposed to the writings of Ibn Sina and\nSuhrawardi, both of whom make much of hads, as we have seen\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 8–12). We are thus confronted here\nwith the historiographical and methodological question of the weight\nto be given to technical terms as opposed to ideas, a question that\nthe present writer opts to leave open. \n\nIbn Kammuna’s writings as a rule deal exclusively with speculative\nmatters. Two recently published treatises, however, give equal weight\nto praxis, in line with the pairing of ‘ilm and\n’amal (knowledge and practice) that appears in the title of\nthe longer work; this pairing was widespread among Sufis but by no\nmeans limited to them alone. Ibn Kammuna usually identifies the reader\nof these tracts as an ‘aqil, literally someone who employs\nhis intellect; this too is quite common. Other expressions he uses to\ndescribe his audience are “seeker of perfection” and\n“seeker of salvation (najat) and perfection.” \n\nThe speculative philosophy expressed in these writings is in keeping\nwith the views that Ibn Kammuna expresses elsewhere. However, he has\nin mind here a very particular type of ‘ilm;\n“true” ‘ilm is not, as he tells us, what people\ngenerally think. Rather, it is self-knowledge: knowledge of one’s own\nshortcomings, and of one’s obligations to worship God. Knowledge of\nthis sort is goal directed; it serves to weaken one’s\nconnections or involvement in this world, and to produce a concomitant\nintensification of one’s inclination towards the other world. The\nsections on\n’amal, which urge an ethical program steeped in piety, reveal\na side to Ibn Kammuna that has not been mentioned, let alone\nadequately explored, in the scholarly literature to date. The\nfollowing paragraphs are an attempt to bring to the fore some salient\npoints. We shall offer some suggestions towards contextualization,\nwhich are necessarily tentative and preliminary. \n\nThe tension-free concord between reasoned, independently verifiable\nknowledge and knowledge based on revelation and tradition (science and\nfaith, to put it more simply) manifest in these writings is noteworthy.\nIbn Kammuna raises none of the ostensible contradictions that so\ntroubled Ibn Sina, al-Ghazali, and Maimonides. A series of generally\nfacile arguments are given for the existence of God and his attributes.\nIn general, the conception of the deity is informed more by His\ngoodness and bounty than it is by His power and judgment. \n\nConsistent with the concerns so prominent in his other writings, Ibn\nKammuna devotes a great deal of space (half of part one of the Kalimat, which deals with ‘ilm, whose meaning in\nthis text has been described two paragraphs above) to the human soul\n(nafs; the meaning of this term in this text has been given\nabove, section II), its quasi-divine nature, and its survival after\ndeath. His discourse on these issues is philosophical. In the second\npart of this treatise, however, Ibn Kammuna shifts to a Sufi mode of\nexposition. In keeping with Sufi notions, he emphasizes the key,\ncritical role of the qalb, literally “heart”, as\nthe epicenter of human goodness. However, he does not adopt the very\ncommon Sufi opposition of nafs, “soul”, to\nqalb, where the former stands for passions and bad moral\ntraits. Instead, he defines qalb as “the eye of\nnafs. (”Eye“ in this context has much the same\nmeaning as it has in the English phrase, ”the eye of the\nstorm“).” \n\nBoth treatises display a thorough integration of religious and\nphilosophical ideas and ideals. As Ibn Kammuna writes at the beginning\nof the Kalimat: “The masters of traditional religions\nand of intellectual tenets agree that salvation and eternal felicity\ndepend upon belief in God, the end of days, and doing good\nworks” (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 142). Elsewhere Ibn\nKammuna speaks of “the people of wisdom and revelation.”\nThe values and ideas expounded in these two works look to represent a\nconsensus that has been reached by these two groups, who, in different\ncircumstances, were thought to be very much at odds with one\nanother. We cannot say as yet how widespread this concordance was as a\nsocial phenomenon. In any event, it was shattered a century later by\nIbn Taymiyya and his followers, who assaulted the\n“foreign” sciences from different angles. \n\n’Amal is definitely subordinate to ‘ilm; in this\nsense, the pietistic treatises continue the strong scientific\norientation evident in all of Ibn Kammuna’s writings. However, praxis\nis by no means a concession to the low intellectual level of the\nmasses, as it is often thought to be in “political”\nconceptions of religion; nor is it merely a device to restrain bodily\ndrives. Praxis and science reinforce each other in a specific way:\n“From the states of the limbs, lights ascend forth to the\nqalb, just as from the gnoses (ma‘arif) of the\nqalb, lights descend to the limbs. This is the secret of the\nelevation of souls by means of bodily devotions” (Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 161). There is thus a distinct and immediate\nspiritual reward for praxis, even for—perhaps especially\nfor—the enlightened. \n\nThe Kalimat is dedicated to a Muslim patron, and it easily\nand naturally reads as a work of Muslim piety. However, on close\ninspection, there is nothing distinctly Muslim about it. Ibn Kammuna\nis driven by the same idea of spirituality and religiosity common to\nMuslims, Jews, Christians, or non-denominational philosophic theists\nof the type described by Judah Hallevi in his Kuzari, a book that Ibn\nKammuna studied closely. It is striking that the only Qur’anic verse\ncited, from the fifty-seventh sura (“Iron”, verse\n3) has, at least for its first part (“He is the first and the\nlast…”), an exact parallel in both the Hebrew and\nChristian bibles. \n\nJust how much Jewish ethics, biblical, rabbinic, and medieval, Ibn\nKammuna has included is difficult to determine. Jewish and Islamic\nethics have been intertwined all along; by the thirteenth century, some\nrabbinic ideas had become thoroughly islamicized on the one hand, and,\non the other, Jewish versions of Sufism were well-established. Jews\ncited snippets of the Qur’an as apothegms of universal wisdom, rather\nthan as the scripture of a particular faith\n community.[4] So\nwhen Ibn Kammuna says that “The beginning (ra’s,\ncf. Hebrew reishit) of wisdom is fear of God,” is he\nconsciously importing the verse from Psalms 111:10? Overall, Ibn\nKammuna appears to have formulated an original “Abrahamic”\nphilosophical piety. Both the philosophical foundations underpinnings\n(concepts of the deity and of humanity) as well as the moral values\nand spiritual exercises, were carefully crafted so as to be acceptable\nto all monotheists . \n\n A number of “problems” (shubuhat; the Arabic\nrefers to all forms of obscurities, including what we call paradoxes\nand sophistries) are attributed to Ibn Kammuna. These have challenged\nIranian philosophers in particular from the sixteenth century onwards\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 37–51). Some but not all can be\ntraced to known writings of Ibn Kammuna. One of these is the famous\nliar paradox, which Ibn Kammuna discusses in The New Wisdom;\nsome later figures mistakenly thought that Ibn Kammuna had invented\nit. Another, much discussed item is “the problem of unity”\n(shubhat al-tawhid). Especially since Ibn Sina, the deity was\nwidely identified with wajib al-wujud, “that whose\nexistence is necessary”; but, as a philosophical category, is\n“necessary existence” necessarily unique?  Muslim and\nJewish thinkers would certainly want it to be so, but proving this\npoint was no simple matter. At one place Ibn Kammuna argues from the\ninterconnectedness of all reality, which implies that a single\n“necessary existence” must stand at the top of the causal\nchain.  He may have picked this up from Maimonides who noted in his\nGuide of the Perplexed (Part I, Ch. 72) that the unity of\nreality is an important indication for the unity of God. Elsewhere,\nhowever, he chose a more torturous route. Were there more than one\n“necessary existence”, then, rather than being a unique\nessential characteristic, “necessary existence” would\nperforce be demoted to the rank of an accident shared by two or more\nbeings. It was this proposal that was debated and criticized by later\nthinkers. \n\nAnother “problem” is a sophistry that ties in with some\nrecondite issues in logic that exercised Ibn Kammuna and his\ncontemporaries, especially conversion by contraposition (Langermann\n2007, 11–13). It appears that Ibn Kammuna tried to manipulate the\nsimple observation that creation (huduth al-‘alam) is not\ncounterfactual, that is to say, it does not require one to deny\nimmediate reality (al-waqi’, reality or actuality as it\npresents itself here and now), into a formal proof: creation does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality; whatever does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality is immediately real; ergo,\nthe creation of the world is immediately real. \n\nIbn Kammuna communicated this “proof” to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who\nproceeded to uncover its\n fallacies.[5]\nFor example, the contraposed major premise,\n“whatever does not necessitate the denial of immediate reality is\nimmediately real,” when written in its positive formulation, requires a\nrider: “Whatever is absent from immediate reality (ghayr\nwaqi’, grammatically a positive sentence in Arabic) necessitates\nthe negation of immediate reality, as long as it remains absent from\nimmediate reality.” The rider, however, makes the premise hypothetical,\nand that, in turn, changes the rules as far as conversion is concerned,\nand does not allow the conclusion Ibn Kammuna wishes to draw. \n\nOnly a very small portion of the commentary to\nSuhrawardi’s Talwihat was published by Ziai and Alwishah. Now\ntwo editions of the full text have been prepared: a three volume\ndoctoral dissertation by Sayyid H.S. Musawi (Tehran University, 1385\nSolar, 1996/1997) and a three volume publication by N. Habibi (Tehran\n1387 Solar, 2008/2009.) Joep Lameer scoured all three editions and\npublished a thirty page review (2012). He concludes that we are still\nin need of a reliable edition. \n\nThese are welcome developments, to be sure, but there is cause for\nfurther reflection. In particular, the arguments advanced by Ibn\nKammuna have as a rule not been taken into account by the editors, who\nmust decide between variants in the manuscripts, or by the critics who\nreview the editions. Simply taking note of variants missed by one or\nmore editor, even if these seem to be significant, is not enough; we\nwould like to see a discussion of sample passages, with full analysis\nof the implications of the different readings. At times there is no\ngrammatical, syntactical, or lexical reason a priori to choose one\nvariant over the other. Without fully understanding the passage in\nquestion, errors may ensue; an example of this given by Langermann\n2009, p. 282. Earlier editions must not be dismissed as worthless\nunless one can provide examples to prove such an extreme\nclaim. Moreover, changing the title of a book in mid-course without\nany justification (all agree, for example, that Ibn Kammuna himself\ngave no title to the work commonly referred to as the New\nWisdom) introduces confusion with no compensatory payoff.
