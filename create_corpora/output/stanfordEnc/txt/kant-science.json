It is of interest to\ncontemporary philosophers of science primarily because of the way in\nwhich Kant attempts to articulate a philosophical framework that\nplaces substantive conditions on our scientific knowledge of the world\nwhile still respecting the autonomy and diverse claims of particular\nsciences. More specifically, Kant develops a philosophy of science\nthat departs from (i) broadly empiricist views — such as David\nLewis's, according to which purely contingent events in space and time\n(along with considerations of simplicity, etc.) determine what the\nlaws of nature ultimately are — and (ii) certain necessitarian\nviews — such as David Armstrong's, according to which the laws\nof nature consist of necessitation relations between universals, which\nplace constraints on what events occur in space and time. Kant does so\nby holding that (i) scientific laws do involve necessity, but that\n(ii) this necessity is based not on (purely metaphysical and hence\ninaccessible) relations between universals, but rather on certain\nsubjective, a priori conditions under which we can experience objects\nin space and time.\n\n\n\nKant's scientific writings are also of interest to historians of\nmodern philosophy, historians of science, and historians of philosophy\nof science. Historians of modern philosophy are especially interested\nin determining how Kant's views on science might complement or clarify\nhis distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines (e.g., as\nexpressed in the Critique of Pure Reason). Historians of\nscience reflect on the way in which Kant's position fits in with the\nviews of other natural philosophers of the period, such as Newton and\nLeibniz, including his novel account of the formation of the solar\nsystem according to Newtonian principles. Historians of philosophy of\nscience investigate, among other things, Kant's work in the conceptual\nfoundations of physics — in particular, his matter theory (e.g.,\nthe infinite divisibility of matter, attractive and repulsive forces,\ninertia, atoms and the void), his theory of motion, and his dynamical\naccount of the laws of mechanics.\n\n\n\nBecause physics was Kant's primary (though not exclusive) focus over\nthe course of his lengthy career, his views on physics during his\npre-Critical (1746-1770), Critical (1781-1790), and Post-Critical\nperiods (after 1790) will be discussed in separate sections.\nSubsections will be devoted to each of the chapters of Kant's most\ninfluential work in philosophy of science, the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786). Kant's basic positions on\nother sciences, including psychology, chemistry, and history, will be\npresented thereafter.\n\n\n\nKant's early pre-Critical publications (1746-1756) are devoted\nprimarily to solving a variety of broadly cosmological problems and to\ndeveloping an increasingly comprehensive metaphysics that would\naccount for the matter theory that is required by the solutions to\nthese problems. Kant's first publication, Thoughts on the True\nEstimation of Living Forces (1746), explicitly attempts to solve\nthe vis viva controversy, which had been hotly contested ever\nsince Leibniz's attack on Descartes' laws of motion in the Acta\nEruditorum in 1686. While Kant attempts to occupy an intermediary\nposition between the Cartesian and Leibnizian positions by maintaining\nthat both mv and mv² could be conserved in\ndifferent contexts, what is of particular note is how his solution in\nParts II and III rests on the conception of force developed in Part\nI. According to this conception, force is understood in terms of the\nactivity of substances, an activity that Kant then uses to explain how\nthe motions of bodies are generated, to solve the mind-body problem,\nand to account for both the possibility of other, actually existing\nworlds and the three-dimensionality of space.  \nHis solution to the vis viva dispute is especially\ninteresting, because it presages his later approach to philosophical\ncontroversy. Rather than offering a conclusive argument in favor of\none position, Kant seeks to mediate between the two parties,\nLeibnizian and Cartesian. He argues that each measure of force is\ncorrect, but in different contexts. Kant distinguishes two ways of\nstudying bodies, “mathematical” and “metaphysical,” and claims that\nthey presuppose distinct conceptions of body. According to\nmathematical mechanics, a body cannot accelerate unless an external\ncause acts on it; for that reason, Kant declares, the Cartesians'\nquantity mv is the only one appropriate measure of force\nin this context. “Natural bodies,” in contrast, have features that\nmathematics brackets. One such feature is a capacity for\n“vivification,” whereby a body increases by itself the force of motion\nthat an external cause merely “awakens.” In light of that, Kant\nconcludes, the Leibnizian quantity mv2 is the\ncorrect measure of force in metaphysical considerations of “natural\nbodies” (1:140f).\n\n \n\nKant develops his account of the nature of substance in greater detail\nin A New Elucidation of the First Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition (1755). While the first two sections of\nthis work undertake revisions of Wolff's principles of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason, the third section argues for\ntwo substantive principles that are alleged to follow from the\nprinciple of sufficient (or rather, following Crusius, determining)\nreason, namely the principles of succession and coexistence. The main\nthrust of the principle of succession is directed against Leibnizian\npre-established harmony, arguing that only causal connections\nbetween substances can bring about changes in their states.\nKant's position appears to be designed to account primarily for\nchanges of bodily states (with changes in mental states being\nparasitic upon them, as was explicitly asserted in the True\nEstimation). For he maintains that mutual changes of\nstate require mutual interaction, where it is clear that\nchanges in motion are precisely the kind of mutual change that he has\nin mind (since one body cannot move closer to another without the\nother body moving closer to it). The principle of coexistence then\nargues that harmonious causal interaction between otherwise isolated,\nindependently existing substances is possible only by means of God's\ncoordination (just as Leibniz thought was required for harmonious\nrelations between the states of such substances). \n\nKant's Physical Monadology (1756) takes as its task the\nreconciliation of the infinite divisibility of space, as maintained in\ngeometry, with the simplicity of substances, which Kant believes is\nrequired in metaphysics. As was the case with his earlier works, the\nessential feature of his reconciliation lies in the way in which his\nmatter theory is supported by his metaphysical views. Specifically,\nKant asserts that simple substances fill space not by means of their\nmere existence, but rather in virtue of their spheres of activity. As\na result, any division of the relevant spheres of activity does not\ncompromise the simplicity of the substances themselves, since the\nspatial properties of substances (including the infinite divisibility\nof space) arise from the interaction between their activities rather\nthan from their intrinsic features. In the course of the Physical\nMonadology, Kant also argues for the necessity of attractive and\nrepulsive forces and attributes a significant role to the force of\ninertia. Kant's acceptance of such Newtonian principles represents an\nimportant change of position over the True Estimation, where\nKant rejects the principle of inertia and pursues a dynamical theory\nmuch more in line with Leibniz's views. \n\nIn addition to these works, which bridge the gap, as it were, between\nphysics and metaphysics, during this period Kant is interested in a\nseries of specific issues in cosmology and empirical physics. For\nexample, Kant writes several short exclusively scientific essays\nbetween 1754 to 1757, including “Brief Outline of Certain Meditations\non Fire,” “Investigation of the question of whether the Earth has\nsuffered changes in its axial Rotation,” “The Question of the Aging of\nthe Earth, considered physically” as well as three papers on\nearthquakes. Of much greater significance is his Universal Natural\nHistory and Theory of the Heavens (1755), which represents an\nimportant contribution to science as such. For in it Kant explains how\none can account for the formation of the solar system from an initial\nstate, in which matter is dispersed like a cloud, solely by means of\nthe interaction of attractive and repulsive forces. In 1796, Laplace,\nunaware of Kant's argument, would develop a very similar derivation,\nwith the result that the view is now typically referred to as the\nKant-Laplace nebular hypothesis. \n\nSome of Kant's youthful insights have yielded long-lasting\ncontributions to scientific knowledge. His intuition that tides slow\ndown the Earth's rotation over time is correct. In his New Remarks\ntoward an Elucidation of the theory of Winds, Kant correctly\nexplained that North-South winds in our hemisphere suffer a Coriolis\ndeflection due to the Earth's rotation. Moreover, broadly Kantian\naccounts of planetary formation have been the dominant model since the\nemergence of sophisticated nebular models in the 1970s (see, e.g.,\nSafronov 1972 and Prentice 1978). \n\nLater in his pre-Critical period (1763-1770), Kant attempts to build a\ncomprehensive metaphysical account on the basis of the framework that\nhe had established in his first works. Thus, in his The Only\nPossible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763)\nhe attempts to extend his reasoning to fundamental issues in both\nphilosophical theology and teleology, presenting, for the first time,\nhis now famous criticisms of the three traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God, while developing a new theistic proof, based on the\nidea that God is necessary as a real ground of the possibilities of\nthings. After reading Hume's Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding in German translation sometime after 1755, Kant\ndistinguishes between real and logical grounds/opposition in his\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763) to avoid Hume's objection that there is no\nlogical contradiction in the existence of one thing not following the\nexistence of another. But in this work he is also interested in\nexploring the notion of a real ground/opposition further by applying\nit more widely, e.g., to bodies, mental states, etc. Also relevant is\nKant's Concerning the Ultimate Foundation of the Distinction of\nthe Directions in Space (1768) which modifies his earlier account\nof space insofar as he seems to hold that certain spatial properties\n— viz., chirality, or handedness — may not be able to be\nexplained entirely in terms of direct relations between material\nsubstances. In his so-called Inaugural Dissertation (1770),\nKant continues to develop a more comprehensive philosophical system,\nwhich would encompass the principles of both the sensible and the\nintelligible world, and in so doing modifies his account of space and\ntime even further. Over the course of the next ten years, during which\nhe published almost nothing, Kant would revise his views more\nsystematically, with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 representing the first major step in his\n“critical turn.” \n\nAdickes (1924), Harman (1982), Friedman (1992), Laywine (1993),\nSchönfeld (2000), Kuehn (2001), Lefevre & Wunderlich (2000),\nand Watkins (1997, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2013) have emphasized the\nimportance of scientific issues in the development of Kant's thought\nduring his pre-Critical period, as he reacted to Leibniz, Newton and\nother, more immediate predecessors (such as Christian Wolff, Christian\nAugust Crusius, Leonard Euler, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, and\nMartin Knutzen). Smith (2013) reconstructs Kant's picture of matter in\nthe Physical Monadology.  \n\nThough Kant discusses issues relevant to physics in various works\nthroughout the Critical period (esp. the Critique of Pure\nReason), his views on this topic are developed most explicitly in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), which\nconsists of a preface and four chapters. \n\nIn the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations Kant (i)\nanalyzes the concepts of nature and science so as to establish what\nconditions must be met for a body of knowledge to constitute natural\nscience in the proper sense, (ii) explains why science so understood\nrequires “a pure part” (4:469) and what criteria would have to be\nsatisfied for such a pure part to exist, (iii) argues that chemistry\nand psychology cannot at present meet these criteria, and (iv)\ndescribes what procedure should be followed to satisfy these criteria\nand thus to provide the “pure part” that science proper requires. \n\nThe feature of Kant's conception of natural science proper that is\nmost immediately striking is how restrictive it is. It requires that\ncognition (i) be systematically ordered (ii) according to rational\nprinciples and (iii) be known a priori with apodictic certainty, i.e.,\nwith “consciousness of their necessity” (4:468). Because\nproperly scientific cognition must satisfy these strict conditions, it\nrequires “a pure part on which the apodictic certainty that\nreason seeks can be based” (4:469). But since Kant identifies\npure rational cognition that is generated from concepts with\nmetaphysics, it follows that science proper requires a metaphysics of\nnature. He then specifies that such a metaphysics of nature could\nconsist in either a “transcendental part,” which discusses\nthe laws that make possible the concept of a nature in general —\n“even without relation to any determinate object of\nexperience” (4:469) — or a “special\nmetaphysical” part, which concerns a “particular nature of\nthis or that kind of things” for which an empirical concept is\ngiven. \n\nKant's very conception of natural science proper thus immediately\ngives rise to several systematically important questions. First, if\nthe “transcendental part” of the metaphysics of nature can be\nidentified with the results of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nthen the Metaphysical Foundations is a work in special\nmetaphysics. But what exactly is a special metaphysics? In particular,\nwhat particular natures or kinds of things could be its object? And\nhow precisely can an empirical concept of such things be given without\ncompromising the necessity required of the pure part of natural\nscience? Second, how is the special metaphysics provided by the\nMetaphysical Foundations supposed to be related to the\ntranscendental part of the metaphysics of nature that was established\nin the Critique of Pure Reason? Does the former presuppose\nthe principles of the latter or are they logically independent, but\nstill related to each other in some other way? Another question\nconcerns the method of special metaphysics. Is that method the\nconceptual analysis (of the notion of matter), the transcendental\ninvestigation of the presuppositions of the mathematical science of\nnature, or something else entirely?  \n\nFirst, Kant suggests that in special metaphysics the principles of the\ntranscendental part “are applied to the two species of objects of our\nsenses” (4:470). Thus, the particular kinds of things that could be\ninvestigated in a special metaphysics are (i) the objects of outer\nsense, i.e., matter, and (ii) the objects of inner sense, i.e.,\nthinking beings, which would thus result in a doctrine of body and a\ndoctrine of soul. Kant then argues that because “the possibility of\ndeterminate natural things cannot be cognized from their mere concepts\n… it is still required that the intuition\ncorresponding to the concept be given a priori, that is, that\nthe concept be constructed” (4:470), which is a task that requires\nmathematics. This is Kant's justification for his famous claim that\n“in any special doctrine of nature there can be only as much\nproper science as there is mathematics therein”\n(4:470). This argument suggests that the necessity required of the\npure part of natural science derives from the necessity of the rules\nby which the mathematical construction of determinate things must\nproceed. \n\nKant then uses the claim that science proper requires the construction\nof the concept of the object in a priori intuition to exclude the\npossibility that chemistry and psychology, at least as they were\npracticed at that time, could count as science proper. In the case of\nchemistry, the problem is that “no law of the approach or withdrawal\nof the parts of matter can be specified according to which …\ntheir motions and all the consequences thereof can be made intuitive\nand presented a priori in space (a demand that will only with\ngreat difficulty ever be fulfilled)” (4:471). Since its principles are\n“merely empirical,” it can, at best, be a “systematic art”\n(ibid.). The case of psychology is more complex, since Kant provides\n(at least) two separate reasons in the Preface for denying it the\nstatus of natural science proper. First, Kant claims that mathematics\nis inapplicable to the phenomena of inner sense and their laws, though\nhe grants that the law of continuity (discussed, e.g., at\nA207–209/B253–255 and A228–229/B281 in the Critique of Pure\nReason) ought to apply to changes in our representations as\nwell. He downplays the significance of this application of the law of\ncontinuity, however, by noting that time has only one dimension, which\ndoes not provide enough material to extend our cognition\nsignificantly. Second, Kant also complains that empirical psychology\ncannot separate and recombine the phenomena of inner sense at will;\nrather, our inner observations can be separated “only by mere division\nin thought” (4:471). Kant's fuller views on chemistry and psychology\nwill be discussed further below. \n\nSecond, in explaining how mathematics can be applied to bodies Kant\nasserts that “principles for the construction of the concepts\nthat belong to the possibility of matter in general must first be\nintroduced. Therefore a complete analysis of the concept of a matter\nin general [must be provided in which it] makes use of no particular\nexperiences, but only that which it finds in the isolated (although\nintrinsically empirical) concept itself, in relation to the pure\nintuitions in space and time, and in accordance with laws that already\nessentially attach to the concept of nature in general” (4:472). Kant\nthen explains that this means that the concept of matter must be\ndetermined according to the Critique of Pure Reason's\ncategories of quantity, quality, relation, and modality (4:474–476).\nFurther, Kant holds that “a new determination” (4:476) must be added\nto the concept of matter in each chapter of the Metaphysical\nFoundations. This suggests not only that the principles argued\nfor in the Metaphysical Foundations are to be developed “in\naccordance with” the principles defended in the Critique of Pure\nReason, but also that both the concept of matter and the\nMetaphysical Foundations itself is structured according to\nthe Critique of Pure Reason's table of categories. \n\nUnfortunately, these points of clarification do not resolve all of the\nissues that are immediately raised by Kant's pronouncements about what\nis required for natural science proper. One further issue that is\nrelevant here concerns the concept of matter that is at the heart of\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. Kant introduces it in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (A847–848/B875–876) as the concept of\nsomething that is impenetrable, extended, and inert. Yet, in the\nbeginning of the Preface of the Metaphysical Foundations, he\ndescribes it as whatever is an object of outer sense, and later he\nargues that the “basic determination of something that is to be an\nobject of the outer senses had to be motion, because only thereby can\nthese senses be affected” (4:476). Whatever weight one accords Kant's\njustification of the connection between matter, outer sense, and\nmotion, one faces a dilemma. If the concept of matter, most\nfundamentally, is simply the concept of any object of outer sense,\nthen how is it still empirical in any genuine sense (and what has\nbecome of the structural difference Kant draws between the\nCritique of Pure Reason and the Metaphysical\nFoundations)? If, by contrast, impenetrability, extension, and\nmovability are deemed the basic traits of the concept of matter, then\nhow can one know a priori that any object we might encounter in outer\nsense must behave in accordance with the laws that would govern matter\nso defined? \n\nMoreover, even if one can find an appropriately nuanced sense in which\nthe concept of matter is empirical while still allowing for an\nappropriate kind of necessity, questions can still be posed about the\n“new determinations” that are to be added to that concept in each\nchapter of the Metaphysical Foundations. For example, what is\nthe justification for each specific determination that is added when\none thinks of matter as having a quantity, a quality, etc.? Also, what\nis the relationship between each new determination of matter and the\nvarious claims that Kant makes in each chapter of the Metaphysical\nFoundations? In particular, when Kant explicitly invokes\nprinciples for constructing concepts belonging to the possibility of\nmatter, is his idea that these principles are required insofar as they\nmake experience of the relevant “new determination” of matter possible\n(so that Kant would be developing a transcendental argument in the\nMetaphysical Foundations similar in many respects to the\nCritique of Pure Reason)? Answers to these questions depend\non how one interprets the arguments Kant develops throughout the\nMetaphysical Foundations. \n\nThe conception of science that Kant presents in the Preface has been\nthe focus of considerable attention over the past several decades. In\nthe German literature, the issues raised above have been discussed at\nlength by Plaass (1965), Schäfer (1966), Hoppe (1969), Gloy\n(1976), and Cramer (1985). Pollok (2001) has recently produced a\ndetailed and comprehensive textual commentary on the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Important work has also been done in the English\nliterature by Walker (1974), Brittan (1978), Buchdahl (1968, 1969, and\n1986), Parsons (1984), Butts (1986), and Watkins (1998a). Friedman (1992, 2001,\n2002 and 2013) has been especially influential on these issues as well. \n\nThe first chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhoronomy, considers the quantity of motion of matter and how it is to\nbe constructed in intuition a priori (so as to produce the kind of\nrules that are necessary for our experience of matter in\nmotion). Since extension and impenetrability are not directly relevant\nto how different magnitudes (or degrees) of motion can be represented,\nKant restricts his discussion in this chapter to matter considered as\na point. Since the motion of a point in space can be represented\nstraightforwardly, the main issue is how to represent the composition\nof two different motions. Kant's primary claim in this chapter is that\ndue to the relativity of space (i.e., the fact that every motion can\nbe viewed arbitrarily as either the motion of a body in a space at\nrest, or as a body in a state of rest in a space which is in motion in\nthe opposite direction with the same velocity) “the composition\nof two motions of one and the same point can only be thought in such a\nway that one of them is represented in absolute space, and, instead of\nthe other, a motion of the relative space with the same speed\noccurring in the opposite direction is represented as the same as the\nlatter” (4:490). The proof of this Theorem considers the three\npossible cases for the composition of two motions: (i) The two motions\nare in the same direction; (ii) the two motions are in opposite\ndirections; (iii) the two motions enclose an angle. Kant then shows\nhow one can construct a priori in intuition a single motion out of the\ntwo motions described in cases (i)-(iii). The synthetic a priori\noutcome of this constructive procedure is a composition theorem that\ncovers two fundamental results of classical physics: the parallelogram\nrule for velocity addition, and the Galilean kinematic\ntransformations.  The theorem is needed for architectonic reasons too,\nnot just as a foundation for science. Kant uses the composition\ntheorem as a premise in his Dynamics, so as to infer a priori to\nforces from the composite motions they cause (e.g., 4:497). And, he\ninvokes the theorem explicitly in his Mechanics, in the course of\n“constructing the communication of motion,” i.e. deriving the laws of\nimpact (4:546). \n\nUntil recently, very little has been written directly on Kant's\nPhoronomy. (By contrast, Kant's philosophy of mathematics has long\nreceived considerable attention.) Palter (1972) first broached the\nPhoronomy from the modern standpoint of coordinate transformations\nbetween frames. Pollok (2001) is a historically rich\ncommentary. Friedman (2013) untangles the complex strands of thought\nin Kant's chapter. His leading idea is that Kant's categories of\nquantity (of the First Critique) guarantee that motion is a magnitude,\nhence mathematics is applicable to the motions of bodies--as\nkinematics. \n\nThe second chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nDynamics, considers how it is possible to experience matter as filling\na determinate region in space. Propositions 1–4 are devoted to\nexhibiting the nature and necessity of repulsive forces. In\nProposition 1 Kant argues that repulsive force is required for matter\nto fill space, since solidity, understood by “Lambert and others” as\nthe property matter would have by means of “its mere\nexistence” (4:497), cannot truly explain how one matter\nresists another matter's attempt to penetrate it. Kant then specifies\nseveral central features of repulsive forces in Propositions 2 and\n3. Repulsive forces admit of degrees to infinity, since one must\nalways be able to think of a slightly greater or lesser force, and\nalthough matter can be compressed to infinity, it can never be\npenetrated, since that would require an infinite compressing force,\nwhich is impossible. \n\nIn Proposition 4 Kant draws an important consequence from his\ncharacterization of repulsive forces, namely that matter is infinitely\ndivisible (4:503). What is especially striking about this point is\nthat it represents a significant departure from his own earlier\nPhysical Monadology, where he had accepted attractive and\nrepulsive forces, but denied the infinite divisibility of what\nultimately constitutes matter, namely physical points or monads. It is\ntrue that part of Kant's rationale for his change of position on this\npoint stems from the “critical turn” undertaken in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (and in its Second Antinomy in\nparticular). For once one recognizes that both space and spatial\nproperties such as divisibility are not properties of things in\nthemselves but rather only appearances, one can reject the proposition\nthat seems to necessitate the acceptance of simple substances, namely\nthe idea that simple substances must precede the wholes they compose\n(4:506). However, Kant's proof also seems to depend, in its details,\nnot merely on the idea that every space is filled by means of\nsome repulsive force or other, but on the stronger claim that\nevery space is divisible into smaller spaces that are filled by\ndifferent repulsive forces. \n\nPropositions 5–8 are all devoted to attractive force. In Proposition 5\nKant argues that matter must have an attractive force in order to fill\nspace. Kant's argument is that if there were only repulsive forces,\nthen matter “would disperse itself to infinity” (4:508)\nsince neither space nor other matter could limit it. Proposition 6\nargues that both attractive and repulsive forces must be considered\nessential to matter. That is, attractive forces alone are not\nsufficient to account for matter filling a space, since if matter\nconsisted solely of attractive forces, there would be no force to\ncounteract the attractive force being exercised and the universe would\ncollapse into a single point. Together, Propositions 5 and 6 make up a\n‘balancing argument’, which Kant had already used in the\nearlier Physical Monadology. (A balancing argument is an\nexistence proof for a type of force. Its premises are (1) an accepted\nuniversal fact, viz.  that a certain stable configuration obtains; and\n(2) a type of force independently known to exist. The argument seeks\nto prove that the stability in question is impossible unless a second\nkind of force exists to balance the first kind. In Kant's particular\nversion of the balancing argument, the universal fact is the constancy\nof mass density in a control volume; and the given force is “original\nrepulsion,” whose existence he proves in Proposition 4.) Proposition 7\nthen specifies how attractive forces are to be understood, namely as\nthe immediate action of matter on other matter through empty space\n(and therefore at a distance). Kant thus directly confronts the\nmetaphysical question of how to understand attraction that Newton\nattempted to avoid by positing it merely mathematically. As Kant\ninterprets the situation, Newton “abstracts from all hypotheses\npurporting to answer the question as to the cause of the universal\nattraction of matter … [since] this question is physical or\nmetaphysical, but not mathematical” (4:515). In response to the\n“most common objection to immediate action at a distance,”\nnamely “that a matter cannot act immediately where it is\nnot” (4:513), Kant argues that action at a distance is no\nmore problematic than action by contact (whether it be by collision or\npressure), since in both cases a body is simply acting outside\nitself. Proposition 8 concludes by arguing that attractive forces act\nimmediately to infinity and by adding a “preliminary\nsuggestion” (4:518) as to how one might be able to construct the\nconcept of cohesion (which Kant understands as attraction that is\nrestricted to contact). \n\nIn the General Remark to Dynamics Kant addresses two main issues.\nFirst, Kant considers how it is that the specific varieties of matter\n(e.g., water as different from mercury) might be reduced, at least in\nprinciple, to the fundamental forces of attraction and repulsion. The\nsecond issue concerns the fundamental distinction between the\n“mathematical-mechanical” and the\n“metaphysical-dynamical mode of explanation”. The former\nmode of explanation, which is associated with the postulation of atoms\nand the void, employs nothing more than the shapes and motions of\nfundamental particles and empty interstices interspersed among\nthem. It contrasts with the metaphysical-dynamical mode, which employs\nfundamental moving forces (e.g., attraction and repulsion) in its\nexplanations. Kant grants that the mathematical-mechanical mode has an\nadvantage over the metaphysical-dynamical mode, since its fundamental\nposits can be represented (indeed, “verified” (4:525))\nmathematically, whereas he repeatedly admits that the possibility of\nfundamental forces can never be comprehended, i.e., their possibility\ncan never be rendered certain.  However, Kant thinks that this\nadvantage is outweighed by two disadvantages. First, by presupposing\nabsolute impenetrability, the mathematical-mechanical mode of\nexplanation accepts an “empty concept” at its\nfoundation. Second, by giving up all forces that would be inherent in\nmatter, such a mode of explanation provides the imagination with more\nfreedom “than is truly consistent with the caution of\nphilosophy” (4:525). \n\nGiven that the bulk of Kant's matter theory is presented in the\nDynamics, it is unsurprising that it has received the greatest amount\nof attention in the literature. Of particular note are discussions by\nBuchdahl (1968, 1969), Brittan (1978), Kitcher (1983), Butts (1986),\nCarrier (1990), Friedman (1990), Malzkorn (1998), Warren (2001, 2010),\nPollok (2002), Holden (2004), and Engelhard (2005). Friedman (2013) is\nan extensive commentary, under the overarching theme that Kant in the\nDynamics aims to explain how certain features of body – density,\nvolume, static weight – become mathematizable, as Newton's\ndynamics illustrates paradigmatically.  \n\nThe third chapter of Kant's Metaphysical Foundations, the\nMechanics, concerns how it is possible to experience matter as having\na moving force, that is, how one matter communicates its motion to\nanother by means of its moving force. Kant begins, in Proposition 1,\nby clarifying how the quantity of matter is to be estimated before\nstating, in Propositions 2–4, three Laws of Mechanics. \n\nAfter first defining the quantity of matter and the quantity of motion\n(or, in contemporary terms, impulse, i=mv), Kant\nasserts that the quantity of matter, in comparison with every\nother matter, can be estimated only by the quantity of motion at a\ngiven speed (4:537). Kant's proof proceeds by way of elimination. The\nquantity of matter, which is the aggregate of the movable in a\ndeterminate space, cannot be estimated by counting the number of parts\nit has, since, as was established in the Dynamics, every matter is\ninfinitely divisible.  Nor can one estimate the quantity of matter\nmerely by considering its volume, since different matters can have\ndifferent specific densities.  As a result, the only universally\napplicable way of estimating the quantity of matter is to hold the\nvelocity of matter constant. \n\nIn Proposition 2, Kant states his First Law of Mechanics: the total\nquantity of matter remains the same throughout all changes in matter\n(4:541). His proof seems to rely (i) on the principle of the First\nAnalogy of Experience that no substance arises or perishes throughout\nany change in nature and (ii) on the identification of what in matter\nmust be substantial. On this latter point, Kant quickly assumes that\nthe ultimate subject of all accidents inhering in matter must be the\nmovable in space, and that its quantity is the aggregate of the\nmovable in space. In his remark to this proposition, Kant explicitly\nnotes that there is a crucial difference between spatial and\nnon-spatial substances, since the latter, unlike the former, could\ngradually fade away by degrees. (Kant cites the possibility of\nconsciousness as a concrete example.) Kant uses this difference to\nargue that since the quantity of matter consists in a plurality of\nreal things external to each other that cannot fade away (as\nconsciousness might), the only way to decrease its quantity is by\ndivision. \n\nKant's Second Law of Mechanics, stated in Proposition 3, is that every\nchange in matter has an external cause. (Immediately after this\nprinciple, Kant adds in parentheses a version of the law of inertia\nthat is much closer to Newton's: “every body persists in its state of\nrest or motion, in the same direction, and with the same speed, if it is\nnot compelled by an external cause to leave this state” (4:543). Since\nKant's Second Law of Mechanics is not identical to Newton's law of\ninertia, it would require argument to show that, and by means of what\nadditional assumptions, the former entails the latter.) The proof of\nthe main principle depends on the Second Analogy of Experience (which\nasserts that all changes occur in accordance with the law of cause and\neffect and thus entails that every change in matter has a cause) as\nwell as on the further assumption that matter has no internal grounds\nof determinations (such as thinking and desiring), but rather only\nexternal relations in space. In his remark to this proposition, which\nclarifies this “law of inertia,” Kant explains that inertia is to be\ncontrasted with life or the ability of a substance to determine itself\nto act from an internal principle. Thus, a body's inertia\n“does not mean a positive striving to conserve its state”\n(4:544), but rather what it does not do, its\nlifelessness. \n\nKant also asserts that the very possibility of natural science proper\ndepends on the law of inertia, since the rejection of it would be\nhylozoism, “the death of all natural philosophy” (4:544). In a later\nremark in the Mechanics, Kant explicitly objects that “the terminology\nof inertial force (vis inertiae) must be entirely banished\nfrom natural science, not only because it carries with it a\ncontradiction in terms, nor even because the law of inertia\n(lifelessness) might thereby be easily confused with the law of\nreaction in every communicated motion, but primarily because the\nmistaken idea of those who are not properly acquainted with the\nmechanical laws is thereby maintained and even strengthened” (4:550).\nKant goes on to point out that if inertia were to entail an active\nforce of resistance, then it would be possible that when one moving\nbody hits another, the moving body has to apply part of its motion\nsolely to overcome the inertia of the one at rest and might not have\nany motion left over, as it were, to set the body at rest into motion,\nwhich is contrary to experience (and Proposition 2). \n\nKant's Third Law of Mechanics, expressed in Proposition 4, asserts the\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion.  Kant\nformulates a version of the Third Analogy of Experience (according to\nwhich all external action in the world is interaction) and suggests\nthat the main point at issue in mechanics is establishing that mutual\naction is necessarily reaction. Kant's argument for this law\nis based on the following line of thought: (i) if all changes of\nmatter are changes of motion; (ii) if all changes of motion are\nreciprocal and equal (since one body cannot move closer to/farther\naway from another body without the second body moving closer\nto/farther away from the first body and by exactly the same amount);\nand (iii) if every change of matter has an external cause (a\nproposition that was established as the Second Law of Mechanics), then\nthe cause of the change of motion of the one body entails an equal and\nopposite cause of a change of motion of the other body or, in short,\naction must be equal to reaction. \n\nIn Remark 1, Kant then shows how his position differs from that of\nother authors. Newton “by no means dared to prove this law a\npriori, and therefore appealed rather to experience”\n(4:449). Kepler likewise derived it from experience, though he went\nfurther, conceiving of it in terms of a special force of inertia.\nCertain unnamed “transfusionists” (presumably Locke and perhaps\nDescartes or Rohault) attempted to deny the law altogether by\nsuggesting that motion could simply be transferred from one body to\nanother in the communication of motion, a view Kant rejects on the\ngrounds that explaining the communication of motion in terms of the\ntransfer of motion is no explanation at all and also amounts to\nadmitting that accidents could be literally transferred from one\nsubstance to another. \n\nKant's Laws of Mechanics have been discussed widely in the secondary\nliterature. One can point to discussions by Palter (1972), Duncan\n(1984), Friedman (1989, 1992, and 1995), Brittan (1995), Westphal\n(1995), Carrier (2001), and Watkins (1997 and 1998b). Much of the\nmodern tradition of scholarship used to regard Kant's laws of\nmechanics as derived from, or even identical with, Newton's three laws\nin the Principia. Watkins (1997; 1998b) showed that Kant's\nformulation and justification of his laws was strongly influenced by a\nphilosophy of nature stemming from Leibniz not Newton. Stan (2013)\nfurther corroborated these findings. As a result, it is safe to say\nthat Kant's foundations of mechanics were significantly shaped by\npost-Leibnizian rationalism too, not just Newton's mechanics. This\nfact is now reflected in Friedman (2013), the most recent and detailed\naccount of Kant's interpretation of the conceptual foundations of\nmechanics. Stan (2014) examines the conceptual link between Kant's\ntheory of matter and his laws of mechanics. \n\nThe final chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhenomenology, focuses on how the motion of matter can be experienced\nmodally, that is, in terms of it being possibly, actually, or\nnecessarily in motion. Its three Propositions specify (in accordance,\nKant suggests, with the results of the three previous chapters) that\n(i) rectilinear motion is a merely possible predicate of matter, (ii)\ncircular motion is an actual predicate of matter, and (iii) the equal\nand opposite motion of one matter with respect to another is a\nnecessary motion of that matter. In the General Remark to the\nPhenomenology, Kant discusses the status of absolute space, which had\nbeen presupposed by the possible, actual, and necessary motions of\nmatter at issue in the three main propositions, and explains that\nsince it is not itself an object of experience, it must be represented\nby means of an idea of reason (in Kant's technical sense of “idea”,\nnamely as a concept for which a corresponding object could never be\ngiven to us in intuition). Though we can never know absolute space, it\nnonetheless functions as a regulative principle that guides us in\nour scientific practice by forcing us to look for further conditions\nfor the conditioned objects we meet with in experience. Kant's view\nthat ideas of reason can function as regulative principles is\ndeveloped in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic in the\nCritique of Pure Reason. \nFriedman's interpretation (1992) of the Phenomenology deserves special\nmention. According to him, in light of Kant's rejection of Newton's\nabsolute space and time, he must give an account of the concept of\ntrue motion – as change of true place over time – presupposed by\nclassical mechanics. To this end, Kant “views the laws of motion as\ndefinitive or constitutive of the spatio-temporal framework of\nNewtonian theory,” hence these laws “count as a priori” for him\n(p. 143). The reason Kant takes them as constitutive is the\nfollowing. In Kant's Phenomenology, the three Newtonian\nlaws define a concept of true motion: the true motions of\nbodies just are those that obey the dynamical laws. Moreover,\nthe concept must be given “objective meaning in experience,”\nviz. measured empirically. To do so, Kant views Newton's three laws as\nholding primarily in a privileged system of reference, namely the\ncenter-of-mass (CM) frame of the system of the world, which the\nCM-frame of our Solar System approximates to a very good degree. Thus,\nby measuring the motions of bodies relative to this frame, we produce\nobjective experience of these motions. However, this frame must first\nbe located. To do so, Kant thinks, we must likewise count the\nlaw of universal gravitation as a priori, not empirical-inductive. If\nwe know a priori that all bodies in the Solar System necessarily\nattract each other, from their observable, mutually-induced\naccelerations we can infer their masses. In turn, knowing their masses\nwill enable us to locate the CM-frame of the system. (In a system of\nbodies, the center of mass is the point relative to which the bodies'\ndistances are in inverse proportion to their masses.) With respect to\nthis distinguished frame, the motions of bodies count as their true\nmotions, Friedman claims. Hence, immediate and essential gravitation\n“cannot be straightforwardly obtained from our experience of matter\nand its motions – by some sort of inductive argument, say”\n– because universal gravitation is “necessarily presupposed in\nmaking an objective experience of matter and its motions possible in\nthe first place” (pp.  157–158). However, the CM-frame of the Solar\nSystem is just approximately an inertial frame. Scientific inquiry\nmust ultimately look beyond it, to better and better approximations of\nan inertial frame. And, Kant's absolute space is just the concept that\ndirects our search for such approximations. More recently, Friedman\nupdated and expanded his interpretation in (2013). In view of recent\nscholarship, Friedman has now made a convincing case that it\nis Kant's laws of mechanics – not Newton's three laws, as\nclaimed in (1992) – that define the privileged frame (Kantian\nabsolute space) relative to which bodies have true motions, in the\nPhenomenology.   \n\nApart from Friedman's interpretation, there is relatively little\nsecondary literature that discusses Kant's Phenomenology. Palter\n(1971) interprets Kant's doctrine of absolute space and motion in\nterms of transformation groups for Galilean kinematics. Carrier (1992)\nprovides an alternative to Friedman's account of Kant on absolute\nspace. Stan (forthcoming) is an alternative to Friedman's reading of\nKant's doctrine of circular motion, and its relation to Newton's\ndynamics.  \n\nKant's interest in physics continued after the publication of the\nMetaphysical Foundations, in fact, until the very end of his\nproductive years. Though Kant never completed a manuscript that could\nbe put forward as a publication, the various notes, sketches, and\ndrafts on topics in physics that he was working on intensively during\nthis time (especially after 1796) were gathered together over a\ncentury after his death and published as his so-called Opus\npostumum. \n\nDespite the fragmentary nature of the Opus postumum, Kant\nmakes it clear that it is designed to fill an important gap in his\nsystem. Just as the Metaphysical Foundations had attempted to\nconnect the transcendental principles of the Critique of Pure\nReason and the principles that explain how matter is possible,\nthe Opus postumum undertakes the task of effecting a\ntransition from the special metaphysics of nature contained in the\nMetaphysical Foundations to physics itself. However, Kant\ndoes not clarify adequately what systematic principles would guide\nthis transition project, nor is it clear whether he takes the project\nto yield substantive principles or heuristic guidelines. On the one\nhand, in a note that stems from a period shortly after the publication\nof the Metaphysical Foundations, Kant suggests that one could\n“follow the clue given by the categories and bring into play the\nmoving forces of matter according to their quantity, quality,\nrelation, and modality” (21:311), a procedure that could be\nsimilar to that of the\nMetaphysical Foundations. On the other hand, if the\nMetaphysical Foundations already presupposes an empirical\nconcept (namely matter), the transition to be carried out in the\nOpus postumum cannot be understood as moving from something\nnon-empirical to something empirical. As Kant struggles with the\nproblems that result from trying to account for now much more specific\nfeatures of matter, it is unclear that (or how) the categories are\nsupposed to be of help in structuring Kant's argument.  Thus, the\nprecise argumentative structure of the Opus postumum (i.e.,\nits relationship to Kant's other works and its fundamental\npresuppositions) remains problematic. Equally problematic is the exact\nnature of Kant's transition project. Given his stated aim to account\nfor\nspecific features of matter—e.g., particular\naggregation states, special forces—one would think that\nsuch contingent features are a problem for empirical science\nnot philosophy, since Kant sees the latter as pursuing knowledge that\nis, in various senses, necessary. \n\nWhatever its form, the content of the Opus postumum includes\nreflections on a series of important topics in physics. Three clusters\nare particularly noteworthy. (1) Kant develops more detailed views\nabout a number of outstanding issues concerning matter theory that he\nhad discussed (often in a tentative way) in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, such as fluidity, rigidity, cohesion, and the\nquantity of matter. (2) Kant argues for the existence of an\nall-encompassing ether. This might seem to be a natural development,\nsince the Metaphysical Foundations was non-committal on the\npoint, but what is surprising is that Kant thinks that the ether can\nbe established a priori (e.g., 21:222), which might seem to conflict\nwith Kant's project in the Critique of Pure Reason (or with\nhis description of his position as “formal idealism,” 4:337). (3) Kant\nalso explores the idea that the subject must posit itself in positing\nthe various forces in matter, a doctrine that has come to be known as\nthe Selbstsetzungslehre, and attempts to incorporate it into\nhis views on how man is situated in between the world of experience\nand God, whose existence is a central requirement of morality. \n\nThe Opus postumum has long been a topic of interest\nespecially insofar as it offers the hope of clarification and\ndevelopment of central issues in Kant's Critical philosophy. While\nmuch of the original literature focussing on it was in German (Adickes\n1920, Hoppe 1969, Tuschling 1971, and, more recently, Blasche, 1991\nand Emundts, 2004), it has received increased attention of late in\nEnglish with discussions by Friedman (1992, chapter 5), Förster\n(2000), Edwards (2000), Guyer (2001), and Hall (2006, 2009). \n\nKant was interested not only in the inanimate bodies studied by\nphysics, but also in living organisms, which he viewed as deserving of\nadditional philosophical scrutiny due to their special status, for two\nreasons. First, the symmetries and regularities of their structure and\nworkings make them “in the highest degree contingent” (5:\n360) and “mechanically inexplicable.” Second, organisms\ncome from their own kind; grow their own functional parts, or organs,\nand repair them if they become damaged; and do in general exhibit\nhomeostasis. These facts about them prompt Kant to claim that an\norganism is “cause and effect of itself” (5: 370). In a\nsense, a living entity is self-caused, and indeed by a causality that\nwe can grasp solely “under the idea of purposes as a\nprinciple” (5: 383). Organisms, in other words, are\n“natural purposes,” or naturally occurring ensembles of\nparts purposefully fitted and working in unity. \n\nIt is just these peculiarities that create philosophical challenges\nnot met with in physics and chemistry. Kant tackles them in the latter\nhalf of his third magnum opus, the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790). In particular, he claims that attempting to\nexplain organisms creates an inevitable conflict within reflective\njudgment, the faculty we employ in empirical concept formation,\ntaxonomic classification, and the explanatory unification of\nparticular laws. Kant describes that conflict in the Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment (CJ §§ 69–78; 5:\n385–415). The Antinomy obtains between two regulative principles,\nherein prefixed by an ‘R’ to distinguish them from two\nsimilar\nconstitutive principles that Kant briefly discusses in the\nsame place: R-thesis:\nAll generation of material things and their forms must\nbe judged as possible in accordance with merely mechanical\nlaws. \nR-antithesis:Some products of material nature cannot be judged\nas possible according to merely mechanical laws (judging them\nrequires an entirely different law of causality, namely that of final\ncausality) (5: 387). \n\nA great deal of scholarship has aimed to elucidate this antinomy,\nand in the last decade these interpretive efforts have gained new\nmomentum (see also the entry “Kant’s Aesthetics and\nTeleology” in this encyclopedia). In particular, sustained\nattention has been given to three questions: In what sense are\norganisms inexplicable mechanically, for Kant? What exactly is the\ncontradiction that generates the Antinomy? And precisely how does Kant\nsolve it? \n\nFirst, clarification is needed about Kant’s claim that\norganisms cannot be explained ‘mechanically.’ In the\nEnlightenment, ‘mechanical’ was used in at least two\nsenses: broadly, to denote explanation by physico-chemical laws of\nefficient causation; and narrowly, restricted to the theory of\n‘compound machines,’ or assemblies of movable parts used to\ndisplace loads or transfer momentum, e.g. engines and watches.\nMcLaughlin (1990) takes Kant to mean ‘mechanical’ in this\nlatter sense. In artificial machines, parts precede the\nwhole temporally, and determine it: the machine’s\nconfiguration results from summation over the parts; and its laws of\noperation are the same as those governing the parts. But organisms are\ndifferent: the whole precedes its parts, or organs; and it has\nfunctions and aim-directed behaviors not present in them. Hence,\norganisms are mechanically inexplicable. Ginsborg (2004) construes\nKant’s claim along different lines, in two senses. According to\none, to explain something mechanically is to show that its production\nresults, or would result, from the “unaided powers of matter as\nsuch,” i.e. Newtonian forces of attraction and repulsion, and\n“crude unorganized matter,” or arbitrary initial conditions\nsuch as masses, charges, configurations and motions. Organisms are\ninexplicable in this sense because their arising would be “in the\nhighest degree contingent.” This is the notion operative in the\nAntinomy of Teleological Judgment, Ginsborg contends. But, she has\nargued, there is a second, stronger sense. Not only are organisms\ninexplicable by reduction to the structure and powers of their\norgans—rather, their symmetries and regularities and powers are\nnot explicable from the “moving forces” of their\ninorganic particles either. Organism-level powers are not\nvector sums or integrals of physico-chemical forces that accelerate or\nreconfigure sub-visible particles.  \n\nSecond, interpreters have also scrutinized the exact nature of the\nAntinomy. Insofar as the thesis and the antithesis are regulative\nprinciples, they may be seen as research policies, and those can be\npursued separately, at different times, hence with no\ncontradiction. Then why are they antinomic? Watkins (2009, § 2.2)\nexplains that the two theses do not just recommend explanatory policies\nbut express commitments to judging in a determinate way about\nbiological phenomena. As such, they would be contradictory commitments:\nto judge organisms purely mechanistically and to judge them\nnon-mechanistically. Teufel (2011) reads the two theses as hypothetical\nimperatives, imposed upon reflective judgment by practical reason. The\nAntinomy ensues, he contends, because they demand contradictory courses\nof cognitive conduct: to judge that mechanistic laws suffice to explain\norganisms and that they are insufficient for that\ntask.  \n\nMoreover, for each antinomy in the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant derives both thesis and antithesis by deductive argument from\nalleged a priori premises. But, in the Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment, he does not take that route. This makes quite pressing the\nquestion of his justification for the two R-claims above. As to the\nR-thesis, one might think that it can be easily deduced from\nKant’s three Laws of Mechanics. However, we must remember that\nthose laws are constitutive principles, whereas the R-thesis is\nregulative. A better interpretive avenue is that Kant’s three\nlaws constrain the spectrum of particular empirical laws, including\nlaws for biology, that scientists may seek. The constraint is that the\nLaws of Mechanics are basic: no other laws of material nature explain\nor ground them, while they must explain all other laws,\ndirectly or indirectly. So, for biological regularities to be turned\ninto genuine laws, they must be integrable with the system of already\nknown mechanical laws, and ultimately explained by the three Laws of\nMechanics, the basis for all “interconnected experiential\ncognition” (5: 386). Even less well understood is Kant’s\njustification for the R-antithesis. Not only is there no official\nproof, it is not easy to know what the proof must establish. The\nR-thesis strongly implies that at issue is the origin of\norganisms; in contrast, the R-antithesis is about judging their\npossibility, which has to do with structure and functioning\nnot production (Ginsborg 2001, 236). These are different aspects of\norganisms, and proving that they are mechanically inexplicable would\nrequire different arguments. \n\nThird, Kant’s solution to the Antinomy has received sustained\nattention. In the first two Critiques, his general approach is to\nargue, for each antinomy, that both thesis and antithesis presuppose\nTranscendental Realism, insofar as they make claims about things in\nthemselves; and to adduce Transcendental Idealism as the vantage point\nfrom which the initial contradiction is solved. However, that is not\nKant’s approach to the Antinomy of Teleological Judgment.\nAccordingly, interpreters have sought to reconstruct a different\nsolution on Kant’s behalf. Quarfood (2004) and Förster\n(2008) take the notion of an intuitive understanding (expounded at 5:\n401–10) as the key to Kant’s answer. In particular, Förster\nexplains, intellects like ours are discursive: they grasp objects\nthrough concepts as ‘parts’ assembled in\ntemporally-extended judgments, and so mechanistically, he alleges.\nHence, we need the concept ‘purpose’ to judge organisms\nsolely because we have discursive intellects. However, an intuitive\nunderstanding could grasp organisms without purpose-concepts and\nregulative principles about judging teleologically. Hence, for this\nunderstanding, the R-thesis and R-antithesis need not be true, and so\nno antinomy arises. Breitenbach (2008) contends that the Antinomy is\nsolved, or rather dissolved, if we note that thesis and antithesis are\nnot really contradictory but complementary. They govern (reflecting)\nacts of judging in different contexts: the mechanistic R-thesis\nregulates explanatory conduct in empirical biology, whereas the\nR-antithesis governs ordinary judging about living nature as\nexperienced in everyday, pre-theoretical encounters with it. The two\nprinciples epitomize “two different views on nature,” and\nare compossible (466). They just appear to be in contradiction; in\nfact, they complement each other, indispensably. McLaughlin (1990)\nsubmits that the Antinomy does not arise simpliciter but only\nunder a special assumption, viz. that everything in nature is\nobjectively explainable by us (162). Reject the assumption, and the\ncontradiction vanishes, insofar as the R-thesis and the R-antithesis\ncan both be true, but for different domains: the former holds for\nphenomena explainable by us, the latter for phenomena not so\nexplainable. McLaughlin does not offer a general criterion for\n‘explicability by us’ attributable to Kant, however, apart\nfrom mechanical explicability. Ginsborg (2008) focuses on how the\ncontradiction might be resolved in the context of scientific\ninvestigation rather than in abstract, general philosophical terms.\nBuilding on Kant’s remark about subordinating mechanism to\nteleology (5: 414), Ginsborg contends that natural historians and\nphysiologists may well explain the origin and workings of organisms\n‘mechanistically,’ purely by physico-chemical laws,\nprovided they apply them not to “crude” but to\n“organized” matter, i.e. organic stuff already endowed with\na “formative drive,” a generic disposition to grow,\nreproduce and self-maintain. In turn, this organized matter itself is\nunintelligible without appeal to purpose and design terms. Thus,\nbiologists ‘subordinate’ mechanism to teleology, and so the\nantinomic conflict between them is removed.  \n\nWhile these interpretive proposals collectively advance our\nunderstanding of how the Antinomy might be defused, each has its share\nof philosophical difficulties, as spelled out in Watkins (2009).\nMoreover, few of these construals heed close to Kant’s words,\nwhich suggest strongly that his solution relies indispensably\non a “supersensible ground” (5: 413), or explanatory\nprinciple located in the noumenal world. That ground could\nunite both mechanism and teleology, by making both antinomic theses\njointly derivable or explainable from it. However, since humans can\nhave “no positive determinate” knowledge of any\nsupersensible entity, the Antinomy is solvable in principle rather than\nsolved in fact. Kant (at least in his official solution) does not seem\nto provide the details for an actual account of how the conflict at the\nheart of biological explanation is removed. The limitations that beset\nour understanding of Kant’s philosophy of biology so far, some of\nwhich we have expounded above, continue to drive interpretive efforts\nto cast more light on that part of his doctrine, as exemplified in Goy\nand Watkins (forthcoming). \n\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, Kant’s Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment has been usefully discussed in Allison (1991),\nCohen (2004), Ginsborg (2001), Kreines (2005), Steigerwald (2006),\nZanetti (1993) and Zumbach (1984); see also the entry\n“Kant’s Aesthetics and Teleology” in this\nencyclopedia. \n\nIn the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations Kant claims\nthat chemistry, at least as he understood it in 1786, was not science\n“proper”, but such a claim leaves open the possibility\nthat chemistry could be fully scientific in some other sense or that,\nwith time, it could develop into science proper. Up through 1787, Kant\naccepted the fundamental tenets of Stahl's chemical theory, according\nto which water and air are fundamental elements that function as\nvehicles for change in both inflammable and “earthy”\nsubstances, and he commented on particular issues in chemistry in his\nvarious physics lectures. As a result, it is clear that Kant considers\nchemistry to be a science in\nsome sense even during the Critical period. However,\nbeginning in the mid-1780s (and extending through the mid to late\n1790s), Kant becomes aware of significant new developments in\nchemistry (as evidenced in the Danziger Physik and documented\nin Lichtenberg's revised, third edition of Erxleben's\nAnfangsgründe der Naturlehre from which Kant lectured).\nIn particular, Kant comes to reject Stahl's theory, favoring\nLavoisier's anti-phlogistic account of combustion and calcination,\nwhich relied on his doctrines of latent heat and the caloric theory of\nthe states of aggregation. While Kant never explicitly claims that\nchemistry, so understood, can be considered science proper, Kant's\ninterest in these issues in the Opus postumum suggests that\nhe was optimistic about providing the kind of foundation that would be\nrequired for it to attain this status. \n\nKant's views on chemistry have not been widely discussed in the\nsecondary literature. However, outstanding discussions of Kant's views\non the topic can be found in Carrier (1990, 2001) and Friedman (1992,\nchapter 5, III). Lequan (2000) is a philosophical survey of Kant's\nthought on chemistry throughout his development. McNulty (forthcoming)\nexplains why Kant takes chemistry to miss the threshold for proper\nscience – specifically, the sense in which chemistry is not\nmathematizable, in Kant's view.  \n\nKant's views on psychology are intimately bound up with his more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind. (See the separate entry on\nthis topic.) Still, one can take note of the fact that Kant\ndistinguishes between rational and empirical psychology and, in the\nCritique of Pure Reason's Paralogisms, denies that rational\npsychology contains arguments that could justify any substantive\nprinciples (especially concerning our immortality). Thus, only\nempirical psychology, it seems, could be possible as a science.\nHowever, if Kant continues to maintain that science requires a pure\npart, and denies that rational psychology contains any substantive\nknowledge that might constitute the pure part of psychology, then it\nfollows that empirical psychology cannot qualify as science proper\neither. \n\nAt the same time, Kant's own project in the Critique of Pure\nReason requires what one might call transcendental psychology,\nthat is, the study of those faculties that are required for us to have\ncognition. Transcendental psychology thus differs from rational\npsychology insofar as the former presupposes that we have experience\n(albeit of a very general sort), whereas the latter is restricted to\nthe mere concept “I think”. Thus, it would seem that many of Kant's\nmost important claims in the Critique of Pure Reason would\nfall under the domain of transcendental psychology. As is well known,\nKant's Critique of Pure Reason came under attack immediately\nafter its publication (most notably by Johann Georg Hamann) for not\npresenting an explicit account of how we obtain knowledge of our\ntranscendental faculties. \n\nJust as Kant held that chemistry could either be scientific in less\nthan the strictest sense or perhaps become science proper (depending\non how it develops), the same could be said for psychology. For one,\nKant may simply be objecting to psychology as it was practiced in the\n18th century, e.g., as based on introspection (a method that both\nrules out the application of mathematics and gives rise to other\ndifficulties, 4:471). Further, in the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant holds that although objects can never be given in\nintuition that would correspond to ideas of reason, such ideas never\nthe less function as regulative principles that direct our\nunderstanding with regard to what it should inquire into next. Thus,\nour idea of the world as a totality is supposed to drive us to look\nfor smaller and smaller parts to bodies and objects in further regions\nof space and at earlier moments of time.  But if we have an idea of\nour soul, then it too should guide our scientific inquiry into our own\nrepresentations, which seems to imply that psychology is a legitimate\nscientific practice (even if it does ultimately fall short of being\nscience proper). \nUnsurprisingly, Kant influenced empirical theory in early 19th-century\nGermany. (However, it was his transcendental psychology in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason, not his views on empirical\npsychology, that proved to be most influential.) In particular, his\ndoctrine of space and time as forms of sensibility was given a\nnaturalistic construal in the physiology and psychology of\nperception. Since for Kant an a priori form of intuition need not be\ninnate, it could unfold in the course of sensory experience. This led\nJ.G. Steinbuch (1811) and C. Th. Tourtual (1827) to investigate\nempirically how spatial representation arises – specifically,\nhow particular subjects become able to see things as arrayed in space,\nperceive objects as three-dimensional, and represent spatial\nstructures more generally. Hatfield (1990, Chapter 4) surveys these\npost-Kantian developments in more detail.\n \n\nKitcher (1990) presents a detailed argument for the role of\ntranscendental psychology within Kant's Critique of Pure\nReason. Sturm (2001) argues that Kant's critical comments about\npsychology are primarily directed against introspection-based\nconceptions of psychology. Hatfield (1990) is an acute discussion of\nthe complexities of psychology as a science in Kant's view.  \n\nThough Kant is sometimes quite strict about what qualifies as science\n“proper,” we have seen that he clearly accepts that other\ndisciplines, such as chemistry and psychology, can be scientific in\nsome other sense. (Kant is also extremely interested in providing an\nexplanation of the nature and origin of organisms, which is central to\nan account of biology. For a more detailed description of Kant's\nstance on biology, see the entry on his views on aesthetics and\nteleology.)  However, his explicit reflections about science (taken\nbroadly so as to encompass not only\n“Wissenschaft” but any kind of\n“Lehre” or “Kunde”) extend\neven further so as to include bodies of cognition such as history,\nphysical geography, and anthropology. (Even in the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant leaves room for such “scientific\ncognition” by dividing the doctrine of nature into natural\nscience — e.g., physics — and the historical doctrine of\nnature, which is separated further into natural description and\nnatural history, 4:468). In the case of historical sciences, Kant\nviews its cognitions as related not by subordination (as is the case\nin physics), but rather by coordination, since historical facts cannot\nbe derived from each other, but rather merely related to each other in\nspace (geographically) and time (chronologically). Kant views\nanthropology as overlapping to some extent in subject matter with\nempirical psychology.  What enables the coordination of facts in each\nof these domains is not a theoretical, but rather a practical idea. In\nthe case of history, it is the idea of reason (or freedom) that\nprovides a guiding principle of coordination (cf. Kant's “Idea\nfor a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View”),\nwhile anthropology is framed by the cosmopolitan moral ideal of the\nworld-best. Thus, it is clear that Kant's emphasis on physics\nthroughout his career did not blind him to the value of other\nsciences, nor did it keep him from reflecting creatively on how best\nto account for them from the perspective of his Critical\nphilosophy. \n\nKant's views on history are discussed by Yovel (1980) and, more\nrecently, Kleingeld (1995 and 1999). Kant's Physical\nGeography has been discussed by Adickes (1911). Brandt (1999),\nWood (1999), and Makkreel (2001) have recently published important\ndiscussions of Kant's anthropology. Sturm (2009) is a comprehensive\nmonograph on\n\nKant's philosophy of psychology and anthropology.

It is of interest to\ncontemporary philosophers of science primarily because of the way in\nwhich Kant attempts to articulate a philosophical framework that\nplaces substantive conditions on our scientific knowledge of the world\nwhile still respecting the autonomy and diverse claims of particular\nsciences. More specifically, Kant develops a philosophy of science\nthat departs from (i) broadly empiricist views — such as David\nLewis's, according to which purely contingent events in space and time\n(along with considerations of simplicity, etc.) determine what the\nlaws of nature ultimately are — and (ii) certain necessitarian\nviews — such as David Armstrong's, according to which the laws\nof nature consist of necessitation relations between universals, which\nplace constraints on what events occur in space and time. Kant does so\nby holding that (i) scientific laws do involve necessity, but that\n(ii) this necessity is based not on (purely metaphysical and hence\ninaccessible) relations between universals, but rather on certain\nsubjective, a priori conditions under which we can experience objects\nin space and time.\n\n\n\nKant's scientific writings are also of interest to historians of\nmodern philosophy, historians of science, and historians of philosophy\nof science. Historians of modern philosophy are especially interested\nin determining how Kant's views on science might complement or clarify\nhis distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines (e.g., as\nexpressed in the Critique of Pure Reason). Historians of\nscience reflect on the way in which Kant's position fits in with the\nviews of other natural philosophers of the period, such as Newton and\nLeibniz, including his novel account of the formation of the solar\nsystem according to Newtonian principles. Historians of philosophy of\nscience investigate, among other things, Kant's work in the conceptual\nfoundations of physics — in particular, his matter theory (e.g.,\nthe infinite divisibility of matter, attractive and repulsive forces,\ninertia, atoms and the void), his theory of motion, and his dynamical\naccount of the laws of mechanics.\n\n\n\nBecause physics was Kant's primary (though not exclusive) focus over\nthe course of his lengthy career, his views on physics during his\npre-Critical (1746-1770), Critical (1781-1790), and Post-Critical\nperiods (after 1790) will be discussed in separate sections.\nSubsections will be devoted to each of the chapters of Kant's most\ninfluential work in philosophy of science, the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786). Kant's basic positions on\nother sciences, including psychology, chemistry, and history, will be\npresented thereafter.\n\n\n\nKant's early pre-Critical publications (1746-1756) are devoted\nprimarily to solving a variety of broadly cosmological problems and to\ndeveloping an increasingly comprehensive metaphysics that would\naccount for the matter theory that is required by the solutions to\nthese problems. Kant's first publication, Thoughts on the True\nEstimation of Living Forces (1746), explicitly attempts to solve\nthe vis viva controversy, which had been hotly contested ever\nsince Leibniz's attack on Descartes' laws of motion in the Acta\nEruditorum in 1686. While Kant attempts to occupy an intermediary\nposition between the Cartesian and Leibnizian positions by maintaining\nthat both mv and mv² could be conserved in\ndifferent contexts, what is of particular note is how his solution in\nParts II and III rests on the conception of force developed in Part\nI. According to this conception, force is understood in terms of the\nactivity of substances, an activity that Kant then uses to explain how\nthe motions of bodies are generated, to solve the mind-body problem,\nand to account for both the possibility of other, actually existing\nworlds and the three-dimensionality of space.  \nHis solution to the vis viva dispute is especially\ninteresting, because it presages his later approach to philosophical\ncontroversy. Rather than offering a conclusive argument in favor of\none position, Kant seeks to mediate between the two parties,\nLeibnizian and Cartesian. He argues that each measure of force is\ncorrect, but in different contexts. Kant distinguishes two ways of\nstudying bodies, “mathematical” and “metaphysical,” and claims that\nthey presuppose distinct conceptions of body. According to\nmathematical mechanics, a body cannot accelerate unless an external\ncause acts on it; for that reason, Kant declares, the Cartesians'\nquantity mv is the only one appropriate measure of force\nin this context. “Natural bodies,” in contrast, have features that\nmathematics brackets. One such feature is a capacity for\n“vivification,” whereby a body increases by itself the force of motion\nthat an external cause merely “awakens.” In light of that, Kant\nconcludes, the Leibnizian quantity mv2 is the\ncorrect measure of force in metaphysical considerations of “natural\nbodies” (1:140f).\n\n \n\nKant develops his account of the nature of substance in greater detail\nin A New Elucidation of the First Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition (1755). While the first two sections of\nthis work undertake revisions of Wolff's principles of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason, the third section argues for\ntwo substantive principles that are alleged to follow from the\nprinciple of sufficient (or rather, following Crusius, determining)\nreason, namely the principles of succession and coexistence. The main\nthrust of the principle of succession is directed against Leibnizian\npre-established harmony, arguing that only causal connections\nbetween substances can bring about changes in their states.\nKant's position appears to be designed to account primarily for\nchanges of bodily states (with changes in mental states being\nparasitic upon them, as was explicitly asserted in the True\nEstimation). For he maintains that mutual changes of\nstate require mutual interaction, where it is clear that\nchanges in motion are precisely the kind of mutual change that he has\nin mind (since one body cannot move closer to another without the\nother body moving closer to it). The principle of coexistence then\nargues that harmonious causal interaction between otherwise isolated,\nindependently existing substances is possible only by means of God's\ncoordination (just as Leibniz thought was required for harmonious\nrelations between the states of such substances). \n\nKant's Physical Monadology (1756) takes as its task the\nreconciliation of the infinite divisibility of space, as maintained in\ngeometry, with the simplicity of substances, which Kant believes is\nrequired in metaphysics. As was the case with his earlier works, the\nessential feature of his reconciliation lies in the way in which his\nmatter theory is supported by his metaphysical views. Specifically,\nKant asserts that simple substances fill space not by means of their\nmere existence, but rather in virtue of their spheres of activity. As\na result, any division of the relevant spheres of activity does not\ncompromise the simplicity of the substances themselves, since the\nspatial properties of substances (including the infinite divisibility\nof space) arise from the interaction between their activities rather\nthan from their intrinsic features. In the course of the Physical\nMonadology, Kant also argues for the necessity of attractive and\nrepulsive forces and attributes a significant role to the force of\ninertia. Kant's acceptance of such Newtonian principles represents an\nimportant change of position over the True Estimation, where\nKant rejects the principle of inertia and pursues a dynamical theory\nmuch more in line with Leibniz's views. \n\nIn addition to these works, which bridge the gap, as it were, between\nphysics and metaphysics, during this period Kant is interested in a\nseries of specific issues in cosmology and empirical physics. For\nexample, Kant writes several short exclusively scientific essays\nbetween 1754 to 1757, including “Brief Outline of Certain Meditations\non Fire,” “Investigation of the question of whether the Earth has\nsuffered changes in its axial Rotation,” “The Question of the Aging of\nthe Earth, considered physically” as well as three papers on\nearthquakes. Of much greater significance is his Universal Natural\nHistory and Theory of the Heavens (1755), which represents an\nimportant contribution to science as such. For in it Kant explains how\none can account for the formation of the solar system from an initial\nstate, in which matter is dispersed like a cloud, solely by means of\nthe interaction of attractive and repulsive forces. In 1796, Laplace,\nunaware of Kant's argument, would develop a very similar derivation,\nwith the result that the view is now typically referred to as the\nKant-Laplace nebular hypothesis. \n\nSome of Kant's youthful insights have yielded long-lasting\ncontributions to scientific knowledge. His intuition that tides slow\ndown the Earth's rotation over time is correct. In his New Remarks\ntoward an Elucidation of the theory of Winds, Kant correctly\nexplained that North-South winds in our hemisphere suffer a Coriolis\ndeflection due to the Earth's rotation. Moreover, broadly Kantian\naccounts of planetary formation have been the dominant model since the\nemergence of sophisticated nebular models in the 1970s (see, e.g.,\nSafronov 1972 and Prentice 1978). \n\nLater in his pre-Critical period (1763-1770), Kant attempts to build a\ncomprehensive metaphysical account on the basis of the framework that\nhe had established in his first works. Thus, in his The Only\nPossible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763)\nhe attempts to extend his reasoning to fundamental issues in both\nphilosophical theology and teleology, presenting, for the first time,\nhis now famous criticisms of the three traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God, while developing a new theistic proof, based on the\nidea that God is necessary as a real ground of the possibilities of\nthings. After reading Hume's Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding in German translation sometime after 1755, Kant\ndistinguishes between real and logical grounds/opposition in his\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763) to avoid Hume's objection that there is no\nlogical contradiction in the existence of one thing not following the\nexistence of another. But in this work he is also interested in\nexploring the notion of a real ground/opposition further by applying\nit more widely, e.g., to bodies, mental states, etc. Also relevant is\nKant's Concerning the Ultimate Foundation of the Distinction of\nthe Directions in Space (1768) which modifies his earlier account\nof space insofar as he seems to hold that certain spatial properties\n— viz., chirality, or handedness — may not be able to be\nexplained entirely in terms of direct relations between material\nsubstances. In his so-called Inaugural Dissertation (1770),\nKant continues to develop a more comprehensive philosophical system,\nwhich would encompass the principles of both the sensible and the\nintelligible world, and in so doing modifies his account of space and\ntime even further. Over the course of the next ten years, during which\nhe published almost nothing, Kant would revise his views more\nsystematically, with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 representing the first major step in his\n“critical turn.” \n\nAdickes (1924), Harman (1982), Friedman (1992), Laywine (1993),\nSchönfeld (2000), Kuehn (2001), Lefevre & Wunderlich (2000),\nand Watkins (1997, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2013) have emphasized the\nimportance of scientific issues in the development of Kant's thought\nduring his pre-Critical period, as he reacted to Leibniz, Newton and\nother, more immediate predecessors (such as Christian Wolff, Christian\nAugust Crusius, Leonard Euler, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, and\nMartin Knutzen). Smith (2013) reconstructs Kant's picture of matter in\nthe Physical Monadology.  \n\nThough Kant discusses issues relevant to physics in various works\nthroughout the Critical period (esp. the Critique of Pure\nReason), his views on this topic are developed most explicitly in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), which\nconsists of a preface and four chapters. \n\nIn the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations Kant (i)\nanalyzes the concepts of nature and science so as to establish what\nconditions must be met for a body of knowledge to constitute natural\nscience in the proper sense, (ii) explains why science so understood\nrequires “a pure part” (4:469) and what criteria would have to be\nsatisfied for such a pure part to exist, (iii) argues that chemistry\nand psychology cannot at present meet these criteria, and (iv)\ndescribes what procedure should be followed to satisfy these criteria\nand thus to provide the “pure part” that science proper requires. \n\nThe feature of Kant's conception of natural science proper that is\nmost immediately striking is how restrictive it is. It requires that\ncognition (i) be systematically ordered (ii) according to rational\nprinciples and (iii) be known a priori with apodictic certainty, i.e.,\nwith “consciousness of their necessity” (4:468). Because\nproperly scientific cognition must satisfy these strict conditions, it\nrequires “a pure part on which the apodictic certainty that\nreason seeks can be based” (4:469). But since Kant identifies\npure rational cognition that is generated from concepts with\nmetaphysics, it follows that science proper requires a metaphysics of\nnature. He then specifies that such a metaphysics of nature could\nconsist in either a “transcendental part,” which discusses\nthe laws that make possible the concept of a nature in general —\n“even without relation to any determinate object of\nexperience” (4:469) — or a “special\nmetaphysical” part, which concerns a “particular nature of\nthis or that kind of things” for which an empirical concept is\ngiven. \n\nKant's very conception of natural science proper thus immediately\ngives rise to several systematically important questions. First, if\nthe “transcendental part” of the metaphysics of nature can be\nidentified with the results of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nthen the Metaphysical Foundations is a work in special\nmetaphysics. But what exactly is a special metaphysics? In particular,\nwhat particular natures or kinds of things could be its object? And\nhow precisely can an empirical concept of such things be given without\ncompromising the necessity required of the pure part of natural\nscience? Second, how is the special metaphysics provided by the\nMetaphysical Foundations supposed to be related to the\ntranscendental part of the metaphysics of nature that was established\nin the Critique of Pure Reason? Does the former presuppose\nthe principles of the latter or are they logically independent, but\nstill related to each other in some other way? Another question\nconcerns the method of special metaphysics. Is that method the\nconceptual analysis (of the notion of matter), the transcendental\ninvestigation of the presuppositions of the mathematical science of\nnature, or something else entirely?  \n\nFirst, Kant suggests that in special metaphysics the principles of the\ntranscendental part “are applied to the two species of objects of our\nsenses” (4:470). Thus, the particular kinds of things that could be\ninvestigated in a special metaphysics are (i) the objects of outer\nsense, i.e., matter, and (ii) the objects of inner sense, i.e.,\nthinking beings, which would thus result in a doctrine of body and a\ndoctrine of soul. Kant then argues that because “the possibility of\ndeterminate natural things cannot be cognized from their mere concepts\n… it is still required that the intuition\ncorresponding to the concept be given a priori, that is, that\nthe concept be constructed” (4:470), which is a task that requires\nmathematics. This is Kant's justification for his famous claim that\n“in any special doctrine of nature there can be only as much\nproper science as there is mathematics therein”\n(4:470). This argument suggests that the necessity required of the\npure part of natural science derives from the necessity of the rules\nby which the mathematical construction of determinate things must\nproceed. \n\nKant then uses the claim that science proper requires the construction\nof the concept of the object in a priori intuition to exclude the\npossibility that chemistry and psychology, at least as they were\npracticed at that time, could count as science proper. In the case of\nchemistry, the problem is that “no law of the approach or withdrawal\nof the parts of matter can be specified according to which …\ntheir motions and all the consequences thereof can be made intuitive\nand presented a priori in space (a demand that will only with\ngreat difficulty ever be fulfilled)” (4:471). Since its principles are\n“merely empirical,” it can, at best, be a “systematic art”\n(ibid.). The case of psychology is more complex, since Kant provides\n(at least) two separate reasons in the Preface for denying it the\nstatus of natural science proper. First, Kant claims that mathematics\nis inapplicable to the phenomena of inner sense and their laws, though\nhe grants that the law of continuity (discussed, e.g., at\nA207–209/B253–255 and A228–229/B281 in the Critique of Pure\nReason) ought to apply to changes in our representations as\nwell. He downplays the significance of this application of the law of\ncontinuity, however, by noting that time has only one dimension, which\ndoes not provide enough material to extend our cognition\nsignificantly. Second, Kant also complains that empirical psychology\ncannot separate and recombine the phenomena of inner sense at will;\nrather, our inner observations can be separated “only by mere division\nin thought” (4:471). Kant's fuller views on chemistry and psychology\nwill be discussed further below. \n\nSecond, in explaining how mathematics can be applied to bodies Kant\nasserts that “principles for the construction of the concepts\nthat belong to the possibility of matter in general must first be\nintroduced. Therefore a complete analysis of the concept of a matter\nin general [must be provided in which it] makes use of no particular\nexperiences, but only that which it finds in the isolated (although\nintrinsically empirical) concept itself, in relation to the pure\nintuitions in space and time, and in accordance with laws that already\nessentially attach to the concept of nature in general” (4:472). Kant\nthen explains that this means that the concept of matter must be\ndetermined according to the Critique of Pure Reason's\ncategories of quantity, quality, relation, and modality (4:474–476).\nFurther, Kant holds that “a new determination” (4:476) must be added\nto the concept of matter in each chapter of the Metaphysical\nFoundations. This suggests not only that the principles argued\nfor in the Metaphysical Foundations are to be developed “in\naccordance with” the principles defended in the Critique of Pure\nReason, but also that both the concept of matter and the\nMetaphysical Foundations itself is structured according to\nthe Critique of Pure Reason's table of categories. \n\nUnfortunately, these points of clarification do not resolve all of the\nissues that are immediately raised by Kant's pronouncements about what\nis required for natural science proper. One further issue that is\nrelevant here concerns the concept of matter that is at the heart of\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. Kant introduces it in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (A847–848/B875–876) as the concept of\nsomething that is impenetrable, extended, and inert. Yet, in the\nbeginning of the Preface of the Metaphysical Foundations, he\ndescribes it as whatever is an object of outer sense, and later he\nargues that the “basic determination of something that is to be an\nobject of the outer senses had to be motion, because only thereby can\nthese senses be affected” (4:476). Whatever weight one accords Kant's\njustification of the connection between matter, outer sense, and\nmotion, one faces a dilemma. If the concept of matter, most\nfundamentally, is simply the concept of any object of outer sense,\nthen how is it still empirical in any genuine sense (and what has\nbecome of the structural difference Kant draws between the\nCritique of Pure Reason and the Metaphysical\nFoundations)? If, by contrast, impenetrability, extension, and\nmovability are deemed the basic traits of the concept of matter, then\nhow can one know a priori that any object we might encounter in outer\nsense must behave in accordance with the laws that would govern matter\nso defined? \n\nMoreover, even if one can find an appropriately nuanced sense in which\nthe concept of matter is empirical while still allowing for an\nappropriate kind of necessity, questions can still be posed about the\n“new determinations” that are to be added to that concept in each\nchapter of the Metaphysical Foundations. For example, what is\nthe justification for each specific determination that is added when\none thinks of matter as having a quantity, a quality, etc.? Also, what\nis the relationship between each new determination of matter and the\nvarious claims that Kant makes in each chapter of the Metaphysical\nFoundations? In particular, when Kant explicitly invokes\nprinciples for constructing concepts belonging to the possibility of\nmatter, is his idea that these principles are required insofar as they\nmake experience of the relevant “new determination” of matter possible\n(so that Kant would be developing a transcendental argument in the\nMetaphysical Foundations similar in many respects to the\nCritique of Pure Reason)? Answers to these questions depend\non how one interprets the arguments Kant develops throughout the\nMetaphysical Foundations. \n\nThe conception of science that Kant presents in the Preface has been\nthe focus of considerable attention over the past several decades. In\nthe German literature, the issues raised above have been discussed at\nlength by Plaass (1965), Schäfer (1966), Hoppe (1969), Gloy\n(1976), and Cramer (1985). Pollok (2001) has recently produced a\ndetailed and comprehensive textual commentary on the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Important work has also been done in the English\nliterature by Walker (1974), Brittan (1978), Buchdahl (1968, 1969, and\n1986), Parsons (1984), Butts (1986), and Watkins (1998a). Friedman (1992, 2001,\n2002 and 2013) has been especially influential on these issues as well. \n\nThe first chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhoronomy, considers the quantity of motion of matter and how it is to\nbe constructed in intuition a priori (so as to produce the kind of\nrules that are necessary for our experience of matter in\nmotion). Since extension and impenetrability are not directly relevant\nto how different magnitudes (or degrees) of motion can be represented,\nKant restricts his discussion in this chapter to matter considered as\na point. Since the motion of a point in space can be represented\nstraightforwardly, the main issue is how to represent the composition\nof two different motions. Kant's primary claim in this chapter is that\ndue to the relativity of space (i.e., the fact that every motion can\nbe viewed arbitrarily as either the motion of a body in a space at\nrest, or as a body in a state of rest in a space which is in motion in\nthe opposite direction with the same velocity) “the composition\nof two motions of one and the same point can only be thought in such a\nway that one of them is represented in absolute space, and, instead of\nthe other, a motion of the relative space with the same speed\noccurring in the opposite direction is represented as the same as the\nlatter” (4:490). The proof of this Theorem considers the three\npossible cases for the composition of two motions: (i) The two motions\nare in the same direction; (ii) the two motions are in opposite\ndirections; (iii) the two motions enclose an angle. Kant then shows\nhow one can construct a priori in intuition a single motion out of the\ntwo motions described in cases (i)-(iii). The synthetic a priori\noutcome of this constructive procedure is a composition theorem that\ncovers two fundamental results of classical physics: the parallelogram\nrule for velocity addition, and the Galilean kinematic\ntransformations.  The theorem is needed for architectonic reasons too,\nnot just as a foundation for science. Kant uses the composition\ntheorem as a premise in his Dynamics, so as to infer a priori to\nforces from the composite motions they cause (e.g., 4:497). And, he\ninvokes the theorem explicitly in his Mechanics, in the course of\n“constructing the communication of motion,” i.e. deriving the laws of\nimpact (4:546). \n\nUntil recently, very little has been written directly on Kant's\nPhoronomy. (By contrast, Kant's philosophy of mathematics has long\nreceived considerable attention.) Palter (1972) first broached the\nPhoronomy from the modern standpoint of coordinate transformations\nbetween frames. Pollok (2001) is a historically rich\ncommentary. Friedman (2013) untangles the complex strands of thought\nin Kant's chapter. His leading idea is that Kant's categories of\nquantity (of the First Critique) guarantee that motion is a magnitude,\nhence mathematics is applicable to the motions of bodies--as\nkinematics. \n\nThe second chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nDynamics, considers how it is possible to experience matter as filling\na determinate region in space. Propositions 1–4 are devoted to\nexhibiting the nature and necessity of repulsive forces. In\nProposition 1 Kant argues that repulsive force is required for matter\nto fill space, since solidity, understood by “Lambert and others” as\nthe property matter would have by means of “its mere\nexistence” (4:497), cannot truly explain how one matter\nresists another matter's attempt to penetrate it. Kant then specifies\nseveral central features of repulsive forces in Propositions 2 and\n3. Repulsive forces admit of degrees to infinity, since one must\nalways be able to think of a slightly greater or lesser force, and\nalthough matter can be compressed to infinity, it can never be\npenetrated, since that would require an infinite compressing force,\nwhich is impossible. \n\nIn Proposition 4 Kant draws an important consequence from his\ncharacterization of repulsive forces, namely that matter is infinitely\ndivisible (4:503). What is especially striking about this point is\nthat it represents a significant departure from his own earlier\nPhysical Monadology, where he had accepted attractive and\nrepulsive forces, but denied the infinite divisibility of what\nultimately constitutes matter, namely physical points or monads. It is\ntrue that part of Kant's rationale for his change of position on this\npoint stems from the “critical turn” undertaken in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (and in its Second Antinomy in\nparticular). For once one recognizes that both space and spatial\nproperties such as divisibility are not properties of things in\nthemselves but rather only appearances, one can reject the proposition\nthat seems to necessitate the acceptance of simple substances, namely\nthe idea that simple substances must precede the wholes they compose\n(4:506). However, Kant's proof also seems to depend, in its details,\nnot merely on the idea that every space is filled by means of\nsome repulsive force or other, but on the stronger claim that\nevery space is divisible into smaller spaces that are filled by\ndifferent repulsive forces. \n\nPropositions 5–8 are all devoted to attractive force. In Proposition 5\nKant argues that matter must have an attractive force in order to fill\nspace. Kant's argument is that if there were only repulsive forces,\nthen matter “would disperse itself to infinity” (4:508)\nsince neither space nor other matter could limit it. Proposition 6\nargues that both attractive and repulsive forces must be considered\nessential to matter. That is, attractive forces alone are not\nsufficient to account for matter filling a space, since if matter\nconsisted solely of attractive forces, there would be no force to\ncounteract the attractive force being exercised and the universe would\ncollapse into a single point. Together, Propositions 5 and 6 make up a\n‘balancing argument’, which Kant had already used in the\nearlier Physical Monadology. (A balancing argument is an\nexistence proof for a type of force. Its premises are (1) an accepted\nuniversal fact, viz.  that a certain stable configuration obtains; and\n(2) a type of force independently known to exist. The argument seeks\nto prove that the stability in question is impossible unless a second\nkind of force exists to balance the first kind. In Kant's particular\nversion of the balancing argument, the universal fact is the constancy\nof mass density in a control volume; and the given force is “original\nrepulsion,” whose existence he proves in Proposition 4.) Proposition 7\nthen specifies how attractive forces are to be understood, namely as\nthe immediate action of matter on other matter through empty space\n(and therefore at a distance). Kant thus directly confronts the\nmetaphysical question of how to understand attraction that Newton\nattempted to avoid by positing it merely mathematically. As Kant\ninterprets the situation, Newton “abstracts from all hypotheses\npurporting to answer the question as to the cause of the universal\nattraction of matter … [since] this question is physical or\nmetaphysical, but not mathematical” (4:515). In response to the\n“most common objection to immediate action at a distance,”\nnamely “that a matter cannot act immediately where it is\nnot” (4:513), Kant argues that action at a distance is no\nmore problematic than action by contact (whether it be by collision or\npressure), since in both cases a body is simply acting outside\nitself. Proposition 8 concludes by arguing that attractive forces act\nimmediately to infinity and by adding a “preliminary\nsuggestion” (4:518) as to how one might be able to construct the\nconcept of cohesion (which Kant understands as attraction that is\nrestricted to contact). \n\nIn the General Remark to Dynamics Kant addresses two main issues.\nFirst, Kant considers how it is that the specific varieties of matter\n(e.g., water as different from mercury) might be reduced, at least in\nprinciple, to the fundamental forces of attraction and repulsion. The\nsecond issue concerns the fundamental distinction between the\n“mathematical-mechanical” and the\n“metaphysical-dynamical mode of explanation”. The former\nmode of explanation, which is associated with the postulation of atoms\nand the void, employs nothing more than the shapes and motions of\nfundamental particles and empty interstices interspersed among\nthem. It contrasts with the metaphysical-dynamical mode, which employs\nfundamental moving forces (e.g., attraction and repulsion) in its\nexplanations. Kant grants that the mathematical-mechanical mode has an\nadvantage over the metaphysical-dynamical mode, since its fundamental\nposits can be represented (indeed, “verified” (4:525))\nmathematically, whereas he repeatedly admits that the possibility of\nfundamental forces can never be comprehended, i.e., their possibility\ncan never be rendered certain.  However, Kant thinks that this\nadvantage is outweighed by two disadvantages. First, by presupposing\nabsolute impenetrability, the mathematical-mechanical mode of\nexplanation accepts an “empty concept” at its\nfoundation. Second, by giving up all forces that would be inherent in\nmatter, such a mode of explanation provides the imagination with more\nfreedom “than is truly consistent with the caution of\nphilosophy” (4:525). \n\nGiven that the bulk of Kant's matter theory is presented in the\nDynamics, it is unsurprising that it has received the greatest amount\nof attention in the literature. Of particular note are discussions by\nBuchdahl (1968, 1969), Brittan (1978), Kitcher (1983), Butts (1986),\nCarrier (1990), Friedman (1990), Malzkorn (1998), Warren (2001, 2010),\nPollok (2002), Holden (2004), and Engelhard (2005). Friedman (2013) is\nan extensive commentary, under the overarching theme that Kant in the\nDynamics aims to explain how certain features of body – density,\nvolume, static weight – become mathematizable, as Newton's\ndynamics illustrates paradigmatically.  \n\nThe third chapter of Kant's Metaphysical Foundations, the\nMechanics, concerns how it is possible to experience matter as having\na moving force, that is, how one matter communicates its motion to\nanother by means of its moving force. Kant begins, in Proposition 1,\nby clarifying how the quantity of matter is to be estimated before\nstating, in Propositions 2–4, three Laws of Mechanics. \n\nAfter first defining the quantity of matter and the quantity of motion\n(or, in contemporary terms, impulse, i=mv), Kant\nasserts that the quantity of matter, in comparison with every\nother matter, can be estimated only by the quantity of motion at a\ngiven speed (4:537). Kant's proof proceeds by way of elimination. The\nquantity of matter, which is the aggregate of the movable in a\ndeterminate space, cannot be estimated by counting the number of parts\nit has, since, as was established in the Dynamics, every matter is\ninfinitely divisible.  Nor can one estimate the quantity of matter\nmerely by considering its volume, since different matters can have\ndifferent specific densities.  As a result, the only universally\napplicable way of estimating the quantity of matter is to hold the\nvelocity of matter constant. \n\nIn Proposition 2, Kant states his First Law of Mechanics: the total\nquantity of matter remains the same throughout all changes in matter\n(4:541). His proof seems to rely (i) on the principle of the First\nAnalogy of Experience that no substance arises or perishes throughout\nany change in nature and (ii) on the identification of what in matter\nmust be substantial. On this latter point, Kant quickly assumes that\nthe ultimate subject of all accidents inhering in matter must be the\nmovable in space, and that its quantity is the aggregate of the\nmovable in space. In his remark to this proposition, Kant explicitly\nnotes that there is a crucial difference between spatial and\nnon-spatial substances, since the latter, unlike the former, could\ngradually fade away by degrees. (Kant cites the possibility of\nconsciousness as a concrete example.) Kant uses this difference to\nargue that since the quantity of matter consists in a plurality of\nreal things external to each other that cannot fade away (as\nconsciousness might), the only way to decrease its quantity is by\ndivision. \n\nKant's Second Law of Mechanics, stated in Proposition 3, is that every\nchange in matter has an external cause. (Immediately after this\nprinciple, Kant adds in parentheses a version of the law of inertia\nthat is much closer to Newton's: “every body persists in its state of\nrest or motion, in the same direction, and with the same speed, if it is\nnot compelled by an external cause to leave this state” (4:543). Since\nKant's Second Law of Mechanics is not identical to Newton's law of\ninertia, it would require argument to show that, and by means of what\nadditional assumptions, the former entails the latter.) The proof of\nthe main principle depends on the Second Analogy of Experience (which\nasserts that all changes occur in accordance with the law of cause and\neffect and thus entails that every change in matter has a cause) as\nwell as on the further assumption that matter has no internal grounds\nof determinations (such as thinking and desiring), but rather only\nexternal relations in space. In his remark to this proposition, which\nclarifies this “law of inertia,” Kant explains that inertia is to be\ncontrasted with life or the ability of a substance to determine itself\nto act from an internal principle. Thus, a body's inertia\n“does not mean a positive striving to conserve its state”\n(4:544), but rather what it does not do, its\nlifelessness. \n\nKant also asserts that the very possibility of natural science proper\ndepends on the law of inertia, since the rejection of it would be\nhylozoism, “the death of all natural philosophy” (4:544). In a later\nremark in the Mechanics, Kant explicitly objects that “the terminology\nof inertial force (vis inertiae) must be entirely banished\nfrom natural science, not only because it carries with it a\ncontradiction in terms, nor even because the law of inertia\n(lifelessness) might thereby be easily confused with the law of\nreaction in every communicated motion, but primarily because the\nmistaken idea of those who are not properly acquainted with the\nmechanical laws is thereby maintained and even strengthened” (4:550).\nKant goes on to point out that if inertia were to entail an active\nforce of resistance, then it would be possible that when one moving\nbody hits another, the moving body has to apply part of its motion\nsolely to overcome the inertia of the one at rest and might not have\nany motion left over, as it were, to set the body at rest into motion,\nwhich is contrary to experience (and Proposition 2). \n\nKant's Third Law of Mechanics, expressed in Proposition 4, asserts the\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion.  Kant\nformulates a version of the Third Analogy of Experience (according to\nwhich all external action in the world is interaction) and suggests\nthat the main point at issue in mechanics is establishing that mutual\naction is necessarily reaction. Kant's argument for this law\nis based on the following line of thought: (i) if all changes of\nmatter are changes of motion; (ii) if all changes of motion are\nreciprocal and equal (since one body cannot move closer to/farther\naway from another body without the second body moving closer\nto/farther away from the first body and by exactly the same amount);\nand (iii) if every change of matter has an external cause (a\nproposition that was established as the Second Law of Mechanics), then\nthe cause of the change of motion of the one body entails an equal and\nopposite cause of a change of motion of the other body or, in short,\naction must be equal to reaction. \n\nIn Remark 1, Kant then shows how his position differs from that of\nother authors. Newton “by no means dared to prove this law a\npriori, and therefore appealed rather to experience”\n(4:449). Kepler likewise derived it from experience, though he went\nfurther, conceiving of it in terms of a special force of inertia.\nCertain unnamed “transfusionists” (presumably Locke and perhaps\nDescartes or Rohault) attempted to deny the law altogether by\nsuggesting that motion could simply be transferred from one body to\nanother in the communication of motion, a view Kant rejects on the\ngrounds that explaining the communication of motion in terms of the\ntransfer of motion is no explanation at all and also amounts to\nadmitting that accidents could be literally transferred from one\nsubstance to another. \n\nKant's Laws of Mechanics have been discussed widely in the secondary\nliterature. One can point to discussions by Palter (1972), Duncan\n(1984), Friedman (1989, 1992, and 1995), Brittan (1995), Westphal\n(1995), Carrier (2001), and Watkins (1997 and 1998b). Much of the\nmodern tradition of scholarship used to regard Kant's laws of\nmechanics as derived from, or even identical with, Newton's three laws\nin the Principia. Watkins (1997; 1998b) showed that Kant's\nformulation and justification of his laws was strongly influenced by a\nphilosophy of nature stemming from Leibniz not Newton. Stan (2013)\nfurther corroborated these findings. As a result, it is safe to say\nthat Kant's foundations of mechanics were significantly shaped by\npost-Leibnizian rationalism too, not just Newton's mechanics. This\nfact is now reflected in Friedman (2013), the most recent and detailed\naccount of Kant's interpretation of the conceptual foundations of\nmechanics. Stan (2014) examines the conceptual link between Kant's\ntheory of matter and his laws of mechanics. \n\nThe final chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhenomenology, focuses on how the motion of matter can be experienced\nmodally, that is, in terms of it being possibly, actually, or\nnecessarily in motion. Its three Propositions specify (in accordance,\nKant suggests, with the results of the three previous chapters) that\n(i) rectilinear motion is a merely possible predicate of matter, (ii)\ncircular motion is an actual predicate of matter, and (iii) the equal\nand opposite motion of one matter with respect to another is a\nnecessary motion of that matter. In the General Remark to the\nPhenomenology, Kant discusses the status of absolute space, which had\nbeen presupposed by the possible, actual, and necessary motions of\nmatter at issue in the three main propositions, and explains that\nsince it is not itself an object of experience, it must be represented\nby means of an idea of reason (in Kant's technical sense of “idea”,\nnamely as a concept for which a corresponding object could never be\ngiven to us in intuition). Though we can never know absolute space, it\nnonetheless functions as a regulative principle that guides us in\nour scientific practice by forcing us to look for further conditions\nfor the conditioned objects we meet with in experience. Kant's view\nthat ideas of reason can function as regulative principles is\ndeveloped in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic in the\nCritique of Pure Reason. \nFriedman's interpretation (1992) of the Phenomenology deserves special\nmention. According to him, in light of Kant's rejection of Newton's\nabsolute space and time, he must give an account of the concept of\ntrue motion – as change of true place over time – presupposed by\nclassical mechanics. To this end, Kant “views the laws of motion as\ndefinitive or constitutive of the spatio-temporal framework of\nNewtonian theory,” hence these laws “count as a priori” for him\n(p. 143). The reason Kant takes them as constitutive is the\nfollowing. In Kant's Phenomenology, the three Newtonian\nlaws define a concept of true motion: the true motions of\nbodies just are those that obey the dynamical laws. Moreover,\nthe concept must be given “objective meaning in experience,”\nviz. measured empirically. To do so, Kant views Newton's three laws as\nholding primarily in a privileged system of reference, namely the\ncenter-of-mass (CM) frame of the system of the world, which the\nCM-frame of our Solar System approximates to a very good degree. Thus,\nby measuring the motions of bodies relative to this frame, we produce\nobjective experience of these motions. However, this frame must first\nbe located. To do so, Kant thinks, we must likewise count the\nlaw of universal gravitation as a priori, not empirical-inductive. If\nwe know a priori that all bodies in the Solar System necessarily\nattract each other, from their observable, mutually-induced\naccelerations we can infer their masses. In turn, knowing their masses\nwill enable us to locate the CM-frame of the system. (In a system of\nbodies, the center of mass is the point relative to which the bodies'\ndistances are in inverse proportion to their masses.) With respect to\nthis distinguished frame, the motions of bodies count as their true\nmotions, Friedman claims. Hence, immediate and essential gravitation\n“cannot be straightforwardly obtained from our experience of matter\nand its motions – by some sort of inductive argument, say”\n– because universal gravitation is “necessarily presupposed in\nmaking an objective experience of matter and its motions possible in\nthe first place” (pp.  157–158). However, the CM-frame of the Solar\nSystem is just approximately an inertial frame. Scientific inquiry\nmust ultimately look beyond it, to better and better approximations of\nan inertial frame. And, Kant's absolute space is just the concept that\ndirects our search for such approximations. More recently, Friedman\nupdated and expanded his interpretation in (2013). In view of recent\nscholarship, Friedman has now made a convincing case that it\nis Kant's laws of mechanics – not Newton's three laws, as\nclaimed in (1992) – that define the privileged frame (Kantian\nabsolute space) relative to which bodies have true motions, in the\nPhenomenology.   \n\nApart from Friedman's interpretation, there is relatively little\nsecondary literature that discusses Kant's Phenomenology. Palter\n(1971) interprets Kant's doctrine of absolute space and motion in\nterms of transformation groups for Galilean kinematics. Carrier (1992)\nprovides an alternative to Friedman's account of Kant on absolute\nspace. Stan (forthcoming) is an alternative to Friedman's reading of\nKant's doctrine of circular motion, and its relation to Newton's\ndynamics.  \n\nKant's interest in physics continued after the publication of the\nMetaphysical Foundations, in fact, until the very end of his\nproductive years. Though Kant never completed a manuscript that could\nbe put forward as a publication, the various notes, sketches, and\ndrafts on topics in physics that he was working on intensively during\nthis time (especially after 1796) were gathered together over a\ncentury after his death and published as his so-called Opus\npostumum. \n\nDespite the fragmentary nature of the Opus postumum, Kant\nmakes it clear that it is designed to fill an important gap in his\nsystem. Just as the Metaphysical Foundations had attempted to\nconnect the transcendental principles of the Critique of Pure\nReason and the principles that explain how matter is possible,\nthe Opus postumum undertakes the task of effecting a\ntransition from the special metaphysics of nature contained in the\nMetaphysical Foundations to physics itself. However, Kant\ndoes not clarify adequately what systematic principles would guide\nthis transition project, nor is it clear whether he takes the project\nto yield substantive principles or heuristic guidelines. On the one\nhand, in a note that stems from a period shortly after the publication\nof the Metaphysical Foundations, Kant suggests that one could\n“follow the clue given by the categories and bring into play the\nmoving forces of matter according to their quantity, quality,\nrelation, and modality” (21:311), a procedure that could be\nsimilar to that of the\nMetaphysical Foundations. On the other hand, if the\nMetaphysical Foundations already presupposes an empirical\nconcept (namely matter), the transition to be carried out in the\nOpus postumum cannot be understood as moving from something\nnon-empirical to something empirical. As Kant struggles with the\nproblems that result from trying to account for now much more specific\nfeatures of matter, it is unclear that (or how) the categories are\nsupposed to be of help in structuring Kant's argument.  Thus, the\nprecise argumentative structure of the Opus postumum (i.e.,\nits relationship to Kant's other works and its fundamental\npresuppositions) remains problematic. Equally problematic is the exact\nnature of Kant's transition project. Given his stated aim to account\nfor\nspecific features of matter—e.g., particular\naggregation states, special forces—one would think that\nsuch contingent features are a problem for empirical science\nnot philosophy, since Kant sees the latter as pursuing knowledge that\nis, in various senses, necessary. \n\nWhatever its form, the content of the Opus postumum includes\nreflections on a series of important topics in physics. Three clusters\nare particularly noteworthy. (1) Kant develops more detailed views\nabout a number of outstanding issues concerning matter theory that he\nhad discussed (often in a tentative way) in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, such as fluidity, rigidity, cohesion, and the\nquantity of matter. (2) Kant argues for the existence of an\nall-encompassing ether. This might seem to be a natural development,\nsince the Metaphysical Foundations was non-committal on the\npoint, but what is surprising is that Kant thinks that the ether can\nbe established a priori (e.g., 21:222), which might seem to conflict\nwith Kant's project in the Critique of Pure Reason (or with\nhis description of his position as “formal idealism,” 4:337). (3) Kant\nalso explores the idea that the subject must posit itself in positing\nthe various forces in matter, a doctrine that has come to be known as\nthe Selbstsetzungslehre, and attempts to incorporate it into\nhis views on how man is situated in between the world of experience\nand God, whose existence is a central requirement of morality. \n\nThe Opus postumum has long been a topic of interest\nespecially insofar as it offers the hope of clarification and\ndevelopment of central issues in Kant's Critical philosophy. While\nmuch of the original literature focussing on it was in German (Adickes\n1920, Hoppe 1969, Tuschling 1971, and, more recently, Blasche, 1991\nand Emundts, 2004), it has received increased attention of late in\nEnglish with discussions by Friedman (1992, chapter 5), Förster\n(2000), Edwards (2000), Guyer (2001), and Hall (2006, 2009). \n\nKant was interested not only in the inanimate bodies studied by\nphysics, but also in living organisms, which he viewed as deserving of\nadditional philosophical scrutiny due to their special status, for two\nreasons. First, the symmetries and regularities of their structure and\nworkings make them “in the highest degree contingent” (5:\n360) and “mechanically inexplicable.” Second, organisms\ncome from their own kind; grow their own functional parts, or organs,\nand repair them if they become damaged; and do in general exhibit\nhomeostasis. These facts about them prompt Kant to claim that an\norganism is “cause and effect of itself” (5: 370). In a\nsense, a living entity is self-caused, and indeed by a causality that\nwe can grasp solely “under the idea of purposes as a\nprinciple” (5: 383). Organisms, in other words, are\n“natural purposes,” or naturally occurring ensembles of\nparts purposefully fitted and working in unity. \n\nIt is just these peculiarities that create philosophical challenges\nnot met with in physics and chemistry. Kant tackles them in the latter\nhalf of his third magnum opus, the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790). In particular, he claims that attempting to\nexplain organisms creates an inevitable conflict within reflective\njudgment, the faculty we employ in empirical concept formation,\ntaxonomic classification, and the explanatory unification of\nparticular laws. Kant describes that conflict in the Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment (CJ §§ 69–78; 5:\n385–415). The Antinomy obtains between two regulative principles,\nherein prefixed by an ‘R’ to distinguish them from two\nsimilar\nconstitutive principles that Kant briefly discusses in the\nsame place: R-thesis:\nAll generation of material things and their forms must\nbe judged as possible in accordance with merely mechanical\nlaws. \nR-antithesis:Some products of material nature cannot be judged\nas possible according to merely mechanical laws (judging them\nrequires an entirely different law of causality, namely that of final\ncausality) (5: 387). \n\nA great deal of scholarship has aimed to elucidate this antinomy,\nand in the last decade these interpretive efforts have gained new\nmomentum (see also the entry “Kant’s Aesthetics and\nTeleology” in this encyclopedia). In particular, sustained\nattention has been given to three questions: In what sense are\norganisms inexplicable mechanically, for Kant? What exactly is the\ncontradiction that generates the Antinomy? And precisely how does Kant\nsolve it? \n\nFirst, clarification is needed about Kant’s claim that\norganisms cannot be explained ‘mechanically.’ In the\nEnlightenment, ‘mechanical’ was used in at least two\nsenses: broadly, to denote explanation by physico-chemical laws of\nefficient causation; and narrowly, restricted to the theory of\n‘compound machines,’ or assemblies of movable parts used to\ndisplace loads or transfer momentum, e.g. engines and watches.\nMcLaughlin (1990) takes Kant to mean ‘mechanical’ in this\nlatter sense. In artificial machines, parts precede the\nwhole temporally, and determine it: the machine’s\nconfiguration results from summation over the parts; and its laws of\noperation are the same as those governing the parts. But organisms are\ndifferent: the whole precedes its parts, or organs; and it has\nfunctions and aim-directed behaviors not present in them. Hence,\norganisms are mechanically inexplicable. Ginsborg (2004) construes\nKant’s claim along different lines, in two senses. According to\none, to explain something mechanically is to show that its production\nresults, or would result, from the “unaided powers of matter as\nsuch,” i.e. Newtonian forces of attraction and repulsion, and\n“crude unorganized matter,” or arbitrary initial conditions\nsuch as masses, charges, configurations and motions. Organisms are\ninexplicable in this sense because their arising would be “in the\nhighest degree contingent.” This is the notion operative in the\nAntinomy of Teleological Judgment, Ginsborg contends. But, she has\nargued, there is a second, stronger sense. Not only are organisms\ninexplicable by reduction to the structure and powers of their\norgans—rather, their symmetries and regularities and powers are\nnot explicable from the “moving forces” of their\ninorganic particles either. Organism-level powers are not\nvector sums or integrals of physico-chemical forces that accelerate or\nreconfigure sub-visible particles.  \n\nSecond, interpreters have also scrutinized the exact nature of the\nAntinomy. Insofar as the thesis and the antithesis are regulative\nprinciples, they may be seen as research policies, and those can be\npursued separately, at different times, hence with no\ncontradiction. Then why are they antinomic? Watkins (2009, § 2.2)\nexplains that the two theses do not just recommend explanatory policies\nbut express commitments to judging in a determinate way about\nbiological phenomena. As such, they would be contradictory commitments:\nto judge organisms purely mechanistically and to judge them\nnon-mechanistically. Teufel (2011) reads the two theses as hypothetical\nimperatives, imposed upon reflective judgment by practical reason. The\nAntinomy ensues, he contends, because they demand contradictory courses\nof cognitive conduct: to judge that mechanistic laws suffice to explain\norganisms and that they are insufficient for that\ntask.  \n\nMoreover, for each antinomy in the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant derives both thesis and antithesis by deductive argument from\nalleged a priori premises. But, in the Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment, he does not take that route. This makes quite pressing the\nquestion of his justification for the two R-claims above. As to the\nR-thesis, one might think that it can be easily deduced from\nKant’s three Laws of Mechanics. However, we must remember that\nthose laws are constitutive principles, whereas the R-thesis is\nregulative. A better interpretive avenue is that Kant’s three\nlaws constrain the spectrum of particular empirical laws, including\nlaws for biology, that scientists may seek. The constraint is that the\nLaws of Mechanics are basic: no other laws of material nature explain\nor ground them, while they must explain all other laws,\ndirectly or indirectly. So, for biological regularities to be turned\ninto genuine laws, they must be integrable with the system of already\nknown mechanical laws, and ultimately explained by the three Laws of\nMechanics, the basis for all “interconnected experiential\ncognition” (5: 386). Even less well understood is Kant’s\njustification for the R-antithesis. Not only is there no official\nproof, it is not easy to know what the proof must establish. The\nR-thesis strongly implies that at issue is the origin of\norganisms; in contrast, the R-antithesis is about judging their\npossibility, which has to do with structure and functioning\nnot production (Ginsborg 2001, 236). These are different aspects of\norganisms, and proving that they are mechanically inexplicable would\nrequire different arguments. \n\nThird, Kant’s solution to the Antinomy has received sustained\nattention. In the first two Critiques, his general approach is to\nargue, for each antinomy, that both thesis and antithesis presuppose\nTranscendental Realism, insofar as they make claims about things in\nthemselves; and to adduce Transcendental Idealism as the vantage point\nfrom which the initial contradiction is solved. However, that is not\nKant’s approach to the Antinomy of Teleological Judgment.\nAccordingly, interpreters have sought to reconstruct a different\nsolution on Kant’s behalf. Quarfood (2004) and Förster\n(2008) take the notion of an intuitive understanding (expounded at 5:\n401–10) as the key to Kant’s answer. In particular, Förster\nexplains, intellects like ours are discursive: they grasp objects\nthrough concepts as ‘parts’ assembled in\ntemporally-extended judgments, and so mechanistically, he alleges.\nHence, we need the concept ‘purpose’ to judge organisms\nsolely because we have discursive intellects. However, an intuitive\nunderstanding could grasp organisms without purpose-concepts and\nregulative principles about judging teleologically. Hence, for this\nunderstanding, the R-thesis and R-antithesis need not be true, and so\nno antinomy arises. Breitenbach (2008) contends that the Antinomy is\nsolved, or rather dissolved, if we note that thesis and antithesis are\nnot really contradictory but complementary. They govern (reflecting)\nacts of judging in different contexts: the mechanistic R-thesis\nregulates explanatory conduct in empirical biology, whereas the\nR-antithesis governs ordinary judging about living nature as\nexperienced in everyday, pre-theoretical encounters with it. The two\nprinciples epitomize “two different views on nature,” and\nare compossible (466). They just appear to be in contradiction; in\nfact, they complement each other, indispensably. McLaughlin (1990)\nsubmits that the Antinomy does not arise simpliciter but only\nunder a special assumption, viz. that everything in nature is\nobjectively explainable by us (162). Reject the assumption, and the\ncontradiction vanishes, insofar as the R-thesis and the R-antithesis\ncan both be true, but for different domains: the former holds for\nphenomena explainable by us, the latter for phenomena not so\nexplainable. McLaughlin does not offer a general criterion for\n‘explicability by us’ attributable to Kant, however, apart\nfrom mechanical explicability. Ginsborg (2008) focuses on how the\ncontradiction might be resolved in the context of scientific\ninvestigation rather than in abstract, general philosophical terms.\nBuilding on Kant’s remark about subordinating mechanism to\nteleology (5: 414), Ginsborg contends that natural historians and\nphysiologists may well explain the origin and workings of organisms\n‘mechanistically,’ purely by physico-chemical laws,\nprovided they apply them not to “crude” but to\n“organized” matter, i.e. organic stuff already endowed with\na “formative drive,” a generic disposition to grow,\nreproduce and self-maintain. In turn, this organized matter itself is\nunintelligible without appeal to purpose and design terms. Thus,\nbiologists ‘subordinate’ mechanism to teleology, and so the\nantinomic conflict between them is removed.  \n\nWhile these interpretive proposals collectively advance our\nunderstanding of how the Antinomy might be defused, each has its share\nof philosophical difficulties, as spelled out in Watkins (2009).\nMoreover, few of these construals heed close to Kant’s words,\nwhich suggest strongly that his solution relies indispensably\non a “supersensible ground” (5: 413), or explanatory\nprinciple located in the noumenal world. That ground could\nunite both mechanism and teleology, by making both antinomic theses\njointly derivable or explainable from it. However, since humans can\nhave “no positive determinate” knowledge of any\nsupersensible entity, the Antinomy is solvable in principle rather than\nsolved in fact. Kant (at least in his official solution) does not seem\nto provide the details for an actual account of how the conflict at the\nheart of biological explanation is removed. The limitations that beset\nour understanding of Kant’s philosophy of biology so far, some of\nwhich we have expounded above, continue to drive interpretive efforts\nto cast more light on that part of his doctrine, as exemplified in Goy\nand Watkins (forthcoming). \n\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, Kant’s Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment has been usefully discussed in Allison (1991),\nCohen (2004), Ginsborg (2001), Kreines (2005), Steigerwald (2006),\nZanetti (1993) and Zumbach (1984); see also the entry\n“Kant’s Aesthetics and Teleology” in this\nencyclopedia. \n\nIn the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations Kant claims\nthat chemistry, at least as he understood it in 1786, was not science\n“proper”, but such a claim leaves open the possibility\nthat chemistry could be fully scientific in some other sense or that,\nwith time, it could develop into science proper. Up through 1787, Kant\naccepted the fundamental tenets of Stahl's chemical theory, according\nto which water and air are fundamental elements that function as\nvehicles for change in both inflammable and “earthy”\nsubstances, and he commented on particular issues in chemistry in his\nvarious physics lectures. As a result, it is clear that Kant considers\nchemistry to be a science in\nsome sense even during the Critical period. However,\nbeginning in the mid-1780s (and extending through the mid to late\n1790s), Kant becomes aware of significant new developments in\nchemistry (as evidenced in the Danziger Physik and documented\nin Lichtenberg's revised, third edition of Erxleben's\nAnfangsgründe der Naturlehre from which Kant lectured).\nIn particular, Kant comes to reject Stahl's theory, favoring\nLavoisier's anti-phlogistic account of combustion and calcination,\nwhich relied on his doctrines of latent heat and the caloric theory of\nthe states of aggregation. While Kant never explicitly claims that\nchemistry, so understood, can be considered science proper, Kant's\ninterest in these issues in the Opus postumum suggests that\nhe was optimistic about providing the kind of foundation that would be\nrequired for it to attain this status. \n\nKant's views on chemistry have not been widely discussed in the\nsecondary literature. However, outstanding discussions of Kant's views\non the topic can be found in Carrier (1990, 2001) and Friedman (1992,\nchapter 5, III). Lequan (2000) is a philosophical survey of Kant's\nthought on chemistry throughout his development. McNulty (forthcoming)\nexplains why Kant takes chemistry to miss the threshold for proper\nscience – specifically, the sense in which chemistry is not\nmathematizable, in Kant's view.  \n\nKant's views on psychology are intimately bound up with his more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind. (See the separate entry on\nthis topic.) Still, one can take note of the fact that Kant\ndistinguishes between rational and empirical psychology and, in the\nCritique of Pure Reason's Paralogisms, denies that rational\npsychology contains arguments that could justify any substantive\nprinciples (especially concerning our immortality). Thus, only\nempirical psychology, it seems, could be possible as a science.\nHowever, if Kant continues to maintain that science requires a pure\npart, and denies that rational psychology contains any substantive\nknowledge that might constitute the pure part of psychology, then it\nfollows that empirical psychology cannot qualify as science proper\neither. \n\nAt the same time, Kant's own project in the Critique of Pure\nReason requires what one might call transcendental psychology,\nthat is, the study of those faculties that are required for us to have\ncognition. Transcendental psychology thus differs from rational\npsychology insofar as the former presupposes that we have experience\n(albeit of a very general sort), whereas the latter is restricted to\nthe mere concept “I think”. Thus, it would seem that many of Kant's\nmost important claims in the Critique of Pure Reason would\nfall under the domain of transcendental psychology. As is well known,\nKant's Critique of Pure Reason came under attack immediately\nafter its publication (most notably by Johann Georg Hamann) for not\npresenting an explicit account of how we obtain knowledge of our\ntranscendental faculties. \n\nJust as Kant held that chemistry could either be scientific in less\nthan the strictest sense or perhaps become science proper (depending\non how it develops), the same could be said for psychology. For one,\nKant may simply be objecting to psychology as it was practiced in the\n18th century, e.g., as based on introspection (a method that both\nrules out the application of mathematics and gives rise to other\ndifficulties, 4:471). Further, in the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant holds that although objects can never be given in\nintuition that would correspond to ideas of reason, such ideas never\nthe less function as regulative principles that direct our\nunderstanding with regard to what it should inquire into next. Thus,\nour idea of the world as a totality is supposed to drive us to look\nfor smaller and smaller parts to bodies and objects in further regions\nof space and at earlier moments of time.  But if we have an idea of\nour soul, then it too should guide our scientific inquiry into our own\nrepresentations, which seems to imply that psychology is a legitimate\nscientific practice (even if it does ultimately fall short of being\nscience proper). \nUnsurprisingly, Kant influenced empirical theory in early 19th-century\nGermany. (However, it was his transcendental psychology in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason, not his views on empirical\npsychology, that proved to be most influential.) In particular, his\ndoctrine of space and time as forms of sensibility was given a\nnaturalistic construal in the physiology and psychology of\nperception. Since for Kant an a priori form of intuition need not be\ninnate, it could unfold in the course of sensory experience. This led\nJ.G. Steinbuch (1811) and C. Th. Tourtual (1827) to investigate\nempirically how spatial representation arises – specifically,\nhow particular subjects become able to see things as arrayed in space,\nperceive objects as three-dimensional, and represent spatial\nstructures more generally. Hatfield (1990, Chapter 4) surveys these\npost-Kantian developments in more detail.\n \n\nKitcher (1990) presents a detailed argument for the role of\ntranscendental psychology within Kant's Critique of Pure\nReason. Sturm (2001) argues that Kant's critical comments about\npsychology are primarily directed against introspection-based\nconceptions of psychology. Hatfield (1990) is an acute discussion of\nthe complexities of psychology as a science in Kant's view.  \n\nThough Kant is sometimes quite strict about what qualifies as science\n“proper,” we have seen that he clearly accepts that other\ndisciplines, such as chemistry and psychology, can be scientific in\nsome other sense. (Kant is also extremely interested in providing an\nexplanation of the nature and origin of organisms, which is central to\nan account of biology. For a more detailed description of Kant's\nstance on biology, see the entry on his views on aesthetics and\nteleology.)  However, his explicit reflections about science (taken\nbroadly so as to encompass not only\n“Wissenschaft” but any kind of\n“Lehre” or “Kunde”) extend\neven further so as to include bodies of cognition such as history,\nphysical geography, and anthropology. (Even in the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant leaves room for such “scientific\ncognition” by dividing the doctrine of nature into natural\nscience — e.g., physics — and the historical doctrine of\nnature, which is separated further into natural description and\nnatural history, 4:468). In the case of historical sciences, Kant\nviews its cognitions as related not by subordination (as is the case\nin physics), but rather by coordination, since historical facts cannot\nbe derived from each other, but rather merely related to each other in\nspace (geographically) and time (chronologically). Kant views\nanthropology as overlapping to some extent in subject matter with\nempirical psychology.  What enables the coordination of facts in each\nof these domains is not a theoretical, but rather a practical idea. In\nthe case of history, it is the idea of reason (or freedom) that\nprovides a guiding principle of coordination (cf. Kant's “Idea\nfor a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View”),\nwhile anthropology is framed by the cosmopolitan moral ideal of the\nworld-best. Thus, it is clear that Kant's emphasis on physics\nthroughout his career did not blind him to the value of other\nsciences, nor did it keep him from reflecting creatively on how best\nto account for them from the perspective of his Critical\nphilosophy. \n\nKant's views on history are discussed by Yovel (1980) and, more\nrecently, Kleingeld (1995 and 1999). Kant's Physical\nGeography has been discussed by Adickes (1911). Brandt (1999),\nWood (1999), and Makkreel (2001) have recently published important\ndiscussions of Kant's anthropology. Sturm (2009) is a comprehensive\nmonograph on\n\nKant's philosophy of psychology and anthropology. ","contact.mail":"marius.c.stan@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
