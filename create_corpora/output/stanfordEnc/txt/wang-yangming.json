He was one of the leading\ncritics of the orthodox Neo–Confucianism of Zhu Xi\n(1130–1200).  Wang is perhaps best known for his doctrine of the\n“unity of knowing and acting,” which can be interpreted as a denial of the possibility of weakness of will. \nThis philosopher’s family name was “Wang,” his personal\nname was “Shouren,” and his “courtesy name”\nwas \n“Bo–an.”[1]\n However, he is normally known today as\n“Wang Yangming,” based on a nickname he adopted when he\nwas living in the Yangming Grotto of Kuaiji Mountain.  Born in 1472\nnear Hangzhou in what is now Zhejiang Province, Wang was the son of a\nsuccessful official.  As such, he would have received a fairly\nconventional education, with a focus on the Four Books of the\nConfucian tradition: the Analects (the sayings of Confucius\nand his immediate disciples), the Great Learning (believed to\nconsist of an opening statement by Confucius with a commentary on it\nby his leading disciple, Zengzi), the Mean (attributed to\nZisi, the grandson of Confucius, who was also a student of Zengzi),\nand the Mengzi (the sayings and dialogues of Mencius, a\nstudent of Zisi).  The young Wang would have literally committed these\nclassics to memory, along with the commentaries on them by the master\nof orthodox Confucianism, Zhu Xi (1130–1200).  The study of\nthese classics–cum–commentary was thought to be morally\nedifying; however, people also studied them in order to pass the civil\nservice examinations, which were the primary route to government\npower, and with it wealth and prestige.  At the age of seventeen\n(1489), Wang had a conversation with a Daoist priest that left him\ndeeply intrigued with this alternative philosophical system and way of\nlife.  Wang was also attracted to Buddhism, and remained torn between\nDaoism, Buddhism and Confucianism for much of his early life.  Whereas\nConfucianism emphasizes our ethical obligations to others, especially\nfamily members, and public service in government, the Daoism and\nBuddhism of Wang’s era encouraged people to overcome their attachment\nto the physical world.  Wang continued the serious study of Zhu Xi’s\ninterpretation of Confucianism, but was disillusioned by an experience\nin which he and a friend made a determined effort to apply what they\ntook to be Zhu Xi’s method for achieving sagehood: As we shall see (Section 2, below), it is unclear whether Wang and\nhis friend were correctly applying what Zhu Xi meant by “the\ninvestigation of things.” However, Wang’s experience of finding\nit impractical to seek for the Pattern of the universe in external\nthings left a deep impression on him, and influenced the later course\nof his philosophy. Wang continued to study Daoism as well as Buddhism, but also showed\na keen interest in military techniques and the craft of writing\nelegant compositions.  Meanwhile, he progressed through the various\nlevels of the civil service examinations, finally passing the highest\nlevel in 1499.  After this, Wang had a meteoric rise in the\ngovernment, including distinguished service in offices overseeing\npublic works, criminal prosecution, and the examination system.\nDuring this period, Wang began to express disdain for overly refined\nliterary compositions like those he had produced in his earlier years.\nWang would later criticize those who “waste their time competing\nwith one another writing flowery compositions in order to win acclaim\nin their age, and…no longer comprehend conduct that honors what\nis fundamental, esteems what is real, reverts to simplicity, and\nreturns to purity” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 275). In addition, Wang started to turn his back on Daoism and Buddhism,\nwhich he came to regard as socially irresponsible:\n“…simply because they did not understand what it is to\nrest in the ultimate good and instead exerted their selfish minds\ntoward the achievement of excessively lofty goals, [Buddhists and\nDaoists] were lost in vagaries, illusions, emptiness, and stillness\nand had nothing to do with the family, state or world” (Tiwald\nand Van Norden 2014, 244, gloss mine).  Nonetheless, Wang continued to\nshow an intimate familiarity with Daoist and Buddhist literature and\nconcepts throughout his career. A life–changing event for Wang occurred in 1506.  A eunuch\nwho had assumed illegitimate influence at court had several able\nofficials imprisoned for opposing him.  Wang wrote a\n“memorial” to the emperor in protest.  The eunuch\nresponded by having Wang publicly beaten and exiled to an\ninsignificant position in a semi–civilized part of what is now\nGuizhou Province.  Wang had to face considerable physical and\npsychological hardship in this post, but through these challenges he\nachieved a deep philosophical awakening (1508), which he later\nexpressed in a poem he wrote for his students: In other words, looking outside oneself for moral truth, as he and\nhis friend Qian had tried to do when studying the bamboos, was\nignoring the root of moral insight, which is one’s own innate\nunderstanding. Fortunately for Wang, in the year when his term of service in\nGuizhou was over (1510), the eunuch who had Wang beaten and banished\nwas himself executed.  Wang’s official career quickly returned to its\nstratospheric level of achievement, with high–ranking posts and\nexceptional achievements in both civil and military positions. This\ninevitably led to opposition from the faction–ridden court. Wang\nwas even accused of conspiring with the leader of a rebellion that\nWang had himself put down.  Wang had begun to attract devoted disciples even before his exile\nto Guizhou, and they gradually compiled the Record for\nPractice (the anthology of his sayings, correspondence, and\ndialogues that is one of our primary sources for Wang’s\nphilosophy). It is reflective of Wang’s philosophy that the\ndiscussions recorded in this work occurred in the midst of his active\nlife in public affairs.  Near the end of his life, Wang was called\nupon to suppress yet another rebellion (1527).  The night before he\nleft, one of his disciples recorded the “Inquiry on the\nGreat Learning,” which was intended as a primer of\nWang’s philosophy for new disciples.  Wang put down the rebellion, but\nhis health had been declining for several years, and he died soon\nafterward (1529). On his deathbed, Wang said, “ ‘This mind’\nis luminous and bright.  What more is there to \nsay?”[2] During Wang’s lifetime, the dominant intellectual movement was\nNeo–Confucianism (in Chinese, Dàoxué, or\nthe Learning of the Way).  Neo–Confucianism traces its origins\nto Han Yu and Li Ao in the late Tang dynasty (618–906), but it\nonly came to intellectual maturity in the Song and Southern Song\ndynasties (960–1279), with the theorizing of Zhou Dunyi, Zhang\nZai, Cheng Yi, his brother Cheng Hao, and Zhu Xi.\nNeo–Confucianism originally developed as a Confucian reaction\nagainst Buddhism.  Ironically, though, the Neo–Confucians were\ndeeply influenced by Buddhism and adopted many key Buddhists concepts,\nincluding the notions that the diverse phenomena of the universe are\nmanifestations of some underlying unity, and that selfishness is the\nfundamental vice.   Zhu Xi synthesized the thought of earlier Neo–Confucians, and\nhis interpretation of the Four Books became the basis of the civil\nservice examinations (see Section 1, above).  Zhu held that everything\nin existence has two aspects, Pattern and qì.  Pattern\n(lǐ, also translated “principle”) is the\nunderlying structure of the universe.  Qi is the\nspatio–temporal stuff that constitutes concrete objects.  The\ncomplete Pattern is fully present in each entity in the universe;\nhowever, entities are individuated by having distinct allotments of\nqi (variously translated as “ether,”\n“psychophysical stuff,” “vital fluid,”\n“material force,” and others).  In addition to having\nspatio–temporal location, qi has qualitative\ndistinctions, described metaphorically in terms of degrees of\n“clarity” and “turbidity.” The more\n“clear” the qi, the greater the extent to which\nthe Pattern manifests.  This explains how speciation is possible.  For\nexample, plants have more “clear” qi than do\nrocks, which is reflected in the more complex repertoire of\ninteractions plants have with their environments. Neo–Confucian metaphysics, ethics, and philosophical\npsychology are systematically connected.  Humans have the most clear\nqi of any being.  However, some humans have especially clear\nqi, and as a result manifest the virtues, while others have\ncomparatively turbid qi, and therefore are prone to vice.\nThe state of one’s qi is not fixed, though.  Through ethical\ncultivation, any human can clarify his qi, and thereby become\nmore virtuous.  Similarly, through laxness, one can allow one’s\nqi to morally deteriorate.  Because the Pattern is fully\npresent in each human, everyone has complete innate ethical knowledge.\nHowever, due to the obscurations of qi, the manifestations of\nthis knowledge are sporadic and inconsistent.  Thus, a king who shows\nbenevolence when he takes pity on an ox being led to slaughter and\nspares it may fail to show benevolence in his treatment of his own\nsubjects (Mengzi 1A7).  Similarly, a person might manifest\nrighteousness when he disdains to even consider an illicit sexual\nrelationship; however, the same person might see nothing shameful\nabout flattering the worst traits and most foolish policies of a ruler\nwhom he serves (Mengzi 3B3). Because humans all share the\nsame Pattern, we are parts of a potentially harmonious whole.  In some\nsense, we form “one body” with other humans and the rest\nof the universe.  Consequently, the fundamental human virtue is\nbenevolence, which involves recognition of our shared nature with\nothers.[3]\nCorrespondingly, the fundamental vice is selfishness.  Cheng Hao uses\na medical metaphor to explain the relationship between ethics and\npersonal identity: Just as those whose hands and feet are “unfeeling” are\nnot bothered by injuries to their own limbs, so do those who are\nethically “unfeeling” fail to show concern for other\nhumans.  In both cases, one fails to act appropriately because one\nfails to recognize that something is a part of oneself. Neo–Confucians regarded the ancient philosopher Mencius (4th\ncentury BCE) as having presented an especially incisive interpretation\nof Confucianism.  They referred to him as the “Second\nSage,” second in importance only to Confucius himself, and often\nappealed to his vocabulary, arguments, and \nexamples.[4] \n In particular,\nNeo–Confucians adopted Mencius’s view that human nature is good,\nand that wrongdoing is the result of humans ignoring the promptings of\ntheir innate virtues.  Physical desires are one of the primary causes\nfor the failure to heed one’s innate moral sense.  There is nothing\nintrinsically immoral about desires for fine food, sex, wealth, etc.,\nbut we will be led to wrongdoing if we pursue them without giving\nthought to the well–being of others (Mengzi 6A15).\nNeo–Confucians also adopted Mencius’s list of four cardinal\nvirtues: benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and propriety.\nBenevolence is manifested in the emotion of compassion, which involves\nsympathizing with the suffering of others and acting appropriately on\nthat sympathy.  For instance, a benevolent ruler could never be\nindifferent to the well–being of his subjects, and would work\ntirelessly to alleviate their suffering. Righteousness is manifested\nin the emotion of disdain or shame at the thought of doing what is\ndishonorable, especially in the face of temptations of wealth or\nphysical desire.  For example, a righteous person would not cheat at a\ngame, or accept a bribe.  Wisdom is manifested in approval or\ndisapproval that reflects sound judgment about means–end\ndeliberation and about the character of others.  Thus, a wise official\nwould know which policies to support and which to oppose, and would be\ninventive in devising solutions to complex problems.  Propriety is\nmanifested in respect or deference toward elders and legitimate\nauthorities, particularly as expressed in ceremonies or etiquette.\nFor instance, a person with propriety would willingly defer to elder\nfamily members most of the time, but would be motivated to serve a\nguest before his elder brother.   The preceding views are shared, in broad outline, by all\nNeo–Confucian philosophers.  The primary issue they debated was\nthe proper method of ethical cultivation.  In other words, how is it\npossible for us to consistently and reliably access and act on our\ninnate ethical knowledge?  Other disagreements among them (on\nseemingly recondite issues of metaphysics and the interpretation of\nthe Confucian classics) can often be traced to more fundamental\ndisagreements over ethical cultivation.  For Zhu Xi, almost all humans\nare born with qi that is so turbid that it is impossible for\nthem to consistently know what is virtuous and act accordingly without\nexternal assistance.  The remedy is carefully studying the classics\nwritten by the ancient sages, ideally under the guidance of a wise\nteacher.  Although the classics were written in response to concrete\nhistorical situations, their words allow us to grasp the Pattern at a\ncertain level of abstraction from its instantiations.  However, Zhu Xi\nstates that merely understanding the Pattern is insufficient for the\nexercise of virtue.  One must achieve Sincerity\n(chéng), a continual awareness of moral knowledge in\nthe face of \ntemptations.[5] In his own lifetime, Zhu Xi’s leading critic was Lu Xiangshan\n(1139–1193).  Lu argued that, because the Pattern is fully\npresent in the mind of each human, it is not necessary to engage in an\nintellectually demanding process of study in order to recover one’s\nmoral knowledge: In emphasizing the innate human capacity for moral judgment, Lu\nadopted the phrase “pure knowing” from Mengzi\n7A15.  In its original context, Mencius writes that “Among babes\nin arms there are none that do not know to love their parents,”\nand describes this as an instance of “pure knowing,” which\nhumans “know without pondering” (Tiwald and Van Norden\n2014, 218).  Lu explains: Although there were always Confucians like Lu who disagreed with\nZhu Xi, the latter’s interpretation became dominant after the\ngovernment sponsored it as the official interpretation for the civil\nservice examinations.  By the time of Wang Yangming, Zhu Xi’s approach\nhad ossified into a stale orthodoxy that careerists mindlessly\nparroted in an effort to pass the examinations. Some aspects of Wang’s philosophy can be understood as refining or\ndrawing out the full implications of Lu Xiangshan’s critique of Zhu\nXi.  Like Lu, Wang stressed that the Pattern is fully present in the\nmind of every person: “The mind is Pattern.  Is there\nany affair outside the mind?  Is there any Pattern outside the\nmind?” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n 264)[6] \n As a result, the\ntheoretical study of ethics is unnecessary.  All a moral agent needs\nto do is exercise “pure knowing.” This view may seem naive\nat first glance.  However, this is partially due to the different foci\nof Chinese and Western ethics.  Metaethics and normative ethical\ntheory are substantial parts of Western ethics, but less central to\nChinese ethics.  In addition, recent Western ethics manifests an\ninterest in abstract ethical dilemmas that is perhaps disproportionate\nto the relevance of these quandaries in practice.  In contrast, the\nfocus of much Chinese ethics, particularly Confucianism, is applied\nethical cultivation.  Consequently, Lu and Wang were primarily\ninterested in having a genuine positive effect on the ethical lives of\ntheir followers.  There is some plausibility to the claim that (even\nin our own complex, multicultural intellectual context) most of us\nknow what our basic ethical obligations are.  For example, as a\nteacher, I have an obligation to grade assignments promptly and\nfairly.  As a colleague, I have an obligation to take my turn serving\nas chair.  As a parent, I have an obligation to make time to share my\nchildren’s interests.  Due to selfish desires, it is tempting to\nprocrastinate in grading essays, or try to evade departmental service,\nor ignore the emotional needs of one’s children.  However, it is not\nas if it is genuinely difficult to figure out that these are our\nobligations. Wang’s most distinctive and well-known doctrine is the unity of\nknowing and acting (zhī xíng hé yī).\nIn order to grasp the significance of this doctrine, consider a\nstudent who is being questioned by a college honor code panel after\nbeing caught plagiarizing an essay.  If the honor code panel asked the\nstudent whether he knew that plagiarism was wrong, it would not be\nsurprising for the student to reply, “Yes, I knew it was wrong\nto plagiarize my essay, but I wanted so much to get an easy A that I\ngave in to temptation.” Western philosophers would describe this\nas a case of akrasia, or weakness of will.  Zhu Xi, along\nwith many Western philosophers like Aristotle, would acknowledge that\nthe student had correctly described his psychological state.  However,\nWang Yangming would deny that the student actually knew that\nplagiarism was wrong: “There never have been people who know but\ndo not act.  Those who ‘know’ but do not act simply do not\nyet know” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 267).  One of Wang’s\nprimary claims is that merely verbal assent is inadequate to\ndemonstrate actual knowledge: “One cannot say he knows filial\npiety or brotherly respect simply because he knows how to say\nsomething filial or brotherly.  Knowing pain offers another good\nexample.  One must have experienced pain oneself in order to know\npain.” Wang also adduces cold and hunger as things that one must\nexperience in order to know.  We might object that Wang’s example\nshows, at most, that someone must have had an experience of goodness\nor evil at some point in his life in order to know what it\nmeans for something to be good or evil.  This falls short of the\nconclusion that Wang needs, though, for just as I can know what you\nmean when you say “I am hungry” even if I am not currently\nmotivated to eat, so might I know that “plagiarism is\nwrong,” even if I am not motivated to avoid plagiarism myself in\nthis circumstance. \n\nA more promising line of argument for Wang is his appropriation of an\nexample from the Great Learning (Commentary 6), which\nsuggests that loving the good is “like loving a lovely\nsight,” while hating evil is “like hating a hateful\nodor” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 191).  To recognize an odor\nas disgusting (a kind of knowing) is to be repulsed by it (a\nmotivation), which leads to avoiding the odor or eliminating its\nsource (actions).  The Chinese phrase rendered “loving a lovely\nsight” (hào hǎo sè) has connotations\nof finding someone sexually \nattractive.[7]\n To regard someone as sexually attractive (a\nkind of cognition) is to be drawn toward them (a kind of motivation\nthat can lead to action).  To this, one might object that Wang’s\nexamples show, at most, that knowing something is good or bad requires\nthat one have some level of appropriate motivation.  Even if\nwe grant the relevance of Wang’s examples, it is possible to have an\nintrinsic motivation that does not result in action.  Recognizing that\nsomeone is sexually attractive certainly does not always result in\npursuing an assignation, for example.  Perhaps Wang’s most compelling line of argument is a pragmatic one\nabout the aim or purpose behind discussing knowing and acting.  He\nallows that it may be useful and legitimate to discuss knowing\nseparately from acting or acting separately from knowing, but only in\norder to address the failings of specific kinds of individuals.  On\nthe one hand, “there is a type of person in the world who\nfoolishly acts upon impulse without engaging in the slightest thought\nor reflection.  Because they always act blindly and recklessly, it is\nnecessary to talk to them about knowing…,” without\nemphasizing acting.  On the other hand, “[t]here is also a type\nof person who is vague and irresolute; they engage in speculation\nwhile suspended in a vacuum and are unwilling to apply themselves to\nany concrete actions” (268). These latter people benefit from\nadvice that emphasizes action, without necessarily discussing\nknowledge.  However, those in Wang’s era who distinguish knowledge and\naction (and here he has in mind those who follow the orthodox\nphilosophy of Zhu Xi) “separate knowing and acting into two\ndistinct tasks to perform and think that one must first know and only\nthen can one act.” As a result, they become nothing more than\npedantic bookworms, who study ethics without ever living up to its\nideals or trying to achieve positive change in the world around them.\nWang concludes, “My current teaching regarding the unity of\nknowing and acting is a medicine directed precisely at this\ndisease.” In the standard Confucian curriculum of Wang’s era, the Great\nLearning was the first of the Four Books that students were\nassigned, and Zhu Xi’s commentary on it often made a lasting\nimpression on them. In the opening of the Great Learning,\nConfucius describes the steps in self–cultivation: Ge wu is left unexplained in the Great Learning.\nHowever, Zhu Xi, following the interpretation of Cheng Yi, claims\nthat Following Zhu Xi’s interpretations, most translators today render\nge wu as “investigating things.” Wang and his\nfriend Qian were trying to “investigate things” in this\nmanner when they stared attentively at the bamboos, struggling to\ngrasp their underlying Pattern.  It is questionable, though, whether\nthis is what Zhu Xi had in mind.  Zhu certainly thought the Pattern\nwas present in everything, and could potentially be investigated in\neven the most mundane of objects.  However, he emphasized that the\nbest method to learn about the Pattern was through studying the\nclassics texts of Confucianism, particularly the Four Books.   As important as learning was for Zhu Xi, he stressed that it was\npossible to know what is right and wrong yet not act on it:\n“Knowledge and action always need each other.  It’s like how\neyes cannot walk without feet, but feet cannot see without eyes.  If\nwe discuss them in terms of their sequence, knowledge comes first.\nBut if we discuss them in terms of importance, action is what is\nimportant” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 180–81).  What\nconnects knowledge and action, on Zhu Xi’s account, is Sincerity.\nSincerity (chéng) is a subtle and multifaceted notion\nin Neo–Confucian thought.  However, the Great Learning\nfocuses on one key aspect of it: “What is meant by ‘making\nthoughts have Sincerity’ is to let there be no self–deception.\nIt is like hating a hateful odor, or loving a lovely sight.  The is\ncalled not being conflicted” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 191).\nIn other words, humans engage in wrongdoing through a sort of\nself–deception in which they allow themselves to ignore the\npromptings of their moral sense, and become motivated solely by their\nphysical desires for sex, food, wealth, etc.  Once one knows what is\nright and wrong, one must then make an effort to keep that knowledge\npresent to one’s consciousness, so that it becomes motivationally\nefficacious.  As Zhu Xi explains, “…those who desire to\ncultivate themselves, when they know to do good in order to avoid the\nbad, must then genuinely make an effort and forbid\nself–deception, making their hatred of the [ethically] hateful\nbe like their hating a hateful odor, and their loving what is good\nlike their loving a lovely sight” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n192).   Wang challenged almost every aspect of Zhu Xi’s interpretation of\nthe Great Learning. He regarded Zhu Xi’s account as not just\ntheoretically mistaken but dangerously misleading for those seeking to\nimprove themselves ethically.  However, Wang recognized that students\nwho had memorized Zhu Xi’s interpretation to prepare for the civil\nservice examinations would have difficulty understanding the text any\nother way.  Consequently, when he accepted a new disciple, Wang often\nbegan by explaining his alternative interpretation of the Great\nLearning, and invited students to ask questions.  Wang’s approach\nis preserved in a brief but densely argued work, “Questions on\nthe Great Learning.” Let’s begin at the apparent\nfoundation of the Great Learning’s program: ge wu.\nWhereas Zhu Xi argues that ge wu is literally “reaching\nthings,” meaning to intellectually grasp the Pattern in things\nand situations, Wang argues that ge wu means\n“rectifying things,” including both one’s own thoughts and\nthe objects of those thoughts.  For Zhu Xi, ge wu is\nprimarily about gaining knowledge, while for Wang it is about\nmotivation and \naction.[8] The fact that the Great Learning explicates ge wu\nin terms of “extending knowledge” might seem to support\nZhu Xi’s interpretation.  However, Wang offers a plausible alternative\nexplanation: “To fully extend one’s knowledge is not like the\nso–called ‘filling out’ of what one knows that later\nscholars [like Zhu Xi] talk about. It is simply to extend fully the\n‘pure knowing’ of my own mind.  Pure knowing is what\n[Mencius] was talking about when he said that all humans have\n‘the mind of approval and disapproval.’ The mind of\napproval and disapproval ‘knows without pondering’ and is\n‘capable without learning’ ” (Tiwald and Van\nNorden 2014, 248, glosses \nmine).[9]\n Wang is suggesting that “extending\nknowledge” refers simply to exercising our innate faculty of\nmoral awareness, which Mencius refers to as “pure\nknowing.” As David S. Nivison explains, “We might say that\nWang’s ‘extending’ of knowledge is more like extending\none’s arm than, say, extending one’s vocabulary” (Nivison 1996a,\n225). According to Zhu Xi, the opening of the Great Learning\nlists a series of steps that are, at least to some extent, temporally\ndistinct. Wang demurs: \nWang’s argument here is similar to the one he made about the verbal\ndistinction between knowing and acting (Section 3, above). He claimed\nthat the ancient sages recognized that knowing and acting were\nultimately one thing, but sometimes discussed them separately for\npedagogic purposes, to help those who underemphasized one aspect of\nthis unity.  Similarly, Wang suggests, the Great Learning\nuses multiple terms to describe various aspects of the unified\nexercise of moral agency, but does not mean to suggest that these are\nactually distinct temporal stages: Wang even interprets the key metaphor of the Great\nLearning in a very different way from Zhu Xi.  For Zhu Xi, hating\nevil “like hating a hateful odor,” and loving good\n“like loving a lovely sight” are goals that we must aspire\nto, but can only achieve after an arduous process of ethical\ncultivation.  For Wang Yangming, these phrases describe what our\nattitudes toward good and evil can and should be at the very inception\nof ethical cultivation: In summary, Zhu Xi and Wang agree that the Great Learning\nis an authoritative statement on ethical cultivation, expressing the\nwisdom of the ancient sages.  However, for Zhu Xi, it is analogous to\na recipe, with distinct steps that must be performed in order.  For\nWang, the Great Learning is analogous to a description of a\npainting, in which shading, coloring, composition, perspective and\nother factors are aspects of a unified effect.   Wang was not primarily interested in theoretical issues.  However,\nsome of his comments suggest a subtle metaphysical view that supports\nhis conception of ethics.  This metaphysics is phrased in terms of the\nPattern/qi framework (see Section 2, above), and also makes\nuse of the Substance/Function distinction.  Substance\n(tǐ), literally body, is an entity in itself, while\nFunction is its characteristic or appropriate activity or\nmanifestation: a lamp is Substance, its light is function; an eye is\nSubstance, seeing is its Function; water is Substance, waves are its\nFunction.  The Substance/Function distinction goes back to the Daoists\nof the Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE) and became central among\nChinese Buddhists before being picked up by Neo–Confucians.\nPart of the attraction of this vocabulary is that it gives\nphilosophers drawn to a sort of monism the ability to distinguish\nbetween two aspects of what they regard as ultimately a unity.   Wang argues that the human mind is identical with the Pattern of\nthe universe, and as such it forms “one body”\n(yì tǐ, one Substance) with “Heaven, Earth,\nand the myriad creatures” of the world.  The difference between\nthe virtuous and the vicious is that the former recognize that their\nminds form one body with everything else, while the latter,\n“because of the space between their own physical form and those\nof others, regard themselves as separate” (Tiwald and Van Norden\n2014, 241).  As evidence for the claim that the minds of all humans\nform one body with the rest of the universe, Wang appeals to a thought\nexperiment first formulated by Mencius: “when they see a child\n[about to] fall into a well, [humans] cannot avoid having a mind of\nalarm and compassion for the child” (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n241–242; Mengzi 2A6).  Wang then anticipates a series\nof objections, and offers further thought experiments to motivate the\nconclusion that only some underlying metaphysical identity between\nhumans and other things can account for the broad range of our\nreactions to them: Wang’s first three thought experiments seem fairly compelling at\nfirst glance.  Almost all humans would, at least as a first instinct,\nhave “alarm and compassion” if suddenly confronted with\nthe sight of a child about to fall into a well. In addition, humans\noften do show pity for the suffering of non–human animals.\nFinally, the fact that humans maintain public parks and personal\ngardens shows some kind of concern for plants.   It is not a decisive objection to Wang’s view that humans often\nfail to manifest benevolence to other humans, non–human animals,\nor plants.  Wang is arguing that all humans manifest these responses\nsometimes (and that this is best explained by his favored\nmetaphysics).  Like all Neo–Confucians, Wang readily\nacknowledges that selfish desires frequently block the manifestation\nof our shared nature.  However, there are three lines of objection to\nWang’s view that are harder to dismiss.  (1) There is considerable\nempirical evidence that some humans never manifest any\ncompassion for the suffering of others.  In the technical literature\nof psychology, these people are a subset of those identified as having\n“Antisocial Personality Disorder” as defined in\n DSM–V.[10]\n (2) Wang asserts that when humans “see tiles and stones broken\nand destroyed, they cannot avoid feeling a sense of concern and\nregret.” This claim is important for Wang’s argument, because he\ntakes this reaction to be evidence for the conclusion that our minds\nare ultimately “one Substance” with everything in\nthe universe, not merely with members of our species, or other\nsentient creatures, or other living things.  We can perhaps motivate\nWang’s intuition by considering how we might react if we saw that\nsomeone had spray painted graffiti on Half Dome in Yosemite National\nPark.  The defacement of this scenic beauty would probably provoke\nsadness in those of us with an eye for natural beauty.  However, it is\ncertainly not obvious that everyone manifests even sporadic concern\nfor “tiles and stones,” which is what he needs for his\nconclusion. (3) Even if we grant Wang his intuitions, it is not clear\nthat the particular metaphysics he appeals to is the best explanation\nof those intuitions.  As Darwin himself suggested, our compassion for\nother humans can be explained in evolutionary terms.  In addition, the\n“biophilia hypothesis” (Wilson [1984]) provides an\nevolutionary explanation for the human fondness for other animals and\nplants.  There is not an obvious evolutionary explanation for why\nhumans seem engaged by non–living natural beauty, like mountain\npeaks, but as we have seen it seems questionable how common this trait\nis. Wang is regarded, along with Lu Xiangshan, as one of the founders\nof the Lu–Wang School of Neo–Confucianism, or the School\nof Mind.  This is one of the two major wings of\nNeo–Confucianism, along with the Cheng–Zhu School (named\nafter Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi), or School of Pattern.  He has frequently\nbeen an inspiration for critics of the orthodox Cheng–Zhu\nSchool, not just in China but also in Japan.  In Japan, his philosophy\nis referred to as Ōyōmeigaku, and its major\nadherents included Nakae Tōju (1608–1648) and Kumazawa\nBanzan (1619–1691).  Wang’s thought was also an inspiration for\nsome of the leaders of the Meiji Restoration (1868), which began\nJapan’s rapid \nmodernization.[11] In China, Confucianism underwent a significant shift during the\nQing dynasty (1644–1911) with the development of the Evidential\nResearch movement.  Evidential Research emphasized carefully\ndocumented and tightly argued work on concrete issues of philology,\nhistory, and even mathematics and civil engineering.  Such scholars\ngenerally looked with disdain on “the Song–Ming\nConfucians” (including both Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming), whom they\naccused of producing “empty words” that could not be\n substantiated.[12] \n One of the few Evidential Research\nscholars with a serious interest in ethics was Dai Zhen\n(1724–1777). However, he too was critical of both the\nCheng–Zhu and the Lu–Wang schools.  The three major prongs\nof Dai’s critique of Neo–Confucians like Wang were that they (1)\nencouraged people to treat their subjective opinions as the\ndeliverances of some infallible moral sense, (2) projected\nBuddhist–inspired concepts back onto the ancient Confucian\nclassics, and (3) ignored the ethical value of ordinary physical\ndesires.  One of the major trends in contemporary Chinese philosophy is\n“New Confucianism.” New Confucianism is a movement to\nadapt Confucianism to modern thought, showing how it is consistent\nwith democracy and modern science.  New Confucianism is distinct from\nwhat we in the West call Neo–Confucianism, but it adopts many\nNeo–Confucian concepts, in particular the view that humans share\na trans–personal nature which is constituted by the universal\nPattern.  Many New Confucians agree with Mou Zongsan (1909–1995)\nthat Wang had a deeper and more orthodox understanding of Confucianism\nthan did Zhu \nXi.[13] Wang’s philosophy is of considerable intrinsic interest, because of\nthe ingenuity of his arguments, the systematicity of his views, and\nthe precision of his textual exegesis.  Beyond that, Wang’s work has\nthe potential to inform contemporary ethics. Although his particular\nmetaphysics may not be appealing, many of his ideas can be\nnaturalized.  It may be hard to believe that everything is unified by\na shared, underlying Pattern, but it does seem plausible that we are\ndeeply dependent upon one another and upon our natural environment for\nour survival and our identities.  I am a husband, a father, a teacher,\nand a researcher, but only because I have a wife, children, students,\nand colleagues.  In some sense, we do form “one body” with\nothers, and Wang provides provocative ideas about how we should\nrespond to this insight.  In addition, Wang’s fundamental criticism of\nZhu Xi’s approach, that it produces pedants who only study and talk\nabout ethics, rather than people who strive to actually be\nethical, has considerable contemporary relevance, particularly given\nthe empirical evidence that our current practices of ethical education\nhave little positive effect on ethical behavior (Schwitzgebel and Rust\n2014; and cf. Schwitzgebel 2013 (Other Internet Resources)).","contact.mail":"brvannorden@vassar.edu","contact.domain":"vassar.edu"}]
