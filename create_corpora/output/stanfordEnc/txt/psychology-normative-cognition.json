Norms are the social\nrules that mark out what is appropriate, allowed, required, or\nforbidden in different situations for various community members. These\nrules are informal in the sense that although they are sometimes\nrepresented in formal laws, such as the rule governing which side of\nthe road to drive on, they need not be explicitly codified to\neffectively influence behavior. There are rules that forbid theft or\nthe breaking of promises, but also rules which govern how close it is\nappropriate to stand to someone while talking to them, or how loud one\nshould talk during the conversation. Thus understood, norms regulate a\nwide range of activity. They exhibit cultural variability in their\nprescriptions and proscriptions, but the presence of norms in general\nappears to be culturally universal. Some norms exhibit characteristics\nthat are often associated with morality, such as a rule that applies\nto everyone and prohibits causing unnecessary harm. Other norms apply\nonly to certain people, such as those that delimit appropriate\nclothing for members of different genders, or those concerning the\nexpectations and responsibilities ascribed to individuals who occupy\npositions of leadership. The norms that prevail in a community can be\nmore or less fair, reasonable, or impartial, and can be subject to\ncritique and change.\n\n\nThis entry provides an overview of interdisciplinary research into the\npsychological capacity for norm-guided cognition, motivation, and\nbehavior. The notions of a norm and normativity occur in an enormous\nrange of research that spans the humanities and behavioral sciences.\nResearchers primarily concerned with the psychology distinctive of\nnorm-governed behavior take what can be called\n“cognitive-evolutionary” approaches to their subject\nmatter. These approaches, common in the cognitive sciences, draw on a\nvariety of resources and evidence to investigate different\npsychological capacities. This entry describes how these have been\nused to construct accounts of those cognitive and motivational\nfeatures of minds that underpin the capacity to acquire, conform to,\nand enforce norms. It also describes how theories of the selective\npressures and adaptive challenges prominent in recent human evolution\nhave helped to inform and constrain theorizing about this\npsychological capacity, as well as how its features can influence the\ntransmission and cultural evolution of norms.\n\n\nBy way of organization, the entry starts with basics and proceeds to\nadd subsequent layers of intricacy and detail. Researchers taking\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms come from a wide range of\ndisciplines, and have formulated, explored, and debated positions on a\nlarge number of different issues. In order to present a comprehensible\noverview of these interconnected literatures, the entry starts by\nlaying out main contours and central tenets, the key landmarks in the\nconceptual space common to different theories and claims. It goes on\nto provide a more detailed description of the kinds of theoretical\nresources that researchers have employed, and identifies important\ndimensions along which more specific accounts of the psychology of\nnorms have varied. It then canvasses different sources of empirical\nevidence that have begun to illuminate other philosophically\ninteresting features of the capacity for norms. Finally, it ends with\na discussion of the relationship between norm cognition and morality,\nwith a few illustrations drawn from recent debates in moral\ntheory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorms are the rules of a group of people that mark out what is\nappropriate, allowed, required, or forbidden for various members in\ndifferent situations. They are typically manifest in common behavioral\nregularities that are kept in place by social sanctions. From an early\nage, humans see certain behaviors, contexts, and roles as governed by\nnorms. Once a person adopts a norm, it functions both as a rule that\nguides behavior and as a standard against which behavior is evaluated.\nMoreover, individuals typically become motivated to enforce the norms\nthey adopt, and so to participate in regulative practices such as\npunishment and the ascription of blame. Such practices in turn help\nstabilize the community’s social arrangements and the norms that\nstructure them. Norms are often classified into kinds or\nsubcategories, with common examples including moral, social,\nconventional, epistemic, aesthetic, and organizational norms. The\ncorrect or theoretically most useful way to distinguish and taxonomize\nkinds of norm is the subject of much debate, but one that will be set\naside here (see O’Neill 2017 for a review, Kelly forthcoming\nfor discussion). Rather, this section will sketch a general overview\nof the conceptual space common to cognitive-evolutionary work on the\npsychology of norms, and later sections will elaborate on its\ncontents, locating different claims and specific theories within\nit. \nAn idea central to work on the psychology of norms is that human minds\ncontain a norm system of some kind, a set of psychological\nmechanisms dedicated to handling information and producing behaviors\nrelevant to norms. Such mechanisms feature in an explanatory strategy\ncommon throughout psychology (R. Cummins 2000). In this case,\ntheorists appeal to different properties of the norm system to help\naccount for different aspects of a complex capacity for norm-guided\nbehavior—a capacity to “do” norms. This capacity is\ncharacterized by a broad but distinctive pattern of behavior: when\nfaced with norm relevant stimuli, typically centered on other\npeoples’ actions or their own, along with other cues concerning\nthe context of those actions and the roles of the actors, individuals\nexhibit a robust and multifaceted type of response that is centered on\nconformity and punishment. Taken together, the responses of\nindividuals aggregate up to produce stabilizing group-level effects on\npatterns of collective social organization. The complexity and\nrobustness of the individual capacity suggests the operation of\ndedicated psychological machinery—a norm system—which\nsensitizes humans to certain social stimuli (behavior, contexts,\nroles) and reliably produces the coordinated facets (physiologically,\ninferentially, behaviorally) of the characteristic response. \nThis picture raises the question of how it is that humans are\nable to spontaneously and reliably track norm-relevant features of\ntheir world, infer the rules which govern it, and bring those rules to\nbear on their own and others’ behavior. It also calls for a\npsychological answer, one that sheds light on what mediates the\nstimuli and the response. By analogy, an automobile is capable of\nacceleration—it reliably speeds up in response to the depression\nof the gas pedal—but one needs to “look under the\nhood” to see what sort of mechanisms are reliably translating\nthat kind of input into that kind of output. Moving from the\nacceleration of a car to the norm-guided activity of a person,\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches posit and investigate the\npsychological machinery that is responsible for translating certain\nkinds of social inputs into the kind of behavioral outputs associated\nwith norms. This strategy—of positing psychological mechanisms\nthat mediate stimulus and response—is supported by a now\nfamiliar way of understanding the mind as an information processing\nsystem. The inputs under consideration are treated as information,\nwhich is routed and processed by a suite of psychological mechanisms\nand finally translated into behavioral outputs. Those focused on the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition have posited the\nexistence of this kind of dedicated package of mechanisms, and have\ninvestigated different possibilities about its nature. \nTo introduce a couple terms of art, accounts of psychological\ncapacities often aspire to provide both a proximate\nexplanation and an ultimate explanation. Where proximate\nexplanations try to answer, “How does it work?”, ultimate\nexplanations try to answer, “How did we come to be like\nthis?” This distinction originates in biology (Mayr 1961; Ariew 2003), but is\napplicable to behavioral and psychological traits as well (Griffiths\n2007). Central to proximate explanations in these latter contexts are\nthe models of the psychological processes that underlie specific\ncapacities. After identifying a relatively complex ability, that\nability is explained in terms of the operation and interaction of a\nset of relatively simpler underlying component mechanisms. Thus,\nproximate explanations of norms aim to show how human individuals are\npsychologically capable of the rich array of activity associated with\nnorm-guided behavior by identifying the component parts of the norm\nsystem and describing how they operate. \nUltimate explanations, on the other hand, aim to explain the\nlikely origins of different traits. It is now common for the cognitive\nsciences to make extensive use of evolutionary theory, taking what is\nknown about the environments and selective pressures faced by\nancestral populations and using it to help inform hypotheses about\nminds (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992). Central to many of the\nultimate explanations proposed by researchers interested in the\npsychology of norms are the adaptive challenges raised by collective\naction and large-scale cooperation (Gintis, Bowles, et al. 2005; Boyd\n& Richerson 2005b; N. Henrich & J. Henrich 2007; Tomasello\n2009). For the sake of clarity, it is helpful to remember that these\ntwo styles of explanation are analytically distinct, but that\nproximate and ultimate explanations for a given trait will ideally be\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. Thus, evolutionary accounts of\nnorm cognition can inform and constrain proximate models, and vice\nversa. \nThe psychological focus of cognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms\ngives them a fairly clear research agenda. It is worth noting,\nhowever, that while questions about the nature of norms are relevant\nto a range of debates in philosophy (and beyond), work on the\npsychology of norms is not primarily driven by one particular\nphilosophical tradition or debate. Rather, those focused on\nnormative psychology are typically guided by a set of general\nissues concerning human nature: the structure and distinctive features\nof human minds, the pathways of human evolution that produced them,\nand the commonalities and differences between human minds and\nbehaviors, on one hand, and those found in non-human species, on the\nother (Tomasello 1999; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tooby & Cosmides\n2005; J. Henrich 2015; Vincent Ring, & Andrews 2018). One upshot\nof this is that theorists draw on the full range of explanatory\nresources made available by contemporary cognitive science. Thus,\nthese accounts of normative cognition are not constrained by\nfolk-psychological explanations of behavior, and so are free to posit\nand appeal to psychological mechanisms, states, and processes that\nneed not bear much resemblance to beliefs and desires, credences and\npreferences, conscious deliberation and explicit inference. \nThis entry is organized around research whose focal point is the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition. However, any\ndiscussion of norms and norm-guided behavior will involve, tacitly or\notherwise, some picture or other of agents and the\ncharacteristics that make them responsive to normative influence. Some\nbegin with analytic formalizations of the kinds of agents and mental\nstates assumed by common sense folk psychology, and use these\nformalizations, along with various refinements, to account for\ndifferent norm related phenomena. These fall beyond the scope of this\nentry, but see especially Bicchieri, Muldoon, and Sontuoso (2018) for\nan overview of such approaches (also see Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan\net al. 2013; Conte, Andrighetto, & Campennì 2013; Hawkins,\nGoodman, & Goldstone 2019; cf. Morris et al. 2015). It is also\nworth noting that cognitive-evolutionary approaches are sometimes\npresented as importantly different from classic rational choice\napproaches to human decision and social behavior (Boyd & Richerson\n2001; Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Whether these are\ngenuinely distinct alternatives remains unclear (Elster 1991, cf.\nWendel 2001), but those who make the case typically point to a growing\nbody of evidence that suggests humans rarely approximate the\nunboundedly rational, purely self-interested agents of classical\neconomics (Gigerenzer & Selten 2001; Kahneman 2011, cf. Millgram\n2019, Other Internet Resources).  To illustrate, participants in\none-time, anonymous cooperation games have been observed to routinely\ncooperate, even when they are made explicitly aware of their anonymity\nand the fact that they will play the game just once (Marwell &\nAmes 1981; see Thaler 1992 for a review). Those sympathetic to\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms have an explanatory\ntemplate for this kind of finding ready at hand, and will construe\nparticipants’ behavior as motivated by their norm systems and\nthe pro-social norms that they have internalized. \nWith the expanded repertoire of psychological entities at their\ndisposal, explanations that appeal to a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms also appear well suited to capture the kinds of\ndissonance and dissociation that can occur between individuals’\nattention, implicit categorization, and normative motivation, on the\none hand, and their explicit beliefs and avowed principles, on the\nother. A person may, for example, explicitly endorse feminism and\nsincerely wish to extinguish the sexist norms and expectations he has\nabout women, but nevertheless find himself monitoring the social world\nthrough the lens of those sexist norms, and experiencing recalcitrant\nmotivation to enforce and comply with them (cf. work on implicit\nbiases Brownstein & Saul 2016). In short, on this kind of picture\ndifferent psychological systems that comprise an individual’s\nmind (perhaps the norm system and the practical reasoning system) can\nwork independently from, and be at slight odds with, each other. \nSeveral more specific features that appear distinctive of normative\ncognition have drawn considerable attention from psychological\nresearchers. These include the propensities to acquire norms,\nto comply with norms, and to enforce norms. When a\nperson is born into or otherwise enters a community, she needs to be\nable to identify and extract information about the broad assortment of\nnorms that shape it, who different norms apply to and when, and what\nthe consequences of breaking them are. She must be able to see some\nbehaviors as normatively regulated, and then to infer what\nthe governing rule is. Learning how to do this is sometimes supported\nby intentional pedagogical behavior by her mentors (Sterelny 2012),\nbut need not be (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011). Gaining\nknowledge of the rules is not where it ends. Individuals rarely just\nobserve such social activities, but rather come to competently\nparticipate in them. To do this, a person typically learns to behave\nin compliance with the norms she identifies as applying to herself;\nacquiring those norms results in their coming to guide her own\nconduct. Finally, prevalent norms and standards of conduct are\ncollectively maintained by a community when its members enforce them,\npunishing those who fail to follow the rules. Enforcement and\npunishment are broad categories, and can include correcting, withholding cooperation,\ncommunicating disapproval through body language or explicit criticism,\nostracizing or gossiping about norm violators, or even physical\nviolence. Thus, individuals become responsive to norms and the social\npressure by which they are enforced, and motivated to apply social\npressure to others who transgress. \nFurther questions arise about each of these propensities. One cluster\nof questions concerns the details of acquisition: what sort of\nperceivable cues are salient to the norm system, prompting a person to\nperceive a behavior, context, or role as normatively\ngoverned? And once a norm is identified, what causes a person to\ninternalize it? Perhaps the merely statistical fact that most people\nbehave the same way suffices in some cases, while in others a\nsanctioning response may be required to activate the acquisition\nprocess. A second family of issues concerns motivation: is norm-guided\nbehavior typically driven by intrinsic or instrumental motivation?\nPeople may comply with a norm for its own sake, simply because it is\nfelt to be the right thing to do. They may also, however, obey a norm\nmerely in order to avoid punishment and blame. Some behaviors may be\ndriven by both kinds of motivation. Similar and perhaps more puzzling\nquestions arise about the psychological roots of people’s\nmotivation to punish others who violate norms. A third family of\nquestions can be framed in terms of innateness: to what degree are the\nmechanisms responsible for norm cognition innately specified or\nculturally acquired? Aside from the mechanisms, is any of the\ncontent—any of the norms themselves—innately\nspecified? \nCognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms treat these as empirical\nquestions, and thus see value in, and aspire to be sensitive to, a\nwide range of evidence. Before looking more closely at some of that\nevidence however, it will be useful to be familiar with the types of\ntheoretical tools researchers typically use to generate and interpret\nit. \nA working hypothesis of cognitive-evolutionary approaches is that the\npsychological mechanisms underlying norm cognition are evolved\nadaptations to important selection pressures in human evolutionary\nhistory (Richerson & Boyd 2005; Sripada & Stich 2007,\nTomasello 2009; Chudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018, cf.\nCosmides & Tooby 1992). Even if a detailed proximate account were\nalready available, other questions could be asked about the provenance\nof the norm system: how—that is, due to which evolutionary\nfactors—did human minds come to be equipped with these\npsychological mechanisms? To what adaptive problem or problems was\nnormative cognition a solution? What selection pressures were\nprimarily responsible for the evolution of a norm system, and what\nphylogenetic trajectory did that evolution take? A brief summary of\nthe types of answers currently on offer to these questions provides\nuseful context for the discussion of proximate explanations that\nfollows. \nA fairly uncontroversial background tenet of the received view is that\nhumans are extraordinarily social animals, and that our hypertrophied\nabilities to learn from and cooperate with each other are key to what\nset us apart from our closest primate ancestors and other hominid\nspecies. A crucial difference is thought to be that human capacities\nto imitate and learn from each other became powerful enough to sustain\ncumulative culture (Tomasello 1999; J. Henrich &\nMcElreath 2003, Laland 2017). Culture is understood as information\nthat is transmitted between individuals and groups via behavior,\nrather than processes like genetic transmission (Ramsey 2013).\nBeliefs, preferences, norms, skills, techniques,\ninformation-containing artifacts, etc., are passed from individual to\nindividual, and thus across populations and between generations,\nmainly by social learning (Mathew & Perreault 2015). For\nexample, development of the set of techniques and skills associated\nwith throwing spears, or the knowledge and tools enabling the\ncontrolled use of fire, have been tied to increases in opportunities\nfor social learning provided by expanding social networks and more\ncomplex forms of social activity (Thieme 1997; Gowlett 2006). Culture\nis cumulative in the sense that the body of information in\nthe cultural repository does not remain static, but can itself grow\nlarger and more complex. Grass huts evolve into wood-frame houses,\nthen brick buildings, and eventually skyscrapers. Tribal leaders\nevolve into kings, then emperors, then prime ministers. Simple sets of\nnorms evolve into more complicated informal institutions, then\nbyzantine formalized legal codes. As each generation adds its own new\ninnovations, discoveries, and improvements, functional sophistication\nis accumulated in cultural traits in much the same way as it is\naccumulated in genetic traits. \nThis general evolutionary outlook gives reason to think that as human\ngroups increased in size, they also grew in their capacity to carry\nmore culture and produce more cultural innovations (Kline & Boyd\n2010; J. Henrich 2015: chapter 12), though the causal relationship\nbetween population size and cultural complexity remains controversial\n(Fogarty & Creanza 2017, cf. Vaesen et al. 2016). As cultural\ninnovations continued to accumulate, they allowed humans to more\nsignificantly control and reshape the environments in which they\nlived. Such transformations also reshaped the environments inhabited\nby subsequent generations, thus shifting the contours of the physical,\nsocial, and informational niches in which they evolved. Such changes,\nin turn, created a range of new selection pressures, many of which\nfavored bodies, brains, and minds better equipped for sociality and\ncultural inheritance. Researchers continue to develop and debate the\nmerits of different conceptual tools with which to conceive of this\nkind of evolutionary dynamic (Tomasello 1999; Laland, Odling-Smee,\n& Feldman 2001; Laland, Odling-Smee, & Myles 2010; Sterelny\n2003, 2012; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tennie, Call, & Tomasello\n2009; Boyd, Richerson, & Henrich 2011, J. Henrich 2015; Boyd\n2017). \nHumans are able to inhabit a wide range of environments, and socially\ntransmitted information—as opposed to innately specified and\nbiologically transmitted information—is particularly useful in\nthe face of ecological and social variation (Richerson & Boyd\n2013). Information about which plants in various environments are\nedible and which are toxic has straightforward adaptive advantage.\nInformation about what kinds of norms prevail in various social\nenvironments is also important, and knowing it allows individuals to\nsmoothly participate in their community and coordinate with other\nmembers in an array of collective activities that ranges from\nproducing food and raising children to responding to threats and\ndealing with outsiders (Chudek & Henrich 2011). While different\ntypes of cultural variants can be useful in different ways,\nnot all socially transmittable information is equally valuable, and\nindividuals are not indiscriminate social learners. Theorists posit\nthat human minds evolved to contain a number of social learning\nbiases or heuristics that help facilitate more\nselective learning. These influence which, of the many cultural\nvariants to which an individual is exposed, she will actually adopt\nfor herself. Two heuristics appear to be particularly important in\namplifying the advantages of a system of cultural inheritance. One is\na conformity bias, which prompts individuals to adopt those\ncultural variants that have been adopted by most others in their\ncommunity (Muthukrishna, Morgan, & Henrich 2016), and another is a\nprestige bias, which sensitizes individuals to hierarchy and\nstatus, prompting them to model their behavior on those who have\nachieved success and high social rank (J. Henrich & Gil-White\n2001; Cheng et al. 2012; Maner 2017). In addition to these two,\nresearchers have posited other learning biases that can influence norm\nacquisition, including one that makes information about norms easier\nto remember than other, non-normative information about behavior\n(O’Gorman, Wilson, & Miller 2008). \nCulture looms increasingly large in evolutionary explanations of human\nultrasociality, i.e., our species’ ability to cooperate on a\nremarkably large scale (Tomasello 2009, 2016; Richerson 2013; though\nsee Hagen & Hammerstein 2006; Burnham & Johnson 2005 for\nalternative views, and Sterelny, Calcott, & Fraser 2013 for\nbroader context on the evolution of cooperation). An increasingly\nprominent idea is that explaining the full range of behaviors involved\nin human sociality will require some appeal not just to culture in\ngeneral, but to culturally transmitted norms and institutions in\nparticular (Mathew, Boyd, & van Veelen 2013). Some have taken the\nsignificance and complexity of the adaptive challenges posed by\nlarge-scale cooperation to have implications for human psychology,\narguing from these grounds that human minds have a capacity specific to\nnorms (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013), which may have evolved in\ntandem with our capacities for language (Lamm 2014). Others argue\nfurther that cultural group selection, generated by various forms of\ncompetition between cultural groups like communities, tribes, clans,\nand even nations, has contributed to the spread of more effective\ncooperative norms (Turchin 2018; Richerson, Baldini, et al. 2016,\nthough see Krasnow et al. 2015). On such views, these kinds of\nselective pressures further remodeled human social psychology,\nsupplementing more evolutionarily ancient social instincts to form\nwhat have been called tribal social instincts (Richerson & Boyd\n2001; Boyd & Richerson 2008; Richerson & Henrich 2012). This family of\nevolutionarily recent “instincts” is posited as including\na capacity for norms, but also other psychological features thought to\nrefine norm-guided behavior in various ways, including sensitivities\nto markers of tribal membership and the boundaries between ethnic\ngroups (McElreath, Boyd, & Richerson 2003) and social emotions\nlike guilt, pride, and loyalty. \nThe theoretical toolkit common in the cognitive and behavioral\nsciences affords several key dimensions along which different\ntheorists stake out and explore more specific positions about\nnormative psychology. Capacities like the one for norms are understood\nas complex in the sense that they are subserved by a number of\nsimpler, interrelated processes and subsystems. Such complex systems\nare usefully analyzed by reference to those simpler ones that comprise\nthem. When used in psychology, this general method of analyzing\ncomplex systems by appeal to the character and interactions of their\ncomponent parts often takes the form of what has been called\nhomuncular functionalism (Lycan 1990), where it is paired with the\nmetaphysical doctrine of functionalism about the mind. This, briefly\nstated, is the view that mental states and processes are functional\nstates, identified by the characteristic role they play in the\npsychological system of which they are a part (Putnam 1963, 1967;\nFodor 1968; Levin 2004 [2018]). Dennett, an early proponent of\nhomuncular functionalism, urged psychologists to follow a method\nparallel to that used in artificial intelligence research: \nThe AI researcher starts with an intentionally characterized\nproblem (e.g., how can I get a computer to understand\nquestions of English?), breaks it down into sub-problems that are also\nintentionally characterized (e.g., how do I get the computer to\nrecognize questions, distinguish subjects from\npredicates, ignore irrelevant parsing?) and then breaks these\nproblems down further until he reaches problem or task descriptions\nthat are obviously mechanistic. (Dennett 1978: 80) \nAn important step in any explanation is delineating the target\nphenomena itself. In cognitive science, this step often takes the form\nof characterizing a capacity via task analysis, which amounts to\nidentifying and distinguishing the tasks or functions that\nare performed in exercising the relevant capacity. For example, some\ntasks currently thought to be central to the functioning of a norm\nsystem include those mentioned above: acquisition, compliance, and\nenforcement. Another step is concerned with modeling the\npsychological mechanisms responsible for carrying out those\ntasks: the typical algorithms and patterns of information processing\nthat perform those functions. The final step in completing a full\naccount of a capacity would be an explanation of how those mechanisms\nand algorithms are implemented and thus realized in the\nperson’s physical, chemical, and biological structures (see Marr\n1982 for the classical discussion of these different levels of\nexplanation). \nWhile experimental and other behavioral evidence can help to more\ndirectly characterize a capacity and identify its associated tasks,\nmany theoretically important issues have to do with determining what\nkind of psychological mechanisms should be posited to account for\nthem. Theorists defending different views might hypothesize different\nmechanisms that underpin a particular capacity, or give different\naccounts of how a mechanism performs its function. They can also agree\nor disagree about how the relevant mechanisms are organized,\ndeveloping different accounts of their proprietary algorithms, and the\ntypes of causal and informational links each bears to each other and\nto other elements of a person’s overall psychological economy\n(perceptual systems, short term memory, action production systems,\netc.). \nWithin this conceptual space there are number of prominent dimensions\nalong which accounts might vary. The following list of such dimensions\nis not exhaustive, but it gives a sense of some of the most\nsignificant ones. The psychological mechanisms posited by different\nproximate accounts of a norm system can differ with respect to \nThe first dimension concerns a distinction between type 1 and\ntype 2 cognitive processes made by dual processing and dual\nsystems theories (see Frankish 2010 for a review, Cushman, Young,\n& Greene 2010). Type 1 processes are typically characterized as\n“fast and frugal,” intuitive, heuristic processes which\ndeliver “rough-and-ready” responses (Gigerenzer et al.\n2000). These processes take place automatically and unconsciously and\nare prone to error, but they make up in speed and resource-efficiency\nwhat they lack in precision. Type 2 processes, by contrast, are\ntypically characterized as slower, rule-based, analytical processes\nwhich require more concentration and cognitive effort, take place\nconsciously, and deliver more precise responses. \nThe second dimension concerns the view that the mind is, to some\ndegree, made up of modules: psychological mechanisms that are\ninformationally encapsulated, fairly autonomous, automatic, and\ndomain-specific (Fodor 1983; Carruthers 2006; Robbins 2009 [2017]).\nModules are informationally encapsulated in the sense that they are\ninsensitive to information present in the mind but not contained\nwithin the mechanism itself, leaving their internal processes\nunaffected by, for example, what the person reflectively believes or\nprefers. A related property is cognitive impenetrability. This\ncaptures the fact that the information and processes inside a module\nare themselves inaccessible to central systems, such as those involved\nin introspection or deliberation. Although it is often possible to\nconsciously consider the output of a modular mechanism, the endogenous\nprocesses responsible for producing that output will remain opaque to\ndirect introspection (Carruthers 2011). \nTurning to the third dimension, it should be clear how commitments\nalong the first two dimensions could support different views about the\nextent to which normatively governed expectations and behavior require\nor are susceptible to voluntary control. If the processes subserving\nthe capacity for norms are to some degree automatic and unconscious,\nand are insensitive to changes a person makes to her explicit beliefs,\njudgments, or volitions, those processes would be able to affect her\nbehavior without the need of any guidance from her will, and could\nhelp produce behaviors and judgments that oppose it. Research on\nimplicit bias may provide useful resources for thinking about the\nrelationship between normative cognition and voluntary control. Recent\nwork sheds light on what kind of intervention strategies are effective\n(Lai et al. 2014; Devine et al. 2012), and suggests that deliberate\ncognitive effort and voluntary control can, under certain conditions,\noverride the influence of implicit and automatic cognition. Turning to normative cognition, research\nsuggests that self-control may be required to violate a norm one has\ninternalized, such as the norm against breaking promises (Baumgartner\net al. 2009), but the details remain unclear (Peach, Yoshida, &\nZanna 2011; Yoshida et al. 2012; also see Kelly forthcoming for\ndiscussion of differences between internalized and avowed norms). \nThe fourth and fifth dimensions are where the traditional\nnature/nurture debate plays out with respect to norms and normative\npsychology. It is part of the standard account of modules that they\nare innate in the sense that they will develop in more or less the\nsame way in normal humans, irrespective of cultural setting. Advocates\nof so-called Evolutionary Psychology, one especially visible way of\napplying evolutionary thought to human behavior, have embraced the\nidea of modules, even arguing that human minds are “massively\nmodular”, i.e., composed exhaustively or almost entirely of\nmodular psychological mechanisms (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992;\nSamuels 1998; Carruthers 2006). On such a view, normative psychology\nwill also be modular in many respects. One way to develop this idea\nwould be to make the case that all human cultures are structured by\nsome set of norms or another, suggesting the presence of modular\ncognition. The ways in which norms differ from one group to the next\nmight then be explained by appeal to an evoked culture model\n(Tooby & Cosmides 1992, though see Sperber 1996 for a different\naccount of the relationship between modular cognition and culture).\nAccording to this model, the norm-guided behaviors found across\ncultures would be construed as innately constrained, rooted in\nendogenous mental form and content of the “cognitive adaptations\nfor social exchange” common to all human minds. Normative\nvariation, then, would be explained by appeal to the fact that\ndifferent groups live in different circumstances, and variation in the\nexternal conditions they face evokes different subsets of the set of\nall norms and norm-governed behaviors made possible by the norm\nsystem. Such a view has been suggested but not yet fully worked out\n(though see Buchanan & Powell 2018). An alternative family of\nviews puts the ideas of innateness and domain-specificity to different\nuses (Fessler & Machery 2012). These, which have been more\ndeveloped for normative psychology, depict humans as having an innate\ncapacity dedicated to acquiring and performing norms, but whose\nunderlying mechanisms contain little if any innately specified\ncontent. No particular norms would be innate on such a view; rather,\nthe capacity (perhaps together with some set of learning biases)\nguides acquisition in its specific domain, and thus equips individuals\nto easily internalize whatever norms are present in her local social\nenvironment (Boyd & Richerson 2005a; Sripada & Stich 2007;\nChudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018). \nA general alternative to these kinds of nativist, modular views has\nrecently been developed in more detail. It holds that psychological\nmechanisms bearing many characteristics of type 1 processes might be\nlearned cognitive gadgets rather than innate cognitive\ninstincts or modules. On this account, a complex capacity—for,\nsay, reading and writing or playing chess—is still underpinned\nby a number of relatively integrated psychological mechanisms and\nroutinized processes, but these mechanisms themselves (as opposed to\nmerely the content they process) are fashioned and bundled together by\ncultural evolution. These packages of skills, once available in the\ngroup’s cultural repertoire, can then be acquired by individuals\nvia domain general learning processes (Heyes 2018). The idea of a\ncognitive gadget provides a promising new theoretical option for\npsychology in general. Its advocates have not yet systematically\naddressed the question of whether it best captures the capacity for\nnorms, however (though see Sterelny 2012 chapter 7 for a discussion\nthat anticipates this line of thought). \nOthers interested in moral cognition more generally—which\noutstrips work on norm-guided behavior to include work on the\npsychology of altruism, well-being, character and virtue, moral\nemotions, intentional versus unintentional action, and so\nforth—have sought to develop an analogy between Chomskyan\ntheories of language acquisition and use, on one hand, and the\nacquisition and application of moral rules, on the other (Mikhail\n2007, 2011; Dwyer, Huebner, & Hauser 2010; Hauser, Young, &\nCushman 2008; Roedder & Harman 2010).  This approach is generally\nnativist, positing a universal moral competence that guides learning\nspecifically in the domain of morality, and contains enough innately\nspecified structure to account for the putative poverty of moral\nstimulus that children face when attempting to learn the norms that\nprevail in their local environment (see Laurence & Margolis 2001\nfor discussion of poverty of the stimulus arguments in cognitive\nscience). Some advocates also suggest that in addition to information\nspecifying the structure of the mechanisms dedicated to acquiring and\nprocessing moral norms, a few particular norms themselves may also be\nincluded as part of the innate moral capacity, perhaps norms against\nincest or intentionally causing harm (e.g., Mikhail 2007,\n2011). Others have criticized this view (Prinz 2008; Sterelny 2012),\nbut only recently has a more detailed positive account of rule\nacquisition begun to be developed. Central to this newly emerging\nempiricist alternative is the idea that individuals are rational rule\nlearners, but they rely on domain general learning strategies to\nacquire norms from their social environment, rather than on an\ninnately specified, domain specific moral competence (Gaus &\nNichols 2017; Ayars & Nichols 2017, 2020; Nichols\nforthcoming.) \nThe sixth and final dimension concerns motivation. Especially in light\nof the roles that punishment and reward play in the stabilization of\ngroup-level patterns of behavior, an initially plausible idea is that\nnormative motivation is instrumental (for discussion see Fehr\n& Falk 2002). On such views, an individual conforms to a norm in\norder to receive some benefit, or to avoid reprimand, or because she\nwants to behave in the way she thinks others expect her to behave.\nSuch motivation would be instrumental in the sense that people obey\nnorms merely as a means to some further end that more fundamentally\ndrives them; in counterfactual terms, remove the external reward,\npunishment, or social expectation, and the individual’s norm\ncompliant behavior will disappear along with it. Those who explore\nthis kind of account have recently emphasized the role of\npsychological states like conditional preferences, together with\n2nd order social beliefs, i.e., people’s beliefs\nabout other people’s expectations, and people’s beliefs\nabout other people’s beliefs about what should be done (see\nBicchieri, Muldoon, & Sontuoso 2018 for discussion of such a\nfamily views). \nOther accounts construe normative motivation as intrinsic\n(Kelly & Davis 2018; Nichols forthcoming,\nespecially chapter 10). On such a\nview, once a norm is acquired and internalized, it typically becomes\ninfused with some kind of non-instrumental motivation. People will be\nmotivated to comply with and enforce a such rule for its own sake, and\nexperience an impetus to do so that is independent of external\ncircumstances or the perceived likelihood that they will receive\nsocial sanctions even if they flout the norm. Intrinsic motivation\ndoes not imply unconditional behavioral conformity, of course. For\nexample, a person may feel the intrinsic pull of a norm that\nprescribes leaving a 20% tip, but still choose to override it and\ninstead act out of material self-interest, stiffing the waiter. This\nsecond family of accounts raises a broader set of questions about the\npsychological nature of normative motivation, and if and how it might\nbe special. Is normative motivation best treated as a primitive, its\nown sui generis psychological category? Or is it better\nconstrued as being generated by more familiar psychological elements\nlike desires, emotions, drives, or other types of conative states,\nposited on independent grounds, that are recruited to work in\nconjunction with normative psychology? (see Kelly 2020 for\ndiscussion) \nAn early and influential account of the psychology of norms given by\nSripada and Stich (2007) illustrates how these kinds of theoretical\npieces might be put together. The preliminary model posits two innate\nmechanisms, a norm acquisition mechanism and a norm\nexecution mechanism. The functions or tasks of the norm\nacquisition mechanism are \nThe tasks of the norm execution mechanism, on the other hand, are \nSripada and Stich provide an initial pictorial representation: \nFigure: Sripada & Stich 2007: 290,\nfigure redrawn.\n [An\n extended description of the figure\n is in the supplement.] \nThe acquisition and execution mechanisms themselves are posited as\ninnate, but are highly sensitive to the local social setting in which\nan individual develops. As described above, this bifurcation into\ninnate psychological architecture, on the one hand, and socially\nlearned normative content, on the other, is taken to explain why the\npresence of norms is culturally universal, whereas the behaviors,\nroles, and social arrangements governed by those norms exhibit\nvariation. In addition, the model depicts the operation of many\ncomponents of the norm system as “automatic and\ninvoluntary” (Sripada & Stich 2007: 290), but takes no stand\non particular processes or more granular characteristics associated\nwith modularity or dual processing. Finally, the model is designed to\naccommodate evidence suggesting that when a norm is acquired and\nrepresented in the database it thereby gains a distinctive kind of\nmotivational profile. Specifically, this profile construes normative\nmotivation as \nOn this account, normative motivation has the third property in the\nsense that in some cases it is capable of overpowering even fairly\ncompelling motivations that pull in conflicting directions; extreme\nexamples include suicide bombers overriding their instincts for\nself-preservation, or other fanatics who expend significant resources\nto enforce their favored norms on others. The self- and\nother-directedness of normative motivation captures the idea that the\nnorm system produces motivation to keep one’s own behavior in\ncompliance with a norm as well as motivation to enforce it by\npunishing others who violate it. \nFinally, the model depicts normative motivation as intrinsic in the\nusual sense that people comply with norms as ultimate ends, or for\ntheir own sake. Sripada and Stich suggest that intrinsic motivation\nhelps explain a property of norms they call “independent\nnormativity”. This marks the fact that norms can exert reliable\ninfluence on people’s behavior even when those norms are not\nwritten down or formally articulated in any formal institution, and\nthus not enforced via any official mechanisms of punishment and reward\n(also see Davidson & Kelly 2020). They also discuss motivation and\nindependent normativity in terms of an “internalization\nhypothesis” drawn from sociology and anthropology, and suggest\nthat the idea of internalization can be interpreted in terms of their\nmodel. On this story, a person has internalized a norm when it has\nbeen acquired by and represented in her norm database. The\ninternalization hypothesis can then be construed as a claim that\ninternalized norms are intrinsically motivating for the simple reason\nthat it is a fundamental psychological feature of normative psychology\nthat once a norm has been acquired, delivered to, and represented in a\nperson’s norm database, the norm system automatically confers\nthis distinctive motivational profile on the norm. Being accompanied\nby self- and other-directed intrinsic motivation is part of the\nfunctional role a rule comes to occupy once it is represented in the\ndatabase of a person’s norm system—when it is\n“internalized”—in something analogous to the way\nthat being accompanied by avoidance motivation and contamination\nsensitivity is part of the functional role a cue comes to occupy once\nit is represented in a person’s disgust system (Kelly 2011; also\nsee Gavrilets & Richerson 2017 for a computational model exploring\nthe evolution of norm internalization and the kinds of selective\nforces that may have given normative psychology this intriguing\ncharacteristic). \nThe explanatory strategies and theoretical toolkit of the cognitive\nsciences have been used to guide and account for an enormous range of\nempirical work. Cognitive-evolutionary approaches to normative\npsychology are likewise interdisciplinary, and aspire to\naccommodate empirical research done on norms by anthropologists,\nsociologists, behavioral economists, and developmental, comparative,\nand other kinds of psychologists. This section provides a sampling of\nthe sorts of findings that have been marshalled to illuminate\ninteresting aspects of norm-guided behavior and support different\nclaims about normative cognition. \nAs noted above, the ethnographic record indicates that all cultures\nare structured by norms—rules that guide behavior and standards\nby which it is evaluated (Brown 1991). Evidence also suggests that\nnorms are fairly evolutionarily ancient, as there is little indication\nthat the capacity for norms spread from society to society in the\nrecent past. Anthropologists also have shown that norms governing,\ne.g., food sharing, marriage practices, kinship networks, communal\nrituals, etc., regulate the practices of extant hunter-gatherers and\nrelatively culturally isolated groups, which would be unlikely if\nnorms were a recent innovation (see J. Henrich 2015 for a review).\nMuch attention, however, has been given to the ways in which the\nprevailing sets of norms vary between cultures (House, Kanngiesser, et\nal. 2020; cf. Hofstede 1980, 2001) and the manner in which packages of\nnorms develop and change over time within particular cultures (Gaus\n2016, Schulz et al. 2019; cf. Inglehart 1997; Bednar et al. 2010). \nFor example, one line of evidence from comparative ethnography looks\nat cooperative behavior, and reveals variation between groups even in\nthe kinds of activities, relationships, and contexts that are governed\nby norms. Some groups “cooperate only in warfare and fishing,\nwhile others, just downstream, cooperate only in housebuilding and\ncommunal rituals” (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013: 426). That\nbehavioral variations like these can persist even in the face of the\nsame ecological context (i.e., “just downstream”) suggests\nthat they are due to differences in norms and other socially\ntransmitted elements of culture, rather than responses more directly\nevoked by the physical environment (also see N. Henrich & J.\nHenrich 2007). \nIt is a platitude that different individual norms, identified by the\ncontext in which they apply, their scope and content, and the specific\nbehaviors they prescribe and proscribe, are present in different\ncultures. Systematic empirical work has also recently investigated the\nprominence of different normative themes across cultures.\nFamiliar examples include the different families of norms that mark\ncultures of honor versus cultures of shame, especially those that that\ngovern violence and its aftermath (Nisbett & Cohen 1996; Uskal et\nal. 2019), or the different kinds of norms found in societies that\nprize individualistic values versus those dominated by more\ncollectivist ones, especially norms that delimit the scope of personal\nchoice (McAuliffe et al. 2003; Nisbett 2004; Ross 2012, Hagger\nRentzelas, & Chatzisarantis 2014; J. Henrich forthcoming, also see\nJ. Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan 2010 for discussion of\nmethodological issues). Other researchers have distinguished still\nother themes, for instance identifying the kinds of values and\n“purity” norms that predominate in a community governed by\nwhat they call an ethics of divinity, in comparison to those prevalent\nin communities that are governed by an ethics of autonomy or an ethics\nof community (Shweder et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 1999; this line of\nthought has been further developed in the influential Moral\nFoundations Theory, Haidt 2012; Graham et al. 2013). Theorists also\nuse these kinds of empirical findings to help assess claims about norm\npsychology, shedding light on those features of individual normative\ncognition that are more rigid and universal versus those that are more\nculturally malleable, and on how such psychological features might\nmake various patterns of group-level variation more or less likely\n(O’Neill & Machery 2018). \nA recent and intriguing contribution along these lines is Gelfand and\ncolleagues’ investigation of patterns in the tightness\nand looseness of different cultures’ norms. This work\nlooks at differences in the general overall “strength” of\nnorms within and across cultures: how many norms there are, how\ntolerant members of a culture tend to be of deviations from\nnormatively prescribed behavior, and how severely they punish\nviolations (Gelfand, Nishii, & Raver 2006; Gelfand, Raver, et al.\n2011; Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson 2017). Tighter cultures have\nmore numerous and exacting standards, with members who are less\ntolerant of slight deviancies and prone to impose more severe\nsanctions. Cultures whose members are more lenient and accepting of\nwiggle room around a norm, and who are less extreme in their\nenforcement, fall more towards the loose end of this spectrum. Gelfand\nand colleagues explore the manifestations of tightness and looseness\nnot just at the level of cultures but also across a number of other\nlevels of description, from the communal and historical down to the\nbehavioral, cognitive, and neural (Gelfand 2018). A central claim of\nthis account is that a culture’s orientation towards\nnorms—whether the norm systems of its members tend to be\ncalibrated more tightly or more loosely—reflects the severity of\nthe challenges faced in its past and present:  \n[t]he evolution of norm strength is adaptive to features of\necological environments and, in turn, is afforded by a suite of\nadaptive psychological processes. (Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson\n2017: 802, our italics)  \nA group whose ecology is characterized by things like frequent natural\ndisasters, disease, territorial invasion, or resource scarcity is\nlikely to possess a more comprehensive and exacting system of norms\nand to take a stricter stance towards its norms, in part because more\nefficiently coordinated social action is required to overcome more\nsevere threats. Groups faced with less extreme ecological stressors\nhave less dire need for tightly coordinated social action, and so can\nafford to have weaker norms and more tolerance for deviation. \nBehavioral economics began by focusing on how real people make actual\neconomic decisions, and on explaining the type of information\nprocessing that leads them to fall short of ideal economic rationality\n(Kahneman 2011). In the last few decades, many behavioral economists\nhave also begun to investigate cross cultural variation in economic\nbehavior, and to interpret findings in terms of the different norms\nof, e.g., fairness, equity, and cooperation adopted by their\nparticipants (e.g., Lesorogol 2007). Much of this evidence comes from\npatterns in how people from different cultures perform in economic\ngames (J. Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Such variation, for\nexample, has been found in ultimatum game experiments, in which two\nparticipants bargain about how to divide a non-trivial sum of\nmoney. The first participant makes a proposal for how to divide the\nsum between the two, which is offered as an ultimatum to the\nother. The second participant can either accept or reject the\noffer. If she accepts, then both participants receive the respective\namounts specified by the proposal; if she rejects it, however, neither\nparticipant receives anything. If they were ideal economic agents,\nthen the first participant, acting from self-interest, would offer the\nlowest possible non-zero amount to the second participant, who would\naccept it because something is better than nothing. This result is\nquite rare in humans, however (though it is more common, intriguingly,\nin chimpanzees; see Jensen, Call, & Tomasello 2007). Actual people\ndo not just diverge from it, but diverge from it in different\nways. Several experiments found that cultural factors affect how\npeople tend to play the game, and that variability in norms and\nconceptions of fairness can help explain different patterns in the\noffers participants make and are willing to accept (Roth et al. 1991;\nthough see Oosterbeek, Sloof & van de Kuilen 2004 for discussion\nof difficulties in interpreting such results). Other experiments use a\nwider range of games to gather evidence of similar patterns of\ncultural variation in economic behavior (see J. Henrich, Boyd, et al.\n2004 for a collection of such work). \nAnother family of findings that is puzzling from the point of view of\nclassical economic rationality shows that individuals will routinely\npunish others even at a cost to themselves (Fehr & Gachter 2002;\nJ. Henrich, McElreath, et al. 2006). Evidence suggests that this\npropensity to punish is influenced by norms and other cultural factors\nas well (Bone, McAuliffe, & Raihani 2016). For example, in public\ngoods games participants are given a non-trivial sum of money and must\ndecide if and how much to contribute to a common pool over the course of\nseveral rounds. How much each investment pays off depends on how much\neveryone collectively contributes that round, so each\nparticipant’s decisions should factor in the behavior of every\nother participant. In some versions, participants can also spend their\nmoney to punish others, based on knowledge of the contributions they\nhave made. Results indicate that some participants are willing to\nincur a cost to themselves to sanction low contributors, but also to\npunish high contributors, a surprising phenomenon called\nanti-social punishment. Participants from different cultures\nexhibit different patterns in their willingness to punish others,\nincluding in their enthusiasm for anti-social punishment (Herrman,\nThöni, and Gächter 2008). Another noteworthy aspect of\npunitive behavior revealed by behavioral economic experiments is that\nhumans are willing to punish even when they are mere bystanders to the\nincident that they are responding to. In such cases of third-party\npunishment, an individual enforces a norm despite the fact that\nshe is neither the offender who commits the violation and\nbecomes the target of the punishment, nor the offended who\nwas wronged or the victim affected by the transgression (Fehr &\nFischbacher 2004; though see Bone, Silva, & Raihani 2014). \nMore broadly, the general psychological propensity for punishment\nilluminated by this kind of empirical work has been claimed by\nresearchers to emerge early in humans (Schmidt & Tomasello 2012;\nMcAuliffe, Jordan, & Richerson 2015). Some have argued that it is\ncrucial to a host of features of human social life, including the\ngroup-level stabilization of norms (Boyd & Richerson 1992) and the\ncapacity to sustain cooperation on large scales (Price, Cosmides,\n& Tooby 2002; Mathew & Boyd 2011; Mathew, Boyd, & van\nVeelen 2013). Others have used such results to support inferences\nabout the character of normative psychology, including the nature of\nnormative motivation. For instance, Chudek and Henrich summarize\nseveral neuroeconomic studies (Fehr & Camerer 2007; Tabibnia,\nSatpute, & Lieberman 2008; and de Quervain et al. 2004) that\ninvestigate economic behavior using the methods and technology of\nneuroscience (i.e., fMRI) by pointing out that  \nboth cooperating and punishing in locally normative ways activates the\nbrain’s rewards or reward anticipation circuits in the same\nmanner as does obtaining a direct cash payment. (Chudek & Henrich\n2011: 224) \nAn impressive range of evidence suggests that humans are natural-born\nnorm learners. The developmental trajectory of norm-guided cognition\nin humans appears to exhibit robust similarities across cultures, with\nchildren beginning to participate in normative behavior around the\nsame early age (see House et al. 2013 and Tomasello 2019 for context).\nBetween three and five years of age children exhibit knowledge of\ndifferent kinds of normative rules (Turiel 1983; Smetana 1993; Nucci\n2001), and at as early as three years of age they are able to perform\ncompetently in deontic reasoning tasks (R. Cummins 1996; Beller 2010).\nThey also enforce norms, both when they believe the transgressive\nbehavior was freely chosen (Josephs et al. 2016) but also when they\nunderstand that it was unintentional (Samland et al. 2016) at least in\nsome circumstances (cf. Chernyak & Sobel 2016; also see Barrett et\nal. 2016 and Curtin et al. forthcoming for evidence and discussion of\ncross cultural variation in people’s sensitivity to the mental\nstates of norm violators). Moreover, children are alert to how other\npeople respond to transgressions, showing more positive feelings\ntowards those who enforce a norm violation than toward those who leave\nviolations uncorrected (Vaish et al. 2016). \nPerhaps most striking is the ease and rapidity with which children\nacquire norms. Preschoolers have been found to learn norms quickly\n(Rakoczy, Warneken, & Tomasello 2008), even without explicit\ninstruction (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011), although\nlearning is facilitated when norms are modeled by adults (Rakoczy,\nHaman, et al. 2010). Children’s enthusiasm for rules—their\n“promiscuous normativity” (Schmidt, Butler, et al.\n2016)—even appears to outstrip being sensitive to common\nnorm-governed behavior in their social environment. Evidence suggests\nthat sometimes a single observation of an action is sufficient for\nchildren to infer the existence of a norm, and that left to their own\ndevices they will spontaneously create their own norms and teach them\nto others (Göckeritz, Schmidt, & Tomasello 2014). \nThat said, behaviors that are perceived to be normal in a community are\nparticularly salient to individuals’ norm psychology. Children\nare also normatively promiscuous in that they appear prone to false\npositives in the course of acquisition, seeing behavior as norm-guided\neven when it is merely common, and inferring the presence of normative\nrules when there are none. One series of studies found that when\nparticipants (children and adults from both the United States and\nChina) detected or were told that a type of behavior was common among\na group of people, they came to negatively evaluate group members who\nbehaved in a non-conforming way (Roberts et al. 2018; Roberts, Ho,\n& Gelman 2019). Researchers have investigated this feature of norm\nacquisition from different angles, and have labeled it with various\nnames, including the “descriptive-to-prescriptive\ntendency” (Roberts, Gelman, & Ho 2017) the “common is\nmoral heuristic” (Lindström et al. 2017), and the\n“injunctive inference hypothesis” (Davis, Hennes, &\nRaymond 2018, discussing, e.g., Schultz et al. 2007). Since the\nevidence suggests that human normative cognition invites an easy\ninference from the “is” of a perceived pattern of common\nbehavior to the “ought” of a norm (Tworek & Cimpian\n2016), philosophers may be tempted to think of this as a\n“naturalistic fallacy bias”. \nAnother line of research suggests that key to understanding the roots\nof human normativity is the fact that human children are\noverimitators. They are not just spontaneous, intuitive, and\nexcellent imitators, but they also tend to copy all of the\nelements in the sequence of a model’s behavior, even when they\nrecognize some of those elements are superfluous to the task at hand\n(Lyons, Young, & Keil 2007; Kenward, Karlsson, & Persson 2011;\nKeupp, Behne, & Rakoczy 2013; Nielsen, Kapitány, &\nElkins 2014, cf. Heyes 2018: chapter 6). Children attend to the\nspecific manner in which an action is carried out rather than merely\nto the goal it is aimed at, and conform to the full script even if\nthey see that the goal can be achieved in some more direct way.\nMoreover, children monitor others to see if they are doing likewise,\nand enforce overimitation on their peers by criticizing those who fail\nto perform the entire sequence of steps (Kenward 2012; Rakoczy &\nSchmidt 2013). Overimitation can lead to the unnecessary expenditure\nof energy on these extraneous behaviors, but the trait may be an\nadaptation nevertheless. According to this argument, the costs of what\nlook like individual “mistakes” are ultimately outweighed\nby the communal benefits generated by a population whose individual\ncapacities for transmitting norms and other cultural variants are more\ninsistent in this way, erring on the side of too much imitation rather\nthan too little (J. Henrich 2015: chapter 7). Whatever it was\ninitially selected for, researchers have suggested that the\npsychological machinery responsible for overimitation makes important\ncontributions to normative cognition. Evidence indicates that this\nmachinery generates strong (perhaps intrinsic) social motivation aimed\nat behavioral conformity with others. When working in conjunction with\na norm system, this source of motivation may also help facilitate\nperformance of the key task of keeping an individual’s behavior\ncompliant, inducing her to conform not just to behaviors she is\nobserving but to those norms she has internalized (Hoehl et al. 2019\nfor overview). \nOverimitation is also noteworthy because it may be distinctively\nhuman. For example, although chimpanzees imitate the way conspecifics\ninstrumentally manipulate their environment to achieve a goal, they\nwill copy the behavior only selectively, skipping steps which they\nrecognize as unnecessary (Whiten et al. 2009, also see Clay &\nTennie 2018 for similar results with bonobos). Evidence suggests that\nlearning in human children is comparatively more attuned to peer\ninfluence in other ways as well. Once chimpanzees and orangutans have\nfigured out how to solve a problem, they are conservative, sticking to\nwhatever solution they learn first. Humans, in contrast, will often\nswitch to a new solution that is demonstrated by peers, sometimes even\nswitching to less effective strategies under peer influence\n(Haun, Rekers, & Tomasello 2014). \nHowever, other researchers have recently contested the claim that\noverimitation is strictly absent in non-humans (Andrews 2017). This is one front of a much\nlarger debate over which features of human psychology are unique to\nour species, and which are shared with others. Recent work relevant to\nnorms has focused on whether and to what extent species other than\nhumans have the capacities to sustain cumulative culture (Dean et al.\n2014), with plausible cases being made that the basic psychological\nwherewithal is present not just in some great apes but also in\nsongbirds (Whiten 2019) as well as whales and dolphins (Whitehead\n& Rendell 2015). Another area of focus has been on aspects of\nmoral cognition, where much illuminating work has explored the\ncontinuities between humans and other animals (de Waal 2006; Andrews\n& Monsó forthcoming). Much of this is relevant to, but does\nnot directly address, the question of whether a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms is distinctively human, or which of its\ncomponent mechanisms might be present in rudimentary form in other\nanimals. Some have suggested that the propensity to punish, and\nespecially the tendency for third party sanctioning of norm\nviolations, is not found in other species (Riedl et al. 2012; Prooijen\n2018, though see Suchak et al. 2016). Others point to humans’\nexceptional ability to cooperate and their resulting ecological\ndominance, suggesting it provides indirect evidence for the uniqueness\nof our capacities for culturally transmitted norms (J. Henrich 2015;\nBoyd 2017). Not all are convinced, arguing that animals like elephants\n(Ross 2019) and chimpanzees (von Rohr et al. 2011) exhibit socially\nsophisticated behaviors best explained by the presence of\npsychological precursors to core components of the human norm system.\nImportant preliminary progress has been made on this cluster of\nquestions concerning non-human normativity (Vincent, Ring, &\nAndrews 2018; Andrews 2020; Fitzpatrick forthcoming),\nbut much conceptual and empirical\nwork remains to be done. \nNorms are relevant to areas of research across philosophy, the\nhumanities, and the behavioral sciences, and the kinds of\ncognitive-evolutionary accounts of norm psychology described here have\nthe potential to inform and enrich many of them. The most immediate\nimplications would seem to fall within the domain of moral theory.\nHowever, the relationship of norms and norm psychology to morality and\nmoral psychology is not straightforward, and is itself a subject of\ndebate (Machery 2012). The quest to delimit the boundaries of the\nmoral domain, and to distinguish the genuinely moral from non-moral\nnorms, has a long history, but has yet to produce a view that is\nwidely accepted (Stich 2018). For example, some researchers argue that\nthere are proximate psychological differences that can be used to\ndistinguish a set of moral rules from others (conventional rules,\netiquette rules, pragmatic rules). According to one prominent account\nrooted in developmental psychology, moral rules are marked by the fact\nthat individuals judge them to hold generally rather than only\nlocally, and to apply independently of the pronouncement of any\nauthority figure, and to govern matters concerning harm, welfare,\njustice, and rights (Turiel 1983; Nucci 2001). Some have drawn\ninspiration from the sentimentalist tradition in moral theory to build\non this account, explaining the features posited as distinctive of\nmoral rules by appeal to their connection to emotions like anger or\ndisgust (Nichols 2004; cf. Haidt 2001). Others have contested the\ninitial characterization of moral norms, marshalling arguments and\nevidence that it is not psychologically universal, but is rather\nparochial to certain cultures (Kelly et al. 2007; Kelly & Stich\n2007, also see Berniūnas, Dranseika, & Sousa, 2016;\nBerniūnas, Silius, & Dranseika, 2020; cf. Kumar 2015; Heath\n2017). \nShifting focus from proximate to ultimate considerations seems to add\nlittle clarity. While some theorists hold that our species possesses\nan evolved psychological system dedicated specifically to morality\n(Joyce 2007; Mameli 2013; Stanford 2018; cf. Kitcher 2011), others\nremain skeptical. They argue instead that the evidence better supports\nthe view that humans have an evolved psychological system dedicated to\nnorms in general, but there is nothing about the mechanisms that\nunderlie it, the adaptive pressures that selected for it, or the norms\nthat it can come to contain that would support a distinction between\nmoral norms and non-moral norms (Machery & Mallon 2010; Davis\n& Kelly 2018; Stich forthcoming). On this view, rather, the human\nnorm system evolved to be able to deal with, and can still acquire and\ninternalize, a wide range of norms, including epistemic norms,\nlinguistic norms, sartorial norms, religious norms, etiquette norms,\nand norms that might be classified by a contemporary westerner as\nmoral. Indeed, the claim has been taken to support a historicist view\nof morality itself, according to which the practice of distinguishing\nsome subset of norms and normative judgments as moral, and thus as\npossessing special status or authority, is a culturally parochial and\nrelatively recent historical invention (Machery 2018). \nThat said, several debates with broadly moral subject matter have\nalready begun drawing on empirically inspired accounts of norm\npsychology. For example, philosophical discussions of the moral\nquestions raised by implicit social biases have recently assumed the\nshape of venerable and long-standing debates between individualists\nand structuralists (Beeghly & Holroyd 2020, also see Brownstein\n2015 [2019]). A central issue has been whether behaviors are best\nexplained and injustices best addressed by focusing attention on\nindividual agents and their implicit biases and other psychological\ncharacteristics, on the one hand, or on features of the institutions\nand social structures that those agents inhabit, on the other\n(Haslanger 2015). This has inspired attempts to develop an\ninteractionist account that can combine the virtues of both approaches\n(Madva 2016; Soon 2020).\nSeveral of these have put norms center stage (Ayala-López\n2018), and drawn on empirical research on norm psychology to show how\nnorms serve as a connective tissue that weaves individuals and soft\nsocial structures together (Davidson & Kelly 2020). \nCultural variation in norms and persistent disputes over right and\nwrong have been thought to have significant implications for\nmetaethics as well. The “argument from disagreement” (Loeb\n1998) holds that if dispute over the permissibility of some activity\nor practice persists even after reasoning errors and non-moral factual\ndisagreements have been resolved, such intractable disagreement would\nmilitate against moral realism (Mackie 1977). Empirically establishing\nthe existence of persistent disagreement is difficult (Doris &\nPlakias 2008), but the character of the norm system and its influence\non judgment may speak to whether or not it is likely. Consider two\nindividuals from different cultures, who have internalized divergent\nfamilies of norms (individualistic and collectivist, honor based and\nshame based, divinity and autonomy, tight and loose, etc.) Such\nindividuals are likely to disagree about the permissibility of a range\nof activities and practices, such as what counts as a fair division of\nresources, or whether people should get to choose who they marry, or\nwhat is and is not an appropriate way to respond to an insult. This\ndisagreement may very well endure even in the face of agreement about the\nnon-moral facts of the matter, and even when neither side of the\ndispute is being partial or making any reasoning errors. Such\npersistent disagreement may be explainable by appeal to differences in\nthe individual’s respective norm systems, and to the different\nnorms each has internalized from his or her culture (Machery et al.\n2005). Empirical details of the operational principles of normative\ncognition—especially knowing whether and the extent to which it\nis informationally encapsulated, cognitively impenetrable, or\notherwise recalcitrant and insensitive to other psychological\nprocesses—can help assess the plausibility of this argument. \nA final set of debates to which the details of norm psychology are\nbecoming increasingly relevant are those concerning the nature and\nexplanation of moral progress. Recent progress is understood to have\nlargely come in the form of expansions of the moral circle, the spread\nof inclusive norms, and the demoralization of invalid ones (Singer 1981; Buchanan\n& Powell 2018; cf. Sauer 2019.) Much attention has focused on\nunderstanding changes in the distribution of norms that occur as the\nresult of reasoning about norms (Campbell & Kumar 2012), but\nimportant steps towards moral progress may also occur as the result of\nmyopic, though not fully blind, processes of cultural evolution (cf.\nKling 2016; Brownstein & Kelly 2019). A more detailed empirical\nunderstanding of the relationship of internalized norms to\nrationalization, critical reasoning, and explicit argumentation\n(Summers 2017; Mercier & Sperber 2017), along with a clearer view\nof the other psychological and social factors that influence norms and the\ndynamics of their transmission, will help further illuminate these\nimportant philosophical debates.","contact.mail":"drkelly@purdue.edu","contact.domain":"purdue.edu"},{"date.published":"2020-08-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychology-normative-cognition/","author1":"Daniel Kelly","author2":"Stephen Setman","entry":"psychology-normative-cognition","body.text":"\n\n\nFrom an early age, humans exhibit a tendency to identify, adopt, and\nenforce the norms of their local communities. Norms are the social\nrules that mark out what is appropriate, allowed, required, or\nforbidden in different situations for various community members. These\nrules are informal in the sense that although they are sometimes\nrepresented in formal laws, such as the rule governing which side of\nthe road to drive on, they need not be explicitly codified to\neffectively influence behavior. There are rules that forbid theft or\nthe breaking of promises, but also rules which govern how close it is\nappropriate to stand to someone while talking to them, or how loud one\nshould talk during the conversation. Thus understood, norms regulate a\nwide range of activity. They exhibit cultural variability in their\nprescriptions and proscriptions, but the presence of norms in general\nappears to be culturally universal. Some norms exhibit characteristics\nthat are often associated with morality, such as a rule that applies\nto everyone and prohibits causing unnecessary harm. Other norms apply\nonly to certain people, such as those that delimit appropriate\nclothing for members of different genders, or those concerning the\nexpectations and responsibilities ascribed to individuals who occupy\npositions of leadership. The norms that prevail in a community can be\nmore or less fair, reasonable, or impartial, and can be subject to\ncritique and change.\n\n\nThis entry provides an overview of interdisciplinary research into the\npsychological capacity for norm-guided cognition, motivation, and\nbehavior. The notions of a norm and normativity occur in an enormous\nrange of research that spans the humanities and behavioral sciences.\nResearchers primarily concerned with the psychology distinctive of\nnorm-governed behavior take what can be called\n“cognitive-evolutionary” approaches to their subject\nmatter. These approaches, common in the cognitive sciences, draw on a\nvariety of resources and evidence to investigate different\npsychological capacities. This entry describes how these have been\nused to construct accounts of those cognitive and motivational\nfeatures of minds that underpin the capacity to acquire, conform to,\nand enforce norms. It also describes how theories of the selective\npressures and adaptive challenges prominent in recent human evolution\nhave helped to inform and constrain theorizing about this\npsychological capacity, as well as how its features can influence the\ntransmission and cultural evolution of norms.\n\n\nBy way of organization, the entry starts with basics and proceeds to\nadd subsequent layers of intricacy and detail. Researchers taking\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms come from a wide range of\ndisciplines, and have formulated, explored, and debated positions on a\nlarge number of different issues. In order to present a comprehensible\noverview of these interconnected literatures, the entry starts by\nlaying out main contours and central tenets, the key landmarks in the\nconceptual space common to different theories and claims. It goes on\nto provide a more detailed description of the kinds of theoretical\nresources that researchers have employed, and identifies important\ndimensions along which more specific accounts of the psychology of\nnorms have varied. It then canvasses different sources of empirical\nevidence that have begun to illuminate other philosophically\ninteresting features of the capacity for norms. Finally, it ends with\na discussion of the relationship between norm cognition and morality,\nwith a few illustrations drawn from recent debates in moral\ntheory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorms are the rules of a group of people that mark out what is\nappropriate, allowed, required, or forbidden for various members in\ndifferent situations. They are typically manifest in common behavioral\nregularities that are kept in place by social sanctions. From an early\nage, humans see certain behaviors, contexts, and roles as governed by\nnorms. Once a person adopts a norm, it functions both as a rule that\nguides behavior and as a standard against which behavior is evaluated.\nMoreover, individuals typically become motivated to enforce the norms\nthey adopt, and so to participate in regulative practices such as\npunishment and the ascription of blame. Such practices in turn help\nstabilize the community’s social arrangements and the norms that\nstructure them. Norms are often classified into kinds or\nsubcategories, with common examples including moral, social,\nconventional, epistemic, aesthetic, and organizational norms. The\ncorrect or theoretically most useful way to distinguish and taxonomize\nkinds of norm is the subject of much debate, but one that will be set\naside here (see O’Neill 2017 for a review, Kelly forthcoming\nfor discussion). Rather, this section will sketch a general overview\nof the conceptual space common to cognitive-evolutionary work on the\npsychology of norms, and later sections will elaborate on its\ncontents, locating different claims and specific theories within\nit. \nAn idea central to work on the psychology of norms is that human minds\ncontain a norm system of some kind, a set of psychological\nmechanisms dedicated to handling information and producing behaviors\nrelevant to norms. Such mechanisms feature in an explanatory strategy\ncommon throughout psychology (R. Cummins 2000). In this case,\ntheorists appeal to different properties of the norm system to help\naccount for different aspects of a complex capacity for norm-guided\nbehavior—a capacity to “do” norms. This capacity is\ncharacterized by a broad but distinctive pattern of behavior: when\nfaced with norm relevant stimuli, typically centered on other\npeoples’ actions or their own, along with other cues concerning\nthe context of those actions and the roles of the actors, individuals\nexhibit a robust and multifaceted type of response that is centered on\nconformity and punishment. Taken together, the responses of\nindividuals aggregate up to produce stabilizing group-level effects on\npatterns of collective social organization. The complexity and\nrobustness of the individual capacity suggests the operation of\ndedicated psychological machinery—a norm system—which\nsensitizes humans to certain social stimuli (behavior, contexts,\nroles) and reliably produces the coordinated facets (physiologically,\ninferentially, behaviorally) of the characteristic response. \nThis picture raises the question of how it is that humans are\nable to spontaneously and reliably track norm-relevant features of\ntheir world, infer the rules which govern it, and bring those rules to\nbear on their own and others’ behavior. It also calls for a\npsychological answer, one that sheds light on what mediates the\nstimuli and the response. By analogy, an automobile is capable of\nacceleration—it reliably speeds up in response to the depression\nof the gas pedal—but one needs to “look under the\nhood” to see what sort of mechanisms are reliably translating\nthat kind of input into that kind of output. Moving from the\nacceleration of a car to the norm-guided activity of a person,\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches posit and investigate the\npsychological machinery that is responsible for translating certain\nkinds of social inputs into the kind of behavioral outputs associated\nwith norms. This strategy—of positing psychological mechanisms\nthat mediate stimulus and response—is supported by a now\nfamiliar way of understanding the mind as an information processing\nsystem. The inputs under consideration are treated as information,\nwhich is routed and processed by a suite of psychological mechanisms\nand finally translated into behavioral outputs. Those focused on the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition have posited the\nexistence of this kind of dedicated package of mechanisms, and have\ninvestigated different possibilities about its nature. \nTo introduce a couple terms of art, accounts of psychological\ncapacities often aspire to provide both a proximate\nexplanation and an ultimate explanation. Where proximate\nexplanations try to answer, “How does it work?”, ultimate\nexplanations try to answer, “How did we come to be like\nthis?” This distinction originates in biology (Mayr 1961; Ariew 2003), but is\napplicable to behavioral and psychological traits as well (Griffiths\n2007). Central to proximate explanations in these latter contexts are\nthe models of the psychological processes that underlie specific\ncapacities. After identifying a relatively complex ability, that\nability is explained in terms of the operation and interaction of a\nset of relatively simpler underlying component mechanisms. Thus,\nproximate explanations of norms aim to show how human individuals are\npsychologically capable of the rich array of activity associated with\nnorm-guided behavior by identifying the component parts of the norm\nsystem and describing how they operate. \nUltimate explanations, on the other hand, aim to explain the\nlikely origins of different traits. It is now common for the cognitive\nsciences to make extensive use of evolutionary theory, taking what is\nknown about the environments and selective pressures faced by\nancestral populations and using it to help inform hypotheses about\nminds (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992). Central to many of the\nultimate explanations proposed by researchers interested in the\npsychology of norms are the adaptive challenges raised by collective\naction and large-scale cooperation (Gintis, Bowles, et al. 2005; Boyd\n& Richerson 2005b; N. Henrich & J. Henrich 2007; Tomasello\n2009). For the sake of clarity, it is helpful to remember that these\ntwo styles of explanation are analytically distinct, but that\nproximate and ultimate explanations for a given trait will ideally be\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. Thus, evolutionary accounts of\nnorm cognition can inform and constrain proximate models, and vice\nversa. \nThe psychological focus of cognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms\ngives them a fairly clear research agenda. It is worth noting,\nhowever, that while questions about the nature of norms are relevant\nto a range of debates in philosophy (and beyond), work on the\npsychology of norms is not primarily driven by one particular\nphilosophical tradition or debate. Rather, those focused on\nnormative psychology are typically guided by a set of general\nissues concerning human nature: the structure and distinctive features\nof human minds, the pathways of human evolution that produced them,\nand the commonalities and differences between human minds and\nbehaviors, on one hand, and those found in non-human species, on the\nother (Tomasello 1999; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tooby & Cosmides\n2005; J. Henrich 2015; Vincent Ring, & Andrews 2018). One upshot\nof this is that theorists draw on the full range of explanatory\nresources made available by contemporary cognitive science. Thus,\nthese accounts of normative cognition are not constrained by\nfolk-psychological explanations of behavior, and so are free to posit\nand appeal to psychological mechanisms, states, and processes that\nneed not bear much resemblance to beliefs and desires, credences and\npreferences, conscious deliberation and explicit inference. \nThis entry is organized around research whose focal point is the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition. However, any\ndiscussion of norms and norm-guided behavior will involve, tacitly or\notherwise, some picture or other of agents and the\ncharacteristics that make them responsive to normative influence. Some\nbegin with analytic formalizations of the kinds of agents and mental\nstates assumed by common sense folk psychology, and use these\nformalizations, along with various refinements, to account for\ndifferent norm related phenomena. These fall beyond the scope of this\nentry, but see especially Bicchieri, Muldoon, and Sontuoso (2018) for\nan overview of such approaches (also see Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan\net al. 2013; Conte, Andrighetto, & Campennì 2013; Hawkins,\nGoodman, & Goldstone 2019; cf. Morris et al. 2015). It is also\nworth noting that cognitive-evolutionary approaches are sometimes\npresented as importantly different from classic rational choice\napproaches to human decision and social behavior (Boyd & Richerson\n2001; Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Whether these are\ngenuinely distinct alternatives remains unclear (Elster 1991, cf.\nWendel 2001), but those who make the case typically point to a growing\nbody of evidence that suggests humans rarely approximate the\nunboundedly rational, purely self-interested agents of classical\neconomics (Gigerenzer & Selten 2001; Kahneman 2011, cf. Millgram\n2019, Other Internet Resources).  To illustrate, participants in\none-time, anonymous cooperation games have been observed to routinely\ncooperate, even when they are made explicitly aware of their anonymity\nand the fact that they will play the game just once (Marwell &\nAmes 1981; see Thaler 1992 for a review). Those sympathetic to\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms have an explanatory\ntemplate for this kind of finding ready at hand, and will construe\nparticipants’ behavior as motivated by their norm systems and\nthe pro-social norms that they have internalized. \nWith the expanded repertoire of psychological entities at their\ndisposal, explanations that appeal to a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms also appear well suited to capture the kinds of\ndissonance and dissociation that can occur between individuals’\nattention, implicit categorization, and normative motivation, on the\none hand, and their explicit beliefs and avowed principles, on the\nother. A person may, for example, explicitly endorse feminism and\nsincerely wish to extinguish the sexist norms and expectations he has\nabout women, but nevertheless find himself monitoring the social world\nthrough the lens of those sexist norms, and experiencing recalcitrant\nmotivation to enforce and comply with them (cf. work on implicit\nbiases Brownstein & Saul 2016). In short, on this kind of picture\ndifferent psychological systems that comprise an individual’s\nmind (perhaps the norm system and the practical reasoning system) can\nwork independently from, and be at slight odds with, each other. \nSeveral more specific features that appear distinctive of normative\ncognition have drawn considerable attention from psychological\nresearchers. These include the propensities to acquire norms,\nto comply with norms, and to enforce norms. When a\nperson is born into or otherwise enters a community, she needs to be\nable to identify and extract information about the broad assortment of\nnorms that shape it, who different norms apply to and when, and what\nthe consequences of breaking them are. She must be able to see some\nbehaviors as normatively regulated, and then to infer what\nthe governing rule is. Learning how to do this is sometimes supported\nby intentional pedagogical behavior by her mentors (Sterelny 2012),\nbut need not be (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011). Gaining\nknowledge of the rules is not where it ends. Individuals rarely just\nobserve such social activities, but rather come to competently\nparticipate in them. To do this, a person typically learns to behave\nin compliance with the norms she identifies as applying to herself;\nacquiring those norms results in their coming to guide her own\nconduct. Finally, prevalent norms and standards of conduct are\ncollectively maintained by a community when its members enforce them,\npunishing those who fail to follow the rules. Enforcement and\npunishment are broad categories, and can include correcting, withholding cooperation,\ncommunicating disapproval through body language or explicit criticism,\nostracizing or gossiping about norm violators, or even physical\nviolence. Thus, individuals become responsive to norms and the social\npressure by which they are enforced, and motivated to apply social\npressure to others who transgress. \nFurther questions arise about each of these propensities. One cluster\nof questions concerns the details of acquisition: what sort of\nperceivable cues are salient to the norm system, prompting a person to\nperceive a behavior, context, or role as normatively\ngoverned? And once a norm is identified, what causes a person to\ninternalize it? Perhaps the merely statistical fact that most people\nbehave the same way suffices in some cases, while in others a\nsanctioning response may be required to activate the acquisition\nprocess. A second family of issues concerns motivation: is norm-guided\nbehavior typically driven by intrinsic or instrumental motivation?\nPeople may comply with a norm for its own sake, simply because it is\nfelt to be the right thing to do. They may also, however, obey a norm\nmerely in order to avoid punishment and blame. Some behaviors may be\ndriven by both kinds of motivation. Similar and perhaps more puzzling\nquestions arise about the psychological roots of people’s\nmotivation to punish others who violate norms. A third family of\nquestions can be framed in terms of innateness: to what degree are the\nmechanisms responsible for norm cognition innately specified or\nculturally acquired? Aside from the mechanisms, is any of the\ncontent—any of the norms themselves—innately\nspecified? \nCognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms treat these as empirical\nquestions, and thus see value in, and aspire to be sensitive to, a\nwide range of evidence. Before looking more closely at some of that\nevidence however, it will be useful to be familiar with the types of\ntheoretical tools researchers typically use to generate and interpret\nit. \nA working hypothesis of cognitive-evolutionary approaches is that the\npsychological mechanisms underlying norm cognition are evolved\nadaptations to important selection pressures in human evolutionary\nhistory (Richerson & Boyd 2005; Sripada & Stich 2007,\nTomasello 2009; Chudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018, cf.\nCosmides & Tooby 1992). Even if a detailed proximate account were\nalready available, other questions could be asked about the provenance\nof the norm system: how—that is, due to which evolutionary\nfactors—did human minds come to be equipped with these\npsychological mechanisms? To what adaptive problem or problems was\nnormative cognition a solution? What selection pressures were\nprimarily responsible for the evolution of a norm system, and what\nphylogenetic trajectory did that evolution take? A brief summary of\nthe types of answers currently on offer to these questions provides\nuseful context for the discussion of proximate explanations that\nfollows. \nA fairly uncontroversial background tenet of the received view is that\nhumans are extraordinarily social animals, and that our hypertrophied\nabilities to learn from and cooperate with each other are key to what\nset us apart from our closest primate ancestors and other hominid\nspecies. A crucial difference is thought to be that human capacities\nto imitate and learn from each other became powerful enough to sustain\ncumulative culture (Tomasello 1999; J. Henrich &\nMcElreath 2003, Laland 2017). Culture is understood as information\nthat is transmitted between individuals and groups via behavior,\nrather than processes like genetic transmission (Ramsey 2013).\nBeliefs, preferences, norms, skills, techniques,\ninformation-containing artifacts, etc., are passed from individual to\nindividual, and thus across populations and between generations,\nmainly by social learning (Mathew & Perreault 2015). For\nexample, development of the set of techniques and skills associated\nwith throwing spears, or the knowledge and tools enabling the\ncontrolled use of fire, have been tied to increases in opportunities\nfor social learning provided by expanding social networks and more\ncomplex forms of social activity (Thieme 1997; Gowlett 2006). Culture\nis cumulative in the sense that the body of information in\nthe cultural repository does not remain static, but can itself grow\nlarger and more complex. Grass huts evolve into wood-frame houses,\nthen brick buildings, and eventually skyscrapers. Tribal leaders\nevolve into kings, then emperors, then prime ministers. Simple sets of\nnorms evolve into more complicated informal institutions, then\nbyzantine formalized legal codes. As each generation adds its own new\ninnovations, discoveries, and improvements, functional sophistication\nis accumulated in cultural traits in much the same way as it is\naccumulated in genetic traits. \nThis general evolutionary outlook gives reason to think that as human\ngroups increased in size, they also grew in their capacity to carry\nmore culture and produce more cultural innovations (Kline & Boyd\n2010; J. Henrich 2015: chapter 12), though the causal relationship\nbetween population size and cultural complexity remains controversial\n(Fogarty & Creanza 2017, cf. Vaesen et al. 2016). As cultural\ninnovations continued to accumulate, they allowed humans to more\nsignificantly control and reshape the environments in which they\nlived. Such transformations also reshaped the environments inhabited\nby subsequent generations, thus shifting the contours of the physical,\nsocial, and informational niches in which they evolved. Such changes,\nin turn, created a range of new selection pressures, many of which\nfavored bodies, brains, and minds better equipped for sociality and\ncultural inheritance. Researchers continue to develop and debate the\nmerits of different conceptual tools with which to conceive of this\nkind of evolutionary dynamic (Tomasello 1999; Laland, Odling-Smee,\n& Feldman 2001; Laland, Odling-Smee, & Myles 2010; Sterelny\n2003, 2012; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tennie, Call, & Tomasello\n2009; Boyd, Richerson, & Henrich 2011, J. Henrich 2015; Boyd\n2017). \nHumans are able to inhabit a wide range of environments, and socially\ntransmitted information—as opposed to innately specified and\nbiologically transmitted information—is particularly useful in\nthe face of ecological and social variation (Richerson & Boyd\n2013). Information about which plants in various environments are\nedible and which are toxic has straightforward adaptive advantage.\nInformation about what kinds of norms prevail in various social\nenvironments is also important, and knowing it allows individuals to\nsmoothly participate in their community and coordinate with other\nmembers in an array of collective activities that ranges from\nproducing food and raising children to responding to threats and\ndealing with outsiders (Chudek & Henrich 2011). While different\ntypes of cultural variants can be useful in different ways,\nnot all socially transmittable information is equally valuable, and\nindividuals are not indiscriminate social learners. Theorists posit\nthat human minds evolved to contain a number of social learning\nbiases or heuristics that help facilitate more\nselective learning. These influence which, of the many cultural\nvariants to which an individual is exposed, she will actually adopt\nfor herself. Two heuristics appear to be particularly important in\namplifying the advantages of a system of cultural inheritance. One is\na conformity bias, which prompts individuals to adopt those\ncultural variants that have been adopted by most others in their\ncommunity (Muthukrishna, Morgan, & Henrich 2016), and another is a\nprestige bias, which sensitizes individuals to hierarchy and\nstatus, prompting them to model their behavior on those who have\nachieved success and high social rank (J. Henrich & Gil-White\n2001; Cheng et al. 2012; Maner 2017). In addition to these two,\nresearchers have posited other learning biases that can influence norm\nacquisition, including one that makes information about norms easier\nto remember than other, non-normative information about behavior\n(O’Gorman, Wilson, & Miller 2008). \nCulture looms increasingly large in evolutionary explanations of human\nultrasociality, i.e., our species’ ability to cooperate on a\nremarkably large scale (Tomasello 2009, 2016; Richerson 2013; though\nsee Hagen & Hammerstein 2006; Burnham & Johnson 2005 for\nalternative views, and Sterelny, Calcott, & Fraser 2013 for\nbroader context on the evolution of cooperation). An increasingly\nprominent idea is that explaining the full range of behaviors involved\nin human sociality will require some appeal not just to culture in\ngeneral, but to culturally transmitted norms and institutions in\nparticular (Mathew, Boyd, & van Veelen 2013). Some have taken the\nsignificance and complexity of the adaptive challenges posed by\nlarge-scale cooperation to have implications for human psychology,\narguing from these grounds that human minds have a capacity specific to\nnorms (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013), which may have evolved in\ntandem with our capacities for language (Lamm 2014). Others argue\nfurther that cultural group selection, generated by various forms of\ncompetition between cultural groups like communities, tribes, clans,\nand even nations, has contributed to the spread of more effective\ncooperative norms (Turchin 2018; Richerson, Baldini, et al. 2016,\nthough see Krasnow et al. 2015). On such views, these kinds of\nselective pressures further remodeled human social psychology,\nsupplementing more evolutionarily ancient social instincts to form\nwhat have been called tribal social instincts (Richerson & Boyd\n2001; Boyd & Richerson 2008; Richerson & Henrich 2012). This family of\nevolutionarily recent “instincts” is posited as including\na capacity for norms, but also other psychological features thought to\nrefine norm-guided behavior in various ways, including sensitivities\nto markers of tribal membership and the boundaries between ethnic\ngroups (McElreath, Boyd, & Richerson 2003) and social emotions\nlike guilt, pride, and loyalty. \nThe theoretical toolkit common in the cognitive and behavioral\nsciences affords several key dimensions along which different\ntheorists stake out and explore more specific positions about\nnormative psychology. Capacities like the one for norms are understood\nas complex in the sense that they are subserved by a number of\nsimpler, interrelated processes and subsystems. Such complex systems\nare usefully analyzed by reference to those simpler ones that comprise\nthem. When used in psychology, this general method of analyzing\ncomplex systems by appeal to the character and interactions of their\ncomponent parts often takes the form of what has been called\nhomuncular functionalism (Lycan 1990), where it is paired with the\nmetaphysical doctrine of functionalism about the mind. This, briefly\nstated, is the view that mental states and processes are functional\nstates, identified by the characteristic role they play in the\npsychological system of which they are a part (Putnam 1963, 1967;\nFodor 1968; Levin 2004 [2018]). Dennett, an early proponent of\nhomuncular functionalism, urged psychologists to follow a method\nparallel to that used in artificial intelligence research: \nThe AI researcher starts with an intentionally characterized\nproblem (e.g., how can I get a computer to understand\nquestions of English?), breaks it down into sub-problems that are also\nintentionally characterized (e.g., how do I get the computer to\nrecognize questions, distinguish subjects from\npredicates, ignore irrelevant parsing?) and then breaks these\nproblems down further until he reaches problem or task descriptions\nthat are obviously mechanistic. (Dennett 1978: 80) \nAn important step in any explanation is delineating the target\nphenomena itself. In cognitive science, this step often takes the form\nof characterizing a capacity via task analysis, which amounts to\nidentifying and distinguishing the tasks or functions that\nare performed in exercising the relevant capacity. For example, some\ntasks currently thought to be central to the functioning of a norm\nsystem include those mentioned above: acquisition, compliance, and\nenforcement. Another step is concerned with modeling the\npsychological mechanisms responsible for carrying out those\ntasks: the typical algorithms and patterns of information processing\nthat perform those functions. The final step in completing a full\naccount of a capacity would be an explanation of how those mechanisms\nand algorithms are implemented and thus realized in the\nperson’s physical, chemical, and biological structures (see Marr\n1982 for the classical discussion of these different levels of\nexplanation). \nWhile experimental and other behavioral evidence can help to more\ndirectly characterize a capacity and identify its associated tasks,\nmany theoretically important issues have to do with determining what\nkind of psychological mechanisms should be posited to account for\nthem. Theorists defending different views might hypothesize different\nmechanisms that underpin a particular capacity, or give different\naccounts of how a mechanism performs its function. They can also agree\nor disagree about how the relevant mechanisms are organized,\ndeveloping different accounts of their proprietary algorithms, and the\ntypes of causal and informational links each bears to each other and\nto other elements of a person’s overall psychological economy\n(perceptual systems, short term memory, action production systems,\netc.). \nWithin this conceptual space there are number of prominent dimensions\nalong which accounts might vary. The following list of such dimensions\nis not exhaustive, but it gives a sense of some of the most\nsignificant ones. The psychological mechanisms posited by different\nproximate accounts of a norm system can differ with respect to \nThe first dimension concerns a distinction between type 1 and\ntype 2 cognitive processes made by dual processing and dual\nsystems theories (see Frankish 2010 for a review, Cushman, Young,\n& Greene 2010). Type 1 processes are typically characterized as\n“fast and frugal,” intuitive, heuristic processes which\ndeliver “rough-and-ready” responses (Gigerenzer et al.\n2000). These processes take place automatically and unconsciously and\nare prone to error, but they make up in speed and resource-efficiency\nwhat they lack in precision. Type 2 processes, by contrast, are\ntypically characterized as slower, rule-based, analytical processes\nwhich require more concentration and cognitive effort, take place\nconsciously, and deliver more precise responses. \nThe second dimension concerns the view that the mind is, to some\ndegree, made up of modules: psychological mechanisms that are\ninformationally encapsulated, fairly autonomous, automatic, and\ndomain-specific (Fodor 1983; Carruthers 2006; Robbins 2009 [2017]).\nModules are informationally encapsulated in the sense that they are\ninsensitive to information present in the mind but not contained\nwithin the mechanism itself, leaving their internal processes\nunaffected by, for example, what the person reflectively believes or\nprefers. A related property is cognitive impenetrability. This\ncaptures the fact that the information and processes inside a module\nare themselves inaccessible to central systems, such as those involved\nin introspection or deliberation. Although it is often possible to\nconsciously consider the output of a modular mechanism, the endogenous\nprocesses responsible for producing that output will remain opaque to\ndirect introspection (Carruthers 2011). \nTurning to the third dimension, it should be clear how commitments\nalong the first two dimensions could support different views about the\nextent to which normatively governed expectations and behavior require\nor are susceptible to voluntary control. If the processes subserving\nthe capacity for norms are to some degree automatic and unconscious,\nand are insensitive to changes a person makes to her explicit beliefs,\njudgments, or volitions, those processes would be able to affect her\nbehavior without the need of any guidance from her will, and could\nhelp produce behaviors and judgments that oppose it. Research on\nimplicit bias may provide useful resources for thinking about the\nrelationship between normative cognition and voluntary control. Recent\nwork sheds light on what kind of intervention strategies are effective\n(Lai et al. 2014; Devine et al. 2012), and suggests that deliberate\ncognitive effort and voluntary control can, under certain conditions,\noverride the influence of implicit and automatic cognition. Turning to normative cognition, research\nsuggests that self-control may be required to violate a norm one has\ninternalized, such as the norm against breaking promises (Baumgartner\net al. 2009), but the details remain unclear (Peach, Yoshida, &\nZanna 2011; Yoshida et al. 2012; also see Kelly forthcoming for\ndiscussion of differences between internalized and avowed norms). \nThe fourth and fifth dimensions are where the traditional\nnature/nurture debate plays out with respect to norms and normative\npsychology. It is part of the standard account of modules that they\nare innate in the sense that they will develop in more or less the\nsame way in normal humans, irrespective of cultural setting. Advocates\nof so-called Evolutionary Psychology, one especially visible way of\napplying evolutionary thought to human behavior, have embraced the\nidea of modules, even arguing that human minds are “massively\nmodular”, i.e., composed exhaustively or almost entirely of\nmodular psychological mechanisms (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992;\nSamuels 1998; Carruthers 2006). On such a view, normative psychology\nwill also be modular in many respects. One way to develop this idea\nwould be to make the case that all human cultures are structured by\nsome set of norms or another, suggesting the presence of modular\ncognition. The ways in which norms differ from one group to the next\nmight then be explained by appeal to an evoked culture model\n(Tooby & Cosmides 1992, though see Sperber 1996 for a different\naccount of the relationship between modular cognition and culture).\nAccording to this model, the norm-guided behaviors found across\ncultures would be construed as innately constrained, rooted in\nendogenous mental form and content of the “cognitive adaptations\nfor social exchange” common to all human minds. Normative\nvariation, then, would be explained by appeal to the fact that\ndifferent groups live in different circumstances, and variation in the\nexternal conditions they face evokes different subsets of the set of\nall norms and norm-governed behaviors made possible by the norm\nsystem. Such a view has been suggested but not yet fully worked out\n(though see Buchanan & Powell 2018). An alternative family of\nviews puts the ideas of innateness and domain-specificity to different\nuses (Fessler & Machery 2012). These, which have been more\ndeveloped for normative psychology, depict humans as having an innate\ncapacity dedicated to acquiring and performing norms, but whose\nunderlying mechanisms contain little if any innately specified\ncontent. No particular norms would be innate on such a view; rather,\nthe capacity (perhaps together with some set of learning biases)\nguides acquisition in its specific domain, and thus equips individuals\nto easily internalize whatever norms are present in her local social\nenvironment (Boyd & Richerson 2005a; Sripada & Stich 2007;\nChudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018). \nA general alternative to these kinds of nativist, modular views has\nrecently been developed in more detail. It holds that psychological\nmechanisms bearing many characteristics of type 1 processes might be\nlearned cognitive gadgets rather than innate cognitive\ninstincts or modules. On this account, a complex capacity—for,\nsay, reading and writing or playing chess—is still underpinned\nby a number of relatively integrated psychological mechanisms and\nroutinized processes, but these mechanisms themselves (as opposed to\nmerely the content they process) are fashioned and bundled together by\ncultural evolution. These packages of skills, once available in the\ngroup’s cultural repertoire, can then be acquired by individuals\nvia domain general learning processes (Heyes 2018). The idea of a\ncognitive gadget provides a promising new theoretical option for\npsychology in general. Its advocates have not yet systematically\naddressed the question of whether it best captures the capacity for\nnorms, however (though see Sterelny 2012 chapter 7 for a discussion\nthat anticipates this line of thought). \nOthers interested in moral cognition more generally—which\noutstrips work on norm-guided behavior to include work on the\npsychology of altruism, well-being, character and virtue, moral\nemotions, intentional versus unintentional action, and so\nforth—have sought to develop an analogy between Chomskyan\ntheories of language acquisition and use, on one hand, and the\nacquisition and application of moral rules, on the other (Mikhail\n2007, 2011; Dwyer, Huebner, & Hauser 2010; Hauser, Young, &\nCushman 2008; Roedder & Harman 2010).  This approach is generally\nnativist, positing a universal moral competence that guides learning\nspecifically in the domain of morality, and contains enough innately\nspecified structure to account for the putative poverty of moral\nstimulus that children face when attempting to learn the norms that\nprevail in their local environment (see Laurence & Margolis 2001\nfor discussion of poverty of the stimulus arguments in cognitive\nscience). Some advocates also suggest that in addition to information\nspecifying the structure of the mechanisms dedicated to acquiring and\nprocessing moral norms, a few particular norms themselves may also be\nincluded as part of the innate moral capacity, perhaps norms against\nincest or intentionally causing harm (e.g., Mikhail 2007,\n2011). Others have criticized this view (Prinz 2008; Sterelny 2012),\nbut only recently has a more detailed positive account of rule\nacquisition begun to be developed. Central to this newly emerging\nempiricist alternative is the idea that individuals are rational rule\nlearners, but they rely on domain general learning strategies to\nacquire norms from their social environment, rather than on an\ninnately specified, domain specific moral competence (Gaus &\nNichols 2017; Ayars & Nichols 2017, 2020; Nichols\nforthcoming.) \nThe sixth and final dimension concerns motivation. Especially in light\nof the roles that punishment and reward play in the stabilization of\ngroup-level patterns of behavior, an initially plausible idea is that\nnormative motivation is instrumental (for discussion see Fehr\n& Falk 2002). On such views, an individual conforms to a norm in\norder to receive some benefit, or to avoid reprimand, or because she\nwants to behave in the way she thinks others expect her to behave.\nSuch motivation would be instrumental in the sense that people obey\nnorms merely as a means to some further end that more fundamentally\ndrives them; in counterfactual terms, remove the external reward,\npunishment, or social expectation, and the individual’s norm\ncompliant behavior will disappear along with it. Those who explore\nthis kind of account have recently emphasized the role of\npsychological states like conditional preferences, together with\n2nd order social beliefs, i.e., people’s beliefs\nabout other people’s expectations, and people’s beliefs\nabout other people’s beliefs about what should be done (see\nBicchieri, Muldoon, & Sontuoso 2018 for discussion of such a\nfamily views). \nOther accounts construe normative motivation as intrinsic\n(Kelly & Davis 2018; Nichols forthcoming,\nespecially chapter 10). On such a\nview, once a norm is acquired and internalized, it typically becomes\ninfused with some kind of non-instrumental motivation. People will be\nmotivated to comply with and enforce a such rule for its own sake, and\nexperience an impetus to do so that is independent of external\ncircumstances or the perceived likelihood that they will receive\nsocial sanctions even if they flout the norm. Intrinsic motivation\ndoes not imply unconditional behavioral conformity, of course. For\nexample, a person may feel the intrinsic pull of a norm that\nprescribes leaving a 20% tip, but still choose to override it and\ninstead act out of material self-interest, stiffing the waiter. This\nsecond family of accounts raises a broader set of questions about the\npsychological nature of normative motivation, and if and how it might\nbe special. Is normative motivation best treated as a primitive, its\nown sui generis psychological category? Or is it better\nconstrued as being generated by more familiar psychological elements\nlike desires, emotions, drives, or other types of conative states,\nposited on independent grounds, that are recruited to work in\nconjunction with normative psychology? (see Kelly 2020 for\ndiscussion) \nAn early and influential account of the psychology of norms given by\nSripada and Stich (2007) illustrates how these kinds of theoretical\npieces might be put together. The preliminary model posits two innate\nmechanisms, a norm acquisition mechanism and a norm\nexecution mechanism. The functions or tasks of the norm\nacquisition mechanism are \nThe tasks of the norm execution mechanism, on the other hand, are \nSripada and Stich provide an initial pictorial representation: \nFigure: Sripada & Stich 2007: 290,\nfigure redrawn.\n [An\n extended description of the figure\n is in the supplement.] \nThe acquisition and execution mechanisms themselves are posited as\ninnate, but are highly sensitive to the local social setting in which\nan individual develops. As described above, this bifurcation into\ninnate psychological architecture, on the one hand, and socially\nlearned normative content, on the other, is taken to explain why the\npresence of norms is culturally universal, whereas the behaviors,\nroles, and social arrangements governed by those norms exhibit\nvariation. In addition, the model depicts the operation of many\ncomponents of the norm system as “automatic and\ninvoluntary” (Sripada & Stich 2007: 290), but takes no stand\non particular processes or more granular characteristics associated\nwith modularity or dual processing. Finally, the model is designed to\naccommodate evidence suggesting that when a norm is acquired and\nrepresented in the database it thereby gains a distinctive kind of\nmotivational profile. Specifically, this profile construes normative\nmotivation as \nOn this account, normative motivation has the third property in the\nsense that in some cases it is capable of overpowering even fairly\ncompelling motivations that pull in conflicting directions; extreme\nexamples include suicide bombers overriding their instincts for\nself-preservation, or other fanatics who expend significant resources\nto enforce their favored norms on others. The self- and\nother-directedness of normative motivation captures the idea that the\nnorm system produces motivation to keep one’s own behavior in\ncompliance with a norm as well as motivation to enforce it by\npunishing others who violate it. \nFinally, the model depicts normative motivation as intrinsic in the\nusual sense that people comply with norms as ultimate ends, or for\ntheir own sake. Sripada and Stich suggest that intrinsic motivation\nhelps explain a property of norms they call “independent\nnormativity”. This marks the fact that norms can exert reliable\ninfluence on people’s behavior even when those norms are not\nwritten down or formally articulated in any formal institution, and\nthus not enforced via any official mechanisms of punishment and reward\n(also see Davidson & Kelly 2020). They also discuss motivation and\nindependent normativity in terms of an “internalization\nhypothesis” drawn from sociology and anthropology, and suggest\nthat the idea of internalization can be interpreted in terms of their\nmodel. On this story, a person has internalized a norm when it has\nbeen acquired by and represented in her norm database. The\ninternalization hypothesis can then be construed as a claim that\ninternalized norms are intrinsically motivating for the simple reason\nthat it is a fundamental psychological feature of normative psychology\nthat once a norm has been acquired, delivered to, and represented in a\nperson’s norm database, the norm system automatically confers\nthis distinctive motivational profile on the norm. Being accompanied\nby self- and other-directed intrinsic motivation is part of the\nfunctional role a rule comes to occupy once it is represented in the\ndatabase of a person’s norm system—when it is\n“internalized”—in something analogous to the way\nthat being accompanied by avoidance motivation and contamination\nsensitivity is part of the functional role a cue comes to occupy once\nit is represented in a person’s disgust system (Kelly 2011; also\nsee Gavrilets & Richerson 2017 for a computational model exploring\nthe evolution of norm internalization and the kinds of selective\nforces that may have given normative psychology this intriguing\ncharacteristic). \nThe explanatory strategies and theoretical toolkit of the cognitive\nsciences have been used to guide and account for an enormous range of\nempirical work. Cognitive-evolutionary approaches to normative\npsychology are likewise interdisciplinary, and aspire to\naccommodate empirical research done on norms by anthropologists,\nsociologists, behavioral economists, and developmental, comparative,\nand other kinds of psychologists. This section provides a sampling of\nthe sorts of findings that have been marshalled to illuminate\ninteresting aspects of norm-guided behavior and support different\nclaims about normative cognition. \nAs noted above, the ethnographic record indicates that all cultures\nare structured by norms—rules that guide behavior and standards\nby which it is evaluated (Brown 1991). Evidence also suggests that\nnorms are fairly evolutionarily ancient, as there is little indication\nthat the capacity for norms spread from society to society in the\nrecent past. Anthropologists also have shown that norms governing,\ne.g., food sharing, marriage practices, kinship networks, communal\nrituals, etc., regulate the practices of extant hunter-gatherers and\nrelatively culturally isolated groups, which would be unlikely if\nnorms were a recent innovation (see J. Henrich 2015 for a review).\nMuch attention, however, has been given to the ways in which the\nprevailing sets of norms vary between cultures (House, Kanngiesser, et\nal. 2020; cf. Hofstede 1980, 2001) and the manner in which packages of\nnorms develop and change over time within particular cultures (Gaus\n2016, Schulz et al. 2019; cf. Inglehart 1997; Bednar et al. 2010). \nFor example, one line of evidence from comparative ethnography looks\nat cooperative behavior, and reveals variation between groups even in\nthe kinds of activities, relationships, and contexts that are governed\nby norms. Some groups “cooperate only in warfare and fishing,\nwhile others, just downstream, cooperate only in housebuilding and\ncommunal rituals” (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013: 426). That\nbehavioral variations like these can persist even in the face of the\nsame ecological context (i.e., “just downstream”) suggests\nthat they are due to differences in norms and other socially\ntransmitted elements of culture, rather than responses more directly\nevoked by the physical environment (also see N. Henrich & J.\nHenrich 2007). \nIt is a platitude that different individual norms, identified by the\ncontext in which they apply, their scope and content, and the specific\nbehaviors they prescribe and proscribe, are present in different\ncultures. Systematic empirical work has also recently investigated the\nprominence of different normative themes across cultures.\nFamiliar examples include the different families of norms that mark\ncultures of honor versus cultures of shame, especially those that that\ngovern violence and its aftermath (Nisbett & Cohen 1996; Uskal et\nal. 2019), or the different kinds of norms found in societies that\nprize individualistic values versus those dominated by more\ncollectivist ones, especially norms that delimit the scope of personal\nchoice (McAuliffe et al. 2003; Nisbett 2004; Ross 2012, Hagger\nRentzelas, & Chatzisarantis 2014; J. Henrich forthcoming, also see\nJ. Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan 2010 for discussion of\nmethodological issues). Other researchers have distinguished still\nother themes, for instance identifying the kinds of values and\n“purity” norms that predominate in a community governed by\nwhat they call an ethics of divinity, in comparison to those prevalent\nin communities that are governed by an ethics of autonomy or an ethics\nof community (Shweder et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 1999; this line of\nthought has been further developed in the influential Moral\nFoundations Theory, Haidt 2012; Graham et al. 2013). Theorists also\nuse these kinds of empirical findings to help assess claims about norm\npsychology, shedding light on those features of individual normative\ncognition that are more rigid and universal versus those that are more\nculturally malleable, and on how such psychological features might\nmake various patterns of group-level variation more or less likely\n(O’Neill & Machery 2018). \nA recent and intriguing contribution along these lines is Gelfand and\ncolleagues’ investigation of patterns in the tightness\nand looseness of different cultures’ norms. This work\nlooks at differences in the general overall “strength” of\nnorms within and across cultures: how many norms there are, how\ntolerant members of a culture tend to be of deviations from\nnormatively prescribed behavior, and how severely they punish\nviolations (Gelfand, Nishii, & Raver 2006; Gelfand, Raver, et al.\n2011; Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson 2017). Tighter cultures have\nmore numerous and exacting standards, with members who are less\ntolerant of slight deviancies and prone to impose more severe\nsanctions. Cultures whose members are more lenient and accepting of\nwiggle room around a norm, and who are less extreme in their\nenforcement, fall more towards the loose end of this spectrum. Gelfand\nand colleagues explore the manifestations of tightness and looseness\nnot just at the level of cultures but also across a number of other\nlevels of description, from the communal and historical down to the\nbehavioral, cognitive, and neural (Gelfand 2018). A central claim of\nthis account is that a culture’s orientation towards\nnorms—whether the norm systems of its members tend to be\ncalibrated more tightly or more loosely—reflects the severity of\nthe challenges faced in its past and present:  \n[t]he evolution of norm strength is adaptive to features of\necological environments and, in turn, is afforded by a suite of\nadaptive psychological processes. (Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson\n2017: 802, our italics)  \nA group whose ecology is characterized by things like frequent natural\ndisasters, disease, territorial invasion, or resource scarcity is\nlikely to possess a more comprehensive and exacting system of norms\nand to take a stricter stance towards its norms, in part because more\nefficiently coordinated social action is required to overcome more\nsevere threats. Groups faced with less extreme ecological stressors\nhave less dire need for tightly coordinated social action, and so can\nafford to have weaker norms and more tolerance for deviation. \nBehavioral economics began by focusing on how real people make actual\neconomic decisions, and on explaining the type of information\nprocessing that leads them to fall short of ideal economic rationality\n(Kahneman 2011). In the last few decades, many behavioral economists\nhave also begun to investigate cross cultural variation in economic\nbehavior, and to interpret findings in terms of the different norms\nof, e.g., fairness, equity, and cooperation adopted by their\nparticipants (e.g., Lesorogol 2007). Much of this evidence comes from\npatterns in how people from different cultures perform in economic\ngames (J. Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Such variation, for\nexample, has been found in ultimatum game experiments, in which two\nparticipants bargain about how to divide a non-trivial sum of\nmoney. The first participant makes a proposal for how to divide the\nsum between the two, which is offered as an ultimatum to the\nother. The second participant can either accept or reject the\noffer. If she accepts, then both participants receive the respective\namounts specified by the proposal; if she rejects it, however, neither\nparticipant receives anything. If they were ideal economic agents,\nthen the first participant, acting from self-interest, would offer the\nlowest possible non-zero amount to the second participant, who would\naccept it because something is better than nothing. This result is\nquite rare in humans, however (though it is more common, intriguingly,\nin chimpanzees; see Jensen, Call, & Tomasello 2007). Actual people\ndo not just diverge from it, but diverge from it in different\nways. Several experiments found that cultural factors affect how\npeople tend to play the game, and that variability in norms and\nconceptions of fairness can help explain different patterns in the\noffers participants make and are willing to accept (Roth et al. 1991;\nthough see Oosterbeek, Sloof & van de Kuilen 2004 for discussion\nof difficulties in interpreting such results). Other experiments use a\nwider range of games to gather evidence of similar patterns of\ncultural variation in economic behavior (see J. Henrich, Boyd, et al.\n2004 for a collection of such work). \nAnother family of findings that is puzzling from the point of view of\nclassical economic rationality shows that individuals will routinely\npunish others even at a cost to themselves (Fehr & Gachter 2002;\nJ. Henrich, McElreath, et al. 2006). Evidence suggests that this\npropensity to punish is influenced by norms and other cultural factors\nas well (Bone, McAuliffe, & Raihani 2016). For example, in public\ngoods games participants are given a non-trivial sum of money and must\ndecide if and how much to contribute to a common pool over the course of\nseveral rounds. How much each investment pays off depends on how much\neveryone collectively contributes that round, so each\nparticipant’s decisions should factor in the behavior of every\nother participant. In some versions, participants can also spend their\nmoney to punish others, based on knowledge of the contributions they\nhave made. Results indicate that some participants are willing to\nincur a cost to themselves to sanction low contributors, but also to\npunish high contributors, a surprising phenomenon called\nanti-social punishment. Participants from different cultures\nexhibit different patterns in their willingness to punish others,\nincluding in their enthusiasm for anti-social punishment (Herrman,\nThöni, and Gächter 2008). Another noteworthy aspect of\npunitive behavior revealed by behavioral economic experiments is that\nhumans are willing to punish even when they are mere bystanders to the\nincident that they are responding to. In such cases of third-party\npunishment, an individual enforces a norm despite the fact that\nshe is neither the offender who commits the violation and\nbecomes the target of the punishment, nor the offended who\nwas wronged or the victim affected by the transgression (Fehr &\nFischbacher 2004; though see Bone, Silva, & Raihani 2014). \nMore broadly, the general psychological propensity for punishment\nilluminated by this kind of empirical work has been claimed by\nresearchers to emerge early in humans (Schmidt & Tomasello 2012;\nMcAuliffe, Jordan, & Richerson 2015). Some have argued that it is\ncrucial to a host of features of human social life, including the\ngroup-level stabilization of norms (Boyd & Richerson 1992) and the\ncapacity to sustain cooperation on large scales (Price, Cosmides,\n& Tooby 2002; Mathew & Boyd 2011; Mathew, Boyd, & van\nVeelen 2013). Others have used such results to support inferences\nabout the character of normative psychology, including the nature of\nnormative motivation. For instance, Chudek and Henrich summarize\nseveral neuroeconomic studies (Fehr & Camerer 2007; Tabibnia,\nSatpute, & Lieberman 2008; and de Quervain et al. 2004) that\ninvestigate economic behavior using the methods and technology of\nneuroscience (i.e., fMRI) by pointing out that  \nboth cooperating and punishing in locally normative ways activates the\nbrain’s rewards or reward anticipation circuits in the same\nmanner as does obtaining a direct cash payment. (Chudek & Henrich\n2011: 224) \nAn impressive range of evidence suggests that humans are natural-born\nnorm learners. The developmental trajectory of norm-guided cognition\nin humans appears to exhibit robust similarities across cultures, with\nchildren beginning to participate in normative behavior around the\nsame early age (see House et al. 2013 and Tomasello 2019 for context).\nBetween three and five years of age children exhibit knowledge of\ndifferent kinds of normative rules (Turiel 1983; Smetana 1993; Nucci\n2001), and at as early as three years of age they are able to perform\ncompetently in deontic reasoning tasks (R. Cummins 1996; Beller 2010).\nThey also enforce norms, both when they believe the transgressive\nbehavior was freely chosen (Josephs et al. 2016) but also when they\nunderstand that it was unintentional (Samland et al. 2016) at least in\nsome circumstances (cf. Chernyak & Sobel 2016; also see Barrett et\nal. 2016 and Curtin et al. forthcoming for evidence and discussion of\ncross cultural variation in people’s sensitivity to the mental\nstates of norm violators). Moreover, children are alert to how other\npeople respond to transgressions, showing more positive feelings\ntowards those who enforce a norm violation than toward those who leave\nviolations uncorrected (Vaish et al. 2016). \nPerhaps most striking is the ease and rapidity with which children\nacquire norms. Preschoolers have been found to learn norms quickly\n(Rakoczy, Warneken, & Tomasello 2008), even without explicit\ninstruction (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011), although\nlearning is facilitated when norms are modeled by adults (Rakoczy,\nHaman, et al. 2010). Children’s enthusiasm for rules—their\n“promiscuous normativity” (Schmidt, Butler, et al.\n2016)—even appears to outstrip being sensitive to common\nnorm-governed behavior in their social environment. Evidence suggests\nthat sometimes a single observation of an action is sufficient for\nchildren to infer the existence of a norm, and that left to their own\ndevices they will spontaneously create their own norms and teach them\nto others (Göckeritz, Schmidt, & Tomasello 2014). \nThat said, behaviors that are perceived to be normal in a community are\nparticularly salient to individuals’ norm psychology. Children\nare also normatively promiscuous in that they appear prone to false\npositives in the course of acquisition, seeing behavior as norm-guided\neven when it is merely common, and inferring the presence of normative\nrules when there are none. One series of studies found that when\nparticipants (children and adults from both the United States and\nChina) detected or were told that a type of behavior was common among\na group of people, they came to negatively evaluate group members who\nbehaved in a non-conforming way (Roberts et al. 2018; Roberts, Ho,\n& Gelman 2019). Researchers have investigated this feature of norm\nacquisition from different angles, and have labeled it with various\nnames, including the “descriptive-to-prescriptive\ntendency” (Roberts, Gelman, & Ho 2017) the “common is\nmoral heuristic” (Lindström et al. 2017), and the\n“injunctive inference hypothesis” (Davis, Hennes, &\nRaymond 2018, discussing, e.g., Schultz et al. 2007). Since the\nevidence suggests that human normative cognition invites an easy\ninference from the “is” of a perceived pattern of common\nbehavior to the “ought” of a norm (Tworek & Cimpian\n2016), philosophers may be tempted to think of this as a\n“naturalistic fallacy bias”. \nAnother line of research suggests that key to understanding the roots\nof human normativity is the fact that human children are\noverimitators. They are not just spontaneous, intuitive, and\nexcellent imitators, but they also tend to copy all of the\nelements in the sequence of a model’s behavior, even when they\nrecognize some of those elements are superfluous to the task at hand\n(Lyons, Young, & Keil 2007; Kenward, Karlsson, & Persson 2011;\nKeupp, Behne, & Rakoczy 2013; Nielsen, Kapitány, &\nElkins 2014, cf. Heyes 2018: chapter 6). Children attend to the\nspecific manner in which an action is carried out rather than merely\nto the goal it is aimed at, and conform to the full script even if\nthey see that the goal can be achieved in some more direct way.\nMoreover, children monitor others to see if they are doing likewise,\nand enforce overimitation on their peers by criticizing those who fail\nto perform the entire sequence of steps (Kenward 2012; Rakoczy &\nSchmidt 2013). Overimitation can lead to the unnecessary expenditure\nof energy on these extraneous behaviors, but the trait may be an\nadaptation nevertheless. According to this argument, the costs of what\nlook like individual “mistakes” are ultimately outweighed\nby the communal benefits generated by a population whose individual\ncapacities for transmitting norms and other cultural variants are more\ninsistent in this way, erring on the side of too much imitation rather\nthan too little (J. Henrich 2015: chapter 7). Whatever it was\ninitially selected for, researchers have suggested that the\npsychological machinery responsible for overimitation makes important\ncontributions to normative cognition. Evidence indicates that this\nmachinery generates strong (perhaps intrinsic) social motivation aimed\nat behavioral conformity with others. When working in conjunction with\na norm system, this source of motivation may also help facilitate\nperformance of the key task of keeping an individual’s behavior\ncompliant, inducing her to conform not just to behaviors she is\nobserving but to those norms she has internalized (Hoehl et al. 2019\nfor overview). \nOverimitation is also noteworthy because it may be distinctively\nhuman. For example, although chimpanzees imitate the way conspecifics\ninstrumentally manipulate their environment to achieve a goal, they\nwill copy the behavior only selectively, skipping steps which they\nrecognize as unnecessary (Whiten et al. 2009, also see Clay &\nTennie 2018 for similar results with bonobos). Evidence suggests that\nlearning in human children is comparatively more attuned to peer\ninfluence in other ways as well. Once chimpanzees and orangutans have\nfigured out how to solve a problem, they are conservative, sticking to\nwhatever solution they learn first. Humans, in contrast, will often\nswitch to a new solution that is demonstrated by peers, sometimes even\nswitching to less effective strategies under peer influence\n(Haun, Rekers, & Tomasello 2014). \nHowever, other researchers have recently contested the claim that\noverimitation is strictly absent in non-humans (Andrews 2017). This is one front of a much\nlarger debate over which features of human psychology are unique to\nour species, and which are shared with others. Recent work relevant to\nnorms has focused on whether and to what extent species other than\nhumans have the capacities to sustain cumulative culture (Dean et al.\n2014), with plausible cases being made that the basic psychological\nwherewithal is present not just in some great apes but also in\nsongbirds (Whiten 2019) as well as whales and dolphins (Whitehead\n& Rendell 2015). Another area of focus has been on aspects of\nmoral cognition, where much illuminating work has explored the\ncontinuities between humans and other animals (de Waal 2006; Andrews\n& Monsó forthcoming). Much of this is relevant to, but does\nnot directly address, the question of whether a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms is distinctively human, or which of its\ncomponent mechanisms might be present in rudimentary form in other\nanimals. Some have suggested that the propensity to punish, and\nespecially the tendency for third party sanctioning of norm\nviolations, is not found in other species (Riedl et al. 2012; Prooijen\n2018, though see Suchak et al. 2016). Others point to humans’\nexceptional ability to cooperate and their resulting ecological\ndominance, suggesting it provides indirect evidence for the uniqueness\nof our capacities for culturally transmitted norms (J. Henrich 2015;\nBoyd 2017). Not all are convinced, arguing that animals like elephants\n(Ross 2019) and chimpanzees (von Rohr et al. 2011) exhibit socially\nsophisticated behaviors best explained by the presence of\npsychological precursors to core components of the human norm system.\nImportant preliminary progress has been made on this cluster of\nquestions concerning non-human normativity (Vincent, Ring, &\nAndrews 2018; Andrews 2020; Fitzpatrick forthcoming),\nbut much conceptual and empirical\nwork remains to be done. \nNorms are relevant to areas of research across philosophy, the\nhumanities, and the behavioral sciences, and the kinds of\ncognitive-evolutionary accounts of norm psychology described here have\nthe potential to inform and enrich many of them. The most immediate\nimplications would seem to fall within the domain of moral theory.\nHowever, the relationship of norms and norm psychology to morality and\nmoral psychology is not straightforward, and is itself a subject of\ndebate (Machery 2012). The quest to delimit the boundaries of the\nmoral domain, and to distinguish the genuinely moral from non-moral\nnorms, has a long history, but has yet to produce a view that is\nwidely accepted (Stich 2018). For example, some researchers argue that\nthere are proximate psychological differences that can be used to\ndistinguish a set of moral rules from others (conventional rules,\netiquette rules, pragmatic rules). According to one prominent account\nrooted in developmental psychology, moral rules are marked by the fact\nthat individuals judge them to hold generally rather than only\nlocally, and to apply independently of the pronouncement of any\nauthority figure, and to govern matters concerning harm, welfare,\njustice, and rights (Turiel 1983; Nucci 2001). Some have drawn\ninspiration from the sentimentalist tradition in moral theory to build\non this account, explaining the features posited as distinctive of\nmoral rules by appeal to their connection to emotions like anger or\ndisgust (Nichols 2004; cf. Haidt 2001). Others have contested the\ninitial characterization of moral norms, marshalling arguments and\nevidence that it is not psychologically universal, but is rather\nparochial to certain cultures (Kelly et al. 2007; Kelly & Stich\n2007, also see Berniūnas, Dranseika, & Sousa, 2016;\nBerniūnas, Silius, & Dranseika, 2020; cf. Kumar 2015; Heath\n2017). \nShifting focus from proximate to ultimate considerations seems to add\nlittle clarity. While some theorists hold that our species possesses\nan evolved psychological system dedicated specifically to morality\n(Joyce 2007; Mameli 2013; Stanford 2018; cf. Kitcher 2011), others\nremain skeptical. They argue instead that the evidence better supports\nthe view that humans have an evolved psychological system dedicated to\nnorms in general, but there is nothing about the mechanisms that\nunderlie it, the adaptive pressures that selected for it, or the norms\nthat it can come to contain that would support a distinction between\nmoral norms and non-moral norms (Machery & Mallon 2010; Davis\n& Kelly 2018; Stich forthcoming). On this view, rather, the human\nnorm system evolved to be able to deal with, and can still acquire and\ninternalize, a wide range of norms, including epistemic norms,\nlinguistic norms, sartorial norms, religious norms, etiquette norms,\nand norms that might be classified by a contemporary westerner as\nmoral. Indeed, the claim has been taken to support a historicist view\nof morality itself, according to which the practice of distinguishing\nsome subset of norms and normative judgments as moral, and thus as\npossessing special status or authority, is a culturally parochial and\nrelatively recent historical invention (Machery 2018). \nThat said, several debates with broadly moral subject matter have\nalready begun drawing on empirically inspired accounts of norm\npsychology. For example, philosophical discussions of the moral\nquestions raised by implicit social biases have recently assumed the\nshape of venerable and long-standing debates between individualists\nand structuralists (Beeghly & Holroyd 2020, also see Brownstein\n2015 [2019]). A central issue has been whether behaviors are best\nexplained and injustices best addressed by focusing attention on\nindividual agents and their implicit biases and other psychological\ncharacteristics, on the one hand, or on features of the institutions\nand social structures that those agents inhabit, on the other\n(Haslanger 2015). This has inspired attempts to develop an\ninteractionist account that can combine the virtues of both approaches\n(Madva 2016; Soon 2020).\nSeveral of these have put norms center stage (Ayala-López\n2018), and drawn on empirical research on norm psychology to show how\nnorms serve as a connective tissue that weaves individuals and soft\nsocial structures together (Davidson & Kelly 2020). \nCultural variation in norms and persistent disputes over right and\nwrong have been thought to have significant implications for\nmetaethics as well. The “argument from disagreement” (Loeb\n1998) holds that if dispute over the permissibility of some activity\nor practice persists even after reasoning errors and non-moral factual\ndisagreements have been resolved, such intractable disagreement would\nmilitate against moral realism (Mackie 1977). Empirically establishing\nthe existence of persistent disagreement is difficult (Doris &\nPlakias 2008), but the character of the norm system and its influence\non judgment may speak to whether or not it is likely. Consider two\nindividuals from different cultures, who have internalized divergent\nfamilies of norms (individualistic and collectivist, honor based and\nshame based, divinity and autonomy, tight and loose, etc.) Such\nindividuals are likely to disagree about the permissibility of a range\nof activities and practices, such as what counts as a fair division of\nresources, or whether people should get to choose who they marry, or\nwhat is and is not an appropriate way to respond to an insult. This\ndisagreement may very well endure even in the face of agreement about the\nnon-moral facts of the matter, and even when neither side of the\ndispute is being partial or making any reasoning errors. Such\npersistent disagreement may be explainable by appeal to differences in\nthe individual’s respective norm systems, and to the different\nnorms each has internalized from his or her culture (Machery et al.\n2005). Empirical details of the operational principles of normative\ncognition—especially knowing whether and the extent to which it\nis informationally encapsulated, cognitively impenetrable, or\notherwise recalcitrant and insensitive to other psychological\nprocesses—can help assess the plausibility of this argument. \nA final set of debates to which the details of norm psychology are\nbecoming increasingly relevant are those concerning the nature and\nexplanation of moral progress. Recent progress is understood to have\nlargely come in the form of expansions of the moral circle, the spread\nof inclusive norms, and the demoralization of invalid ones (Singer 1981; Buchanan\n& Powell 2018; cf. Sauer 2019.) Much attention has focused on\nunderstanding changes in the distribution of norms that occur as the\nresult of reasoning about norms (Campbell & Kumar 2012), but\nimportant steps towards moral progress may also occur as the result of\nmyopic, though not fully blind, processes of cultural evolution (cf.\nKling 2016; Brownstein & Kelly 2019). A more detailed empirical\nunderstanding of the relationship of internalized norms to\nrationalization, critical reasoning, and explicit argumentation\n(Summers 2017; Mercier & Sperber 2017), along with a clearer view\nof the other psychological and social factors that influence norms and the\ndynamics of their transmission, will help further illuminate these\nimportant philosophical debates.","contact.mail":"ssetman@purdue.edu","contact.domain":"purdue.edu"}]
