A notoriously scrappy\npolemicist, Hook identified with the attribution given to him as\n“Dewey’s bulldog.”\n\n\nHook worked primarily in the areas of the pragmatic theory of\nknowledge, ethical naturalism, and social and political theory. In\nregard to theory of knowledge, Hook believed that only the pragmatic\naccount of knowledge, with its instrumentalist emphasis, provided an\nadequate explanation of the value ascribed to knowledge in human\nexperience and a satisfactory answer to the question of why knowledge\nwas important for human life. In regard to ethical naturalism, Hook\nargued that a naturalistic account of the origin and justification of\nethical statements offered a critical yet justified and objective\nbasis for moral decisions. In his defense of ethical naturalism, Hook\ncarried out a sustained criticism of opposing theses. These theses\nincluded all forms of moral absolutism that were derived from\ninherited religious traditions or metaphysical systems of Idealism or\nIntuitionism. They also included the variants of what he considered to\nbe moral relativism or moral nihilism, whether these were derived from\narbitrary commitments as in Existentialist philosophy, or were\nsupported as expressions of emotive attitudes as in Logical\nPositivism.\n\n\nHook sought to apply the pragmatic interpretation of ethics to diverse\nareas of social action including issues of educational policy,\ncultural freedom and societal change. Hook’s application of\nnormative ethical judgments to contemporary social and political\nissues led to an apparent shift in his political allegiances. In his\nearliest writing through the 1930s, Hook overtly embraced Marxism\nunderstood as an application of scientific method for the resolution\nof the problematic situation of capitalist societies. Hook’s\ninterpretation Marxism, however, eventually led him to his becoming a\nleading advocate of anti-communist policy, both in foreign affairs and\ndomestic institutions. In the later phase of his career, after his\nreaction to the programs of the “New Left” in the 1960s,\nHook’s approach could be understood as a form of conservative\nliberalism. Hook’s initial stress upon freedom of inquiry in\neducation practice was augmented by his emphasis upon the continuity\nin the curriculum of Western humanistic cultural traditions.\nSimilarly, Hook’s initial support for social democracy was\naugmented by his opposition to the totalitarian potential that had\nemerged within socialist and radical movements in contemporary\nhistory. Accordingly, in Hook’s final phase as a public\nphilosopher, his writings were identified with the neoconservative\nmovement.\n\nHook studied philosophy as an undergraduate at the City College of New\nYork in the early 1920s, where he was influenced by Morris Raphael\nCohen. He then attended Columbia University, where he earned a PhD\nunder the supervision of John Dewey. As the background for the\ndevelopment of Hook’s thought, the philosophical and\nintellectual discussion of this period was dominated by the reigning\npower of Deweyan pragmatism even as it also showed the emerging signs\nof the coming influence of Marxism. One illustration of the\nsignificance of Dewey for Hook’s intellectual development can be\nfound in the fact that the completion of Dewey’s attempt to\nproduce a naturalist metaphysics, Experience and Nature, took\nplace in the mid-twenties and Sidney Hook’s doctoral\ndissertation, The Metaphysics of Pragmatism, was defended in\n1927. \nHook’s study of the metaphysics of pragmatism placed his work\nwithin a series of successive reconsiderations by pragmatic\nphilosophers of the relationship between the nature of metaphysical\ninquiry and a commitment to scientific method. The founding fathers of\npragmatism in the United States, Charles Peirce and William James, had\neach presented pragmatism as a criticism of metaphysics. \nIn his two essays that founded pragmatism as a philosophical movement,\nPeirce argued that the experimental methods of the natural sciences\nprovided the proper the model for philosophical inquiry. He understood\nthe scientific method to be opposed to the methods used in traditional\nmetaphysics which were identified by him with Cartesian rationalism\nand rationalist intuitionism. Further, Peirce’s account of the\nnature of “belief” could be interpreted as leading to a\ncomplete rejection of all metaphysical hypotheses on the ground that,\nas they are not verifiable by the methods of scientific inquiry,\nmetaphysical beliefs were properly considered “meaningless\ngibberish.” \nIn a different idiom, James had criticized both the metaphysical\nMaterialism and the metaphysical Idealism that he took to be dominant\nin the latter part of the nineteenth century. James had argued that\nboth of these seemingly contrary philosophical hypotheses shared the\nphilosophical flaw inherent in the metaphysical approach that he\nidentified as a form of “looking backward.” James\nidentified traditional metaphysics with the method of searching for\nthe necessary presuppositions of empirical phenomena. This form of\n“looking backward” from the realm of contingent experience\nto a philosophical set of entities that necessarily existed, whether\nMaterialistic or Idealistic, was contrasted by James with the\npragmatic approach which looked to future experience. Accordingly, for\nJames, metaphysical claims were to be interpreted as hypotheses whose\nadoption or acceptance by an agent was justified only if it would lead\nto verifiable or confirmable consequences in future human experience.\nThis involved James in a redefinition of the nature of metaphysics,\nsince it transformed metaphysical claims into predictions regarding\nthe consequences for the human condition of adopting them. Thus the\npragmatism of both Peirce and James could be understood as calling for\nthe elimination of traditional metaphysics and replacing it with a\n“scientific”metaphysics, metaphysics within the bounds of\nscientific methodology \nDewey had sought to build upon the insights of Peirce and James in\narguing for a naturalistic metaphysics. He stressed that scientific\ninquiry was an activity of human beings whose minds and intellectual\nhabits had emerged in natural evolutionary processes and that\nscientific inquiry was carried out in a natural environment so that\nits results were applied in the transformation of the conditions of\nnature. Along these lines, it seemed for Dewey that philosophers of\nlogic or science should be concerned not only with normative rules of\nlogical and scientific inquiry but also with the features of the\nnatural environment in which logical and scientific inquiry had taken\nplace. Accordingly, logical and epistemological inquiry involved the\nbroader investigation of the biological, psychological and\nsociological conditions of human knowledge. For pragmatism,\nnaturalistic metaphysics as an extension of such investigations\ninvolved an account and analysis of the most general and pervasive\nfeatures of human experience in its natural environment. \nIn Dewey’s naturalistic metaphysics, then, a contextual and\nempirical account of the origin and function of human knowledge is\ncombined with a recognition of man’s biological quest for\nadaptation to and control of his environment. This emphasis upon human\nadaptation and control characterized the recognition within pragmatic\nphilosophy of its debt to Darwinism in the development of its theory\nof mind’s place in nature and of the nature of human\nknowledge. \nHook followed Dewey in stressing the connection between a naturalistic\nmetaphysics and the identification of human knowledge as an instrument\nin transforming the real nature of Nature. Significantly, this feature\nof naturalistic metaphysics heightened the pragmatic emphasis upon the\ncapacity of human agency to function as an activist transformer of the\nnatural environment. To a significant degree, what was natural,\nwhether in the sphere of the universe or the sphere of human affairs,\ncould be considered in the idiom of pragmatism not so much as a\n“given,” but as a possibility for a “taken.”\nThe theme of human transformation of the natural environment carried\nHook from the initial interest in the metaphysics of pragmatism to the\npossibilities of pragmatism as a philosophy which could apply\nscientific method for social change. \nHook’s analysis of the metaphysics of pragmatism focused on the\nissue of whether the practice of scientific method presupposed a set\nof beliefs about the world or any set of ontological commitments.\nAccording to Hook, the primacy of scientific method did not require\nany prior set of foundational metaphysical beliefs but was justified\ninstead by its consequences. Decades later, after the great emphasis\nascribed to the nature of Being in existentialist metaphysics, Hook\nreturned to an analysis of this issue in his essay “The Quest\nfor ‘Being.’” He reaffirmed his earlier view that\nthe practice of scientific method did not presuppose a set of\nontological commitments or metaphysical theses about the world. Hook\nrecognized that an empirical analysis of experience and of the way\nscientific knowledge originated and functioned in the human\nenvironment could justify statements that represented the “great\ncommonplaces” of experience and of the world. These statements\ncould even be identified as “empirical metaphysics” in the\nsense that they asserted general traits about experience. From\nHook’s perspective, however, these “great\ncommonplaces” did not constitute a set of metaphysical doctrines\nabout the nature of reality which could be demonstrated\nphilosophically or verified scientifically (Hook, The Quest for\nBeing, 1961, Part 3, “The Quest for\n‘Being’”). \nHook’s account of the naturalist metaphysics of pragmatism was\ndriven by the longstanding focus among pragmatists on the interaction\nbetween human beings and their surroundings, and the potential of such\ninteractions to result in a transformation of both. Thus Hook’s\naccount did not lead him into the thicket of the debates concerning\nthe elimination of metaphysics that were raging in the late 1920s and\nthroughout 1930s. It is worth noting that many of these debates are\nimplicit in the Peircean “pragmatic maxim”, which proposes\na verificationist criterion for the meaningfulness of a statement. As\nPeirce himself saw, and as the Logical Positivists would quickly come\nto see, it is difficult to make sense of “verification”\nwithout making reference to certain metaphysical concepts, including\nthose of counterfactual circumstances and unrealizable potential. In\ndifficulties such as these would lay the collapse of many of the more\nstringent forms of anti-metaphysics. However, Hook did not pursue the\nhard line criticisms of metaphysics that were implicit in pragmatism;\nrather, his intellectual interest shifted to the significance of the\npragmatic commitment to scientific method in other areas of\nphilosophy. Hook’s subsequent philosophical activity was based\nupon his belief that the pragmatic commitment to scientific method had\ntransformative implications, primarily in three areas of philosophy:\nthe theory of knowledge, ethical theory, and social and political\nphilosophy. \nIn theory of knowledge, Hook defended the scientific method as the\nparadigmatic way in which human beings could achieve reliable\nknowledge. In ethical inquiry, Hook argued that the application of the\nscientific method was crucial for the justification of normative\nethical statements and for their confirmation as objectively true\nstatements. \nGiven his Deweyan commitment to socially-engaged philosophy, it is no\nwonder that in the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s and 1950s,\nHook’s philosophical attention began turning increasingly\ntowards social and political philosophy. Here, too, Hook sought to\napply the scientific method. Hook’s writings on educational\nreform, socialist theory, political protest, academic freedom, civil\nliberties, segregation, and ideology often engaged with social\nconcerns at a level of concreteness that had eluded Dewey. Though his\nviews on these social issues blend what appear to us today as\npolitically opposed categories, Hook claimed that his views reflected\na consistent and univocal philosophical commitment to the epistemic\nand moral experimentalism that lay at the core of pragmatism. Hook\nrecognized there was ample evidence that different political positions\nderived from divergent structures of perception which interpreted the\nempirical data in contradictory ways as well as from fixed attitudes\nwhich had been set through a person’s life experience. To a\ndegree, he appreciated the significance of the dissimilarities in the\napplication of scientific method between the confirmation of an\nexperimental hypothesis in natural science by a community of inquiry\nand the empirical grounds that could be appealed to as providing a\njustification of a particular social or political policy in the\ncontext of decision-making in historical circumstances. Hook\ncontinued, both in his explicit thought about the nature of moral or\npolitical disagreement and in his implicit practice in discussion, to\nhold the pragmatic faith that critical intelligence – a\ngeneralized form of scientific method – could rationally resolve\nany conflict of opinion. \nAt the center of Hook’s support for pragmatism was the\njustification of the pragmatic theory of knowledge. This justification\ncharacteristically took the form of setting the pragmatic theory\nagainst two opposing conceptions of truth which were identified as the\n“correspondence” theory of truth, which was advocated by\nphilosophical Realists, and the “coherence” theory of\ntruth, which was advanced by philosophical Idealists. For Hook, the\nsuperiority of pragmatism was most evident in the recognition that it\nwas the only theory of knowledge which explained why the attainment of\nknowledge was important for human activity in its interaction with the\nenvironment. In the pragmatic theory of knowledge, the discovery and\nconfirmation of true hypotheses about the nature of the world was\nunderstood as the realization of an instrument that enabled human\nbeings to predict and control aspects of their environment. \nIn contrast, whatever the merit of the correspondence theory of truth,\nit could not ground a theory of knowledge that could explain why why\nthe attainment of truth should make a difference in human affairs. In\nsuch theories, as truth is a matter of statements\n“mirroring” or “copying” reality, knowledge is\nnot connected with the human ability to experimentally alter the\nenvironment. Here Hook remained faithful to the early pragmatism of\nPeirce and James, which featured a standard criticism of the\ncorrespondence theory as presupposing human beings as “passive\nspectators” whose role in knowledge is that of mirroring the\nobjects and events of the environment in which the knower finds\nhimself. The pragmatist indictment was that the correspondence theory\nof truth relegated the knower to the role of “passive\nspectator” in a completed universe, an image that is at odds\nwith the success of experimental scientific inquiry. Picking up on\nthemes in Dewey’s work on experimental method, Hook argued that\nknowledge is best conceived as an instrument for human prediction and\ncontrol of the environment. This remained a significant pragmatist\ninsight to be recognized even in the context of later and more\nsophisticated interpretations of the correspondence theory, like\nAlfred Tarski’s “semantic theory of truth.” Despite\nthe pragmatic criticism of the correspondence theory, Dewey, Hook and\nother pragmatists like C.I. Lewis recognized the legitimacy of the\ngoal of this theory in its aspiration to realize a connection between\nhuman language about the world and the facts of the world, or between\nlinguistic assertions and what actually “is the case” in\nthe world. \nTo appreciate the full force of the pragmatist theory of knowledge, it\nmust be positioned in opposition not only to Realist views rooted in\nthe correspondence theory of truth, but also to Idealist views that\nare based in the coherence theory of truth. Idealists, from the\npre-pragmatic generation of Bradley and Royce to the later writings of\nBrand Blanshard, had identified truth with consistency or coherence.\nPragmatists could accept that the truth of logical or mathematical\nsystems could be defined in terms of their consistency since such\nsystems could be understood as abstract formal structures of language\nwithout requiring confirmation or applicability to empirical\nexperience. A coherence theory, however, could not provide a criterion\nfor truth. In a contingent universe, where empirical events were not\nderived from a set of consistent axioms but were parts of the flux of\nexperience of nature, no criterion of consistency or coherence could\nprovide the basis for an account of truth. From the pragmatic\nperspective, the coherence theory presupposed and required a\nmetaphysical conception of the world as forming parts of the absolute\nmind so that inconsistent and incoherent events were excluded. The\nrejection of an Idealist theory of absolute mind in metaphysics by\nPeirce, James and Dewey brought with it their rejection of a coherence\ntheory of truth in epistemology. Thus for pragmatism, truths about the\nworld were not arrived at by the criterion of coherence but by a\nmethod through which verifiable empirical hypotheses were confirmed in\nexperimental practice. \nAgainst both competitors, pragmatists claim the advantage of being\nable to neatly tether knowledge to successful inquiry. With successful\ninquiry understood as the controlled and deliberate transformation of\none’s surroundings, Dewey and Hook were able to draw an explicit\ntie between their pragmatist theory of knowledge and at least one\ninstance of highly impactful science, namely Darwinian biology. That\nis, they saw it as an attractive feature of their conception of\nknowledge that it was friendly to a conception of the human mind as an\nevolved instrument for improved prediction and control of the\nenvironment. \nBoth Hook and Dewey sought to place the application of the scientific\nmethod and the pragmatic theory of knowledge in the maelstrom of human\nsocial, cultural and political issues. Even in these difficult\ndomains, they believed that the Peircian model of scientific method\ncould be realized. Just as Peirce had suggested that a history of\nexperimental method would demonstrate a movement from fallible\nhypotheses to their progressive replacement by other fallible\nhypotheses with greater degrees of confirmation approaching the\nasymptotic limit ascribed to truth, Dewey and Hook argued that the\npragmatic theory of knowledge or truth should pursue this scientific\nmethod with respect to what Dewey had termed the “problems of\nmen.” \nWhile the contrast between the convergence in the natural sciences\nwithin the community of inquiry and the divergence and disagreement\nover political and social issues within a political community is\nhistorically evident, there is a theoretical basis for the pragmatic\nthesis of a unitary method. Scientific method requires that inquirers\nare committed to the rational and open-minded investigation and\nanalysis of experimental consequences. The celebrated illustration\nthat Galileo cites is that he is unable to persuade his critics of the\ntruth of scientific results if they refuse to look through the\ntelescope. Similarly, the existence of persons whose antecedent\nattitudinal framework or whose bias within their structuring of their\nperceptions limits their ability to observe the empirical evidence\nthat is relevant for resolving an issue does not negate the\nobjectivity of the factual evidence or the legitimacy of the\nacceptance of the hypotheses that represent the optimal interpretation\nof the data. Along these lines, the optimal policy option or decision\nfor resolving a problematic situation is also open, to a degree, to\nobjective confirmation or refutation. Thus Hook identified his\nfoundational belief to be a pragmatic theory of knowledge derived from\nDewey as the basis for his extended forays into public debate over a\nhost of political and social questions. \nThe broadness of this justification of pragmatic theory of knowledge\nwas one aspect of Hook’s effort, later abandoned, to ally\npragmatism with Marxism. One parallel which provided a basis for\nHook’s effort was the pragmatists’ identification of truth\nas instrumental in transforming the human condition. Thus for Hook,\nthe pragmatic theory of knowledge was paralleled by the well-known\npassage in Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach.”\nMarx’s gnomic statement that “Philosophers have hitherto\nonly interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change\nit” could be interpreted as indicating the distinction between\nan account of knowledge in which the knower or spectator sought to\nduplicate or interpret in language the phenomena of the real world, as\nopposed to the ways in which an experimentalist knower would develop\nhypotheses which would result in the transformation of the environment\naccording to predictable hypotheses. From this perspective, the\nvindication of the Marxist hypothesis by the consequences of its\ntransformational activity paralleled the general pragmatic thesis of\nthe vindication of an hypothesis by its success in modifying the\nnatural and human environment. \nThe truth of the hypothesis could not be recognized except as\nconfirmed by the changes that its application to experience generated\nfor future experience. By stressing this parallel between Marx and\nDeweyan instrumentalism, Marxism was not interpreted by Hook as a\ndogmatic thesis about historical inevitability but as an experimental\nhypothesis to be confirmed by its future consequences. In developing\nthis parallel, Hook also asserted that his interpretation of Marx\ndiffered from the materialist variant of an Hegelian dialectic of\nhistory, which he ascribed to “orthodox idolaters” of\nMarxism (Hook, The Meaning of Marx, 1934, “The Meaning\nof Marx”). The analogy to Deweyan pragmatism also enabled Hook\nto differentiate his interpretation of Marxism from what he referred\nto as the misinterpretation by Stalin and the Soviet authorities\nwhich, according to Hook, had transmuted Marxism into a species of\nsecular religion. \nFor Hook, the connection between Marxism and pragmatism ran deeper\nthan the connection between knowledge as an instrument of change in\npragmatism and knowledge as an instrument for revolutionary\ntransformation in Marxism. On Hook’s interpretation,\nMarx’s theory could be identified as an application of\nscientific method to social and economic history. The Marxist theory\nwould then be justified in the same way that any scientific hypothesis\nwould be justified, that is, through confirmation by empirical\nevidence. Thus, the Marxist interpretation of the “contradiction\nof capitalism” could be interpreted as a verifiable empirical\nhypothesis about the ways in which the class relations of production,\nthat is, the ways the manufactured and agricultural enterprises of a\ncountry were owned and managed, fettered or blocked the social forces\nof production, that is, the ability of these enterprises to produce a\nmuch greater volume of products that could more fully satisfy the\nneeds of persons in a society. The revolutionary slogan calling for\nthe liberation of the social forces of production directed against the\nclass relations of capitalist society could be interpreted as a\nverifiable empirical hypothesis that socializing the means of\nproduction would bring about a far greater volume of products and\ntheir distribution to a much greater range of persons in the society.\nAlong these lines, Marxism represented the application of scientific\nmethod to the current empirical realities of society. Hook did not\nbalk at referring to Marxism as developing a “science of\nhistory.” Similarly, he referred to the Marxist theory and\npractice of revolution as analogous to the Deweyan model of the\napplication of scientific method to the resolution of a problematic\nsituation. \nOn this interpretation of Marxism, the philosophical presupposition of\nMarx and Engels which were identified as dialectical materialism were\nincompatible with the delineation of Marxism as a scientific and\nexperimental hypothesis. Thus, while, or even because Hook asserted\nhis belief in a version of Marxism as compatible with pragmatism as an\nexperimental hypothesis, the various theses of Marxist dialectical\nmaterialism were subjected to an intensely probing and extremely\nskeptical criticism in his writings. Consequently, Hook found himself\nto be identified as a supporter of Marxism through an unorthodox\ninterpretation of that theory, while at the same time he was\ncastigated as an opponent of Marxism by the recognized authoritative\nfigures of the Marxist movement because of his severe criticism of the\nmetaphysical claims within the Marx-Engels canon regarding dialectical\nmaterialism. Hook’s interpretation of Marxism as a scientific\nhypothesis would appear to be compatible with the Marxist\nmovement’s preferred characterization of its theory as\n“scientific socialism” in opposition to “utopian\nsocialism.” Yet, scientific socialism was asserted by its\nfollowers to be a species of ultimate philosophical truth rather than,\nas Hook’s pragmatic interpretation required, a set of fallible\nand corrigible hypotheses about the historical situation, including\ncontemporaneous economic processes and their eventual outcomes. It was\nevident to believers in Marxism as a kind of secular faith or religion\nthat its interpretation as a species of experimental science left the\nway open for its refutation and revision or rejection in light of the\nanalysis of future consequences. For Marxists, and to a significant\ndegree for Hook, in the early 1930s Marxism was a commitment of faith\nand a normative guide to revolutionary action. Yet as an experimental\ntheory according to Peircian pragmatic principles, it would admit of\n“disconfirmation” or refutation in the light of future\nhistorical evidence. From this perspective, in the context of the\n1920s, the empirical nature of the institutions of the socialist\nsociety in the Soviet Union and their development in the near future\ncould be identified as representing factors that would confirm or\nrefute the Marxist hypothesis. \nHook’s philosophical position was characterized by his\naffirmation of Marxism and activist commitment to its implementation\nin the United States, even as he concluded that the evidence of the\nfailure of socialist institutions and Marxist practices in the Soviet\nUnion had increasing weight. Even as Hook became deeply involved in\nthe socialist and communist political movements during the late 1920s\nand early 1930s, the analysis of the negative evidence derivable from\ndevelopments within Soviet society was reshaping his positive attitude\ntoward Marxism. Consequently, Hook’s involvement with Marxism\noscillated between his continuous exploration of Marxist theory\nincluding its historical origins and his increasing criticism of\nSoviet institutions and Communist Party practice. The critical\napproach to Soviet society and pro-Soviet movements gradually\ndisplaced the previous vindication of Marxist theory. \nOne continuing aspect of Hook’s involvement in Marxism was the\ncompletion in 1935 of his most significant scholarly contribution to\nthe development of Marxist thought: From Hegel to Marx. This\nresearch had been undertaken during his residence in Europe, primarily\nin Germany and briefly in Moscow, after the completion of his doctoral\ndissertation at Columbia. In Moscow, Hook had carried out research at\nthe Marx-Engels Institute in 1929, which was then headed by a scholar\nof the history of Marxism, David Riazanov. A tension between two\nopposing attitudes was paradigmatic of Hook’s involvement in\nMarxism during that period. On the one hand, Hook was immersing\nhimself in what were considered canonic texts of Leninism; on the\nother hand, Hook was to discover himself reacting with abhorrence to\nthe purge of Riazanov from the Institute, in part, presumably, on\naccount of his objectivity in his approach to the sacred texts of the\nnew State. \nFrom Hegel to Marx provided an analysis of the origins of\nMarxist theory through an account of Marx’s intellectual\nconfrontation with each of the Young Hegelians who had sought to\ninterpret the relevance of Hegel for developments in European society.\nHook tried to show how Marx’s successive rethinking of the\nwritings of David Strauss, Bruno Bauer, Arnold Ruge, Max Stirner,\nMoses Hess and Ludwig Feuerbach led to the emergence of his own\n“scientific theory of history.” Hook’s study did\njustice to the subtleties of the polemics that flourished among the\nYoung Hegelians on diverse issues including the nature of emancipation\nin bourgeois society or the function of religion in relationship to\nclass consciousness in European society. Further, by selecting these\nthinkers as the originating background for Marx rather than focusing\nupon Marx’s earlier philosophical manuscripts, Hook was able to\nprovide evidence for the interpretation of Marx that indicated links\nwith a pragmatic theory of knowledge and a nascent experimental social\nscience. Accordingly, Hook could suggest that just as the pragmatists\nlike Dewey had moved beyond the Hegelian tradition toward a\nnaturalistic account of mind and of human self-consciousness, so\nMarxism had moved beyond the idealistic framework of Hegelian thought\ntoward a materialistic and potentially scientific account of\nhistorical change as the process of dialectic. \nHook’s final attempt to provide an interpretation of Marxism\nwhich was consistent with pragmatism was developed in his 1933 book\nToward the Understanding of Karl Marx. In this work, arguably\nfor the last time, Hook defended the closeness of the analogy between\nthe Marxist theory of knowledge as connected to revolutionary activism\nand the pragmatic theory of knowledge as requiring confirmation of\nhypotheses by their experimental consequences. In this work, also\narguably for the last time, Hook sustained the interpretation of Marx\nas a critical and experimental science of history which was to be\ntested by the future historical relationship between the social forces\nof production or technology and the class relations of production in a\ncapitalist society. \nSince, as previously noted, Hook’s interest in Marxism was not\nan abstract theoretical one, but involved his personal commitment and\nactivity in the arena of contemporaneous politics, it was virtually\ninevitable that the focus of his concern would shift toward the major\nevents that emerged as the dominant historical realities of the 1930s.\nHook’s political thought was pioneering in the critical\nintensity that he brought to bear upon two major movements of the\n1930s: Stalinism and Nazism. \nHook went against the grain of the growing radical movements in the\nUnited States which had become more pro-Soviet as the economic\ndepression lengthened and the New Deal was perceived on the left as\nhaving failed to solve the problems of the depression. Hook became a\nsevere critic of the movement of policy in the Soviet Union, including\nthe formulation of the charge that the Soviet rehabilitation camps\nwere actually a form of slave labor, that the purges of writers and\nartists represented brutal repression, and that the trials of leading\nmembers of the Communist Party and the Politburo were show trials\nwhich involved framing the accused in order to strengthen\nStalin’s position in his struggle for complete power.\nHook’s criticism of communism in the Soviet Union went through\nseveral phases and the earliest phase was not anti-socialist, perhaps\nnot even anti-communist, but could be identified as anti-Stalinist. It\nalso represented a degree of identification with the thought and\npolitical approach of what was termed during that time Trotskyism. \nHook was distinguished from many in the radical movement in the 1930s\nin his recognition of the novel threat of Nazism to European and\nWestern society. For most Marxist theorists, the emergence of Nazism\ncould not be considered a major historical threat since the laws of\nhistorical inevitability were believed to prove that socialism must\nfollow the capitalist crisis. The success of Nazism in Germany must\nthen be explained away as a passing phenomenon in the decadent\n“last phase of capitalism.” Even as a post-doctoral\nstudent in Germany in the late 1920s, Hook had expressed criticism of\nthe approach to the elections in Germany of the Communist Party in\ntheir confidence that any Nazi triumph would be brief and would\nnecessarily be followed by the transfer of power toward socialism and\nthe Communist Party. Hook’s opposition to Nazism included a\npartial recognition of the extreme price that even a brief\ntransitional period of Nazi rule could exact in Europe. It was this\nopposition to Nazism that led Hook to subsequently break decisively\nwith the Trotskyite position in the early 1940s. \nIt is significant that Hook’s vindication of Marxism by\nreference to its scientific character paves the way for the refutation\nof Marxism when its predicted consequences are not verified in\npractice. Hook’s practical political involvement throughout the\n1930s with the record of Soviet dictatorship as well as with the\nregressive oppression by the National Socialist regime in Germany\nprovided strong evidence that his own predictions about the future of\ncapitalism and socialism that had been derived from Marxist theory\nwere not being verified by the historical events. Even more generally,\nthe idea that there could be a “science of history” which\nwould allow human prediction and control of historical outcomes was\nrefuted for any open-minded observer of the facts whose vision was not\nblinkered or blinded by faith in a theoretical construction. \nHook’s enduring commitment to Deweyan pragmatism contributed to\nhis ultimate rejection of Marxism. The understanding of verification\nin pragmatic theory as requiring experimental confirmation of\nhypotheses by an appeal to derived, predictable consequences\nilluminated crucial dissimilarities between pragmatism and a Marxist\ntheory of verification through revolutionary activism in societal\ntransformation. Further, the interpretation of the scope and limits of\nscientific method in the attainment of knowledge led to a\nclarification of the extreme difficulties, insuperable in\nmethodological terms, between the establishment of a natural science\nand the realization of a “science of history.” Thus\nHook’s continuing commitment to the exploration of Deweyan\npragmatism led him to the abandonment of his support for Marxism. To a\ndegree, Hook’s focus on foundational moral issues shifted by the\nlate 1930s from the investigation of the compatibility of Deweyan\npragmatism with Marxism toward the defense of Deweyan ethical\nnaturalism against the tide of opposition from moral absolutism and\nfrom moral emotivism. \nBefore turning to Hook’s defense of ethical naturalism in moral\ntheory, the practical issues that dominated contemporaneous political\ndiscussion merit review. There are three elements that were connected\nto contemporaneous political controversy. \nThe first issue was the question of the nature of Stalin’s rule\nin the Soviet Union, which was highlighted by the trials of leading\nfigures of the Russian Revolution, including, most prominently, Leon\nTrotsky. A second major issue was the interpretation of the character\nof the Nazi regime which was given primary significance by the\nquestion of American support for Britain at the risk of war with Nazi\nGermany. The policy options raised by the discussion of these two\npractical issues brought to the fore, for Hook, the more general issue\nof the relative weight to be ascribed to political factors as opposed\nto economic factors, that is, the value of the existence of\ninstitutions of democracy or dictatorship compared with the value of\nthe institutions of capitalism or socialism. \nOn the first issue, Hook acted directly by requesting John Dewey to\nserve as the judge of a proposed impartial tribunal which would\nexamine the justice of the charges that had been brought by the Soviet\ngovernment under Joseph Stalin against Leon Trotsky. To a degree, such\na tribunal could be justified as an extension and application of the\npragmatic method. The tribunal would seek to resolve conflicting\nopinions by an appeal to evidence and by undertaking a form of free\ninquiry. Dewey accepted Hook’s argument that Trotsky may have\nbeen the victim of injustice by a socialist society. Presumably, such\nan injustice merited some attempt at rectification, particularly since\nthe Soviet Union had assumed a role of a morally progressive society\nin its relation to Western societies and Dewey himself had lauded\nSoviet education experiments as progressive on his visit to that\ncountry in 1928. Accordingly, Dewey agreed to become the judge of a\nquasi-formal trial of Leon Trotsky to be held in the country of\nTrotsky’s exile, Mexico, on the charges that the Soviet Union\nhad brought against him. This form of trial does not have a juridical\nfunction so that the goal of the trial may be considered as carrying\nout an educational rather than judicial function. The moral authority\nof John Dewey enhanced the credibility of the proceedings. The trial\ninvolved a rigorous examination of the evidence against Trotsky.\nTrotsky himself was cross-examined as a witness at the trial. The\nresult was a verdict rendered by Dewey which was essentially\nrecognized as a declaration that Trotsky was not guilty of the charges\nbrought against him by the Soviet authorities. \nOne byproduct of this trial was Dewey’s published analysis of\nthe set of Trotsky’s beliefs about Marxism, freedom, scientific\nmethod and democracy. Dewey had concluded that Trotsky did not\nunderstand the nature of democracy and its required toleration for the\nrights of the minority in the process of government. Dewey argued that\nTrotsky’s approach revealed a mind that was “locked in\nabsolutes” and failed to recognize the variable and contingent\nnature of historical processes. Trotsky’s belief that Marxism\nhad provided a theory of scientific socialism which was a blueprint\nfor the development of the historical future was not consistent with\nthe pragmatic understanding of the scientific method. Although Hook\nhad taken the initiative in generating Dewey’s involvement in\nthe vindication of Trotsky, he shared Dewey’s negative\nconclusions about the compatibility of Trotsky’s beliefs with\npragmatism, freedom and democracy. \nIn the debate over the second issue, that is, opposition to Nazism\nincluding the risk of American entry into the Second World War, Hook\nfurther distanced himself from the Marxist or the Trotskyist approach.\nThe leading intellectual journal of political discussion of the left\nduring this period was Partisan Review. This magazine, which\nhad been founded as a communist literary journal devoted to the\nunlikely union of Marxism with aesthetic modernism, had been taken\nover by the Trotskyist movement in the mid-1930s. Sidney Hook served\non its editorial board along with his colleague in the New York\nUniversity Philosophy Department, James Burnham, and the Columbia\nUniversity Professor of English and literary critic, Lionel Trilling.\nThe editors of Partisan Review published a controversial\neditorial against American support for Britain and the anti-Nazi cause\non the ground that such support could lead the United States into the\nwar against Nazi Germany. The Partisan Review editorial\nfollowed the Trotskyist theoretical position that had been formulated\nduring the period shortly before the Second World War. The Trotskyist\nview was that the United States was a corporate capitalist society\nwhose militarization would be facilitated by its entry into the war.\nConsequently, a war between the United States and Nazi Germany would\nrepresent a war between two forms of corporate capitalist militarism.\nThis kind of war was identified as one during which the forces of\nsocialism, which were considered as the forces of democracy, would\nprobably experience repression and from which, in any event, they\ncould expect no benefit. \nHook’s rejection of this argument indicates the distance he had\nmoved from Marxism and Trotskyism. The empirical facts regarding\nNational Socialism could not be identified as a phase within the\ndecadent death throes of international capitalism. Rather, the\nempirical facts of Nazi aggression and Nazi aims required a practical\nassessment and appropriate response freed from the blinders of Marxist\nhistorical determinism. The policy options had to be examined from the\nperspective of political and moral realism with an evaluation of their\npotential consequences. \nIn assessing his support for the capitalist democratic societies like\nthe United Kingdom and the United States against the socialist Soviet\nUnion governed by a single Communist Party or the national socialism\nof Germany governed by a single National Socialist German\nWorkers’ Party, Hook explicitly affirmed that the defense and\npreservation of the institutions of political democracy that permitted\nfreedom for individuals and groups were a much more important priority\nthan the transfer of the ownership of the means of production from\nindividuals and corporations to a socialist state. This conclusion\nwent directly counter to the Marxist view that the political\norganization of a society was secondary to the primary economic\nstructure of the society, that is, in one Marxist phrasing, that a\nstate is nothing but the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. This\nconclusion, which emerged during the debate over support for the\nUnited States against Nazi Germany, was subsequently to become a\nstrong basis for Hook’s support for American policy against the\nSoviet Union during the period that is referred to as the Cold\nWar. \nOne additional aspect of Hook’s consideration of the\nrelationship between pragmatism and Marxism was his attempt to set up\nan “experimental” test for the vindication or refutation\nof Marxism as an historical theory. Hook’s analysis of the role\nof the heroic person at different periods in history that was carried\nout in his 1943 study The Hero in History can be interpreted\nas developing such a “crucial experiment.” In the final\nchapter of this study, the role of Lenin as the hero of the Russian\nRevolution is examined. It is evident on Hook’s account that the\nRussian Revolution cannot be adequately understood as an historical\ntransformation that was carried out under inevitable dialectical laws.\nThe empirical historical narrative of the period does not cohere with\na theoretical construction according to which the social forces of\nproduction of pre-Soviet Russia were being fettered by the class\nrelations of production of a capitalist society resulting in an\ninevitable revolutionary transformation. \nFor Hook, the realization of Leninist rule in Russia required that\nLenin be interpreted as an “event-making” hero. This\nthesis is incompatible with Marxism. According to Marxism, the actions\nof those who are identified as heroes in history must be interpreted\nas “determined,” or strongly “conditioned,” by\nthe economic substructure. In The Hero in History,\nHook’s criticism of the Marxist theory of history hinges upon an\naccount of the historical achievements of the hero, Lenin, who brought\nabout a Marxist state in Russia. Thus, ironically, the work that\nmarked Hook’s final break with Marxism was an un-Marxist\ninterpretation of the achievement of Lenin in his founding of the\nMarxist socialist state. (Hook, The Hero in History, 1943,\nChapter X). \nHook’s activist involvement in many of the major moral issues\nthat emerged in the political debates of the 1930s was connected to a\nmajor theoretical issue of ethical theory: the possibility of the\ndetermination and the justification of objective, normative\nstatements. In ethical theory, Hook aimed to provide a clear and\nconsistent formulation of Deweyan ethical naturalism. In his John\nDewey: An Intellectual Portrait of 1939, Hook began his\ndiscussion by quoting in full Dewey’s view about the centrality\nof ethics for philosophy. Dewey wrote, “the central problem of\nphilosophy is the relation that exists between the beliefs about the\nnature of things due to natural science to beliefs about values\n– using that word to designate whatever is taken to have\nrightful authority in the direction of conduct.” Dewey\ncontinued: “the problem of restoring integration and\nco-operation between man’s beliefs about the world in which he\nlives and his beliefs about the values and purposes that should direct\nhis conduct is the deepest problem of modern life” (Hook,\nJohn Dewey: An Intellectual Portrait, 1939, 128). \nIn his discussion of Dewey’s ethical naturalism in the\n“portrait,” Hook proceeded to bring together different\nstrands of Dewey’s ethical theory that had been developed\nthroughout his philosophical career, from his early textbook on ethics\nin 1908 through Human Nature and Conduct to The Quest for\nCertainty and concluding with The Theory of Valuation of\n1937. Hook stresses that a common feature of Dewey’s diverse\npresentations of his ethical theory is the location and derivation of\nmorality within the scope of nature, particularly the understanding of\nhuman nature. Accordingly, for Dewey, there is an intimate connection,\nrather than a bifurcation, between value and fact, the\n“ought” and the “is,” or the prescriptive and\nthe descriptive. A major argument of Dewey’s for this\nconnection, which is the hallmark of his ethical naturalism, was\ndeveloped in the chapter on the “Construction of Good” in\nThe Quest for Certainty. Hook shares the Deweyan naturalist\nview that is developed in that chapter that the term\n“Good” can be understood by reference to the\n“desirable”. Emphasizing this naturalistic analysis, Hook,\nlike Dewey, recognized the prescriptive component in desirability.\n“The desirable” refers to what ought to be\ndesired, not only to what could be desired or what\nis desired. Hook insisted that the prescriptive component is\nnot separated from the descriptive facts of desire. The connection\nbetween the desirable and the desired was not deemed to be a fallacy\nwhich overlooked the gulf between the “ought” and the\n“is,” but a justified recognition of the way in which the\nmoral norms for human behavior were developed by recognizing the\nempirical needs, interests and desires of human beings. Dewey\nidentified phrases like “the desirable” with similar\nterms, such as “likeable” and “enjoyable.” In\neach case, the dispositional term could not be reduced to a singular\nepisodic term. To claim that an object, event or experience was\nlikeable, desirable or enjoyable was not so much to claim that it had\nbeen liked, desired or enjoyed by a subject, but involved a species of\npredictive hypothesis, namely, that it could or would be enjoyed by\nother persons who possessed the relevant potential capacities. The\ndenial that statements about “the Good” were subjective\nand the recognition that they involved a predictive hypothesis led to\nthe more general thesis that statements about the good, or normative\nstatements, were to be interpreted as statements regarding what would\nbe desired by persons who understood the nature of their desires and\nknew the consequences of their desires. Accordingly, ethical norms\nwere not subjective or relative but represented cognitive empirical\npredictions that could be verified or confirmed. They were hypotheses\nabout what would be liked or enjoyed or desired by persons who had\ninvestigated critically the nature of their desires, analyzed\nrationally the optimal means required to satisfy those desires and\nwere sensitive to the consequences of their desires. The derivation of\na fundamental moral term like “Good” from the empirical\nand experiential elements of human desires determined the naturalist\ncharacter of Deweyan ethics. While human desires could be perverse,\nsuch as malicious desires that would wreak havoc with the lives of\nother people, Hook’s belief was that such perverse desires could\nnot withstand the tests required for normative acceptance. Without\nbeing able to appeal to an absolute intuitive exclusion of such\nmalicious desires or of perverse policies that were motivated by these\ndesires, Deweyan naturalism argued that such desires would not meet\nthe criteria for acceptance as norms. Such desires could be understood\nas incoherent, self-contradictory or self-destructive, and they would\ninevitably conflict with other desires as well as lead to\ncounter-productive consequences which would mandate their\nunacceptability. Thus, ethical norms were neither subjective\nexpressions of likes, preferences or desires nor intuitive absolutes\nthat were moral imperatives without any connection to human desires or\ninterests, but were empirical hypotheses regarding optimal norms for\nrealizing desirable ends. Accordingly, empirical statements were\ncognitive and could be shown in principle to be either true or\nfalse. \nIn his chapter on Dewey’s ethical theory in Intellectual\nPortrait, Hook also stressed Dewey’s belief that since\nnormative ethical statements were cognitive empirical hypotheses,\nscientific method could be used to mediate between conflicting\nhypotheses (Hook, John Dewey: An Intellectual Portrait, 1939,\nChapter VII, “Standards, Ends, and Means”). Thus Hook\nassumed that there was a method of verification for normative\nhypotheses by an appeal to their consequences. Hook’s\nillustrations of this use of scientific method in ethics, however, are\ncharacteristically developed for cases of competing social, economic\nor educational policies. Even in these contexts, the question can be\nraised whether there is a blurring of the differences between the ways\nin which verification functions in scientific experiments and the ways\nverification can function in decisions evaluating social policy.\nFurther, even if it were conceded that it is possible to achieve a\nkind of “verification” or “disconfirmation” of\npolicy decisions on such issues as the desirability of minimum wage\nlegislation or the prohibition of narcotics in American society,\nHook’s critics were concerned about the distance between the\nnotion of “mediation of conflicting opinions by an appeal to\nconsequence” in such contexts of decision among policy options\nand the contexts of the emerging disputes over practices of racial\ngenocide or the use of concentration camps as instruments of\nideological rehabilitation. Consequently, Dewey’s ethical\nempiricism was subject to continuous challenge during the 1930s and\n40s on the charge that it presupposed an optimistic interpretation of\nhuman nature which could not be sustained in light of the new\nrealities of totalitarianism and genocide. \nThe focus of Hook’s concern in ethical theory over several\ndecades was the continuing defense of Deweyan ethical naturalism.\nDuring the decade of the 1940s, a number of ethical and political\nworks were written that represented reactions to the historical evils\nthat had emerged into public consciousness after the Second World War.\nThese works involved reconsiderations of the causes for the phenomena\nof human evil and of historical regression that were identified with\nthe institutions of “the concentration camp universe” and\nof mass murder. These works generally involved a rejection of ethical\nnaturalism and the recurrent claim that the Deweyan approach reflected\nan excessively optimistic and unrealistic interpretation of human\nnature. \nThus at one pole, anti-naturalist ethical theories were derived from\ninterpretations of current historical phenomena. Some of the\nanti-naturalist doctrines in ethics developed theses that were\nanalogous to the religious doctrine of “original sin.”\nThis tendency was evidenced by the popularity achieved by the writings\nof theological critics of Deweyan ethical naturalism such as Reinhold\nNiebuhr in the 1950s. The dual theme of these works involved both a\ndescriptive interpretation of the perversity, malice and\nimperfectability of human nature, as well as an ontological or\nmeta-ethical thesis about the need for a non-natural, that is,\nreligious or rational-intuitionist basis and source for moral\nimperatives in human society and history. \nHook’s defense of ethical naturalism against the anti-naturalist\nwritings that were related to contemporaneous historical events also\ninvolved him in the rejection of Existentialist ethical theory. The\nempiricism and objectivity that were hallmarks of Dewey’s\nethical theory were antithetical to the Heideggerian or Sartrean\ninterpretation of normative ethical assertions as arbitrary\ncommitments which represent the choices of persons who bear the burden\nof freedom and self-consciousness. Hook defended the pragmatic view\nthat normative ethical judgments are evaluated and their truth or\nadequacy can be confirmed by an appeal to their consequences against\nthe Existentialist thesis that the only criteria available for\nevaluation of a person’s moral commitments is one of their\nauthenticity to the agent’s being engagée in the\nsituation or accepting of the burden of responsibility for his\npersonal commitments. The darkened canvass of moral phenomenology that\nemerged during the decade of the 1940s, with its scenes of total war,\nseemingly absurd resistance, and irrational genocide, did not alter\nHook’s identification with the moral naturalism that had been\ndeveloped as part of the moral canon of the earlier decades of the\ntwentieth century. \nAt the opposite pole of philosophical methodology, the focus of\ninquiry was not upon contemporaneous historical phenomena but upon the\nanalysis of language, particularly the constructed languages of logic\nand mathematics and upon the paradigm of knowledge as delineated in\nempirical discourse and the languages of the empirical sciences. At\nthis pole also, ethical naturalism was rejected in favor of an account\nof ethical statements as expressions of emotive attitude. From this\nperspective, ethical theory was not to be derived from interpretations\nof history and human nature but from an analysis of logical language\nand the nature of the languages of the empirical sciences. Dewey and\nHook believed that this interpretation of ethical language as\nexpressions of emotive attitude was not justified by an analysis of\nthe ways in which ethical propositions originated in human society or\nwere supported in the context of ethical practice. The ground for the\nemotivist position, in their view, was the logical positivist thesis\nthat there could be only two kinds of cognitive statements. One kind\nof statement was cognitively analytic, that is, a class of the\nstatements that were true or false by virtue of the rules of language.\nThe second kind of statement was cognitively empirical, that is, a\nclass of statements that are asserted to be true or false by virtue of\nsense experience. Statements that were neither analytically true (or\nfalse) nor empirically verifiable were thus non-cognitive, that is,\nneither true nor false. Expressions of emotive attitude like\n“Hoorah for Stanford!” are exemplified as non-cognitive\nexpressions of emotive attitude. There may be special circumstances in\nwhich moral statements admit of analytical truth or falsity, just as\nthere are significant cases where moral statements are empirically\nverifiable and can be claimed to be probably true or probably false.\nYet, in the logical positivist account, since most moral statements do\nnot appear to be true or false by virtue of the rules of language or\nto be verifiable in the way in which statements are verifiable in the\nexperimental sciences, they must be understood as expressions of\nemotive attitude. Against emotivism, Dewey and Hook argued that the\npragmatic elucidation of moral statements considered them in the\ncontexts of their use in framing moral policy and argument, while the\nlogical positivist analysis of ethical statements did not derive from\nthe consideration of the actual contexts in which ethical statements\nas judgments of practice functioned and received their\njustification. \nWith reference to the debate in ethical theory between logical\npositivism and pragmatism, there is a relevant and seemingly\nparadoxical event that forms an interesting part of the historical\nrecord. Despite the significant differences that were evident between\nthe views of logical positivism and pragmatism in ethical theory, the\neditors of the Encyclopedia for Unified Science, a\nmultivolume work which had been projected to represent the\nauthoritative formulation of the position of logical positivism in\nseveral fields of philosophy, had decided to ask John Dewey to author\nthe essay on ethical theory. The invitation for Dewey to contribute to\nthe Encyclopedia was given by Otto Neurath in a meeting at\nDewey’s home in New York City in 1937. Along with Neurath and\nDewey, Sidney Hook, who had emerged as previously noted as a major\nexpositor of Dewey’s ethical theory and Ernest Nagel, who had\nplayed a major role in advancing the dialogue between American\npragmatism and European analytical philosophy, were present at the\ndiscussion. After Dewey had expressed an initial reluctance which\nstemmed from his perception of the distance between his own views and\nthose of Neurath in epistemology, Dewey consented to write the volume\nwhich was published in the Encyclopedia as Theory of\nValuation. \nIn that work, Dewey reiterated his strong disagreement with the view\nthat ethical statements could be relegated to a class of non-cognitive\nexpressions of emotive attitude. Dewey developed a distinction between\nmoral statements in their function as “prizings” in\ncontrast with their function as “appraisals.” Without\nmaking explicit reference to A.J. Ayer or any other logical\npositivist, Dewey suggested that the logical positivist doctrine that\nhad categorized ethical statements as expressions of emotive attitude\ncould be understood as an identification of the “prizing”\nfunction of moral statements. For Dewey, normative moral statements\ncould be interpreted more adequately as “appraisals,” that\nis, as statements which went beyond the expression of personal\nattitudes of prizing in order to assert cognitive claims about the\nvalues of entities or experiences that could be tested by other\npersons. Although “prizings” could be analogized to\nemotive attitudes, appraisals were understood as empirical statements\nwhose claims about the value of an object could be confirmed as true\nor false based upon intersubjective experience and upon their future\nempirical consequences. \nThe continuing debate on the issue of the linguistic status of\nnormative statements generated an effort to clarify the nature of\nethical disagreement as a means for the resolution of that debate. In\nC.L. Stevenson’s Ethics in Language, the analysis of\nthe nature of ethical disagreement was considered as providing a\nmethod of mediation between pragmatist and logical positivist views in\nethical theory. In his graduate seminars on ethical theory, Hook made\nuse of Stevenson’s Ethics in Language as the point of\ndeparture for his defense of pragmatic ethics against the criticisms\nthat derived from the analysis of moral language. Stevenson had\nlocated Dewey’s interpretation of ethical norms within the broad\nframework of patterns of moral discourse. For Stevenson, dispute over\nDeweyan norms or appraisals would represent a pattern that he\nidentified as “disagreement-in-belief.” For this kind of\ndisagreement Stevenson shared Dewey’s view that scientific\nmethod provided a competent mode of adjudication. Normative\ndisagreement of this kind could be considered as a parallel to\nempirical disagreement on experimental scientific questions where true\ndecisions between conflicting hypotheses could be arrived at by an\nappeal to the evidence of their future consequences. \nStevenson sought to demonstrate, however, that moral disagreement was\nmore adequately represented by the linguistic pattern which he\nidentified as disagreement in attitude. For this kind of disagreement,\nStevenson shared the non-cognitivist conclusion of the logical\npositivists, according to which there would be no rational or\nscientific method for mediating among conflicting opinions by an\nappeal to their future consequences. Ethical disagreement of this type\ncould be brought to an end only by a change in attitude. Along the\nlines of Stevenson’s approach, philosophers who rejected the\nethical naturalism of Dewey and Hook have examined the ways in which\ndisagreement in attitude can be related to different structures of\nperception, plural or diverse interpretive discourses, and conversion\nto alternative paradigms. \nIn examining the anti-naturalism in ethical theory that was derived\nfrom the analysis of language, Hook followed Dewey in stressing the\ndistinction between prizings and appraisals. Thus, in Hook’s\nview, moral statements, like empirical scientific statements, were to\nbe considered as hypotheses whose truth or falsity would depend upon\ntheir confirmation by future experience. Consequently, this\nnaturalistic and empirical interpretation of ethical statements\ninvolved Hook in continuing debates with the proponents of competing\ninterpretations of ethical statements, such as C.L. Stevenson.\nStevenson had proposed two reasons in justification of his view that\nmoral disagreement was most fundamentally disagreement in attitude\nand, therefore, differentiated from scientific or empirical\ndisagreement. One reason, according to Stevenson, was that persons\ncould agree about all the facts that were relevant to a moral dispute\nand yet hold different attitudes on the issue so that they supported\ndifferent policies. The second reason cited by Stevenson was that a\ndisagreement was considered to be resolved when the persons involved\nin the dispute converged on an agreement in attitude even if they\nmaintained differing views about the facts. On the other hand, the\nmoral dispute was not resolved if persons who had agreed on the facts\ncontinued to disagree in their attitudes about the question at\nissue. \nHook provided naturalistic rebuttals to these two arguments advanced\nby Stevenson on the attitudinal interpretation of ethical statements.\nHook argued that in the case in which seeming agreement on all the\nfacts was conjoined with a continuing disagreement in attitude, it was\nnot legitimate to exclude the possibility of an undisclosed factual\ndisagreement. Future investigation might uncover disagreement about\nrelevant facts that could have an impact in changing attitudes.\nHook’s claim is that the premise of Stevenson’s argument,\nnamely, that all the facts relevant to attitudes in a moral\ndispute have been discovered, is not demonstrable. That is, there is\nno form of completeness theorem which would explicate the notion of\nall the facts. Thus, the pragmatic thesis that normative\nstatements are empirical appraisals that are open to confirmation by\nfuture consequences is not refuted by Stevenson’s identification\nof disagreement in attitude, since the discovery of future facts may\nbring about a change in attitude. \nFurther, agreement in attitude by parties to a dispute does not\nnecessarily imply, as Stevenson suggests, that the moral dispute has\nbeen resolved. It is notorious that a resort to force by one\nprotagonist in a moral dispute can change the balance of power so that\nthe other party to the dispute must adopt a different attitude toward\nthe issue for prudential reasons. Yet the conclusion of such an\nepisode would be that the use of force had brought about a settlement\nof the dispute but not necessarily that it had resolved the ethical\ndisagreement. A change in attitude by a person who has been a party to\na dispute which results in the resolution of the conflict does not\nnecessarily mean that the moral issue which precipitated that conflict\nhas been satisfactorily resolved. The end of a dispute through the\nconvergence of attitudes differs in those cases where the change of\nattitude reflects the acceptance of the realities of power or is the\nproduct of conditioning, as in hypnotic submission, from those cases\nwhere the change of attitude has derived from convergence on the facts\nat issue in the dispute. \nIn this connection, it could be argued, apparently contra Stevenson,\nthat attitudes of extreme prejudice are virtually always defended by\nan appeal to reasons or facts as supporting the prejudicial attitude.\nA person who has an ethnic or racial prejudice does not simply express\nhis prejudicial attitude but tends to rationalize it by asserting\njustifying reasons in support of the attitude. It may be true that the\ndemonstration that these reasons are in point of fact false does not\ncustomarily lead to the abandonment or withdrawal of the prejudicial\nattitude. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of rationalization suggests that\nover the long run, the sustaining of even prejudicial attitudes\nrequires support by reasons. The demonstration that the supporting\nreasons are factually false tends to bring with it some degree of\nrevision in attitude. \nThe issues in the debate between the Stevenson variant of\nnon-naturalist emotivism and pragmatic naturalism were not resolved,\nbut the locus of the debate over ethical naturalism shifted. This\nshift occurred because of a new turn in the reigning methodology of\nphilosophy. The logical positivist focus on the language of science,\nlike the more generalized Deweyan focus on scientific method, was\nreplaced by the focus on understanding the rules governing the use of\nconceptual terms in ordinary language. In the context of ethical\nnaturalism, the analysis of the moral vocabulary involved the\nexplication or definition of “Good” as a term of\ncommendation for reasons. Thus the emotive aspects of the moral\nvocabulary could be interpreted by identifying the commendatory\ngoading or prescriptive functions of moral terms. At the same time,\nthe empirical or pragmatic aspects of the moral vocabulary could be\ninterpreted by identifying the way in which reasons were advanced in\nsupport of commendations or prescriptions. On the whole, Hook did not\nseek to develop a bridge between Deweyan naturalism and the works of\nordinary language philosophy. He recognized that the works of Austin\nand Ryle involved theses about the nature of mind and the nature of\nexperience which were compatible with and supportive of Dewey’s\nnaturalism. Hook did not pursue, however, the defense of ethical\nnaturalism in the vocabulary and methodology that had been advanced by\nphilosophers of ethics like Stuart Hampshire and Philippa Foot.\nRather, Hook’s pragmatism led him away from the ongoing debate\nin ethical theory toward the application of Deweyan naturalism and\nempiricism on contemporary issues in education, politics and\nsociety. \nSidney Hook’s emergence as a major American philosopher and his\naccompanying prominence as an influential intellectual in the American\ncultural and political scene took place during the decades of the\n1930s and 40s. During that period he was recognized as a forceful\ndefender of pragmatic theses in theory of knowledge and ethical\ntheory. Yet the greatest part of Hook’s oeuvre is\ncomprised of writings on the issues that were brought into focus\nwithin American social and political thought in the post-War period.\nAs a political philosopher, Hook had been involved from the outset of\nhis career in the fundamental issues of democracy, liberty and\nequality. In the post-War period, however, Hook was embroiled in\npolitical controversy over the balance between individual liberty and\nnational security occasioned by the exigencies of the Cold War.\nHook’s support for a balance which recognized the need for\nlimitations of liberty for the sake of national security led him to a\ncritique of the dominant liberal position which argued against new\nexecutive or legislative efforts to enhance national security that\ncould requires any limitation of individual liberty. On Hook’s\nview, the traditional liberal position of the Millian variety\nrepresented a form of what he termed “ritualistic\nliberalism.” \nHook’s belief in democracy involved a commitment to civil\nliberties and racial desegregation. Again, after the 1960s, he was\ninvolved in political controversy over the legitimacy of\ndiscrimination on grounds of race as an instrument for educational\ndesegregation and racial integration. \nThe range of issues on which Hook wrote included the redirection and\nreshaping of his perennial interest in philosophy of education and in\nthe relationship between the economic structure of a society and its\npolitical institutions. In the post-War period, Hook revisited his\nearlier position in philosophy of education as well as his support for\nsocialism. His later work in philosophy of education involved him in a\nresponse to the emergence in the 1960s of an educational approach that\nadvocated relevance as the most important criterion for the\neducational curriculum, as well as a response to the debate between an\nemphasis on the Western tradition and the thesis of multiculturalism\nin education. Along similar lines, his reexamination of the issues\nraised by socialist theory was engendered by the need to respond to\nthe evidence that had emerged, particularly by the 1980s, regarding\nthe failure of socialist economics in diverse countries where it had\nbeen practiced. The positions that Hook advanced in these areas were\ngenerally perceived as representing a shift from his\nself-identification as an anti-communist democratic socialist to his\narrival at a prominent place in the diverse ranks of supporters of\nAmerican conservative thought. Yet Hook had remained constant to his\npragmatism which sought to resolve ideological issues on the basis of\na continuing and ongoing inquiry, evaluation of evidence, and\nappraisal of values. \nHook followed Dewey in considering the philosophy of education to be a\ncentral focus of concern for any social and political philosophy. Hook\nargued that American educational institutions, in their bureaucratic\nstructure and organization, were too authoritarian and were not\nsufficiently responsive to the needs of the individual student. As for\nthe content of the curriculum and the methods of teaching, Hook argued\nthat they were too rigidly bound by the traditional disciplines and\nwas insufficiently concerned with the classroom as a community of\ninquiry or a forum for the development of critical and independent\nthinking. Under Dewey’s banner, a legion of advocates and\nsupporters of progressive education had carried out a thoroughgoing\nreform of American educational institutions. These reforms included\nthe development of alternative schools that defined themselves as\n“child-centered” and the development of curricula that\nabolished traditional requirements in favor of the rights of students\nto have a greater role in the determination of the course of their own\nof studies. Like Dewey, Hook came to the conclusion that the\ndevelopments within progressive education that had been fostered in\nDewey’s name had gone too far in their rejection of the need for\nauthority and the importance of liberal education as an education in\nfundamental knowledge, including the knowledge of traditional subject\nmatter. As a result, Hook tried to formulate a measured criticism that\nwould balance the strengths of the American educational system and\ntradition while at the same time seeking to reform aspects of that\nsystem and that tradition. In his Education for Modern Man of\n1946, Hook sought to develop a direction for American education that\nwould conform to the ideals of pragmatic liberalism. For Hook, this\nrequired that the classroom should become a community of inquiry in\nwhich students would develop their potentiality for critical inquiry\nas a method which is analogous to scientific method. One of the\nstrongest claims in Education for Modern Man was the primacy\nof method for education. To a degree, Hook’s belief in the\nprimacy of scientific method presupposed the pragmatist account of a\ngeneralized methodology for all the sciences. Criticism of the\npragmatic thesis of a single generalized scientific method as opposed\nto the recognition of the difference in the methods used in the\nwriting of history, the study of literature and research on social\nproblems as distinct from the methods of the natural sciences had an\nimpact on Hook’s philosophy of education. Hook’s\nsubsequent recognition of the ways in which the teaching of science\ninvolved the learning of substantive subject matter and experimental\ntechniques rather than a generalized method for the criticism and\ntesting of hypotheses marked a nuanced shift in his educational\nphilosophy. \nAlthough Education for Modern Man recognized the place of the\nmajor intellectual disciplines in the sciences and the humanities in\nthe curriculum of the public school and the college, the stress was\nnot laid upon the learning of the substantive subject matter as much\nas upon the development of the student’s ability for independent\nthinking and the fostering of his capacity for exercising critical\nintelligence. Similarly, although the authority of the teacher and\nadministrator was recognized, the stress was placed upon the\ndemocratic character of the classroom as a community of free inquiry.\nIn Hook’s interpretation of education, a condition for the\nidentification of an educational institution as a democratic\ninstitution was the requirement that it sustain freedom of\ninquiry. \nIn Hook’s general theory of democracy, the idea of freedom of\ninquiry also retained pride of place. Thus constraint on freedom of\ninquiry by a democratic majority in an electoral democracy would\nrepresent not only a violation of freedom but a violation of the\ndemocratic process. Continuous with the value of freedom of inquiry,\nthe idea of cultural freedom was identified as a condition for\ndemocratic society. Accordingly, Hook was to formulate his criticism\nof Soviet society during the period of the cold war by reference to\nthe violations of cultural freedom within the Soviet Empire. \nAt the same time, Hook’s interpretation of a free and democratic\nsociety was consistent with the recognition that such a society could\nset limits to freedom of expression. Conceptually, this recognition of\nthe limits of freedom related to pragmatic pluralism. Its\nphilosophical justification rested on the belief that no single value\nwas absolute and that every value was justified only as a result of a\nprocess of mediation, compromise, or balance with other values. Hook\nappreciated the pluralistic character of liberty as recognized in the\nlater terminology of John Austin, according to which the\n“correlative opposites” of the term “liberty”\nare not only such terms as “slavery,”\n“repression” and “coercion,” but also such\nterms as “security,” “order,”\n“self-restraint” and “law.” The significance\nof this recognition of the duality of opposites of the concept of\nliberty is that it points to different contexts in the application of\nliberty. When “liberty” is opposed to\n“slavery” or “tyranny,” the realization of\nliberty involves the abolition of slavery or tyranny. When\n“liberty” is opposed to “security” or\n“order,” the realization of liberty involves a balance of\nvalues between liberty and security or order. \nHook’s formulation of the issue of the limits of freedom in a\ndemocracy could be traced back to his sensitivity to his observation\nof the rise of Nazism in Germany during his residency in that country\nin the late 1920s. The anti-Nazi neo-Kantian philosopher, Leonard\nNelson, had pointed out at that time that totalitarian movements,\nparticularly the National Workers Socialist movement, confronted\ndemocracy with a potentially fatal dilemma: if the democratic system\nwere to outlaw or prohibit the National Workers Socialist Party from\nparticipation in political elections, it would be taking a significant\nstep toward the destruction of democracy by excluding a party which\nhad a mass following. If the democratic system were to fail to outlaw\nor prohibit the National Workers Socialist Party from participation in\nnational electoral politics, however, it would be taking a potentially\neven more significant step toward the destruction of democracy. A\nsingle electoral victory of the National Workers Socialist Party, no\nmatter by how small a margin, would result in the abolition of other\npolitical freedoms or in the termination of subsequent elections, as\nin the standard refrain of democracies that have committed suicide:\n“one person, one vote – one election.” Thus,\nNelson’s dilemma recognized a possibly fatal flaw in democracy\nonce a significant pro-totalitarian or anti-democratic party had\nachieved a degree of popular support. \nHook’s understanding of the dilemma led him to the belief that\nit was legitimate for a democratic system to take steps to constrain\nthe influence of anti-democratic or totalitarian groups or parties\nwithin a democratic society. In the United States, the question of the\nright of the American Fascist Party or the American Communist Party to\nparticipate in electoral politics did not rise to the level of\npolitical controversy, probably because of the lack of popular support\nfor these parties. The issue was drawn, however, over the legitimacy\nof excluding members or advocates of such parties from positions which\ninvolved access to national security decisions as well as their\nexclusion from positions of major influence in the cultural sphere.\nHook sought to resolve this dilemma in a controversial book titled\nHeresy, Yes – Conspiracy, No. The line that Hook sought\nto draw was the granting of full cultural and political freedom to any\nheretical anti-democratic views. At the same time, if holders of such\nviews were organized as a disciplined cadre which could represent a\nthreat to national security or as a doctrinally controlled movement\nwhich could exercise coercive influence in a free marketplace of\nideas, then the activities of such groups could be limited. Critics\ncharged that in developing the thesis of Heresy, Yes –\nConspiracy, No, Hook was in effect permitting the exclusion of\nCommunist Party members or “fellow travelers” from holding\njobs in universities or from holding positions of power or influence\nin cultural activities like films and theater. In Hook’s\ndefense, the record would show that Hook was involved in the\nformulation of a thesis within the theory of democracy about the\nlegitimacy of the line to be drawn in defense of democracy, rather\nthan the application of this thesis to individual cases. Thus, Hook\ndid not seek to resolve the question of what kind of evidence would\nconstitute participation in a conspiracy as between such diverse\nconsiderations as the fact of membership in a political party, the\ncriterion of “advocacy” for policies that were considered\nas “subversive,” indoctrination along lines laid down and\nenforced by a leadership cadre, or participation in an espionage\nring. \nHeresy, Yes – Conspiracy, No represented, from\nHook’s perspective, a contribution to the defense of democracy\nand cultural freedom in an environment in which both democracy and\ncultural freedom were under attack from the Soviet Union. As\npreviously mentioned, Hook was a leading member of the editorial board\nof Partisan Review. During the 1950s, this journal was the\npremier anti-communist publication in the United States. The leading\nintellectual figures who represented opposition to the policies of\nJoseph Stalin and the leaders of the Soviet Union in their internal\npolicies and to the international policies of the Soviet Union wrote\non the nature of Soviet society and policy for this journal. These\nfigures included such leading writers from Western Europe as George\nOrwell, André Malreaux, and Ignazio Silone as well as the\nAmerican black novelist Richard Wright and such intellectual\nluminaries from Eastern Europe as Czeslaw Milosz, Arthur Koestler and\nManes Sperber. As the leading journal within the anti-communist\nspectrum, Partisan Review was confronted by the moral issue\nof McCarthyism. The activities of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the late\n1940s and early 1950s represented a problem for anti-communism in two\ndimensions. On the one hand, from the public relations perspective,\nMcCarthy’s inaccuracies and exaggerations provided a sword to\nthe critics of anti-communism. One quip of the period that represented\nthis aspect was the thesis of liberal opponents of McCarthy that they\nwere “anti-anti-communists.” More significantly, on\nsubstantive moral grounds, as Hook recognized, it was not tenable for\nan intellectual movement that charged Stalinism with framing its\nenemies in purges, trials and rehabilitation camps to be complicit\nwith a movement which would falsely accuse persons of being communist\nagents or members of the Communist Party. The result was the decision\nby a majority of the editorial board of Partisan Review,\nincluding Sidney Hook, to condemn McCarthyism and to lend its support\nto the opponents of Senator McCarthy. In terms of the contemporaneous\nmoral context, it is relevant to note that Professor James Burnham,\nwho was a colleague of Sidney Hook at the Department of Philosophy at\nNew York University, disagreed with this position and resigned from\nthe editorial board of Partisan Review. Burnham’s\nargument was that it was a fallacy of moral equivalence to compare the\nenormity of immoral evil carried out by communism in its attack on\ndemocratic institutions with the moral flaws that had taken place\nduring Senator McCarthy’s strategy and tactics of seeking to\nuncover Soviet agents who were guilty of espionage in the U.S. State\nDepartment or Government. \nThe theoretical background of Heresy, Yes – Conspiracy,\nNo was not limited to the analysis of the specific means that a\ndemocratic society could use to protect itself from internal\ntotalitarian movements without impinging upon legitimate civil\nliberties, but involved the general conception of the absolute status\nof the right of liberty and the legitimacy of constraints upon\nfreedom. In a subsequent work titled The Paradoxes of\nFreedom, Hook confronted the Jeffersonian theme of a right to\nliberty as an absolute and inalienable right. As a pragmatist, Hook\nargued that moral rights, like legal rights, could not be absolute,\nwhether grounded in God or Nature. Rather, Hook sought to show how the\nlanguage of rights presupposed obligations of other persons to protect\na right and that these obligations to protect the rights of the\nindividual person were derived from shared human interests in social\nlife. It followed that although rights for Hook could not be reduced\nto utilities, preferences or expressions of emotive attitude, all\nrights, including the right to liberty, were defeasible by other\nvalues or interests. Thus, a right to liberty could be overridden by\nthe need for a society to protect itself. This is evident when a\nperson’s right to liberty is denied and he is imprisoned after\ncommitting a crime. The logic of the defeasibility of absolute rights,\nhowever, would also imply that the right of a citizen to hold a\nnational security clearance or a job with a nation’s\nintelligence agency could be limited by reference to the value of\nnational security. Hook’s practical position was buttressed by\nhis theoretical account of the pragmatic nature of the concept of\nliberty. The pragmatic account of liberty, however, was not a\nrationalization for Hook’s political advocacy. The\ninterpretation of natural rights as admitting of limitations upon\nrights by reference to other values is a constant aspect of the\napproach that pragmatism offered to the traditions of absolutism and\nimprescriptability on natural or human rights. \nHook’s theoretical interest in the issue of cultural freedom was\novershadowed by his involvement in the forum of public policy.\nHook’s rejection of Marxism led him to support the value of\npolitical freedom as an essential condition for a democratic society,\nwhether in capitalist or socialist economic frameworks. The\nimplication of this theoretical analysis, for Hook, was his support of\nthe American commitment to political and cultural freedom as opposed\nto what he saw as a Soviet or communist commitment against political\nfreedom in furthering the growth of a totalitarian state. For that\nreason, therefore, Hook could be counted as a “Cold\nWarrior” in support of the West during the Cold War. It should\nbe noted that in the political terminology of the period, the\nidentification of Hook as a Cold Warrior by persons who favored the\nuse of that term did not mean a supporter of the Western democratic\nalliance or what was termed “the free world” against\ntotalitarianism. Rather, “Cold Warrior” was used\npejoratively to indicate a person who sought to influence American\npolicy so that it would pursue a containment or adversarial strategy\ntoward the Soviet Union as a corollary to an ideological and paranoiac\ninterpretation of the Soviet Union as an aggressive and expansionist\nempire. Thus, critics of Cold Warriors and the Cold War saw the Soviet\nUnion as an alternative, socialist system with which a realistic,\nmoderate and non-ideological Western policy should pursue\n“constructive engagements” toward compromise, cooperation\nand mutual respect. \nIn his support for the idea of cultural freedom, Hook was a founder of\nthe American Committee for Cultural Freedom. This Committee organized\na number of symposia on issues related to cultural freedom among a\nwide intellectual community, including such figures as W.H. Auden and\nArthur Schlesinger, Jr. Much more significant in political terms was\nthe extension of this kind of activity to international forums,\nparticularly in Western Europe. Among Western European intellectuals\nin the early 1950s, the issue of their choice among the options of\nEuropean neutralism, ideological support for the Soviet Union or\nsupport for the United States was at the center of political debate.\nThe Congress of Cultural Freedom conference that Hook helped organize\nin Paris at that time represented a rallying base for criticism of the\nSoviet Union and for support of a philosophy of liberal democracy that\nwas compatible with the American foreign policy interest. One of the\nmore remarkable results of the activities of the Congress of Cultural\nFreedom was the founding of a number of cultural journals modeled on\nPartisan Review. These journals included Encounter\nin England, Les Preuves in France and Der Monat in\nGermany, as well as similar periodicals in India and Australia. The\nhigh cultural standards adopted by these journals led to their\nbecoming vanguard publications in their own national cultures, so that\ntheir advocacy of the anti-communist message was transcended by their\nliterary achievement. The continued exposure of the abuses of human\nrights and democratic values in the Soviet Union and its satellites\nremained a constant theme even as they were in the forefront of\nliterary and artistic culture and provided independent and open forums\nfor the discussion of major questions of economic development and\nsocial policy. \nConsequently, it was a source of embarrassment when the revelation\nbroke that the CIA had helped finance the activities of the Congress\nof Cultural Freedom and of these publications. Inferentially, Hook\nbelieved that the funding source did not corrupt the integrity of\nthese publications or taint their legitimacy as forums of critical\ninquiry. From the other direction, there was surprise that the CIA was\nprepared to fund publications that had been openly critical of many\naspects of American foreign policy and domestic affairs.\nInterestingly, the acronym in the bureaucratic files of the CIA that\nreferred to the funding of this project was “NCL,” that\nis, the non-communist left. Hook believed that it represented a degree\nof prudential wisdom by the United States government to be willing to\nsupport a non-capitalist, anti-communist cultural enterprise that was\nnot necessarily faithful to the line projected in American foreign\npolicy, since it had developed a significant body of criticism against\nboth the theory and the practice of totalitarian communism. \nThroughout this period, Hook’s political views could be\nidentified as “democratic socialist.” \nOne significant evidence of the transition of Hook’s thought on\neconomic issues is available in his early encounter with the writings\nof Friedrich von Hayek, the economist of the Austrian school which had\ndeveloped the thesis that democratic socialism was incoherent from\nboth economic and political perspectives. Hook wrote a review of\nHayek’s Road to Serfdom which confirms the shift from\nhis earlier view on Marxism and socialism. Far from asserting his\nearlier thesis that the achievement of political democracy require\nsocialism or, at any rate, a greater degree of economic democracy in\nthe form of lessened concentration of economic power in the capitalist\nclass, Hook advanced the criticism that Hayek’s thesis\nparalleled in a significant sense the fallacious Marxist thesis of\neconomic determinism. \nHayek had argued, according to Hook, that socialist societies\nrepresented a state concentration of economic power which had a\npotential for totalitarianism that would be actualized over the\nlong-run. For Hayek, the reverse also held, namely that free-market\nsocieties required the rule of law and constraints upon the exercise\nof monopolistic or arbitrary power so that free market economies would\nlead to the establishment of democratic institutions, again, over the\nlong-run. \nHook’s counter-thesis was the independence of political\nstructures and economic systems. According to Hook, authoritarian or\ntyrannical regimes have been established in countries in which both\ncapitalist as well as socialist economic institutions have prevailed.\nSimilarly, for Hook, there would be no bar to the realization of\ndemocracy in either a society that had free markets or in a society in\nwhich government owned or controlled the economic means of\nproduction. \nIn the decades since The Road to Serfdom was published, there\nhas been significant evidence regarding the close relationship between\nthe concentration of economic power and political power, particularly\nin many of the developing countries. At the same time, it could be\nargued that neither Hayek’s thesis nor Hook’s\ncounter-thesis has been definitively proven. The democratic and\nsocialist states of Western Europe could represent a refutation of\nHayek’s thesis. The Hayek rebuttal, however, could point to the\ndegree in which free markets operate in European societies alongside\nthe governmental sector. The new phenomenon of one-party political\ndictatorships that embrace and encourage free-market economics in the\nPeople’s Republic of China or Vietnam would also suggest a\nrefutation of Hayek’s close connection between free societies\nand free market economics. The Hayek rebuttal would be that the\nnecessity for the rule of law as well as for greater freedom of\nmovement of persons and goods in these developing economies have\nalready limited to a degree the exercise of totalitarian power and\narbitrary rule. Consequently, the thesis remains that the potential\nfor change in the direction of liberal and democratic society is built\ninto the continuing function of free markets even in these\nlong-standing one-party dictatorial states. \nSubsequently, Hook’s own views on economics underwent\nsignificant change. To a degree, this reflected his move from New York\nUniversity, where he had been a professor of philosophy for four\ndecades, to the Hoover Institution in California. At the Hoover\nInstitution, Hook was closely involved with a number of the leading\ntheoreticians of the economics of free-market societies. Although\nthere was a shift in Hook’s approach to economic theory, the\ngeneral change in his views on issues of political philosophy are not\nattributable to theoretical economics but to other social, political\nand cultural factors in the United States. \nThe legitimacy of the attribution of Hook as a conservative in his\nlater views in political philosophy derives from his writings and\nactivities across the entire gamut of social policy questions. To\nHook’s long-standing opposition to the Left on foreign policy\nissues that had stemmed from his major commitment to anti-communism,\nthere was added his stance against major positions of the left wing of\nthe American political spectrum on domestic issues, particularly after\nthe self-identified revolutionary activities of the New Left in the\nlate 1960s. \nAs a response to campus turmoil of the late 1960s, Hook founded an\norganization called University Centers for Rational Alternatives.\nThrough this organization, Hook aimed to advance his critical\nrejection of radical efforts to transform the American university and\neducational system. The newsletter of that organization, titled\nMeasure, represented Hook’s belief in a balance between\nthe traditional practices of the American university and the need for\nreform based on critical method and rational criticism. \nThe range of Hook’s political writings was extended broadly in\nhis contributions to Measure. The issues that had dominated\nHook’s criticism of totalitarianism, as well as his criticism of\naspects of American liberalism through the 1950s had revolved around\nthe pole of communism versus anti-communism. The emergence of the New\nLeft in 1968 moved Hook’s application of what he believed was\nhis pragmatic commitment to free inquiry from its previous emphasis on\nthe reform of institutional practice toward the emphasis, expressed in\nMeasure, on the balance between continuity and change.\nConsequently, in the spectrum of political philosophical thought Hook\nhad moved from the liberal wing, in which the priority had been\nidentified as the need to critically evaluate the flaws and faults of\nAmerican institutional practices in order to reform or transform them,\nto the conservative wing, in which the priority was identified as the\nneed to protect and sustain the strengths and values that were\ninherent in American institutional practices. Hook’s writings\nand positions became linked to American political conservatism on a\nrange of issues from educational curriculum through affirmative action\nto constitutional questions of the limits of executive privilege and\njudicial authority. \nThe issues that were discussed most frequently by Hook in\nMeasure related to American education, which, as previously\nnoted, had been an enduring focus of his interests from the outset of\nhis career. Hook’s changed approach to education was developed\nin his essay, Philosophy of the Curriculum, in 1976. In that\nessay, Hook sought to formulate the indispensable subject matter for a\ncurriculum in higher education. While Hook maintained his previous\nthesis that the development of critical thinking was crucial to any\nvaluable educational experience, his formulation of the curricular\nsubject matter reveals the degree to which the critical method is\nintertwined with the learning of appropriate subject matter, whether\nin the humanities or the sciences. Further, Hook defended liberal\neducation as requiring the reading and study of the Western canon even\nif such a requirement goes against perceived student needs and the\nexpression of student preferences, or violates some proposed criterion\nof social relevance. Thus, without reneging on his earlier criticism\nin Education for Modern Man of any educational philosophy\nthat assumed a fixed human nature, Hook recognized the legitimate role\nof a liberal education as the initiation of every human being into the\ncultural traditions of his society. Such initiation into a tradition\nwas compatible with the development of a critical method and approach.\nThe idea that the classroom was a community of free inquiry remained a\ncentral feature of Hook’s philosophy of education. At the same\ntime, the identification of the classroom as a community of free\ninquiry was no longer directed against academic traditionalism in its\ncurricular implications such as the tradition of reading the greatest\nworks of the humanities or the classic texts of political and social\nthought. Rather, it was directed against the classroom as a community\nof faith or a forum for political advocacy. Thus, the growing\ncurricular practice of “cultural studies” of\n“designated groups of victims” represented the\ntransformation of the classroom into a community of shared substantive\nvalues with a political agenda rather than a community of inquiry with\na shared critical method. To the degree to which multiculturalism did\nnot represent the study of the languages and texts of other cultures\nbut represented a species of political commitment to designated\ndeprived cultural groups, it would entail, for Hook, an unjustified\nmetamorphosis of the university from a community of free inquiry into\na community of political faith and advocacy. \nEducational issues were intertwined with broader issues of American\nsociety. The issue of affirmative action for college admissions, for\nexample, related to the social issue of the nature of American\ndemocratic pluralism. Hook supported a conception of American\ndemocracy as a society that had been built upon individual rights and\nequality before the law, where greater equality was to be realized by\nvirtue of the fact that the United States was a society of multiple\nopportunities with differing patterns for upward mobility. In\ncontrast, Hook perceived affirmative action, with its corollary of\nquotas assigned to designated groups as a conception of American\ndemocracy as a system of group rights, where greater equality was to\nbe realized by distributive measures. For Hook, rights were ascribed\nto the individual and not to individuals as members of majority or\nminority groups. Consequently, discrimination on grounds of race was\nillegitimate, whether it was designed as an expression of majority\nprejudice against a minority or as a benign instrument of\nrectificatory justice. Accordingly, for Hook, programs of affirmative\naction could be justified if they functioned to help a deprived\nindividual student overcome deficiencies in his educational background\nor to eliminate any bars to opportunity that had been erected by\ndiscriminatory laws or practices. Programs of affirmative action,\nhowever, that resulted in quotas for minority group participation\ninvolved discrimination against the rights of other individuals. Since\neach individual was entitled to equality before the law and equality\nof rights, no individual was entitled, on grounds of membership in an\nhistorically deprived group or racial or ethnic minority, to\nadvantages that violate equality of rights and justify discrimination\nagainst other individuals on racial or ethnic ground. While the social\nideal of overcoming economic inequality was legitimate, the means for\nits realization could not involve replacing individual rights with\ngroup rights or justifying discrimination against individuals who were\nconsidered equal before the law. Hook took note of the great progress\ntoward equality that had taken place in American society from the turn\nof the century through the 1980s. Hook expressed confidence in the\ncapacities of a democratic society to overcome inequalities in\neconomic distribution and in social participation of ethnic minorities\nwithout transforming the legal structure of the American system that\nhad prevailed through those decades. As a lifelong supporter of John\nDewey, Hook believed that democratic society, if it embodied the\ncritical method, would be capable of progressive improvement. \nIn light of this Deweyan optimism, it is significant that Hook took as\nthe subject of his Presidential Address for the American Philosophical\nAssociation the question of whether pragmatism had an appropriately\n“tragic sense of life.” Hook sought to counter the charge\nthat the meliorism and optimism of pragmatism represented a failure to\nunderstand the tragic situation that is an inevitable part of the\nhuman condition. Hook had argued that Deweyan pragmatism did not\nrepresent an excessively optimistic faith in human perfectibility, on\nthe model of Condorcé, and distanced itself from a logically\ndialectical faith in the inevitable historical progress along the\nlines of Hegel or Marx. Hook and the pragmatic philosophy recognized\nthat there have been innumerable sites of human failure,\nself-destructive action and tragic defeat in history. Hook recognized\nthe empirical phenomena of historical evil while believing that a\nphilosophical or theological emphasis upon these phenomena as\nrepresenting the essence of mankind or determining with historical\ninevitability the end of civilization could be identified as a\n“failure of nerve” which went beyond the required\nacceptance of the facts about the human condition. Rather,\nHook’s thesis in his presidential lecture was that it was\nnecessary to appreciate those enduring features of the human condition\nthat rendered utopian thought untenable and incoherent even as they\nmade possible progress through scientific method and an increase in\nhuman freedom that could occur at any particular time and place. \nAccordingly, Hook’s conclusion recognized the recurrence of\ntragedy throughout human history and throughout the careers of\nindividuals. Hook argued that this recognition of a tragic sense was\ncompatible with the humanistic naturalism that Deweyan pragmatism had\nfostered. The tragic sense of this pragmatic naturalism did not\nrequire the acceptance of the inevitability of the triumph of fateful\n“Necessity” on the model of Greek tragedy or within the\nframework of an Ionian metaphysical perspective in which human\nachievement is unavoidably dwarfed and overwhelmed by the immense\nmagnitudes of natural phenomena. Similarly, the tragic sense of\npragmatic naturalism did not require the acceptance of the\ninevitability of human self-destruction because of the flawed\nconstitution of human nature, as in the religious metaphors of\noriginal sin or the Freudian metaphor of the “death\ninstinct.” So pragmatic naturalism could sustain the recognition\nof a tragic sense while retaining the Deweyan optimistic realism that\nhuman nature, interacting with the environing processes of Nature,\ncould survive and develop a free society of free human beings, with\nthe use of human reason and the methods of the sciences. \nAccording to a narrative that is common in contemporary accounts of\n20th Century philosophy in America, pragmatism fell into decline\nshortly following World War II. Professional philosophy, it is said,\nhad become dominated by the pretensions to formalism and precision\nthat is the mark of the “analytic philosophy” that had\nemigrated from the UK. Turning to technical topics in the philosophy\nof language, philosophy of mind, and epistemology, American\nphilosophers abandoned the vision of philosophy as a publicly engaged\npractice of social critique that had been championed by Dewey, opting\ninstead for view of philosophy as a highly specialized and anemically\nacademic discipline. Pragmatism, this account has it, was\n“eclipsed” and “marginalized” by analytic\nphilosophy. The popular account continues that in the 1980s,\npragmatism was revived in the form of the “neo-pragmatism”\nproposed by Richard Rorty, Cornel West, Hilary Putnam, and Stanley\nCavell, among others. However, when this account is presented by\nadvocates of the tradition of “classical” pragmatism, the\nemphasis is placed on the allegation that neo-pragmatism is no true\npragmatism at all, but a counterfeit of the movement begun by Perice,\nJames, and Dewey. According to those allied with the classical\npragmatists, pragmatism remains in eclipse. Hence there has emerged a\nsignificant “back to Dewey” movement within contemporary\nAmerican philosophy, a movement that overtly sets itself in opposition\nto mainstream analytic philosophy and seeks to reestablish\npragmatism’s predominance. \nWhat is puzzling in all of this is that those invested in the idiom of\nclassical pragmatism nearly always write Sidney Hook out of\npragmatism’s history. Once Hook is acknowledged, one sees the\nDeweyan vision of philosophy thriving throughout the period of alleged\nmarginalization. That is, one finds in Hook not only a high-profile\npublicly engaged philosopher employing the methods of experimental\ninquiry to present social problems, but also an influential academic\nphilosopher engaged with the professional debates of his day, and\noften making necessary concessions and adjustments to the pragmatist\ncommitments in light of new objections and evidence. Although\nHook’s results do not always reflect “chapter and\nverse” Deweyanism, they do retain what is far more important,\nnamely, the unflagging commitment to the application of experimental\nintelligence to the social and political problems of the day. \nSeveral new studies of the history and mid-century development of\npragmatism have appeared recently, including the landmark work of\nCheryl Misak, which does much to dislodge the dominant “eclipse\nnarrative” and recast pragmatism as continuous with the\nmainstream trends within the so-called “analytic”\nphilosophy of C. I. Lewis, Nelson Goodman, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald\nDavidson. Nonetheless, apart from a suggestive but still only\npreliminary discussion by Cornel West in his study of American\npragmatism, Sidney Hook’s place in the pragmatist story remains\nlargely unexplored.","contact.mail":"robert.talisse@vanderbilt.edu","contact.domain":"vanderbilt.edu"}]
