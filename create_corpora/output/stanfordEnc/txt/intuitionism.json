Brouwer (1881–1966). Intuitionism is\nbased on the idea that mathematics is a creation of the mind. The\ntruth of a mathematical statement can only be conceived via a mental\nconstruction that proves it to be true, and the communication between\nmathematicians only serves as a means to create the same mental\nprocess in different minds.\n\n\nThis view on mathematics has far reaching implications for the daily\npractice of mathematics, one of its consequences being that the\nprinciple of the excluded middle, \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\), is no longer\nvalid. Indeed, there are propositions, like the Riemann hypothesis,\nfor which there exists currently neither a proof of the statement nor\nof its negation. Since knowing the negation of a statement in\nintuitionism means that one can prove that the statement is not true,\nthis implies that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) do not hold\nintuitionistically, at least not at this moment. The dependence of\nintuitionism on time is essential: statements can become provable in\nthe course of time and therefore might become intuitionistically valid\nwhile not having been so before.\n\n\nBesides the rejection of the principle of the excluded middle,\nintuitionism strongly deviates from classical mathematics in the\nconception of the continuum, which in the former setting has the\nproperty that all total functions on it are continuous. Thus, unlike\nseveral other theories of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is\nnot a restriction of classical reasoning; it contradicts classical\nmathematics in a fundamental way.\n\n\nBrouwer devoted a large part of his life to the development of\nmathematics on this new basis. Although intuitionism has never\nreplaced classical mathematics as the standard view on mathematics, it\nhas always attracted a great deal of attention and is still widely\nstudied today.\n\n\nIn this entry we concentrate on the aspects of intuitionism that set\nit apart from other branches of constructive mathematics, and the part\nthat it shares with other forms of constructivism, such as\nfoundational theories and models, is discussed only briefly.\n\nLuitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer was born in Overschie, the Netherlands.\nHe studied mathematics and physics at the University of Amsterdam,\nwhere he obtained his PhD in 1907. In 1909 he became a lecturer at the\nsame university, where he was appointed full professor in 1912, a\nposition he held until his retirement in 1951. Brouwer was a brilliant\nmathematician who did ground-breaking work in topology and became\nfamous already at a young age. All his life he was an independent mind\nwho pursued the things he believed in with ardent vigor, which brought\nhim in conflict with many a colleague, most notably with David\nHilbert. He had admirers as well, and in his house “the\nhut” in Blaricum he welcomed many well-known mathematicians of\nhis time. To the end of his life he became more isolated, but his\nbelief in the truth of his philosophy never wavered. He died in a car\naccident at the age of 85 in Blaricum, seven years after the death of\nhis wife Lize Brouwer.  \nAt the age of 24 Brouwer wrote the book Life, Art and\nMysticism (Brouwer 1905), whose solipsistic content foreshadows\nhis philosophy of mathematics. In his dissertation the foundations of\nintuitionism are formulated for the first time, although not yet under\nthat name and not in their final form. In the first years after his\ndissertation most of Brouwer’s scientific life was devoted to\ntopology, an area in which he is still known for his theory of\ndimension and his fixed point theorem. This work is part of classical\nmathematics; according to Brouwer’s later view, his fixed point\ntheorem does not hold, although an analogue cast in terms of\napproximations can be proved to hold according to his principles. \nFrom 1913 on, Brouwer increasingly dedicated himself to the\ndevelopment of the ideas formulated in his dissertation into a full\nphilosophy of mathematics. He not only refined the philosophy of\nintuitionism but also reworked mathematics, especially the theory of\nthe continuum and the theory of sets, according to these principles.\nBy then, Brouwer was a famous mathematician who gave influential\nlectures on intuitionism at the scientific meccas of that time,\nCambridge, Vienna, and Göttingen among them. His philosophy was\nconsidered awkward by many, but treated as a serious alternative to\nclassical reasoning by some of the most famous mathematicians of his\ntime, even when they had a different view on the matter. Kurt\nGödel, who was a Platonist all his life, was one of them. Hermann\nWeyl at one point wrote “So gebe ich also jetzt meinen eigenen\nVersuch Preis und schließe mich Brouwer an” (Weyl 1921,\n56). And although he rarely practised intuitionistic mathematics later\nin life, Weyl never stopped admiring Brouwer and his intuitionistic\nphilosophy of mathematics. \nThe life of Brouwer was laden with conflicts, the most famous one\nbeing the conflict with David Hilbert, which eventually led to\nBrouwer’s expulsion from the board of the Mathematische\nAnnalen. This conflict was part of the Grundlagenstreit\nthat shook the mathematical society at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury and that emerged as a result of the appearance of paradoxes\nand highly nonconstructive proofs in mathematics. Philosophers and\nmathematicians were forced to acknowledge the lack of an\nepistemological and ontological basis for mathematics. Brouwer’s\nintuitionism is a philosophy of mathematics that aims to provide such\na foundation. \nAccording to Brouwer mathematics is a languageless creation of the\nmind. Time is the only a priori notion, in the Kantian sense. Brouwer\ndistinguishes two acts of intuitionism: \nThe first act of intuitionism is:  \nAs will be discussed in the section on mathematics, the first act of\nintuitionism gives rise to the natural numbers but implies a severe\nrestriction on the principles of reasoning permitted, most notably the\nrejection of the principle of the excluded middle. Owing to the\nrejection of this principle and the disappearance of the logical basis\nfor the continuum, one might, in the words of Brouwer, “fear\nthat intuitionistic mathematics must necessarily be poor and anaemic,\nand in particular would have no place for analysis” (Brouwer\n1952, 142). The second act, however, establishes the existence of the\ncontinuum, a continuum having properties not shared by its classical\ncounterpart. The recovery of the continuum rests on the notion of\nchoice sequence stipulated in the second act, i.e. on the existence of\ninfinite sequences generated by free choice, which therefore are not\nfixed in advance. \nThe second act of intuitionism is: \nThe two acts of intuitionism form the basis of Brouwer’s\nphilosophy; from these two acts alone Brouwer creates the realm of\nintuitionistic mathematics, as will be explained below. Already from\nthis basic principles it can be concluded that intuitionism differs\nfrom Platonism and formalism, because neither does it assume a\nmathematical reality outside of us, nor does it hold that mathematics\nis a play with symbols according to certain fixed rules. In\nBrouwer’s view, language is used to exchange mathematical ideas\nbut the existence of the latter is independent of the former. The\ndistinction between intuitionism and other constructive views on\nmathematics according to which mathematical objects and arguments\nshould be computable, lies in the freedom that the second act allows\nin the construction of infinite sequences. Indeed, as will be\nexplained below, the mathematical implications of the second act of\nintuitionism contradict classical mathematics, and therefore do not\nhold in most constructive theories, since these are in general part of\nclassical mathematics. \nThus Brouwer’s intuitionism stands apart from other philosophies\nof mathematics; it is based on the awareness of time and the\nconviction that mathematics is a creation of the free mind, and it\ntherefore is neither Platonism nor formalism. It is a form of\nconstructivism, but only so in the wider sense, since many\nconstructivists do not accept all the principles that Brouwer believed\nto be true. \nThe two acts of intuitionism do not in themselves exclude a\npsychological interpretation of mathematics. Although Brouwer only\noccasionally addressed this point, it is clear from his writings that\nhe did consider intuitionism to be independent of psychology.\nBrouwer’s introduction of the Creating Subject (Brouwer\n1948) as an idealized mind in which mathematics takes place already\nabstracts away from inessential aspects of human reasoning such as\nlimitations of space and time and the possibility of faulty arguments.\nThus the intersubjectivity problem, which asks for an explanation of\nthe fact that human beings are able to communicate, ceases to exist,\nas there exists only one Creating Subject. In the literature, also the\nname Creative Subject is used for Creating Subject, but here\nBrouwer’s terminology is used. In (Niekus 2010), it is argued\nthat Brouwer’s Creating Subject does not involve an idealized\nmathematician. For a phenomenological analysis of the Creating Subject\nas a transcendental subject in the sense of Husserl see (van Atten\n2007).  \nBrouwer used arguments that involve the Creating Subject to construct\ncounterexamples to certain intuitionistically unacceptable statements.\nWhere the weak counterexamples, to be discussed below, only show that\ncertain statements cannot, at present, be accepted intuitionistically,\nthe notion of the idealized mind proves certain classical principles\nto be false. An example is given in Section 5.4 on the formalization\nof the notion of the Creating Subject. There it is also explained that\nthe following principle, known as Kripke’s Schema, can\nbe argued for in terms of the Creating Subject:  \nIn KS, \\(A\\) ranges over formulas and \\( \\alpha\\) ranges over\nchoice sequences, which are sequences of natural numbers produced by\nthe Creating Subject, who chooses their elements one-by-one. Choice\nsequences and Kripke’s Schema are discussed further in Section\n3.4. \nIn most philosophies of mathematics, for example in Platonism,\nmathematical statements are tenseless. In intuitionism truth and\nfalsity have a temporal aspect; an established fact will remain so,\nbut a statement that becomes proven at a certain point in time lacks a\ntruth-value before that point. In said formalization of the notion of\nCreating Subject, which was not formulated by Brouwer but only later\nby others, the temporal aspect of intuitionism is conspicuously\npresent.  \nImportant as the arguments using the notion of Creating Subject might\nbe for the further understanding of intuitionism as a philosophy of\nmathematics, its role in the development of the field has been less\ninfluential than that of the two acts of intuitionism, which directly\nlead to the mathematical truths Brouwer and those coming after him\nwere willing to accept. \nAlthough Brouwer’s development of intuitionism played an\nimportant role in the foundational debate among mathematicians at the\nbeginning of the 20th century, the far reaching implications of his\nphilosophy for mathematics became only apparent after many years of\nresearch. The two most characteristic properties of intuitionism are\nthe logical principles of reasoning that it allows in proofs and the\nfull conception of the intuitionistic continuum. Only as far as the\nlatter is concerned, intuitionism becomes incomparable with classical\nmathematics. In this entry the focus is on those principles of\nintuitionism that set it apart from other mathematical disciplines,\nand therefore its other constructive aspects will be treated in less\ndetail.  \nIn intuitionism, knowing that a statement A is true means\nhaving a proof of it. In 1934 Arend Heyting, who had been a student of\nBrouwer, introduced a form of what became later known as the\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov-interpretation, which captures the\nmeaning of the logical symbols in intuitionism, and in constructivism\nin general as well. It defines in an informal way what an\nintuitionistic proof should consist of by indicating how the\nconnectives and quantifiers should be interpreted.  \nThe negation \\(\\neg A\\) of a formula \\(A\\) is proven once it has been\nshown that there cannot exist a proof of \\(A\\), which means providing\na construction that derives falsum from any possible proof of \\(A\\).\nThus \\(\\neg A\\) is equivalent to \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\). The\nBHK-interpretation is not a formal definition because the notion of\nconstruction is not defined and therefore open to different\ninterpretations. Nevertheless, already on this informal level one is\nforced to reject one of the logical principles ever-present in\nclassical logic: the principle of the excluded middle \\((A\\vee \\neg\nA)\\). According to the BHK-interpretation this statement holds\nintuitionistically if the Creating Subject knows a proof of \\(A\\) or a\nproof that \\(A\\) cannot be proved. In the case that neither for \\(A\\)\nnor for its negation a proof is known, the statement \\((A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\) does not hold. The existence of open problems, such as the\nGoldbach conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis, illustrates this fact.\nBut once a proof of \\(A\\) or a proof of its negation is found, the\nsituation changes, and for this particular \\(A\\) the principle \\((A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\) is true from that moment on. \nBrouwer rejected the principle of the excluded middle on the basis of\nhis philosophy, but Arend Heyting was the first to formulate a\ncomprehensive logic of principles acceptable from an intuitionistic\npoint of view. Intuitionistic logic, which is the logic of most other\nforms of constructivism as well, is often referred to as\n“classical logic without the principle of the excluded\nmiddle”. It is denoted by IQC, which stands for Intuitionistic\nQuantifier Logic, but other names occur in the literature as well. A\npossible axiomatization in Hilbert style consists of the\nprinciples \nwith the usual side conditions for the last two axioms, and the rule\nModus Ponens,  \nas the only rule of inference. Intuitionistic logic has been an object\nof investigation ever since Heyting formulated it. Already at the\npropositional level it has many properties that sets it apart from\nclassical logic, such as the Disjunction Property:  \nThis principle is clearly violated in classical logic, because\nclassical logic proves \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\) also for formulas that are\nindependent of the logic, i.e. for which both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\nnot a tautology. The inclusion of the principle Ex Falso Sequitur\nQuodlibet, \\((\\bot \\rightarrow A)\\), in intuitionistic logic is a\npoint of discussion for those studying Brouwer’s remarks on the\nsubject; in van Atten 2008, it is argued that the principle is not\nvalid in Intuitionism and that the logical principles valid according\nto Brouwer’s views are those of relevance logic. See van Dalen\n2004 for more on Brouwer and Ex Falso Sequitur Quodlibet.  \nAlthough till today all the logic used in intuitionistic reasoning is\ncontained in IQC, it is in principle conceivable that at some\npoint there will be found a principle acceptable from the\nintuitionistic point of view that is not covered by this logic. For\nmost forms of constructivism the widely accepted view is that this\nwill not ever be the case, and thus IQC is considered to be\nthe logic of constructivism. For intuitionism the situation\nis less clear because it cannot be excluded that at some point our\nintuitionistic understanding might lead us to new logical principles\nthat we did not grasp before.  \nOne of the reasons for the widespread use of intuitionistic logic is\nthat it is well-behaved both from the proof-theoretic as the\nmodel-theoretic point of view. There exist a great many proof systems\nfor it, such as Gentzen calculi and natural deduction systems, as well\nas various forms of semantics, such as Kripke models, Beth models,\nHeyting algebras, topological semantics and categorical models.\nSeveral of these semantics are, however, only classical means to study\nintuitionistic logic, for it can be shown that an intuitionistic\ncompleteness proof with respect to them cannot exist (Kreisel 1962).\nIt has, however, been shown that there are alternative but a little\nless natural models with respect to which completeness does hold\nconstructively (Veldman 1976). The constructive character of\nintuitionistic logic becomes particularly clear in the Curry-Howard\nisomorphism that establishes a correspondence between derivations in\nthe logic and terms in simply typed \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, that is,\nbetween proofs and computations. The correspondence preserves\nstructure in that reduction of terms correspond to normalization of\nproofs.  \nThe existence of the natural numbers is given by the first act of\nintuitionism, that is by the perception of the movement of time and\nthe falling apart of a life moment into two distinct things: what was,\n1, and what is together with what was, 2, and from there to 3, 4, …\nIn contrast to classical mathematics, in intuitionism all infinity is\nconsidered to be potential infinity. In particular this is the case\nfor the infinity of the natural numbers. Therefore statements that\nquantify over this set have to be treated with caution. On the other\nhand, the principle of induction is fully acceptable from an\nintuitionistic point of view. \nBecause of the finiteness of a natural number in contrast to, for\nexample, a real number, many arithmetical statements of a finite\nnature that are true in classical mathematics are so in intuitionism\nas well. For example, in intuitionism every natural number has a prime\nfactorization; there exist computably enumerable sets that are not\ncomputable; \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds for all quantifier free\nstatements \\(A\\). For more complex statements, such as van der\nWaerden’s theorem or Kruskal’s theorem, intuitionistic\nvalidity is not so straightforward. In fact, the intuitionistic proofs\nof both statements are complex and deviate from the classical proofs\n(Coquand 1995, Veldman 2004). \nThus in the context of the natural numbers, intuitionism and classical\nmathematics have a lot in common. It is only when other infinite sets\nsuch as the real numbers are considered that intuitionism starts to\ndiffer more dramatically from classical mathematics, and from most\nother forms of constructivism as well. \nIn intuitionism, the continuum is both an extension and a restriction\nof its classical counterpart. In its full form, both notions are\nincomparable since the intuitionistic real numbers possess properties\nthat the classical real numbers do not have. A famous example, to be\ndiscussed below, is the theorem that in intuitionism every total\nfunction on the continuum is continuous. That the intuitionistic\ncontinuum does not satisfy certain classical properties can be easily\nseen via weak counterexamples. That it also contains\nproperties that the classical reals do not posses stems from the\nexistence, in intuitionism, of choice sequences. \nThe weak counterexamples, introduced by Brouwer in 1908, are\nthe first examples that Brouwer used to show that the shift from a\nclassical to an intuitionistic conception of mathematics is not\nwithout consequence for the mathematical truths that can be\nestablished according to these philosophies. They show that certain\nclassical statements are presently unacceptable from an intuitionistic\npoint of view. As an example, consider the sequence of real numbers\ngiven by the following definition:  \nHere \\(A(n)\\) is a decidable property for which \\(\\forall n A(n)\\) is\nnot known to be true or false. Decidability means that at present for\nany given \\(n\\) there exists (can be constructed) a proof of \\(A(n)\\)\nor of \\(\\neg A(n)\\). At the time of this writing, we could for example\nlet \\(A(n)\\) express that \\(n\\), if greater than 2, is the sum of\nthree primes; \\(\\forall n A(n)\\) then expresses the (original)\nGoldbach conjecture that every number greater than 2 is the sum of\nthree primes. The sequence \\(\\langle r_n \\rangle\\) defines a real\nnumber \\(r\\) for which the statement \\(r=0\\) is equivalent to the\nstatement \\(\\forall n A(n)\\). It follows that the statement \\((r = 0\n\\vee r \\neq 0)\\) does not hold, and therefore that the law of\ntrichotomy \\(\\forall x(x \\lt y \\vee x=y \\vee x \\gt y)\\) is not true on\nthe intuitionistic continuum. \nNote the subtle difference between “\\(A\\) is not\nintuitionistically true ” and “\\(A\\) is intuitionistically\nrefutable”: in the first case we know that \\(A\\) cannot have an\nintuitionistic proof, the second statement expresses that we have a\nproof of ¬A, i.e. a construction that derives falsum from\nany possible proof of \\(A\\). For the law of trichotomy we have just\nshown that it is not intuitionistically true. Below it will be shown\nthat even the second stronger form saying that the law is refutable\nholds intuitionistically. This, however, is not true for all\nstatements for which there exist weak counterexamples. For example,\nthe Goldbach conjecture is a weak counterexample to the principle of\nthe excluded middle, since \\(\\forall n A(n)\\) as above is at present\nnot known to be true or false, and thus we cannot assert \\(\\forall n\nA(n) \\vee \\neg \\forall n A(n)\\) intuitionistically, at least not at\nthis moment. But the refutation of this statement, \\(\\neg (\\forall n\nA(n) \\vee \\neg \\forall n A(n))\\), is not true in intuitionism, as one\ncan show that for any statement \\(B\\) a contradiction can be derived\nfrom the assumption that \\(\\neg B\\) and \\(\\neg\\neg B\\) hold (and thus\nalso from \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\)). In other words, \\(\\neg\\neg (B \\vee\n\\neg B)\\) is intuitionistically true, and thus, although there exist\nweak counterexamples to the principle of the excluded middle, its\nnegation is false in intuitionism, that is, it is intuitionistically\nrefutable. \nThe existence of real numbers \\(r\\) for which the intuitionist cannot\ndecide whether they are positive or not shows that certain classically\ntotal functions cease to be so in an intuitionistic setting, such as\nthe piecewise constant function \nThere exist weak counterexamples to many classically valid statements.\nThe construction of these weak counterexamples often follow the same\npattern as the example above. For example, the argument that shows\nthat the intermediate value theorem is not intuitionistically valid\nruns as follows. Let \\(r\\) be a real number in [−1,1] for which\n\\((r\\leq 0 \\vee 0 \\lt r)\\) has not been decided, as in the example\nabove. Define the uniformly continuous function \\(f\\) on \\([0,3]\\)\nby \nClearly, \\(f(0) = -1 +r\\) and \\(f(3) = 1 + r\\), whence \\(f\\) takes the\nvalue 0 at some point \\(x\\) in [0,3]. If such \\(x\\) could be\ndetermined, either \\(1 \\leq x\\) or \\(x \\leq 2\\). Since \\(f\\) equals\n\\(r\\) on \\([1,2]\\), in the first case \\(r \\leq 0\\) and in the second\ncase \\(0\\leq r\\), contradicting the undecidability of the statement\n\\((r\\leq 0 \\vee 0 \\leq r)\\). \nThese examples seem to indicate that in the shift from classical to\nintuitionistic mathematics one loses several fundamental theorems of\nanalysis. This however is not so, since in many cases intuitionism\nregains such theorems in the form of an analogue in which existential\nstatements are replaced by statements about the existence of\napproximations within arbitrary precision, as in this classically\nequivalent form of the intermediate value theorem that is\nconstructively valid: \nTheorem. For every continuous real-valued function\n\\(f\\) on an interval \\([a,b]\\) with \\(a \\lt b\\), for every \\(c\\)\nbetween \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), the following holds: \nWeak counterexamples are a means to show that certain mathematical\nstatements do not hold intuitionistically, but they do not yet reveal\nthe richness of the intuitionistic continuum. Only after\nBrouwer’s introduction of choice sequences did intuitionism\nobtain its particular flavor and became incomparable with classical\nmathematics. Choice sequences were introduced by Brouwer to capture the\nintuition of the continuum. Since for the intuitionist all infinity is\npotential, infinite objects can only be grasped via a process that\ngenerates them step-by-step. What will be allowed as a legitimate\nconstruction therefore decides which infinite objects are to be\naccepted. For example, in most other forms of constructivism only\ncomputable rules for generating such objects are allowed, while in\nPlatonism infinities are considered to be completed totalities whose\nexistence is accepted even in cases when no generating rules are\nknown. \nBrouwer’s second act of intuitionism gives rise to choice\nsequences, that provide certain infinite sets with properties that are\nunacceptable from a classical point of view. A choice sequence is an\ninfinite sequence of numbers (or finite objects) created by the free\nwill. The sequence could be determined by a law or algorithm, such as\nthe sequence consisting of only zeros, or of the prime numbers in\nincreasing order, in which case we speak of a lawlike\nsequence, or it could not be subject to any law, in which case it is\ncalled lawless. Lawless sequences could for example be\ncreated by the repeated throw of a coin, or by asking the Creating\nSubject to choose the successive numbers of the sequence one by one,\nallowing it to choose any number to its liking. Thus a lawless\nsequence is ever unfinished, and the only available information about\nit at any stage in time is the initial segment of the sequence created\nthus far. Clearly, by the very nature of lawlessness we can never\ndecide whether its values will coincide with a sequence that is\nlawlike. Also, the free will is able to create sequences that start\nout as lawlike, but for which at a certain point the law might be\nlifted and the process of free choice takes over to generate the\nsucceeding numbers, or vice versa. \nAccording to Brouwer every real number is represented by a choice\nsequence, and the choice sequences enabled him to capture the\nintuitionistic continuum via the controversial continuity axioms.\nBrouwer first spoke of choice sequences in his inaugural address\n(Brouwer 1912), but at that time he did not yet treat them as a\nfundamental part of his mathematics. Gradually they became more\nimportant and from 1918 on Brouwer started to use them in a way\nexplained in the next section.  \nThe acceptance of the notion of choice sequence has far-reaching\nimplications. It justifies, for the intuitionist, the use of the\ncontinuity axioms, from which classically invalid statements can be\nderived. The weakest of these axioms is the weak continuity axiom:\n \nHere \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) range over natural numbers, \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\) over choice sequences, and \\(\\beta\\in\\alpha(\\overline{m})\\)\nmeans that the first \\(m\\) elements of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are\nequal. Although until now there has never been given a completely\nsatisfactory justification of most continuity axioms for arbitrary\nchoice sequences, not even by Brouwer, when restricted to the class of\nlawless sequences arguments supporting the validity of the weak\ncontinuity axiom run as follows. When could a statement of the form\n\\(\\forall\\alpha\\exists n A(\\alpha,n)\\) be established by the\nintuitionist? By the very nature of the notion of lawless sequence,\nthe choice of the number \\(n\\) for which \\(A(\\alpha,n)\\) holds has to\nbe made after only a finite initial segment of \\(\\alpha\\) is known.\nFor we do not know how \\(\\alpha\\) will proceed in time, and we\ntherefore have to base the choice of \\(n\\) on the initial segment of\n\\(\\alpha\\) that is known at that point in time where we wish to fix\n\\(n\\). This implies that for every lawless sequence \\(\\beta\\) with the\nsame initial segment as \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A(\\beta,n)\\) holds as well.  \nThe weak continuity axiom has been shown to be consistent, and is\noften applied in a form that can be justified, namely in the case in\nwhich the predicate \\(A\\) only refers to the values of \\(\\alpha\\), and\nnot to the higher order properties that it possibly possesses. The\ndetails of the argument will be omitted here, but it contains the same\ningredients as the justification of the principle for lawless\nsequences, and can be found in van Atten and van Dalen 2002. \nWeak continuity does not exhaust the intuitionists’ intuition\nabout the continuum, for given the weak continuity axiom, it seems\nreasonable to assume that the choice of the number \\(m\\) such that\n\\(\\forall\\beta\\in\\alpha(\\overline{m})A(\\beta,n)\\), could be made\nexplicit. Thus \\(\\forall\\alpha\\exists n A(\\alpha,n)\\) implies the\nexistence of a continuous functional \\(\\Phi\\) that for every\n\\(\\alpha\\) produces the \\(m\\) that fixes the length of \\(\\alpha\\) on\nthe basis of which \\(n\\) is chosen. More formally, let\n\\(\\mathcal{CF}\\) be the class of continuous functionals \\(\\Phi\\) that\nassign natural numbers to infinite sequences, i.e. that satisfy \nThe full axiom of continuity, which is an extension of the weak\ncontinuity axiom, can then be expressed as:  \nThrough the continuity axiom certain weak counterexamples can be\ntransformed into genuine refutations of classically accepted\nprinciples. For example, it implies that the quantified version of the\nprinciple of the excluded middle is false: \nHere \\(\\alpha(n)\\) denotes the \\(n\\)-th element of \\(\\alpha\\). To see\nthat this negations holds, suppose, arguing by contradiction, that\n\\(\\neg\\forall\\alpha(\\forall n\\alpha (n)=0 \\vee \\neg \\forall n\\alpha\n(n)=0)\\) holds. This implies that  \nBy the weak continuity axiom, for \\(\\alpha\\) consisting of only zeros\nthere exists a number \\(m\\) that fixes the choice of \\(k\\), which\nmeans that for all \\(\\beta\\in\\alpha(\\overline{m})\\), \\(k=0\\). But the\nexistence of sequences whose first \\(m\\) elements are 0 and that\ncontain a 1 show that this cannot be. \nThis example showing that the principle of the excluded middle not\nonly does not hold but is in fact false in intuitionism, leads to the\nrefutation of many basic properties of the continuum. Consider for\nexample the real number \\(r_\\alpha\\) that is the limit of the sequence\nconsisting of the numbers \\(r_n\\) as given in the section on weak\ncounterexamples, where the \\(A(m)\\) in the definition is taken to be\nthe statement \\(\\alpha(m)=0\\). Then the refutation above implies that\n\\(\\neg\\forall\\alpha(r_\\alpha=0 \\vee r_\\alpha\\neq 0)\\), and it thereby\nrefutes the law of trichotomy: \nThe following theorem is another example of the way in which the\ncontinuity axiom refutes certain classical principles.  \nIndeed, a classical counterexample to this theorem, the nowhere\ncontinuous function \n\n\\[\n f(x) = \n  \\begin{cases}\n    0 \\text{ if \\(x\\) is a rational number } \\\\\n    1 \\text{ if \\(x\\) is an irrational number} \n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n is not a legitimate function from the\nintuitionistic point of view since the property of being rational is\nnot decidable on the real numbers. The theorem above implies that the\ncontinuum is not decomposable, and in van Dalen 1997, it is shown that\nthis even holds for the set of irrational numbers. \nThe two examples above are characteristic for the way in which the\ncontinuity axioms are applied in intuitionistic mathematics. They are\nthe only axioms in intuitionism that contradict classical reasoning,\nand thereby represent the most colorful as well as the most\ncontroversial part of Brouwer’s philosophy. \nThere is a convenient representation of continuous functionals that\nhas been used extensively in the literature, though not by Brouwer\nhimself. Continuous functionals that assign numbers to infinite\nsequences can be represented by neighborhood functions, where\na neighborhood function \\(f\\) is a function on the natural numbers\nsatisfying the following two properties (\\(\\cdot\\) denotes\nconcatenation and \\(f(\\alpha(\\overline{n}))\\) denotes the value of\n\\(f\\) on the code of the finite sequence\n\\(\\alpha(\\overline{n})\\)). \nIntuitively, if \\(f\\) represents \\(\\Phi\\) then\n\\(f(\\alpha(\\overline{n}))=0\\) means that \\(\\alpha(\\overline{n})\\) is\nnot long enough to compute \\(\\Phi(\\alpha)\\), and\n\\(f(\\alpha(\\overline{n}))=m+1\\) means that \\(\\alpha(\\overline{n})\\) is\nlong enough to compute \\(\\Phi(\\alpha)\\) and that the value of\n\\(\\Phi(\\alpha)\\) is \\(m\\). If \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) denotes the class of\nneighborhood functions, then the continuity axiom \\({\\bf C\\mbox{-}N}\\)\ncan be rephrased as \n\n\\[\n \\forall \\alpha\\exists n A(\\alpha,n) \\rightarrow \n \\exists f \\in \\mathcal{K}\\, \\forall m(f(m) \\gt 0 \\rightarrow \n \\forall \\beta \\in m A(\\beta,f(m-1))), \n\\]\n\n  \nwhere \\(\\beta \\in m\\) means that the code of the initial segment of\n\\(\\beta\\) is \\(m\\). \nBrouwer introduced choice sequences and the continuity axioms to\ncapture the intuitionistic continuum, but these principles alone do\nnot suffice to recover that part of traditional analysis that Brouwer\nconsidered intuitionistically sound, such as the theorem that every\ncontinuous real function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.\nFor this reason Brouwer proved the so-called bar theorem. It is a\nclassically valid statement, but the proof Brouwer gave is by many\nconsidered to be no proof at all since it uses an assumption on the\nform of proofs for which no rigorous argument is provided. This is the\nreason that the bar theorem is also referred to as the bar principle.\n \nThe most famous consequence of the bar theorem is the fan theorem,\nwhich suffices to prove the aforementioned theorem on uniform\ncontinuity, and which will be treated first. Both the fan and the bar\ntheorem allow the intuitionist to use induction along certain\nwell-founded sets of objects called spreads. A spread is the\nintuitionistic analogue of a set, and captures the idea of infinite\nobjects as ever growing and never finished. A spread is essentially a\ncountably branching tree labelled with natural numbers or other finite\nobjects and containing only infinite paths. \nA fan is a finitely branching spread, and the fan principle\nexpresses a form of compactness that is classically equivalent to\nKönig’s lemma, the classical proof of which is unacceptable\nfrom the intuitionistic point of view. The principle states that for\nevery fan \\(T\\) in which every branch at some point satisfies a\nproperty \\(A\\), there is a uniform bound on the depth at which this\nproperty is met. Such a property is called a bar for\n\\(T\\). \nHere \\(\\alpha \\in T\\) means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a branch of \\(T\\). The\nprinciple FAN suffices to prove the theorem mentioned\nabove:  \nBrouwer’s justification for the fan theorem is his bar principle\nfor the universal spread: \nHere \\(\\varepsilon\\) stands for the empty sequence, \\(\\cdot\\) for\nconcatenation, BI for Bar Induction, and the\nsubscript D refers to the decidability of the\npredicate \\(A\\). The bar principle provides intuitionism with an\ninduction principle for trees; it expresses a well-foundedness\nprinciple for spreads with respect to decidable properties. Extensions\nof this principle in which the decidability requirement is weakened\ncan be extracted from Brouwer’s work but will be omitted here.\nContinuity and the bar principle are sometimes captured in one axiom\ncalled the bar continuity axiom. \nThere is a close connection between the bar principle and the\nneighborhood functions mentioned in the section on continuity axioms.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{IK}\\) be the inductively defined class of neighborhood\nfunctions, consisting of all constant non-zero sequences \\(\\lambda\nm.n+1\\), and such that if \\(f(0)=0\\) and \\(\\lambda m.f(x\\cdot m)\\in\n\\mathcal{IK}\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\(f \\in \\mathcal{IK}\\). The\nstatement \\(\\mathcal{K}=\\mathcal{IK}\\), that is, the statement that\nthe neighborhood functions can be generated inductively, is equivalent\nto BID.  \nBrouwer’s proof of the bar theorem is remarkable in that it uses\nwell-ordering properties of hypothetical proofs. It is based\non the assumption that any proof that a property A on\nsequences is a bar can be decomposed into a canonical proof\nthat is well-ordered. Although it is classically valid,\nBrouwer’s proof of the principle shows that the reason for\naccepting it as a valid principle in intuitionism differs\nfundamentally from the argument supporting its acceptability in\nclassical mathematics. \nThe axiom of choice in its full form is unacceptable from a\nconstructive point of view, at least in the presence of certain other\ncentral axioms of set theory, such as extensionality (Diaconescu\n1975). For let \\(A\\) be a statement that is not known to be true or\nfalse. Then membership of the following two sets is undecidable.  \nThe existence of a choice function \\(f:\\{X,Y\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\)\nchoosing an element from \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) would imply \\((A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\). For if \\(f(X)\\neq f(Y)\\), it follows that \\(X\\neq Y\\), and hence\n\\(\\neg A\\), whereas \\(f(X)=f(Y)\\) implies \\(A\\). Therefore a choice\nfunction for \\(\\{X,Y\\}\\) cannot exist.  \nThere are, however, certain restrictions of the axiom that are\nacceptable for the intuitionist, for example the axiom of\ncountable choice, also accepted as a legitimate principle by the\nsemi-intuitionists to be discussed below: \nThis scheme may be justified as follows. A proof of the premise should\nprovide a method that given \\(m\\) provides a number \\(n\\) such that\n\\(mRn\\). Thus the function \\(\\alpha\\) on the natural numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\) can be constructed step-by-step: first an element\n\\(m_0\\) is chosen such that \\(0Rm_0\\), which will be the value of\n\\(\\alpha(0)\\). Then an element \\(m_1\\) is chosen such that \\(1Rm_1\\),\nwhich will be the value of \\(\\alpha(1)\\), and so on.  \nSeveral other choice axioms can be justified in a similar way. Only\none more will be mentioned here, the axiom of dependent choice: \nAlso in classical mathematics the choice axioms are treated with care,\nand it is often explicitly mentioned how much choice is needed in a\nproof. Since the axiom of dependent choice is consistent with an\nimportant axiom in classical set theory (the axiom of determinacy)\nwhile the full axiom of choice is not, special attention is payed to\nthis axiom and in general one tries to reduce the amount of choice in\na proof, if choice is present at all, to dependent choice.  \nBrouwer was not alone in his doubts concerning certain classical forms\nof reasoning. This is particularly visible in descriptive set theory,\nwhich emerged as a reaction to the highly nonconstructive notions\noccurring in Cantorian set theory. The founding fathers of the field,\nincluding Émile Borel and Henri Lebesgue as two of the main\nfigures, were called semi-intuitionists, and their\nconstructive treatment of the continuum led to the definition of the\nBorel hierarchy. From their point of view a notion like the set of all\nsets of real numbers is meaningless, and therefore has to be replaced\nby a hierarchy of subsets that do have a clear description.  \nIn Veldman 1999, an intuitionistic equivalent of the notion of Borel\nset is formulated, and it is shown that classically equivalent\ndefinitions of the Borel sets give rise to a variety of\nintuitionistically distinct classes, a situation that often occurs in\nintuitionism. For the intuitionistic Borel sets an analogue of the\nBorel Hierarchy Theorem is intuitionistically valid. The proof of this\nfact makes essential use of the continuity axioms discussed above and\nthereby shows how classical mathematics can guide the search for\nintuitionistic analogues that, however, have to be proved in a\ncompletely different way, sometimes using principles unacceptable from\na classical point of view. \nAnother approach to the study of subsets of the continuum, or of a\ntopological space in general, has appeared through the development of\nformal or abstract topology (Fourman 1982, Martin-Löf 1970,\nSambin 1987). In this constructive topology the role of open sets and\npoints is reversed; in classical topology an open set is defined as a\ncertain set of points, in the constructive case open sets are the\nfundamental notion and points are defined in terms of them. Therefore\nthis approach is sometimes referred to as point-free topology. \nIntuitionistic functional analysis has been developed far and wide by\nmany after Brouwer, but since most approaches are not strictly\nintuitionistic but also constructive in the wider sense, this research\nwill not be addressed any further here. \nIntuitionism shares a core part with most other forms of\nconstructivism. Constructivism in general is concerned with\nconstructive mathematical objects and reasoning. From constructive\nproofs one can, at least in principle, extract algorithms that compute\nthe elements and simulate the constructions whose existence is\nestablished in the proof. Most forms of constructivism are compatible\nwith classical mathematics, as they are in general based on a stricter\ninterpretation of the quantifiers and the connectives and the\nconstructions that are allowed, while no additional assumptions are\nmade. The logic accepted by almost all constructive communities is the\nsame, namely intuitionistic logic.  \nMany existential theorems in classical mathematics have a constructive\nanalogue in which the existential statement is replaced by a statement\nabout approximations. We saw an example of this, the intermediate\nvalue theorem, in the section on weak counterexamples above. Large\nparts of mathematics can be recovered constructively in a similar way.\nThe reason not to treat them any further here is that the focus in\nthis entry is on those aspects of intuitionism that set it apart from\nother constructive branches of mathematics. For a thorough treatment\nof constructivism the reader is referred to the corresponding entry in\nthis encyclopedia. \nAlthough Brouwer developed his mathematics in a precise and\nfundamental way, formalization in the sense as we know it today was\nonly carried out later by others. Indeed, according to Brouwer’s\nview that mathematics unfolds itself internally, formalization,\nalthough not unacceptable, is unnecessary. Others after him thought\notherwise, and the formalization of intuitionistic mathematics and the\nstudy of its meta-mathematical properties, in particular of arithmetic\nand analysis, have attracted many researchers. The formalization of\nintuitionistic logic on which all formalizations are based has already\nbeen treated above.  \nHeyting Arithmetic HA as formulated by Arend Heyting\nis a formalization of the intuitionistic theory of the natural numbers\n(Heyting 1956). It has the same non-logical axioms as Peano Arithmetic\nPA but it is based on intuitionistic logic. Thus it\nis a restriction of classical arithmetic, and it is the accepted\ntheory of the natural numbers in almost all areas of constructive\nmathematics. Heyting Arithmetic has many properties that reflect its\nconstructive character, for example the Disjunction Property that\nholds for intuitionistic logic too. Another property of\nHA that PA does not share is the\nnumerical existence property: (\\(\\overline{n}\\) is the numeral\ncorresponding to natural number \\(n\\))  \nThat this property does not hold in PA follows from\nthe fact that PA proves \\(\\exists x (A(x) \\vee\n\\forall y \\neg A(y))\\). Consider, for example, the case that \\(A(x)\\)\nis the formula \\(T(e,e,x)\\), where \\(T\\) is the decidable Kleene\npredicate expressing that \\(x\\) is the code of a terminating\ncomputation of the program with code \\(e\\) on input \\(e\\). If for\nevery \\(e\\) there would exist a number \\(n\\) such that \\({\\bf\nPA}\\vdash T(e,e,n) \\vee \\forall y \\neg T(e,e,y)\\), then by checking\nwhether \\(T(e,e,n)\\) holds it would be decided whether a program \\(e\\)\nterminates on input \\(e\\). This, however, is in general undecidable.\n \nMarkov’s rule is a principle that holds both classically and\nintuitionistically, but only for HA the proof of this\nfact is nontrivial:  \nSince HA proves the law of the excluded middle for\nevery primitive recursive predicate, it follows that for such \\(A\\)\nthe derivability of \\(\\neg\\neg \\exists x A(x)\\) in HA\nimplies the derivability of \\(\\exists x A(x)\\) as well. From this it\nfollows that PA is \\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-conservative over\nHA. That is, for primitive recursive \\(A\\):\n\n\\[\n {\\bf PA} \\vdash \\forall x \\exists y A(x,y) \n \\Rightarrow \n {\\bf HA} \\vdash \\forall x \\exists y A(x,y).\n\\]\n\n Thus the class of provably recursive functions of\nHA coincides with the class of provably recursive\nfunctions of PA, a property that, on the basis of the\nideas underlying constructivism and intuitionism, may not come as a\nsurprise.  \nThe formalization of intuitionistic mathematics covers more than\narithmetic. Large parts of analysis have been axiomatized from a\nconstructive point of view (Kleene 1965, Troelstra 1973). The\nconstructivity of these systems can be established using functional,\ntype theoretic, or realizability interpretations, most of them based\non or extensions of Gödel’s Dialectica interpretation\n(Gödel 1958, Kreisel 1959), Kleene realizability (Kleene 1965),\nor type theories (Martin-Löf 1984). In these interpretations the\nfunctionals underlying constructive statements, such as for example\nthe function assigning a \\(y\\) to every \\(x\\) in \\(\\forall x\\exists y\nA(x,y)\\), are made explicit in various ways. \nIn (Scott 1968 and 1970), a topological model for the second-order\nintuitionistic theory of analysis is presented where the reals are\ninterpreted as continuous functions from Baire space into the\nclassical reals. In this model Kripke’s Schema as well as\ncertain continuity axioms hold. In (Moschovakis 1973), this method is\nadapted to construct a model of theories of intuitionistic analysis in\nterms of choice sequences. Also in this model Kripke’s Schema\nand certain continuity axioms hold. In (Van Dalen 1978) Beth models\nare used to provide a model of arithmetic and choice sequences that\nsatisfy choice schemata, instances of weak continuity and\nKripke’s Schema. In this model the domains at every node are the\nnatural numbers, so that one does not have to use nonstandard models,\nas in the case of Kripke models. Moreover, the axioms\nCS1–3 of the creating subject can be\ninterpreted in it, thus showing this theory to be consistent.  \nThere exist axiomatizations of the lawless sequences, and they all\ncontain extensions of the continuity axioms (Kreisel 1968, Troelstra\n1977). In particular in the form of the Axiom of Open Data stating\nthat for \\(A(\\alpha)\\) not containing other nonlawlike parameters\nbesides \\(\\alpha\\):  \nIn (Troelstra 1977), a theory of lawless sequences is developed (and\njustified) in the context of intuitionistic analysis. Besides axioms\nfor elementary analysis it contains, for lawless sequences,\nstrengthened forms of the axioms of open data, continuity,\ndecidability and density (density says that every finite sequence is\nthe initial segment of a lawless sequence). What is especially\ninteresting is that in these theories quantifiers over lawless\nsequences can be eliminated, a result that can also be viewed as\nproviding a model of lawlike sequences for such theories. Other\nclassical models of the theory of lawless sequences have been\nconstructed in category theory in the form of sheaf models (van der\nHoeven and Moerdijk 1984). In (Moschovakis 1986), a theory for choice\nsequences relative to a certain set of lawlike elements is introduced,\nalong with a classical model in which the lawless sequences turn out\nto be exactly the generic ones. \nThe Creating Subject, introduced in Section 2.2, can generate choice\nsequences, which are some of the most important and complicated\nmathematical entities of Brouwer’s Intuitionism. Several\nphilosophers and mathematicians have tried to develop the theory of\nthe Creating Subject further mathematically as well as\nphilosophically.  \nIn the formalization of the notion of the Creating Subject its\ntemporal aspect is formalized using the notation \\(\\Box_n A\\), that\ndenotes that the Creating Subject has a proof of A at time n (in some\nother formulations: experiences the truth of \\(A\\) at time \\(n\\)).\nGeorg Kreisel (1967) introduced the following three axioms for the\nCreating Subject, which taken together are denoted by CS: \nIn the version of Anne Troelstra (1969) the last axiom is strengthened\nto  \nThe first axiom CS1 is uncontroversial: at any point in time,\nit can be established whether the Creating Subject has a proof of a\ngiven statement or not. The second axiom CS2 clearly uses the\nfact that the Creating Subject is an idealization since it expresses\nthat proofs will always be remembered. The last axiom CS3 is\nthe most disputed part of the formalization of the Creating Subject,\nor better, its second conjunct \\((A \\rightarrow \\neg\\neg\\exists n\\Box_n A)\\)\nis, which was given the name Axiom of Christian Charity by\nKreisel. Göran Sundholm (2014), for example, argues that Axiom of\nChristian Charity is not acceptable from a constructive point of view.\nAnd Gödel’s incompleteness theorem even implies that the\nprinciple is false when \\(\\Box_n A\\) would be interpreted as being\nprovable in a sufficiently strong proof system, which, however, is\ncertainly not the interpretation that Brouwer had in mind.  \nGiven a statement \\(A\\) that does not contain any reference to time,\ni.e. no occurrence of \\(\\Box_n\\), one can define a choice sequence\naccording to the following rule (Brouwer 1953):  \nFrom this follows the principle known as Kripke’s Schema\nKS, introduced in Section 2.2, a principle that unlike the\naxioms of the theory of the Creating Subject, contains no explicit\nreference to time: \\(\\exists \\alpha (A \\leftrightarrow \\exists n\n\\alpha(n) = 1)\\). \nUsing Kripke’s Schema, the weak counter example arguments can be\nexpressed formally without any reference to the Creating Subject. The\nfollowing example is taken from (van Atten 2018). Let A be a statement\nfor which at present \\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg\\neg A\\) is not known to hold.\nUsing KS one obtains choice sequences \\(\\alpha_1\\) and\n\\(\\alpha_2\\) such that  \nAssociate with these two sequences the real numbers \\(r_0\\) and\n\\(r_1\\), where for \\(i=0,1\\):  \nThen for \\(r=r_0 + r_1\\), statement \\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg\\neg A\\) is\nimplied by \\((r\\gt 0\\vee r\\lt 0)\\), which shows that \\((r\\gt 0\\vee\nr\\lt 0)\\) cannot be proved.  \nIn (van Dalen 1978) a model is constructed of the axioms for the\nCreating Subject in the context of arithmetic and choice sequences,\nthus proving them to be consistent with intuitionistic arithmetic and\ncertain parts of analysis. In (van Dalen 1982), CS is proven to\nbe conservative over Heyting Arithmetic. Mathematical consequences of\nKripke’s Schema can be found in (van Dalen 1997), where it is\nshown that KS and the continuity axioms reject Markov’s\nprinciple, while KS together with Markov’s principle\nimplies the principle of the excluded middle.  \nKripke has shown that KS implies the existence of nonrecursive\nfunctions, a result not published by him but by Kreisel (1970).\nClearly, this implies that the theory CS also implies the\nexistence of a nonrecursive function. A possible argument for\nCS runs as follows. Suppose \\(X\\) is a noncomputable but\ncomputably enumerable set and define the function \\(f\\) as\nfollows: \nThen it follows that \\(n\\not\\in X\\) if and only if \\(f(m,n)=1\\) for\nsome natural number \\(m\\), which implies that \\(f\\) cannot be\ncomputable. For if so, the complement of \\(X\\) would be computably\nenumerable, implying the computability of \\(X\\). Since \\(f\\) is a\nfunction from the intuitionistic point of view, this establishes that\nin Intuitionism not all functions are computable.  \nFormalizations that are meant to serve as a foundation for\nconstructive mathematics are either of a set-theoretic (Aczel 1978,\nMyhill 1975) or type-theoretic (Martin-Löf 1984) nature. The\nformer theories are adaptations of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to a\nconstructive setting, while in type theory the constructions implicit\nin constructive statements are made explicit in the system. Set theory\ncould be viewed as an extensional foundation of mathematics whereas\ntype theory is in general an intensional one.  \nIn recent years many models of parts of such foundational theories for\nintuitionistic mathematics have appeared, some of them have been\nmentioned above. Especially in topos theory (van Oosten 2008) there\nare many models that capture certain characteristics of intuitionism.\nThere are, for example, topoi in which all total real functions are\ncontinuous. Functional interpretations such as realizability as well\nas interpretations in type theory could also be viewed as models of\nintuitionistic mathematics and most other constructive theories. \nIn reverse mathematics one tries to establish for mathematical\ntheorems which axioms are needed to prove them. In intuitionistic\nreverse mathematics one has a similar aim, but then with respect to\nintuitionistic theorems: working over a weak intuitionistic theory,\naxioms and theorems are compared to each other. The typical axioms\nwith which one wishes theorems to compare are the fan principle and\nthe bar principle, Kripke’s schema and the continuity\naxioms. \nIn (Veldman 2011), equivalents of the fan principle over a basic\ntheory called Basic Intuitionistic Mathematics are studied. It is\nshown that the fan principle is equivalent to the statement that the\nunit interval [0,1] has the Heine-Borel property, and from this many\nother equivalents are derived. In (Veldman 2009), the fan principle is\nshown to also be equivalent to Brouwer’s Approximate Fixed-Point\nTheorem. In (Lubarsky et al. 2012), reverse mathematics is applied to\na form of Kripke’s schema, which is shown to be equivalent to\ncertain topological statements. \nThere are many more of such examples from intuitionistic reverse\nmathematics. Especially in the larger field of constructive reverse\nmathematics there are many results of this nature that are also\nrelevant from the intuitionistic point of view. \nBrouwer build his Intuitionism from the ground up and did\nnot comment much on the relation between Intuitionism and other\nexisting philosophies, but others after him did. Some of these\nconnections are discussed in this section, in particular the way in\nwhich intuitionistic principles can be justified in terms of other\nphilosophies. \nThe connection between Intuitionism and Phenomenology, the philosophy\ndeveloped by Edmund Husserl, has been investigated by several authors,\nduring Brouwer’s lifetime as well as decades later. Hermann Weyl\nwas among the first to discuss the relation between Brouwer’s\nideas and the phenomenological view on mathematics. Like Brouwer, Weyl\nspeaks in his book Das Kontinuum (Chapter 2) about the\nintuitive continuum, but Weyl’s notion is based on the\nphenomenology of (the consciousness of) time. Weyl later feels that\nBrouwer’s development of real analysis is more faithful to the\nidea of the intuitive continuum than his own (Weyl 1921) and therefore\nplaces himself at Brouwer’s side, at least regarding this aspect\n(van Atten 2002). \nVan Atten (2003 en 2007) uses phenomenology to justify choice\nsequences as mathematical objects. The author (2002) is critical about\nBrouwer’s justification of choice sequences, which is the motive\nto look for a philosophical justification elsewhere. Choice sequences\noccur in the work of Becker (1927) and Weyl, but they differ from\nBrouwer’s notion, and Husserl never discussed choice sequences\npublicly. Van Atten explains how the homogeneity of the\ncontinuum accounts for its inexhaustibility and nonatomicity, two key\nproperties of the intuitive continuum according to Brouwer. Using the\nfact that these two essential properties are present in the definition\nof choice sequences, one arrives at a phenomenological justification\nof them.  \nOn March 10, 1928, Brouwer lectured in Vienna on his intuitionistic\nfoundations of mathematics. Ludwig Wittgenstein attended that lecture,\npersuaded by Herbert Feigl, who afterwards wrote about the hours he\nspent with Wittgenstein and others after the lecture: a great\nevent took place. Suddenly and very volubly Wittgenstein began talking\nphilosophy – at great length. Perhaps this was the turning\npoint, for ever since that time, 1929, when he moved to Cambridge\nUniversity, Wittgenstein was a philosopher again, and began to exert a\ntremendous influence. \nOthers dispute that Brouwer’s lecture influenced\nWittgenstein’s thinking (Hacker 1986, Hintikka 1992, Marion\n2003). In how far, if at all, Wittgenstein was influenced by\nBrouwer’s ideas is not entirely clear, but there certainly are\ninteresting agreements and disagreements between their views. Marion\n(2003) argues that Wittgenstein’s conception of mathematics as\ndescribed in the Tractatus is very close to that of Brouwer, and that\nWittgenstein agrees with the rejection of the Law of Excluded Middle\n(1929 manuscript, pp 155–156 in Wittgenstein 1994) but disagrees\nwith Brouwer’s arguments against it. Marion (2003) claims that\nWittgenstein’s stance is more radical than Brouwer’s in\nthat in the former’s view the lack of validity of the Law of\nExcluded Middle in mathematics is a distinguishing feature of all\nmathematical propositions (as opposed to empirical propositions) and\nnot only a particularity of the mathematics of the infinite, as it is\nfor Brouwer. \nVeldman (forthcoming) discusses several points of (dis)agreement between\nBrouwer and Wittgenstein, such as the danger of logic, which,\naccording to both, may lead to constructions without mathematical\ncontent. One of the disagreements raised in the paper concerns\nWittgenstein’s view that mathematics is a common undertaking,\nwhich is in stark contrast to Brouwer’s Creating Subject and his\nview that mathematics is a languageless activity.  \nThe British philosopher Michael Dummett (1975) developed a\nphilosophical basis for Intuitionism, in particular for intuitionistic\nlogic. Dummett explicitly states that his theory is not an exegesis of\nBrouwer’s work, but a possible philosophical theory for (in his\nwords) repudiating classical reasoning in mathematics in favor of\nintuitionistic reasoning. \nDummett’s approach starts with the idea that the choice for one\nlogic over another must necessarily lie in the meaning one attaches to\nlogical statements. In the theory of meaning that Dummett uses, which\nis based on Wittgenstein’s ideas about language and in\nparticular on his idea that meaning is use, the meaning of a\nsentence is determined by the way in which the sentence is used. The\nmeaning of a mathematical statement manifests itself in the use made\nof it, and the understanding of it is the knowledge of the\ncapacity to use the statement. This view is supported by the way in\nwhich we acquire mathematical knowledge. When we learn a mathematical\nnotion we learn how to use it: how to compute it, prove it or infer\nfrom it. And the only way to establish that we have grasped the\nmeaning of a mathematical statement lies in our proficiency in making\ncorrect use of the statement.  \nGiven this view on meaning, the central notion in the theory of\nmeaning for mathematics is not, as in Platonism, truth, but\nproof; the understanding of a mathematical statement consists\nin the ability to recognize a proof of it when one is presented with\none. This then, as Dummett argues, leads to the adoption of\nintuitionistic logic as the logic of mathematical reasoning.  \nInterestingly, as Dummett (1975) remarks himself, his theory of\nmeaning is far apart from Brouwer’s ideas on mathematics as an\nessentially languageless activity. So that there are at least two\nquite different lines of thought that lead to the adoption of\nintuitionistic logic over classical logic, the one developed by\nBrouwer and the one argued for by Dummett. Dummett’s work on\nIntuitionism has been commented on by various philosophers such as Dag\nPrawitz (1977), Parsons (1986) and Richard Tieszen (1994 en 2000).  \nVarious forms of Finitism are based on a similar view as the\none expressed by Dummett, but in which the constructions that are\nallowed to prove mathematical statements are required to exist not\nonly in principle, but also in practice. Depending on the the precise\nimplementation of the latter notion one arrives at different forms of\nFinitism, such as the Ultra-Intuitionism developed by\nAlexander Yessenin-Volpin (1970) and the Strict Finitism\ndeveloped by Crispin Wright (1982).","contact.mail":"R.Iemhoff@uu.nl","contact.domain":"uu.nl"}]
