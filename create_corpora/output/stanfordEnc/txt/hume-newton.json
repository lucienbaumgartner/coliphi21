Hume’s\nself-described “experimental method” (see the subtitle to\nTreatise) and the resemblance of his “rules of\nreasoning” (THN\n 1.3.15)[1]\n with Newton’s are said to be evidence for this position (Noxon\n1973; Stroud 1977; de Pierris 2002; Penelhum 2000; Bennett 2001;\nBeebee 2006; Hazony 2014; Demeter 2016 etc.). Hume encourages this\nview of his project by employing Newtonian metaphors: he talks of an\n“attraction” in the “mental world” on a par\nwith that in the “natural world” (THN 1.1.4.6). Hume\ninfers the existence of “habits” as a kind of mental\n“force” (EHU 5.22) analogous to gravity; the discovery of\nthe “the principles of association”, which in the Abstract\nhe calls his most important achievement (see the\n section on association in the entry on Hume),\n are, then, analogous to the laws of motion. Hume certainly appears to\nwant his readers to feel that he is modeling his project on the\nsuccesses of natural philosophy, exemplified by Newton. In the\n“Introduction” to the Treatise and even more\nexplicitly in the opening pages of Enquiry (EHU 1.15), Hume\nsuggests that his “science of man” can parallel recent\nachievements in natural philosophy (with rather obvious nods to\nNewton’s successes in planetary astronomy). And at the start of\nEPM (1.10), he echoes Newton’s rejection of\n“hypotheses”, and restates his allegiance to the\nexperimental method in contrast with its speculative alternative (on\nthe contrast see Anstey 2005). There is, thus, no doubt that Hume\nwants his readers to believe that Newton forms a kind of model.\n\n\nYet, in the totality of Hume’s oeuvre the technical details of\nNewton’s philosophy are rarely discussed explicitly. In fact,\nsome of the most sophisticated analyses of the implications of\nNewton’s philosophy are attributed to Cleanthes, the\nspokesperson for the inductive argument from design in the\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Dialogues).\nWhile in recent years many commentators have come to doubt that Philo\nshould be considered a straightforward spokesperson of Hume’s\nviews, few suggest that Hume endorses without qualification\nCleanthes’s Newtonian argument from design—the foundations\nof which are undermined throughout Hume’s writings (e.g., Harris\n2015: 447ff). But this raises further complications because Hume can\nbe read as implying that criticism of the design argument can be\ngenerated on strictly Newtonian methodological grounds: the authority\nof “experience”—to which Hume and Newton both\nappeal—does not license an inference (supported by analogical\nreasoning) to a God-like designer of the universe. This would make\nHume something of an internal critic of Newtonianism (Hurlbutt 1985).\nThe same strategy—generate internal criticism to Newtonian\nnatural philosophy—may be thought to operate in Hume’s\nEmpiricist attack on the putative meaningfulness of invisible or\ntheoretical entities (e.g., forces, powers, and masses) that made him\na favorite of Logical Positivists early in the twentieth century (see\nthe entry on\n Alfred Jules Ayer).\n This Positivist interpretation seemed to go well with Hume’s\nreputation for skepticism. Yet, as Positivism gave way to Naturalism\nas the dominant force in twentieth century Anglophone philosophy,\nscholarship on Hume has increasingly emphasized the naturalistic\nelements in Hume, while reinterpreting, even downplaying, his\nskeptical tendencies (Kemp Smith, 1941; Stroud 1977; Garrett 1997).\nBut if by naturalism one (also) means that one is willing to accept\nthe authority of science (see the section on\n Naturalism and Holism in the entry on indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics)\n then one runs into a problem: it is by no means clear that Hume\naccepts the independent intellectual authority of natural philosophers\n(including Newton) to have the final word in interpreting\nNewton’s achievements.\n\n\nBefore, turning to discussion of Hume’s relationship to Newton\nand Newtonianism, one ought to emphasize three problems that beset the\nscholarly literature on this topic. First, much scholarship on Hume is\nstill surprisingly ahistorical; especially among philosophers, it\ntends to favor rational reconstruction of arguments over attention to\nmore contextual forms of interpretation. If such philosophers pay\nattention to historical figures, these tend to be other canonical\nphilosophers: Descartes, Locke, Malebranche, and Berkeley. Second,\neven scholars that emphasize the historical Hume (e.g., Wright 1983;\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997; Winkler 2000) do not tend to exhibit a\nworking knowledge of the details of Newton’s natural philosophy\n(but see Demeter 2016; Slavov 2016; Biener & Schliesser 2014; Belkind 2019). Nearly all of\nthe literature in this genre, most of it quite careful, compares the\ndetails of Hume’s philosophy to evidence from various text-books\n(often “Newtonian”) potentially available to Hume.\nFinally, even the most careful and insightful scholarship on Hume\ntends to ignore the recent scholarly literature generated by the\nrenewed philosophic and historical interest in Newton’s\nphilosophy (Cohen & Smith 2002; see also\n entry on Newton’s philosophy).\n \n\n\n\nThis section analyzes Hume’s relationship to the public Newton\nand other early interpreters of Newton as available to Hume. The\nanalysis reveals that Hume is more critical of and less indebted to\ncore elements of Newton’s philosophy than commonly thought. A\nbenefit of this analysis is that many interpretive debates over how to\nunderstand Hume’s philosophy can be reformulated clearly and\nwith fewer anachronisms. \nHume’s explicit reflections on Newton’s writings and\ncharacter reveal a more ambivalent picture than commonly thought: Hume\nshows respect, even admiration for Newton’s achievements, but he\nalso expresses reservations. Behind this ambivalence one can find\nserious philosophic objections to Newton’s life and project.\nThis section looks, first, at Hume’s brief discussions of\nNewton’s life and achievements and, then, analyzes the aims\nbehind Hume’s “science of man”. \nHume does not doubt the longevity of Newton’s intellectual\nachievement:  \nThe severest scrutiny, which NEWTON’S theory has undergone,\nproceeded not from his own countrymen, but from foreigners; and if it\ncan overcome the obstacles, which it meets with at present in all\nparts of Europe, it will probably go down triumphant to the latest\nposterity. (“Of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and\nSciences”, EMPL 121)  \nBut elsewhere, when Hume comments more directly on Newton, there are\nsigns of ambivalence:  \nWere we to distinguish the Ranks of Men by the Genius and Capacity\nmore than by their Virtue and Usefulness to the Public, great\nPhilosophers would certainly challenge the first Rank, and must be\nplac’d at the Top of human Kind. So rare is this Character,\nthat, perhaps, there has not, as yet, been above two in the World, who\ncan lay a just Claim to it. At least, Galileo and Newton seem to me so\nfar to excel all the rest. (“Of the Middle Station of\nLife”, EMPL 550)  \nAccording to Hume, Newton has unusual philosophic talent. Yet, the\nbackhanded nature of Hume’s compliment is unmistakable.\nNewton’s work is not characterized by its virtue; the\nachievements of Newton’s philosophy are not very useful to the\nrest of mankind. For Hume there is a moral point of view from which\nNewton’s achievements may seem less than entirely\npraiseworthy. \nThis ambivalence about Newton is not an isolated incident in\nHume’s writings. In the last volume of The History of\nEngland, Hume writes: \nIn Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and\nrarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies. From modesty, ignorant of his superiority above the rest of\nmankind; and thence, less careful to accommodate his reasonings to\ncommon apprehensions: More anxious to merit than to acquire fame: He\nwas, from these causes, long unknown to the world; but his reputation\nat last broke out with a lustre, which scarcely any writer, during his\nown life-time, had ever before attained. (HE VI, 542) \nIn this passage, Hume singles out Newton as the “greatest\ngenius” (no mention of Galileo this time). Hume is following\nFontenelle’s interpretation of Newton as a modest genius not\nconcerned with acquiring fame (Fontenelle 1728—see\n Other Internet Resources\n below). But again, Hume’s praise is not entirely\nstraightforward. It turns out that part of Newton’s achievement\nis due to his failure to possess two kinds of self-knowledge: Newton\ndid not understand how much smarter he was than others and Newton did\nnot understand how far removed from ordinary people’s concerns\nhis theories were. Hume implies that if Newton had been more\nself-aware and more attuned to the environment in which he was\nwriting, he would have been more likely to adjust his mode of\nreasoning to public prejudice. On Hume’s account Newton did not\nproperly understand his relationship to his readership and,\nparadoxically, this partly accounts for Newton’s success. It\nseems not to have occurred to Hume that Newton’s mode of\npresentation in the Principia was a deliberate one to avoid\ncontroversy with those who could not follow its intricate geometric\narguments—an intention Newton makes explicit in the introduction\nto Book 3 of the Principia. \nMoreover, Hume thinks that in certain other respects, Newton shares in\nthe superstitious prejudices of his time. This shows another sense in\nwhich Hume’s admiration for Newton’s genius is limited.\nWhile defending the stylistic abilities of King James I, Hume\ncomments:  \n[King James I] has composed a commentary on the Revelations, and\nproved the pope to be Antichrist; may not a similar reproach be\nextended to the famous writer Napier; and even to Newton, at a time\nwhen learning was much more advanced than during the reign of James?\nFrom the grossness of its superstitions, we may infer the ignorance of\nan age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an\nindividual, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated by the\nappearance of religion. (HE V, 155)  \nHowever, Hume did not doubt Newton’s religious sincerity:  \nIt is for the same reason, I maintain, that Newton, Locke, Clarke,\netc. being Arians or Socinians, were very sincere in the creed they\nprofest: And I always oppose this argument to some libertines, who\nwill needs have it, that it was impossible, but that these\nphilosophers must have been hypocrites. (NHR 12.23n78) \nThus, Hume has no doubts about the intellectual quality of\nNewton’s achievements. His reservations are moral even\ntheological in nature. One can distinguish these along a private and a\npublic dimension. Hume thinks that Newton’s life reveals a man\nwith genuine limitations in understanding (let alone transcending)\nhimself and his times. Hume calls into question the moral quality of\nNewton’s works because they do not serve the public interest and\nthey, and the Newtonians that follow him, are infected with\nsuperstitious beliefs (this line of argument is pursued more fully in\nRussell 2008). While Hume’s criticism of Newton as a man are\nrevealing of Hume’s understanding of what it is to be a\nphilosopher, Hume’s criticism of the purpose behind\nNewton’s project ties directly to the anti-Newtonian aims of\nHume’s “science of man”. This project is viewed by\nmany contemporary scholars, who emphasize Hume’s\n“naturalism”, as Hume’s equivalent of what one today\nwould call “cognitive science” (Garrett 1997). \nWhile Hume admits that Newton was the “greatest genius”\nthat “ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies”, he is unwilling to acknowledge Newton’s\n“Virtue” or “Usefulness to the Public”.\nMoreover, Newton’s project lends cover for gross\n“superstition”. Instead, in the “Introduction”\nto the Treatise, Hume offers an ambitious alternative\nproject: his “science of man”. (In EHU 1.12 he calls it a\n“true metaphysics”, which battles “abstruse\nphilosophy and metaphysical jargon…mixed up with popular\nsuperstition”. Given Hume’s criticism of Newton, he may\nhave Newton in mind here.) Hume emphasizes the foundational nature of\nthis project: \nThere is no question of importance, whose decision is not comprised in\nthe science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any\ncertainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In\npretending, therefore, to explain the principles of human nature, we\nin effect propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can\nstand with any security. (THN “Introduction”, see Boehm\n2016) \nThe success of Hume’s systematic “science of man”\nhas a positive and a negative component. On the positive side,  \nIn these four sciences of Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics\n[i.e., political economy], is comprehended almost everything, which it\ncan any way import us to be acquainted with, or which can tend either\nto the improvement or ornament of the human mind.  \nHume makes it absolutely clear where his priorities are:  \nNor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of\nman will do less honour to our native country than the former in\nnatural philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory,\nupon account of the greater importance of that science, as well as the\nnecessity it lay under of such a reformation.  \nIn short, according to Hume his “science of man” is far\nmore valuable than Newton’s natural philosophy. This is why Hume\nends the “Introduction” to the Treatise with the\nclaim that  \nwe may hope to establish…a science [of man], which will not be\ninferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility to any\nother of human comprehension. \nMoreover, the content of the “science of man” reveals that\neven the very Newtonian sciences of  \nMathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some\nmeasure dependent on the science of MAN; since they lie under the\ncognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties.\n(THN “Introduction”)  \nFor Hume the “science of man” is the\n“foundational” science because it is presupposed to some\ndegree by all the other sciences (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016; Boehm 2016, 2019). \nThe details of Hume’s “science of man” show the\nweakness of our ordinary cognitive capacity; at the same time it\noffers an argument for staying within confines of (potential) ordinary\nexperience. Hume’s cognitive science has a normative consequence\nin that knowledge of it is supposed to reduce the inclination toward\nintellectual overreaching. For, the practitioners of “mitigated\nscepticism” (cf. the “modest scepticism” of\n“Appendix” to the Treatise) will not  \nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations. (EHU 12.3.25)  \nHume’s “science of man” constrains the extent of our\ntheorizing. In subsequent sections it will be illustrated how Hume\nreinterprets the limits and content of Newtonian natural philosophy in\nlight of his “science of man” or “true\nmetaphysics”. \nThere is surprisingly little direct evidence of Hume’s knowledge\nof Newton’s texts. Most of it is circumstantial. Recent archival\nand careful hermeneutic research by Michael Barfoot (1990) has\nincreased our knowledge of the kind of education in different elements\nof natural philosophy Hume would have received as a student at\nEdinburgh (see also Emerson 2009; Stewart 2005; Wright 1990). This\nusefully supplements what can be gleaned from Hume’s writings\nand letters. While new material may show up one day, four important\nconclusions follow from his study. \nFirst, it is very likely that Hume was exposed to many works in the\nnew natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics in Europe and\nBritain. Second, while Hume was a student, Boyle’s writings and\nmethodology were emphasized at The University of Edinburgh. It appears\nthat Boyle was favored as the pre-eminent exemplar of modern natural\nphilosophy because of the theological uses of this form of knowledge\nin eighteenth century natural religion. Given the tenor of the\neducation at Edinburgh and evidence derived from Hume’s oeuvre,\nit is very likely that Hume had a working knowledge of Boyle’s\nhydrostatics. Besides, if Hume’s project aims at an account of\nhidden processes underlying observed regularities (as Landy 2017\nsuggests), as opposed to inductively establishing those regularities,\nthen Hume’s project is consonant with much of Boyle’s (see\nSargent 1995). \nSecond, while at the Jesuit College at La Flèche\n(1735–37) Hume was certainly exposed to Cartesian and\nMalebranchian ideas (Perinetti 2018), and some of his most influential\narguments, concerning, e.g., causation and natural theology had their\norigins in this intellectual environment. Some commentators (e.g.,\nWright 2009: 51ff) have argued that the proper interpretation of\nHume’s methodological aspirations and his account of the mind\nshould spring primarily from this Cartesian and Malebranchian\ncontext. \nThird, Hume would have been reasonably familiar with Newton’s\nOpticks, especially his writings on colors. It is less clear\nhow thorough his working knowledge of it was (see Schliesser 2004 for\nsome concerns). However, it is less likely that he was exposed to most\nof the technically challenging parts of Principia. As the\ncatalogue at La Flèche testifies, there was four entries\ndirectly related to Newton, of which only one, a 1720 French edition\nof Newton’s Opticks (but no edition of\nPrincipia), refers to an edition that could have been there\nduring Hume’s stay (Perinetti 2018: 51). Moreover, if Hume never\nread the third edition of the Principia, then this could help\nexplain his lack of interest in Newton’s fourth rule of\nreasoning which was added to the third edition (see\n section 4.5,\n Rules of Reasoning). \nFourth, it remains unclear how proficient Hume became in mathematics.\nThere is manuscript evidence that he attended George Campbell’s\nextramural lectures on\n fluxions.[2]\n These notes require careful study, but Barfoot reports that these\nmanuscripts show “little evidence of the application of fluxions\nto natural philosophy as such” (1990: 190 fn76). Barfoot is\ncorrect to suggest that Hume’s treatment of mathematics shows\ndebts to Berkeley’s criticism of Newton. There is less evidence\nfor Barfoot’s claim that Hume would have had working knowledge\nof the most technical parts of the Principia. \nIt is likely that Hume did get to know the relevant editions of\nOpticks already during his years spent at the University of\nEdinburgh, and may well have been exposed to lectures on it as well,\nbut it is uncertain how reliable his working knowledge of it was\n(Barfoot 1990, esp. 158 and 152). Although in general he was\ndissatisfied with university education, at least he found some\nsatisfaction in his natural philosophy class taught by Robert Steuart\n(Stewart 2005: 21–25). A probably more important introduction to\nthe outlook that has spread due to the influence of the\nOpticks came from Hume’s medical readings in relation\nto his mental breakdown at the age of 18. The most important document\nof this struggle is his 1734 “Letter to a Physician”\n(Letters 1:14–18.), in which the medical description of\nhis condition, as M.A. Stewart (2005: 24n48) puts it, “seems to\nbe consciously modelled on George Cheyne’s The English\nMalady”, published in 1733. A similarly likely source is\nMandeville’s Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick\nDiseases (1st ed. 1711, 2nd ed. 1730, see\nWright 2009: 8–9). In his latter life he probably benefitted\nfrom discussions with philosophical friends and colleagues, most\nnotably with William Cullen and Joseph Black, these discussions,\nhowever, came only after the publication of Hume’s chief\nphilosophical works. These friendships were indeed philosophical in\nthe sense that they were founded, at least partly, on sympathies for\nHume’s philosophical project (see, e.g., Hume’s letter to\nCullen in Letters 1:163) \nIt should be emphasized, however, that archival evidence may radically\nchange our picture of Hume’s formal education and continuing\ninterest in Newton’s natural philosophy. In addition to the\nmanuscript mentioned above, known marginal notes in Hume’s hand\nin a copy of the Edinburgh Review, where works in Newtonian\nnatural philosophy were reviewed, may reveal further evidence about\nthe nature and quality of his response to issues in Newtonian natural\n philosophy.[3] \nIn The History of England, Hume writes about Newton’s\nresearch methodology as follows:  \nthere flourished during this period a Boyle and a Newton: men who trod\nwith cautious, and therefore the more secure steps, the only road\nwhich leads to true philosophy…[Newton is] cautious in\nadmitting no principles but such as were founded on experiment; but\nresolute to adopt every such principle, however new or unusual. (HE\nVI, 542)  \nWhile this is rather terse, Hume calls attention to three important\nelements in Newton’s natural philosophy: (a) Newton’s\ncommitment to an experimental method; (b) the cautious nature of\nNewton’s methodology; (c) Newton’s boldness once\nexperiments have established a “principle”. In eighteenth\ncentury terminology, a “principle” is akin to what we\nwould call a “law” or a “fundamental/causal\nexplanation”. In order to avoid misunderstanding, Hume equates\nNewton’s methodology with Boyle’s only on points (a) and\n(b), not point (c). Moreover, Hume is aware (as will be shown in\n section 4.1)\n that Newton rightly rejected Boyle’s conception of mechanism.\nSo, Hume admires Newton’s methodology, and sees it as a source\nof progress. \nSo, for Hume, Newton uses experiment to arrive at explanations. Thus,\nhe seems to echo and accept Newton’s claim about\n“hypotheses non fingo” (see the relevant section\nin the\n entry on Newton).\n Once such “principles” or explanations have been arrived\nat experimentally, Hume sees Newton as adopting them boldly, even if\nthey are unusual or surprising. Hume appears to have assimilated the\nimportance of Newton’s third rule of reasoning (see\n section 4.5\n below). Moreover, Hume is discerning the (broad) outlines of\nNewton’s commitment to the method of analysis and synthesis\n(Newton’s Opticks, Query 31; for discussion, see\n section 4.7).\n But in Hume’s account there is no mention of the importance of\nmathematics in Newton’s methodology (see\n section 4.6).\n Hume lack of interest in this aspect of Newton’s methodology\nmay be a consequence of his education (see\n section 2). \nNevertheless, Hume’s interpretation of the status of\n“principles” makes him deviate from Newton’s\nmethodology in a fundamental fashion. In the Treatise, he\nuses the “science of man” to claim it is “beyond the\nreach of human understanding” to “penetrate into the\nnature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their\noperations”. He cannot “approve” of the ambition to\ngo beyond knowing bodies by their external properties (THN 1.2.5.25).\nThis contradicts the final paragraph of the “General\nScholium” of the Principia, where Newton promises a\nprogram of research, perhaps inspired by the success of Francis\nHauksbee’s electrical experiments, to penetrate into the nature\nof matter. Although this program was by no means finished by the time\nof Newton’s death, Newton’s optical research had revealed,\nfor example, that light has an internal constitution characterized by\nthe proportions, in it, of the distinct homogeneal (or\n“uniform”) kinds, which have different degrees of\nrefrangibility (Schliesser 2004). \nTo see why Hume cannot “approve”, going beyond external\nproperties of bodies, let us take a brief detour through some core\nelements of Hume’s epistemology. For Hume, we build up our\ncausal theories from experience of particular events (see, for\ninstance, the demands at THN 1.3.14.6–15 and also the footnote\nat EHU 11.26). This is an important constraint for Hume because it\nallows him to ask who has ever perceived an instance of a power or\nforce in action. This is crucial for Hume’s attack on\ntheoretical and invisible entities. \nFor Hume all our simple ideas are derived from impressions (THN\n1.2.3.2–3). Hume’s attacks on notions of substance, mode,\nessence, force, power, self, and—of course—God, all rely\non his rhetorically powerful ability to ask to what impression such\nnotions can be traced (e.g., THN 1.1.6; 1.2.5.28; 1.4.14, and\n1.4.5.3–4; on idea of God, see EHU 2.6). For, “[I]deas\nalways represent the objects or impressions, from which they are\nderived” (THN 1.2.3.11). In the scholarly literature, this has\nbecome known as the “copy principle” (Garrett 1997:\nchapter 2). If no such objects or impressions are to be found, then\none must conclude that such ideas are the product of “passions\nand emotions” (THN 1.1.6.1), a “trivial suggestion of the\nfancy” (THN 1.4.7.6), or “some imperfection in [the]\nfaculties [of mind]” (THN 1.1.7.8). The thrust of Hume’s\naccount is to make talk of, say, substance or force (power, God, etc.)\nseem either meaningless or restricted to the particular qualities of\nbodies from which the idea is derived (THN 1.1.6.1; EHU 4.2.16). At\nbest, they have reference to “an effect, or some other event\nconstantly conjoined with” the cause (EHU 7.2.29; for a more\ndetailed account, see the entry on Hume   ).\n Thomas Reid, who saw what was at stake, described the strategy as\n“a tribunal of inquisition erected by certain modern\nphilosophers before which every thing in nature must answer”\n(An Inquiry into the Human Mind: or the Principles of Common\nSense, Chapter 6, Section VIII).     \nHume’s “science of man” will not permit a realist\ninterpretation of forces as real causes (see, for different arguments,\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997). When the sciences talk about forces or\npowers, these words must be reinterpreted (for example, the note to\nEHU, 4.2.16 tells us to look for this in section 7 of EHU). According\nto Hume, word’s like “force” and “power”\nhave, at best, a reference to “an effect, or some other\nevent”. And  \nForce, Power, Energy…[these] words, as commonly used, have very\nloose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very uncertain and\nconfused. (EHU 7.2.29; cf. THN 1.3.14.27)  \nHume denies here the fundamental achievement of the\n Principia.[4]\n Rather, he offers a reinterpretation of Newton (Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016). \nThis is made very clear by his addition to the Treatise: I\nmust, he writes,  \nconfine our speculations to the appearances of objects to our senses,\nwithout entering into disquisitions concerning their real nature and\noperations.  \nHume is willing to grant that Newton has experimentally discovered\nvarious “principles”. But given Hume’s aversion to\ntalk of forces, it is likely that he thinks these principles must be\nunderstood at best as a means to keep track of the phenomena. This is,\nin fact, for Hume the  \nNewtonian philosophy … rightly understood …\nNothing is more suitable to that philosophy, than a modest skepticism\nto a certain confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human\ncapacity. (THN 1.2.5.26n12; emphasis in original)  \nIn context, Hume re-describes the Newtonian commitment to a vacuum. So\nwhen, elsewhere, Hume describes the “philosopher” [i.e.,\nNewton] who had “determined the laws and forces, by which the\nrevolutions of the planets are governed and directed”, (EHU 1.8)\nhis language of “forces” must be interpreted in light of\nhis deflationary commitments. \nOne may think that Hume’s use of “Newtonian\nphilosophy” in the addition to the Treatise suggests\nthat Hume has described Newton’s natural philosophy as Newton\nunderstood it (as understood by Hume). But this is not likely because\nelsewhere he writes,  \nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at the end of EHU\n7.1.25: a note on Hume’s Terminology: God is the “first\ncause;” “second causes” are ordinary finite causes\nthat operate in nature)  \nSo, first, Hume’s Newton accepts some real causes in nature;\nHume’s Newton is neither a skeptic about causation nor an\noccasionalist (Leibniz had raised this concern in his exchange with\nClarke). Second, Hume is careful to distinguish Newton from the\nNewtonians (for more evidence on this, see\n section 4.2). \nThus, a more likely interpretation is that Hume believes he has\noffered a prescriptive interpretation of how Newtonian philosophy\nshould be viewed in light of the results of his “science of\nman” (which shows the limitations of our cognitive capacity),\nand his restrictive form of Empiricism which contribute to his\n“modest” (or “mitigated”) skepticism. Hume may\nwell have thought himself as an internal critic or “cautious\nNewtonian”. For Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\nexperience. Nevertheless, the “copy principle” guides how\nHume believes how “experiment” or\n“experience”—authoritative for Newton as well as\nHume—should be analyzed. This may be why Hume claims that Boyle\nand Newton have shown the road to the “true philosophy”,\nnot that they completed it. One way to understand Hume’s\n“science of man” is to see it, then, as the fulfillment of\nthe Newtonian philosophy, “rightly understood”, that is,\nby Hume. \nWhile Hume does not match Berkeley’s detail in offering\narguments or in explaining how to reinterpret Newtonian invisible\nentities, Hume does not accept that we can know that invisible causal\nforces operate in a largely empty universe as anything other than\nuseful means to track the appearances. In fact, there is no room in\nHume’s explanatory model for invisible forces acting as causes.\nThis becomes clear if we reflect on a passage that has received\nintense scrutiny in the context of the problem of induction (which we\nignore for present purposes; for Hume’s skepticism see\n section 4.2): \nWe are determined by custom alone to suppose the future conformable to\nthe past. When I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, my mind\nis immediately carry’d by habit to the usual effect, and\nanticipates my sight by conceiving the second ball in motion. There is\nnothing in these objects, abstractly considered, and independent of\nexperience, which leads me to form any such conclusion: and even after\nI have had experience of many repeated effects of this kind, there is\nno argument, which determines me to suppose, that the effect will be\nconformable to past experience. The powers, by which bodies operate,\nare entirely unknown. We perceive only their sensible qualities: and\nwhat reason have we to think, that the same powers will always be\nconjoined with the same sensible qualities?  \nTis not, therefore, reason, which is the guide of life, but custom.\nThat alone determines the mind, in all instances, to suppose the\nfuture conformable to the past. However easy this step may seem,\nreason would never, to all eternity, be able to make it. (THN Abstract\n15–16) \nHume here is calling attention to the (terse) argument of\nTreatise 1.3.6. Our interest is in his claim that  \n[t]he powers, by which bodies operate, are entirely unknown. We\nperceive only their sensible qualities: and what reason have we to\nthink, that the same powers will always be conjoined with the same\nsensible qualities?  \nIn dialectical context, Hume is here presupposing (i) an explanatory\nmodel familiar from Locke (and Spinoza, Aristotle, Boyle, etc.) in\nwhich hidden powers (insensible qualities) of an entity are (causally)\nresponsible for the sensible qualities. So, it is completely natural\nfor early modern natural philosophers to say that these sensible\nqualities express the essence. These hidden powers may be (part of)\nthe essence of the entity or (as Newton suggests about gravity in the\nthird rule of reasoning) universal qualities of an entity. So,\nHume’s implied targets accept something akin to (i). That is not\ninsignificant because (i) is the main explanatory template of early\nmodern science. \nNow, if one accepts (i), then the problem of induction reveals two\n(related) problems: (a) one concerns the connection among\nsensible qualities, and (b) the other concerns the connection between\nhidden qualities and the visible qualities. So, if one accepts (i),\none might have thought, for example, that routinely (if not\nexception-less) conjoined sensible qualities must always presuppose\nthe same combination of hidden/invisible qualities that produce them.\nSo, one could solve the problem associated with (a) by an appeal to\nhidden qualities. In thinking this one could, in fact, appeal to a\nsame effect/same cause principle of the sort Newton articulates in the\nsecond rule of reasoning: “to the same natural effects we must,\nas far as possible, assign the same causes”. To be sure,\nNewton’s version of the rule recognizes exceptions and is\nclearly regulative (“as far as possible”) and it does not\nrely on (i). Rather, in Newton the rule is a direct consequence of a\nparsimony principle (“admit no more causes of natural things\nthan such as are both true and sufficient to explain their\nappearances”). \nBut as Hume discerns, the explanatory model of (i) lacks resources to\nsecure anything like “same visible effect/same hidden\ncause”. That’s because Hume thinks there is always a\nbarrier in moving from sensible qualities to the structure of hidden\nqualities. (In the literature on Newton, who also rejects (i), this is\ncalled the “transduction problem” since an influential\narticle by McGuire 1970a.) Hume makes this point fully explicit in the\nfirst Enquiry: “he has not, by all his experience,\nacquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power, by which the one\nobject produces the other” (EHU 5.4). \nThis is why Hume’s philosophy of science is so deflationary: all\nany science can show is the relations that obtain among visible\nqualities, and perhaps those that can be represented on an analogy\nwith them (see Landy 2017). These relations can be grouped together\nand given names (“elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse”) and be treated as\n“causes” of the phenomena, but these names do not signify\nor explain features of hidden powers. In Hume’s philosophy of\nscience, science remains at the surface. Hume made the point explicit\nin a note added to the Treatise:  \nIf the Newtonian philosophy be rightly understood it will be found to\nmean no more. A vacuum is asserted: That is, bodies are said to be\nplac’d after such a manner, as to receive bodies betwixt them,\nwithout impulsion or penetration. The real nature of this position of\nbodies is unknown. We are only acquainted with its effects on the\nsenses, and its power of receiving body. (THN 1.2.5.26n12 (App.)) \nThis barrier between visible and hidden qualities/powers is\nindependent of the more fundamental problem of induction that even\nwhen one grasps, in some way, the structure of the hidden qualities\nordinarily responsible for conjunction of sensible qualities, one\ncannot feel secure about their presence and role in any claim one\nmakes about sensible qualities. For, a different set of hidden\nqualities may be responsible for any ordinarily conjoined set of\nsensible qualities. (Hume here discerns the outlines of the problem of\nmultiple realization as a general metaphysical problem.) That, in\naddition, nature may change its course (and so change the\nconfiguration of hidden qualities that produce sensible qualities)\nmeans that the main explanatory framework of early modern science (i)\nis without foundation (see also Belkind 2019). \nIt is often argued that the subtitle of the Treatise,\n“Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into\nMoral Subjects”, shows Hume’s self-conscious debt to\nNewton. Experiments certainly play an important role in Newton’s\nscience. But only after 1712 does Newton refer to his own philosophy\nas “experimental” (in the context of his polemic with\nLeibniz; see Shapiro 2004). In general, Newton emphasizes the\nmathematical nature of his philosophy; he calls attention to this in\nthe full title of the Principia: Mathematical Principles of\nNatural Philosophy. \nHowever one interprets Hume’s “experimental method”,\nit is in no sense mathematical. Hume’s so-called\n“experiments” do not have the tacit logic of Newtonian\nexperiments; they almost never offer measurements (which are very\nimportant for Newton’s focus on successive approximation); they\ndo not connect to a tight mathematical structure (Smith 2002).\nMoreover, by the standards of Newtonian natural philosophy, many of\nHume’s so-called “experiments”, for all their\ningenuity (see, e.g., the eight experiments at THN 2.2.2), have a\nrather simple structure. They are more akin to systematic observations\n(cf. THN I.8, 1.3.8.3, 1.3.12.11, 3.3.1.10). In fact, there is\n(almost) nothing to distinguish Humean “experiment” from\nnormal, daily experience. In Hume the word “experiment”\nseems to be nearly synonymous with “experience”, which is\nnot uncommon in the period. This interpretation is also suggested by\nHume’s description of his experiments as being based on “a\ncautious observation of human life” (THN\n“Introduction”). This is why Hume can claim that  \nexperimental inference and reasoning concerning the actions of others\nenters so much into human life, that no man, while awake, is ever a\nmoment without employing it. (EHU 8.1.17)  \nEven if we allow for some hyperbole, it would betray considerable\nignorance to confuse Newton’s “experimental method”\nwith ordinary human “experimental inference and\nreasoning”. \nSo it is not so much the production of data that makes Hume’s\nmethod experimental rather than his way of “processing”\nthe data gathered in various forms of experiments. This method can be\nreconstructed as a version of analysis and synthesis inspired by\nNewton’s Opticks (see\n section 4.8\n below), that begins with phenomena from the historical and everyday\nobservation of human behavior, and its analysis proceeds by such\n“experiments … judiciously collected and\ncompar’d” (THN I.10), in order to arrive at analogies\namong various instances “from the observation of several\nparallel instances” (EHU 8.13). The products of comparative\nanalysis so conducted are the principles of various faculties, like\nperception, imagination, reason, etc., whose interaction results in\nideas and impressions causing behaviour, but their contribution can\nhardly be measured and the principles of their interaction can hardly\nbe quantified—not even in principle (see also Hume’s\nanti-mathematicism discussed in\n section 4.7).\n So their relations cannot be represented in an algebraic way, in\nterms of relations of quantities, so they cannot be mathematized\neither. Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them. \nThese findings are generalized by induction: “What I discover to\nbe true in some instances, I suppose to be so in all” (THN\n2.1.5.1), and consequently, they are fallible, and the account of\nhuman nature founded on them may be misconstrued (THN 1.2.5.19). Even\nif it is sometimes possible  \nto attain what natural philosophers, after Lord BACON, have affected\nto call the experimentum crucis, or that experiment which points out\nthe right way in any doubt or ambiguity. (EPM 5.17)  \nIt is rarely so. Therefore, inquiry into moral matters is just as\nopen-ended as inquiry into natural matters, and the cure is the same\nhere as there, pretty much as Newton envisaged: it is in further\nenquiry (Smith 2002: 160–161). So, for Hume experimental\nfindings can and need to be further refined by methods that rightly\nbelong to the family of Newtonian successive approximations: by\nexploring exceptions and limitations, or by eliminating superfluous\nconditions in order to identify the efficacious one (Demeter 2019b). One could see this feature\nof Hume’s method as anticipating Mill’s method of\ndifference as much as resembling Newton of Opticks (see\n Section 3.3 of the entry on John Stuart Mill). \nIn our analysis of Hume’s “science of man”, we have\nalready encountered Hume’s claim that we are unable to penetrate\ninto the internal constitution of matter\n (section 3).\n So, however else Hume’s skepticism is understood—and it\nhas been the subject of intense scholarly discussion (including the\nso-called “New Hume” debate, see Read & Richman 2000)\nduring the last three decades—the science of man has skeptical\nimplications with regard to his interpretation of Newton’s\nphilosophy. Hume’s evaluation of Newton is an additional source\nof evidence in understanding the nature of Hume’s skepticism.\nThis evidence reveals that in evaluating Newton’s achievement\nHume is pessimistic about the extent and possibility of knowledge of\nnature. It also shows that Hume rejected important Newtonian\nstandards/criteria in evaluating the claims of natural philosophy. \nIn The History of England, Hume writes: \nBoyle was a great partizan of the mechanical philosophy: a theory,\nwhich, by discovering some of the secrets of nature, and allowing us\nto imagine the rest, is so agreeable to the natural vanity and\ncuriosity of men…While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from\nsome of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the\nimperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her\nultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever\nwill remain. (HE VI, 542; emphasis added) \nThis quote reveals crucial details about Hume’s position in\nthree areas: a) Hume’s understanding of the relative merits of\nNewton’s philosophy and the mechanical philosophy of Boyle; b)\nHume’s attitude toward criteria of intelligibility; c)\nHume’s skepticism. \nFirst, Hume treats Newton’s account as a refutation of the\nmechanical philosophy. Yet, while as we have seen\n (section 3),\n Hume certainly saw it as part of the road to “true\nphilosophy”, he does not view Newton’s achievement as a\ndecisive advance in knowledge of nature but, instead, as decisive\nevidence for the claim that nature will remain unknowable in\nprinciple. Hume understands Newton’s success as a double-edged\nsword: even if Newton removed a source of error and/or enlarged our\nknowledge, he did so at the cost of undermining any hope of\nestablishing what we might call a “final theory” (see the\n entry on physicalism).\n Moreover, it is by no means clear whether Hume is willing to accept\nNewtonian natural philosophy as a form of knowledge. A natural reading\nof the passage is to conclude that Hume views Newton as successfully\n(to use an anachronistic term) falsifying the mechanists’\nprogram, while Hume hedges his bets on offering any evaluation of the\npositive side of Newton’s system (notice also the grudging use\nof “seemed”). \nThe way to make sense of Hume’s remarks in The History of\nEngland is that they reveal that he implicitly accepts the\nMechanists’ insistence—explicitly associated with\nBoyle—that theirs was the only program that offered the\npossibility of intelligible explanation (even if in the hands of many\nof its practitioners it only offered hope of post-facto rational\nreconstruction; see also Hume on Causation in\n section 4.4).\n Hume’s treatment of Boyle reveals that he thought it was a good\nthing Newton falsified the mechanical philosophy. Hume acknowledges\nthat the mechanical philosophy could offer some successful\nexplanations. But he emphasizes that its practitioners were likely to\noverestimate—on psychological and methodological\ngrounds—its potential. Hume appears to have assimilated\nNewton’s devastating criticisms of the mechanical\nphilosophy. \nFurthermore, the passage in The History of England, lends\nsupport for a skeptical interpretation of Hume’s philosophy.\nHume thinks the Newtonian project will enable some knowledge of nature\nat the cost of keeping a “final theory” permanently\nunavailable to human inquiry. Earlier Hume had offered a positive\naccount of the explanatory principles knowable to mankind:  \nElasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by\nimpulse; these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which\nwe shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves\nsufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can\ntrace up the particular phenomena to, or near to, these general\nprinciples. (EHU 4.1.12)  \nLet’s leave aside, for the moment, the ultimate metaphysical\nstatus of “ultimate causes and principles” in Hume’s\nthought. He is willing to accept that some limited set of fundamental\nscientific laws (i.e., “ultimate causes and principles”)\nare available to human researchers. (Hume hedges his bets a bit; note\nhis use of “probably”.) Moreover, these four principles\nare all associated with Newton’s project; the mechanical\nphilosophy had only accepted communication of motion by impulse as an\nexplanatory principle. Of course, Hume treats these laws not so much\nas describing genuine “causes” or “powers” of\nnature, but rather—in opposition to Newton’s own view\nwhich insisted on the reality and causal nature of forces (Janiak\n2007)—as a way to keep track of the appearances (recall\n section 3\n above). \nFinally, these passages show that Hume rules out that we could ever\nhope to explain the causes of these laws (or unify them in some more\nultimate principle). Newton would agree he did not know the cause of\nthese laws (“General Scholium”, Principia), but\nhe would treat it as a question open to further research and\nspeculation. In the context of a discussion of the doctrine of\noccasionalism, Hume shows he is aware of this:  \nSir Isaac Newton (tho’ some of his Followers have taken a\ndifferent Turn of thinking) plainly rejects it, but substituting the\nHypothesis of an Aetheral Fluid, not the immediate Volition of the\nDeity, as the Cause of Attraction. (“A Letter From a Gentleman\nto his Friend in Edinburgh”, THN p. 429)  \nThis quote is revealing in two more ways: besides showing that Hume\nmay have been aware of some of Newton’s attempts at articulating\na mechanism for the operation of attraction (i.e., Newton’s\nletters to Bentley or Boyle; see Newton 2004), Hume recognizes that\nNewton’s followers can deviate from Newton (recall\n section 3). \nIn light of the text of The History of England (VI, 542)\nquoted at the start of this sub-section, it is clear Hume thinks that\nNewton’s laws are not sufficient for explaining all of nature.\nSo without (yet) taking a stance on how to interpret Hume’s\ntreatment of induction or his account of causation, one can\ndistinguish two further strands of Hume’s skepticism: i) Hume\ntreats Newton as showing conclusively that the domain of possible\nknowledge will leave parts of nature unknown forever; ii) in\nparticular, this will include the cause(s) behind our fundamental\nprinciples. The combination of (i–ii) entails that Newtonian\nnatural theology—a very popular eighteenth century intellectual\nenterprise (see the\n entry on natural theology and natural religion)—is\n based on shaky foundations. \nTogether with Hume’s emphasis on accounting for the phenomena in\nhis interpretation of Newtonian philosophy, Hume is far removed from\nNewton’s realist ontology of interacting forces (Janiak 2007;\nSmeenk & Schliesser 2013). Two further sources for this difference\nare revealed when we analyze Hume’s departure from\nNewton’s account of causation\n (§4.4)\n and Newton’s rules of reasoning\n (§4.5). \nOne of Hume’s great claims to fame is his articulation of what\nhas come to be known as the “problem of induction”, or, to\nuse language closer to Hume’s: the problematic status of\ninferences. An informal way to express his insight is that no claim to\nknowledge of matters of fact ought to be thought of as definitive\nbecause in all of our inductive reasoning (or inferences) we\npresuppose that the future will be the same as the past. But we can\nnever be certain that the future will be the same as the past because\nthe evidence for the assumption is based on the uniformity of nature\nin the past. The uniformity of nature is presupposed in our knowledge,\nbut our belief in it cannot be secured by reason. Infamously, Hume\nclaimed the source of the belief is not reason but habit and our\nconfidence in it is derived from instinct (see Millican 1995). While\nthere is ongoing scholarly debate over the extent of Hume’s\nskepticism that follows from this insight, it is less controversial\nthat for Hume knowledge of matters of fact, whatever its ultimate\nstatus in Hume’s thought, is always tentative, subject to\nrevision. This is known as fallibilism. While Hume’s argument\nappears unique to him (although elements of it are prefigured in\nBerkeley and the Dutch Newtonian, Willem ’s Gravesande), the\nposition is anticipated by Newton. \nNewton’s fourth rule of reasoning reads: \nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by\ninduction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena\nmake such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions.\n(Newton 2004, Principia, Book III, Rule IV) \nThe rule is that we should treat well-confirmed propositions as true\n(or nearly true) until there are deviations that promote new research,\nwhich, in turn, lead us to refine our original propositions or reject\nthem for new ones (Smith 2002). But while one has a theory, one must\nnot be distracted by possible differing explanations for the found\nregularities until one has empirical reason. One accepts a theory as\ntrue as a means to developing a better theory. As Newton writes in the\n“Preface” to the Principia, “the principles\nset down here will shed some light on either this mode of\nphilosophizing or some truer one” (emphasis added). Thus, Newton accepts that\nphysical inquiry is forward-looking and may be open-ended; not only\nits theories may evolve, but also its methods. Rule IV implicitly\naccepts that the future may bring surprises and new evidence, and,\nthus, anticipates Hume’s fallibilistic insights. As commentators\non Hume have noted, this strand of Hume’s skepticism is shared\nby Newton. It is less clear if Hume learned it from Newton because\nthere is no evidence that he was acquainted with Newton’s fourth\nrule of reasoning (added to the third edition of the\nPrincipia); there is no equivalent in Hume’s rules of\nreasoning to Newton’s fourth rule. In the section on\nHume’s Rule of Reasoning\n (§4.5),\n the significance of the absence of an equivalent to Newton’s\nrule 4 in Hume’s thought is explored. \nIn\n section 3,\n we saw that Hume rejected Newtonian forces as real causes; he argues\nthat we must reinterpret forces and powers as being ideas about\neffects (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony & Schliesser 2016). In that\nsection no reference to Hume’s widely discussed views on\ncausation was made. In this section Hume’s account of causation\nis analyzed. Given our focus on the Hume-Newton relationship no stance\non the most controversial issue in Hume scholarship are taken: are\ncauses mere (psychological) regularity or are they found in nature.\nHowever, recall that Hume insists that  \nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at EHU 7.1.25)\n \nSo Hume’s Newton accepts some real causes in nature. \nHume’s account of causality covers at least five related issues:\n(1) how we acquire an idea of cause; (2) what we mean by\n“cause;” (3) how we reason about causes; (4) whether\ncauses are in the mind or in nature; (5) how we could infer the\nexistence of causes. In this section, we explore how Hume’s\ntreatment of what we mean by “cause” illustrates\nHume’s critical response to and departure from Newton’s\nphilosophy (see also Schliesser 2007). Hume’s treatment of\ncausation straightforwardly rejects at least two kinds of causes that\nappear in Newton’s philosophy: final causes and simultaneous\ncauses (Schliesser 2009). Moreover, we show that the structure of\nHumean causes is deeply indebted to the Pre-Newtonian mechanical\nphilosophy associated with Boyle. \nHume analyzes how “our” notion of causality—one\napplying to events that are contiguous, exhibit temporal priority of\nthe cause, and have constant conjunction (THN 1.3, Sections 2, 6, and\n15)—is derived from experiencing constant conjunction of objects\nthat produce a union in the imagination (THN 1.3.6.16). Hume’s\naccount is causal in its own terms, that is, his two definitions of\nthe meaning of “cause” (THN 1.3.14.31) are patterned on\nthe chain of events that he thinks lead people to acquire the idea of\ncause. Hume’s analysis is a first approximation of and unifies\nwhat “Moderns” tend to mean by “causation”. In\nhis hands, a redefined version of Aristotelian “efficient\ncausation” is the only kind of causation available for use (THN\n1.3.14.32). There is, thus, a stipulative quality to Hume’s\ndiscussion (see also the treatment of his Rules of Reasoning, THN\n1.3.15 discussed in\n section 4.5).\n One of the tacit targets of Hume’s approach is Newton. For\nHume’s treatment of causation rules out the permissibility of\nNewton’s appeal to “final causes” in the\njustification of the (inductive and probable) argument from design in\nthe “General Scholium” of the Principia:\n“we know [the Deity] only by his most wise and excellent\ncontrivances of things, and final causes” (for discussion, see\nStein 2002). \nMoreover, while Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\n“experience”, there are further serious tensions between\nHume’s account of causation and the contents of Newton’s\nnatural philosophy. For Newton, the behavior of the moon in its orbit\nand that of, say, apples falling on the earth have the same cause:\nnamely, the force of gravity, or weight, towards the earth\n(Principia, Book III, Scholium to Proposition IV, Theorem\nIV). This conflicts with the contiguity requirement, which Hume\nconsiders “essential” to “causation” (THN 1.3.2.6).\nIt is hard to see how contiguity could be made consistent with the\nuniversal nature of attraction. The most distant particles of the\nuniverse attract each other. (The contiguity requirement notably\ndisappears in EHU.) More important, according to Newton the\nacceleration produced by the exercise of a force is simultaneous with\nthat exercise—thus defying temporal priority (Smeenk &\nSchliesser 2013). Hume claims that temporal priority of the cause is\n“of no great importance” (THN 1.3.2.8), yet it appears\nexplicitly or implicitly throughout his treatment of causation. Be\nthat as it may, Hume explicitly attacks the possibility of an effect\nbeing simultaneous with its cause (THN 1.3.2.7–8; Ryan\n2003). \nFinally, there is a fundamental structural similarity between Humean\ncauses and the causes favored by pre-Newtonian Mechanical philosophers\n(i.e., Boyle, Huygens, etc; for a different argument, see McGuire\n1972). They have the same structure: i.e., priority of the cause over\nthe effect, contiguity, and constant conjunction. Now, to be sure,\nHume is aware that Newton decisively refuted the Mechanical\nPhilosophy’s program which insisted that explanations be cast in\nterms of the impact of colliding bodies\n (section 4.2).\n Hume rejects the ontological and explanatory reductionism of the\nMechanical philosophy. Hume introduces eight “rules by which to\njudge of causes and effects” (see\n section 4.5\n below) because it is “possible for all objects to become causes\nor effects to each other” (THN 1.3.15). This is why Hume’s\nlist of “ultimate causes” and “general\nprinciples”—“Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse” (EHU 4.1.12)—is more\ninclusive than the Mechanical philosophy would allow. \nSo, even if we leave aside the controversial question to what degree\nHume would allow the existence and our potential knowledge of real\ncauses in nature (as discussed in the “new Hume” debate),\nhis analysis of what we mean by “cause” is hostile to\nNewtonian natural philosophy. Hume rules out final and simultaneous\ncauses. The former play only a role in Newton’s theology and\nnatural religion, but the latter are an integral part of what we could\nhis “science”. \nConsider these passages: \nIn Treatise 1.3.15, Hume states eight “rules by which\nto judge of causes and effects” (see the block-quote above)\nbecause it is “possible for all objects to become causes or\neffects to each other”. The source of these rules is ambiguous.\nAlthough they “might have been supply’d by the natural\nprinciples of our understanding” (THN 1.3.15.11), Hume provides\nno evidence for this. Nevertheless, Hume thinks it is\n“proper” to employ them in his “reasoning”\n(THN 1.3.15.11; 1.3.15.2). Earlier in the Treatise, he was even more\nadamant about the regulative character of these rules:  \nWe shall afterwards take notice of some general rules, by which we\nought to regulate our judgment concerning causes and effects; and\nthese rules are form’d on the nature of our understanding, and\non our experience of its operations in the judgments we form\nconcerning objects. (emphasis added, THN 1.3.13.11; see de Pierris 2001)  \nSo, while these rules may be derived from reflection on how our minds\nwork or some may be derived “from experience” (THN\n1.3.15.6), they prescribe how we should ascribe causes to\n“objects” in the world, especially in “most of our\nphilosophical reasonings”. But on Hume’s definition of a\ncause (rules 1–3), rules 4–8 are at most useful\nstipulations (Hume uses “to fix” at THN 1.3.15.2) that\nhelp one identify causal relations. This is not the place to resolve\nhow Hume is entitled to the normative character of these rules (see\nMartin 1993). Now we examine these rules and their debt to\nNewton’s. \nThe first three rules define what it is to be cause and effect: as we\nhave seen, they must be contiguous in space and time; the cause must\nbe a prior to the effect; there must a constant union between cause\nand effect (THN 1.3.15.3–5). With the exception of these first\nthree (see\n section 4.4),\n Hume’s rules of reasoning have a strong resemblance to\nNewton’s four “Rules for the Study of Natural\nPhilosophy” outlined at the start of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia (third edition). For example, Hume’s fourth\nrule, “The same cause always produces the same effect, and the\nsame effect never arises but from the same cause”, is explained\nby  \n[F]or when by any clear experiment I have discover’d the causes\nor effects of any phænomenon, I immediately extend our\nobservation to every phenomenon of the same kind.  \nThis echoes Newton’s second rule of\n reasoning,[5]\n especially in its generalizing tendency, which Newton explicitly\nasserts in his third\n rule.[6]\n That is to say, in his fourth rule, Hume makes explicit what is\nimplied by the simplicity of nature assumption in Newton’s first\n rule:[7]\n that the same cause always produces the same effect. Also,\nHume’s fifth rule is an articulation of Newton’s first and\nthird rules. Hume’s sixth rule is itself an extension of\nHume’s fifth. \nHume’s seventh and eighth rules do not directly echo\nNewton’s four rules. Hume admits, however, that one should be\ncautious in applying and extending the seventh rule because one cannot\nextrapolate from a “few experiments” (THN 1.3.15.9; he\nappeals to the rule at 2.2.8.4). The example Hume offers (on the\nrelationship between heat and pleasure/pain) is about a mental\nphenomenon. Even so we think there is an important critical\nrelationship between Hume’s Rule VII and Newtonian gravitation\n(what follows is taken over from Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\nrelationship is not explicit in his text, it is established by\nHume’s wording, which closely follows Newton’s phrasing in\ndiscussing gravity in the Principia: In his Book 3,\nProposition 7, Corollary 1, Newton describes gravitation as an action\nin which “every attraction toward a whole arises from the\nattractions toward the individual parts”. In Rule VII, Hume\nspeaks in these same terms, arguing that a quality that\n“encreases or diminishes with the encrease or diminution of its\ncause”, should be “regarded as a compounded effect,\nderiv’d from the union of the several different effects, which\narise from the several different parts of the cause”. And,\nelsewhere in the Treatise, Hume writes explicitly of the\nforce of gravitation using just this language (THN 1.3.2.16). On the\nface of it, then, Hume’s Rule VII seems to adopt Newtonian\nlanguage in order to provide an alternative description of the kind of\nextrapolation involved in establishing Newtonian gravitation. \nBut only the first half of Rule VII is compatible with Newton’s\nscience. In the latter half, Hume turns against Newton, warning\nagainst the attempt to “draw such a conclusion from a few\nexperiments” (THN 1.3.15.9). Indeed, we know quite well that\neffects can vary proportionately within a certain range of experience\nand yet behave completely differently outside of this range. Hume\ngives the example of our experience of fire.  \nA certain degree of heat gives pleasure; if you diminish that heat,\nthe pleasure diminishes; but it does not follow, that if you augment\nit beyond a certain degree, the pleasure will likewise augment; for we\nfind that it degenerates into pain.  \nThis argument, made with respect to heat, is no less applicable to the\nNewtonian force of gravitation: what appears to be a strictly\nproportional relation over a given range of experience can turn into\nsomething quite different when one strays from this range. \nWhat we have, therefore, is as follows. Newton’s Rule III, which\nis the basis for the claimed universality for his law of gravitation,\nis met and replaced by Hume’s Rule VII, whose intent is in a\ncertain sense precisely the opposite: The so-called universal law of\ngravitation must be regarded only as characterizing a certain range of\nhuman experience and no more. Extension of this law beyond our\nexperience (or beyond what “perceptible models” allow for,\nsee Landy 2017), whether into the heavens or the microworld, cannot be\nadmitted into science (except as “hypothesis”). And the\nsame will have to be said for all other qualities that are attributed\nto bodies significantly outside of the bounds of our actual\nexperience. What to Newton is nothing less than the “foundation\nof all natural philosophy”—his Rule III—is in\nHume’s philosophy shown to be unnecessary for scientific\nreasoning and of questionable validity. \nThis suggests that it is Newton’s Rule II that Hume considers to\nbe “Newton’s chief rule of philosophizing”—an\ninterpretation that fits well with what Hume writes about method in\nboth the Treatise and in his later writings. It also\nreinforces the view that Hume rejects Rule III as being that part of\nNewton’s philosophy that is worthy of being adopted and\nimitated. Indeed, Hume’s point is precisely that it is\nNewton’s Rule II, chiefly, that we should be interested in. Rule\nIII, with its extravagant claims concerning the presence of supposedly\nessential qualities in every body in the universe far from common life\nis one we can afford to set aside. The view we have presented here is\nat odds with that of Graciela de Pierris, who builds her discussion of\nHume’s debt to Newton around Hume’s putative embrace of\nNewton’s Rule III as the cornerstone for his philosophical\nmethod (de Pierris 2006:\n306–310, 312; for detailed criticism see Hazony & Schliesser\n2016). \nHume’s eighth rule is, as Hume himself implies, a refinement of\nHume’s fourth rule; it prevents over-zealous causal ascription\nto an object. (In his explanation of the rule, Hume presupposes the\nspatial and temporal contiguity requirement of cause and effect, but\nit is not an essential feature of the rule.) But the first part of it\n(“an object, which exists for any time in its full perfection\nwithout any effect”) appears to target non-Newtonian theological\nor Spinozistic arguments, so will not be discussed here. \nOn Hume’s interpretation, Newton’s second rule is the only\nrule that is said to be derived (un-controversially) “from\nexperience” (THN 1.3.15.6). It is a crucial rule because the\nfifth and sixth rules are, by Hume’s lights, extensions of the\nfourth (THN 1.3.15.7–8). Moreover, the conjunction of\nHume’s fourth and seventh rules produces a new rule: “An\neffect always holds proportion with its cause” (“Of\nInterest”, EMPL 297). We can call this Hume’s ninth rule.\nIf one assumes (or prescribes) that linear causal relationships are\nthe only possible ones, this new rule allows Hume to rule out\ncompeting claims that posit the existence of causal relationships that\nare not “proportional”. Hume can use the rule as a\nconstraint on theory. It plays a prominent role in Hume’s\npolitical economy when he rejects Mercantilism and, more important for\nour present purposes, in his criticism of the use of analogy in the\nNewtonian argument from Design (see EHU XI, and Dialogues\nParts V–VII). \nHume’s ninth rule also has Newtonian debts. Since the time of\nAristotle, many philosophers have asserted proportionality between\ncause and effect in one fashion or another. Hume’s ninth rule\nechoes, for instance, a principle Leibniz uses quite frequently: the\nprinciple of the equality of cause and effect. It is the basis of\narguments Leibniz gives for his conservation principles (e.g.,\nSpecimen Dynamicum). But Leibniz’s formulation is in terms of\nequality and not proportionality. Unlike Leibniz and other Cartesians,\nNewton preferred to reason in terms of proportionality. Although\nHume’s ninth rule is not derived from any of Newton’s\nofficial Rules of Reasoning, Newton does implicitly use a rule like\nHume’s ninth throughout the Principia. For example, the\nimportance of a proportion between cause and effect is emphasized\nthroughout the treatment of the behavior of bodies in resisting fluids\n(e.g., the Scholium to Proposition 40, Book 2, Section 7, especially\nExperiment 14), which, given the importance, for Hume, of treating\nmoney as a fluid (“Of the Balance of Trade”, EMPL\n312–315; see Schabas 2001) may have caught Hume’s\nattention. Hume also treats resistance in his footnote to the EHU,\n7.1.15. Moreover, there is a prominent place in the Principia\n(the Scholium following Proposition 69, Book I, Section 11), where\nNewton implicitly transforms a version of Hume’s seventh rule\ninto Hume’s ninth rule in which proportionality is emphasized.\nIn this Scholium, Newton starts employing the language and emphasizing\nthe importance of proportionality. This is not ruled out by\nNewton’s own “rules”, but it was not emphasized\nthere. This passage could have attracted Hume’s attention for\ntwo reasons: it is one of the few explicit methodological passages in\nthe Principia, and it offers an account of what Newton means\nby “attraction”. Hume was almost certainly aware of this\npassage because the proper meaning of “attraction” is\ndiscussed, with explicit appeal to Newton’s intentions, in\nHume’s footnote to EHU 7.1.25. Hume makes the ninth rule\nexplicit and uses it as a constraint with which competing theories (in\npolitical economy, the argument from design, etc) can be ruled out.\nHume’s use of it in his attack on the design argument is an\ninstance where Hume attacks Newton with Newtonian tools. \nMoreover, there are two connected, important further differences\nbetween Hume’s and Newton’s rules. First, Hume never quite\nendorses the universal reach implied by Newton’s third rule. For\nNewton we extend the known qualities of bodies within our experimental\nreach to all bodies in the universe. While it could be compatible with\nNewton’s third rule, Hume’s fourth rule does not go that\nfar. There is one instance where Hume appears to accept an implication\nof Newton’s rule: “The production of motion by impulse and\ngravity is an universal law, which has hitherto admitted of no\nexception” (EHU 6.4). Leaving aside the fact that this would a\nvery puzzling way to express the inverse-square law, the context makes\nclear that Hume has in mind causes that “are entirely uniform\nand constant” on Earth, not their universal reach; this is why\nin context his other examples involve the burning of fire and the\nsuffocation of every human creature by water. There is textual support\nto suspect that Hume would deny the universal scope implied by\nNewton’s third rule. Hume states a “maxim” in a\nfootnote to section XI of EHU which argues against inferring new\neffects from any cause only “known only by its particular\neffects”. This denies Newton’s strategy of making ever\nmore audacious inferences (about planetary motions, the tides, the\nshape of the Earth, comets, etc) based on the acceptance of universal\ngravity (recall Hume’s treatment of Newton’s methodology\nin HE, VI, 542, discussed in\n section 3).[8]\n The argument in favor of the “maxim” reveals the tension\nwith Newton’s third rule: \nTo say, that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the\nsame energy, which is already known from the first effects, will not\nremove the difficulty. For even granting this to be the case (which\ncan seldom be supposed), the very continuation and exertion of a like\nenergy (for it is impossible it can be absolutely the same), I say,\nthis exertion of a like energy, in a different period of space and\ntime, is a very arbitrary supposition. (EHU 11.26) \nNewton’s first three rules offer a bold methodological program\nthat attempts to unify science across different periods of space and\ntime; it is a bet on the causal unity of nature. The maxim cautions\nagainst overconfidence in this regard. Hume’s caution is\nprophetic because it turns out that sub-atomic entities behave very\ndifferently than macroscopic bodies. However, it is not entirely\ncertain if one should ascribe the “maxim” in the footnote\nto Hume because it is offered in the voice of a “friend”,\nwho is pretending to be Epicurus. \nSecond, Hume lacks an equivalent to Newton’s Rule 4. Hume is not\nalone in ignoring rule 4. Even Reid and Priestley, who have much to\nsay about the authority of Newton’s Rules of Reasoning, tend to\nignore the fourth rule (Tapper 2002). Adam Smith seems to have been\none of few eighteenth century figures to have taken it seriously\n(Schliesser 2005a and 2005b). Recall (from\n section 4.2)\n that Newton’s Rule IV can be viewed as (1) an encouragement to\nfind and exploit known deviations from the regularities one has\nestablished in order to make them “more exact”. (2) A\nproposal about how to treat a theory, that is, as true until proven\notherwise. Hume seems to have not appreciated the first point at all\n(Schliesser 2004). On the second point, we have seen that Hume shares\nNewton’s commitment to fallibilism. But this common commitment\nalso hides an important difference between Hume and Newton which is\nconnected to the observation just made about the contrast between\nNewton’s third rule and the maxim in the footnote to section XI\nof EHU. Newton’s fallibilism includes commitment to the truth of\nthe propositions within one’s scientific theory until it is\nproven to be false. Newton realizes that induction can never be\ncertain for all time; he does anticipate Hume in this respect. But it\nis also an expression of Newton’s “scientific\nnaturalism”. Empirical science is authoritative until one has\nempirical reason to refine theory. This means that at any time one\nrisks the danger of going beyond one’s evidence, but this is the\nmethodological price one must pay to make further progress. In his\neagerness to combat Newtonian superstition, Hume is willing to be more\ncautious. \nHume’s omission of an equivalent rule has several implications\nfor his philosophy and its relationship to Newton’s. First Hume\nreplaces the authority of natural philosophy by his own criterion, the\n“copy principle”, when it comes to existence claims (see\n section 2, of the entry on Hume).\n Only the ideas that can be traced to a distinct impression will be\npermissible. Thus, Hume’s “science of man”, or\n“true philosophy”, offers to evaluate the claims of\nnatural philosophy from a privileged position. This is the sense in\nwhich Hume is not a scientific naturalist. \nSecond, without commitment to the truth of a “scientific”\ntheory, Hume has conceptual elbow room for a distinction between the\nprovable, experimental claims of common life (including some parts of\nnatural philosophy) and the lesser, probable commitments of the more\nabstract parts of natural philosophy. This, too, is a result of\nHume’s “science of man”. Recall (from\n section 1)\n that the Humean practitioners of “mitigated scepticism”\nwill not  \nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations.  \nThe distinction between a provable common life and the far less\nprobable parts of natural philosophy runs through all of Hume’s\nmajor works. Yet, its implications for Hume’s attitude toward\nNewtonian natural philosophy are not discussed until the Dialogues.\nThere, Cleanthes, the spokesperson for a Newtonian natural religion,\nattacks the Humean position: \nThey are even obliged to acknowledge, that the most abstruse and\nremote objects are those, which are best explained by philosophy.\nLight is in reality anatomized: The true system of the heavenly bodies\nis discovered and ascertained. But the nourishment of bodies by food\nis still an inexplicable mystery: The cohesion of the parts of matter\nis still incomprehensible…In reality, would not a man be\nridiculous, who pretended to reject Newton’s explication of the\nwonderful phenomenon of the rainbow, because that explication gives a\nminute anatomy of the rays of light; a subject, forsooth, too refined\nfor human comprehension? And what would you say to one, who having\nnothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and\nGalileo for the motion of the earth, should withhold his assent, on\nthat general principle, That these subjects were too magnificent and\nremote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of\nmankind?… In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between\nscience and common life, or between one science and another. The\narguments, employed in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and\ncontain the same force and evidence. Or if there be any difference\namong them, the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and\nnatural religion. Many principles of mechanics are founded on very\nabstruse reasoning; yet no man, who has any pretensions to science,\neven no speculative sceptic, pretends to entertain the least doubt\nwith regard to them. The Copernican system contains the most\nsurprising paradox, and the most contrary to our natural conceptions,\nto appearances, and to our very senses: yet even monks and inquisitors\nare now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it.\n(Dialogues Part I) \nCleanthes points out that if philosophy asserts the distinction\nbetween common life and science, philosophy would set itself against\nsome of the best supported parts of natural philosophy which are often\nmost removed from common life. We may naturally think that the Sun is\nin motion, but the reality behind the appearances can be very\nsurprising. Cleanthes’s point is that philosophy cannot hope to\nargue against the authority of science without looking as backward as\nmonks and inquisitors (who attacked Copernicanism). \nFor our purposes, there are three important features in\nCleanthes’s discussion. First, he claims that the same kind of\ncorrect reasoning applies to all domains. This is a very popular\nargument among religious Newtonians (e.g., Reid). So just because\nscience deals with uncommon domains and obscure topics, it can still\ncontain “just reasoning”. This is, in fact, one of the\nmajor assumptions behind Hume’s own Rules of Reasoning. So,\nCleanthes uses Hume’s philosophy to undercut part of\nHume’s anti-Newtonian strategy. Even if Philo were not bound by\nHume’s philosophy (and there is no evidence he should be\nconsidered a strict spokesperson for Hume), as a defender of the\nepistemic priority of common life he has no resources to claim that\nthere is a different, correct form of reasoning for areas beyond\ncommon life. Second, if there is a debate between science and common\nlife, the advantage is with science. No skeptic, who at least pretends\nto be informed, is seriously willing to doubt the results of natural\nphilosophy. That is, by the last third of the eighteenth century\nnatural philosophy has an authoritative claim to knowledge even if it\nis founded on very uncommon, “abstruse” principles. Third,\nCleanthes assimilates the success of natural philosophy to theology\nand natural religion; he does not recognize a principled distinction\nbetween science and religion. If Philo attacks natural religion he\nattacks science itself. Contemporary advocates of “intelligent\ndesign”, who claim that it should be treated as a scientific\ntheory (see the\n entry on teleological arguments for God’s existence),\n follow the same strategy as Cleanthes. \nInitially it seems that Cleanthes’s argument is left without a\nresponse. So there appears no room for a principled difference between\ncommon life, on the one hand, and natural philosophy and natural\nreligion, on the other hand. In the remainder of the Dialogues, Philo\nmakes sure not to be thought of as attacking natural philosophy again.\nIn the context where the intellectual authority of science has become\nunchallengeable, Philo’s best hope lies in driving a wedge\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion. This may explain why\nin undermining Newtonian natural religion, Philo does not draw on some\ncore elements of Hume’s philosophy: the “copy\nprinciple” or Hume’s attack on the permissibility of final\ncauses. Rather, throughout the Dialogues, Philo offers more narrow\narguments attacking the content of natural religion. So, while in Part\nI of the Dialogues Philo has no immediate response to\nCleanthes’s argument, later in the Dialogues he continues to use\nsome distinction between the secure reasoning available in common life\nand those too far removed from it. For example, by using Hume’s\nninth rule, Philo is critical of the use of analogy in making claims\nabout the nature of the first cause. Philo relies on common sense to\nformulate the problem of evil—if God is all powerful then he is\nresponsible for natural and moral evil (see Part XI). At the end of\nthe Dialogue, Philo is willing to grant Cleanthes “that the\ncause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote\nanalogy to human intelligence” (Part XII; emphasis in\noriginal). So,\nwhile Philo is unable to draw a conclusive, principled distinction\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion, he reduces the latter\nto a very minimal thesis. \nIt may, of course, be possible that by the end of his life, Hume had\nlimited his aims to removing the “superstitious” elements\nin Newtonianism (recall his criticism of Newton in Section 1). Perhaps he had given up on\nclaiming the priority of the science of man over natural philosophy.\nBut it would be a mistake to identify the posthumous Dialogues as\nHume’s final, definitive philosophy. Hume appended an\n“advertisement” to EHU, which was printed at the start of\nthe posthumous 1777 edition. After distancing himself (to some degree)\nfrom his “juvenile work”, the Treatise, he says\nabout EHU: “Henceforth, the Author desires, that the following\nPieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles”. EHU contains, of course,\nHume’s copy principle and the attack on final causes. Perhaps,\nthe closing remarks of Philo, where he apologizes for  \nintervening in the education and instruction of his [i.e.,\nCleanthes’s] pupil [i.e., Pamphillus—the official narrator\nof (and witness to) the dialogues among Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea],\n \nshould be taken more seriously by more of Hume’s readers. The\nDialogues are Hume’s efforts to educate the students of natural\nreligion; they are not a statement of Hume’s positive\n“science of man” or “true metaphysics”. \nThere has been a persistent strain of criticism of David Hume that has\ninsinuated that he simply did not understand Newton or lacked\nmathematical competence. But when Hume (or any other historical\nfigure) deviates from Newton this need not entail lack of\nunderstanding, it can, depending on other evidence, also be taken as\ninformed criticism (Schliesser 2011). In Hume’s case, critical\nscholars also draw on a (1772) letter to William Strahan in which he\nmentions a 1755 draft essay “On the Metaphysical Principles of\nGeometry” that he withdrew upon the advice of his friend the\nmathematician Lord Stanhope, “who convinced me that either there\nwas some defeat in the argument or in its perspicuity” (Newman\n1981). This remark is taken as evidence of Hume’s acknowledged\nlack of competence in mathematics. But it could also be taken at face\nvalue and an expression of scholarly integrity: he accepted a\ncompelling criticism. \nHowever far his understanding of complex mathematics reached, he\nadvanced a radical sceptical challenge for mathematics, and thereby he\nalso undermined knowledge claims associated with demonstrative\nreasoning (Meeker 2007). The sceptical problem arises from the\ninexactness of geometrical ideas and the fallibility of our reasoning\nprocesses. Geometry for Hume is about actual figures and shapes whose\nideas cannot be perfectly exact because our perceptual abilities are\nlimited, and reasoning based on these ideas inherits this inexactness.\nIdeas relevant for arithmetic, i.e., numbers, do not suffer from this\nimprecision, but arithmetical reasoning is just as fallible as human\nreasoning in general. The outcome of our demonstrative reasoning must\nbe judged by a probabilistic judgment on the reliability of our\nreasoning faculties, which in turn must be judged by a further\nprobabilistic judgment on the probabilistic judgment on the\nreliability of our faculties. The apparent demonstrative certainty of\nour mathematical reasoning degenerates into probability, and we are\nleft with fallible and uncertain conclusions even in our demonstrative\nsciences (THN 1.4.1.2–6). \nBut Hume does not stop there: he offers a sceptical solution to this\nchallenge (Demeter 2019a). First he offers an individual\nremedy for the mathematician: to go back and to check again his\nreasoning, because “[e]very time he runs over his proofs, his\nconfidence increases” (THN 1.2.4.23). Secondly, social\nprocesses are more effective in reducing doubt, because his certainty\nis increased “still more by the approbation of his friends; and\nis rais’d to its utmost perfection by the universal assent and\napplauses of the learned world” (THN 1.4.1.2). Even if all\ndemonstrative knowledge remains probabilistic in this approach too,\nthe certainty of mathematical reasoning reaches its peak due to the\nacknowledgment of epistemic peers. \nThe popularity of a mathematical proof (or demonstration) among\nexperts in the field naturally speaks in favor of the proof. This\nfeature is not peculiar to mathematical conclusions, because as Hume\npoints out: “I feel all my opinions loosen and fall of\nthemselves, when unsupported by the approbation of others” (THN\n1.4.7.4). What makes mathematics peculiar is that, in addition to\nindividual reasoning, the approbation of the mathematician’s\nclose circle of “friends”, and the approval of the\nscholarly community seem to be the only sources of\njustification in matters of mathematics. \nBy connecting mathematical certainty to the approbation of others Hume\ngives an essentially social character to mathematical knowledge. No\nmatter the different metaphysical and epistemic pedigree of its\nbranches, it is their practices that determine the certainty of\nmathematical conclusions (THN 2.3.10.2). In practice geometrical\nreasoning is elevated to the same level of certainty as our reasoning\nin arithmetic and algebra—and his may be one way to explain why\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.1, 7.1–2, 12.20) lists all of them\nas demonstrative. The limitations of our practices, arising from human\nnature, condemn all branches of mathematics to eventual fallibility\nand uncertainty. But that is not the main lesson we should draw here.\nWhat really matters is that despite this fallibility we\ngenerate certainty through our predominantly social\npractices. So geometry in practice can be as certain and\ndemonstrative as arithmetic is in principle demonstrative,\nbut in practice, fallible. Taken together, the metaphysics and\npractice of mathematics leads us to pretty much the same epistemic\ngrounds in all branches of mathematics. \nHume’s reservations about the demonstrability of mathematics\nimply a critique of Newton’s programme of mathematizing natural\nphilosophy (for details see Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\ncriticism is not wholly implicit; rather Newton is very clearly the\ntarget of remarks made in the context of Hume’s discussion of\nthe principle of “infinite divisibility” in the paragraphs\nsubsequent to THN 1.2.4.17: \nwe are not possess’d of any instrument or art of\nmeasuring, which can secure us from all error and uncertainty…\nwe therefore suppose some imaginary standard of equality, by which the\nappearances and measuring are exactly corrected, and the figures\nreduc’d entirely to that proportion… But tho’ this\nstandard be only imaginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor\nis any thing more usual, than for the mind to proceed after this\nmanner with any action, even after the reason has ceas’d, which\nfirst determin’d it to begin. This appears very conspicuously\nwith regard to time; where tho’ ’tis evident we have no\nexact method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so\nexact as in extension, yet the various corrections of our measures,\nand their different degrees of exactness, have given us an obscure and\nimplicit notion of a perfect and entire equality. The case is the same\nin many other subjects. A painter forms the same fiction with regard\nto colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. (THN 1.2.4.24) \nInstead of introducing certainty into natural philosophy as Newton\nclaimed, mathematics, albeit a useful device “in almost every\nart and profession” (THN 2.3.3.2), is thus grounded in natural\nfictions. It has a limited contribution to the advancement of\nknowledge. Mathematics in Hume’s eyes is only another human\ncognitive enterprise that has no potential to make other fields of\nknowledge immune to human fallibility. This is in sharp contrast with\nthe cognitive optimism Newton expresses in the Preface to the\nPrincipia and several other passages about the role of\nmathematics in natural inquiry (see Guicciardini 2009, esp. ch. 13\n& 14; Zemplén & Demeter 2010). Newton is confident that\nby making the method of inquiry mathematical, natural philosophy can\nbe infused with certainty and demonstrativity. This confidence is\nundermined by Hume’s account of how mathematical knowledge is\npossible at all. \nWhat is distinctive about the method of the Principia is what\nI.B. Cohen termed the “Newtonian style”. Its constitutive\nfeature is the mathematization of nature, i.e., “dealing\nmathematically with the realities of the external world”. This\nmeant much more than deriving numerical results from experiments, or a\nfocus on measurement, or a commitment to a means of exposition that\nproceeded from definitions and axioms. Instead, it meant taking\nmathematics as the model of reality: constructing “the\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation” and then to\nadvance from this idealized case by the addition of further conditions\ntoward more accurate mathematical analogues of actual situations\n(Cohen 1980: 51, 151, see also Smith 2002; Smeenk & Schliesser\n2013). There are no traces of this approach in Hume, so if one takes\nthe Principia’s “Newtonian style” as the\nessence of Newton’s method, then one should also conclude that\nHume’s experimental method is not Newtonian. (For a contrasting\nview see de Pierris 2015 who credits Hume with a\nPrincipia-style Newtonian inductive methodology, and for a\ncritique of her views see Landy 2017.) \nAs McGuire (1970b: 182) points out “Newton did not see any\ndichotomy in method between that used in the Principia and\nthat found in the Opticks”. But even if he considered\nhis methodology fundamentally the same in both works, and he treated\nmathematical and experimental analyses as contributing to inquiry in\nthe same manner, this was perceived differently by subsequent\ngenerations. In Query 31 Newton himself introduces two different ways\nof analysis that “may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and\nfrom motions to the forces producing them” (Opticks, Query 31 added in 1718, Newton 2004:\n139; for a discussion\nsee e.g. Ducheyne 2012; Demeter 2016): the first way allows for a\nqualitative analysis that does not require the centrality of a\nmathematical framework of analysis. The crucial element is indeed\ncommon to their methodology, namely the idea of causal\nanalysis—this is the core of Newtonian analysis, and these\nare the terms in which Colin Maclaurin (1775: 8–10) introduces\nthe Newtonian method to his contemporaries. Nevertheless, it is\nimmediately clear from this passage that an analysis “from\ncompounds to ingredients” must proceed differently and find\ndifferent causes from an analysis “from motions to the forces\nproducing them”: they will be different with respect to both the\nmethod of analysis, and the nature of the causes\nthat can be so analysed. \nFrom the angle of Newton’s Preface to the first edition of the Principia,  \nthe basic problem of philosophy seems to be to discover the forces of\nnature from the phenomena of motions and then to demonstrate the other\nphenomena from these forces. (Newton 2004: 41)  \nSo its method is focused on analysing the causes of motions\nin terms of forces, a quantifiable natural kind that is\ndefined in terms of other quantities. So defined, the problem cries\nout for a mathematical apparatus, and so it fosters what I.B. Cohen\ntermed “the Newtonian style” in philosophy: taking\nmathematics as the model of reality, constructing “the\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation”, and then\nproducing from this idealized case by the addition of further\nconditions more and more accurate mathematical analogues of actual\nsituations (Cohen 1980: 51, 151). Through this series of\n“successive approximations”, Newton’s axioms or laws\nof motion function as “inference tickets” that allow for\ndrawing conclusions from motions to forces and vice versa,\nand also from macrophysical to microphysical forces composing them\n(Smith 2002: 143, 155–159; Smeenk & Schliesser 2013). \nThe analysis of compounds to ingredients, followed in the\nOpticks, looks for parts, components, constituents etc., and\naccompanies the mathematical methods of analysis where they prove to\nbe inadequate in themselves. The qualitative component of analysis is\nintended to reveal the composition of optical and, especially\nin the Queries, chemical phenomena. The paradigmatic cases are, of\ncourse, Newton’s prism experiments that revealed the composition\nof white light. In the first two books of the Opticks Newton\nhimself uses the method of analysis of compounds into ingredients\n“to discover and prove the original differences of rays of\nlight” (Query 31, Newton 2004: 140), that is to discover\nqualitative differences that persist due to the lack of their analysis\nin the “Newtonian style”. Most notable among them, as the\nexperimentum crucis had revealed, are colours that\n \nare not Qualifications of Light, derived from Refractions, or\nReflections of natural Bodies (as ’tis generally believed,) but\nOriginal and connate properties, which in divers\nRays are divers. (Newton 1671/72: 3081; for discussion and context see\nDucheyne 2012: 190–192) \nIn this vein, the Opticks provides a more appropriate setting\nfor understanding the character of Hume’s experimentalism than\nthe context of the Principia. As Colin Maclaurin put it in\nhis 1748 account of Newton’s discoveries: while the\nPrincipia inquires into forces acting between bodies in great\ndistance, the Opticks explores the “hidden parts of\nnature”, which are not so easily “subjected to\nanalysis” because of the subtlety and minuteness of the\nagents (Maclaurin 1775: 21). The principles of human nature that Hume\nendeavours to explore also belong to the hidden parts of nature that\ncan be explored by a method of qualitative analysis and\nsynthesis similar to the one advertised in Query 31. (Landy 2017\noffers a consonant reconstruction of Hume’s philosophy of\nscience as aiming at the exploration of hidden processes of the\nmind.) \nThe Treatise begins with setting up a “scheme of\nfundamental ‘elements’” for analyzing human\nphenomena in terms of ideas and impressions. Humean analysis begins\nwith phenomena from the historical and everyday observation of human\nbehavior, and the analysis proceeds by “experiments …\njudiciously collected and compar’d” (THN I.10), in order\nto arrive at analogies among various instances “from the\nobservation of several parallel instances” (EHU 8.13). The\nproducts of comparative analysis so conducted are the principles of\nvarious faculties, like perception, imagination, reason, etc., whose\ninteraction results in ideas and impressions causing behaviour, but\ntheir contribution can hardly be measured and the principles of their\ninteraction can hardly be quantified—not even in principle, so\nthey cannot be mathematized either (see also\n section 4.6\n above). Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them (Demeter 2016). \nThe methodological core thus consists in collecting relevant\nphenomena, finding analogies between them, and ascribing those\nanalogies to similar causes, thereby reducing a variety of phenomena\nto regular principles underlying them (THN App.3, Abs.1, EHU\n4.12)—while knowing that our knowledge cannot transcend what we\ncan infer on an analogical basis from the effects themselves (THN\nI.8). Just as comparing rays of light reveals their determinable\nproperties which, once determined, can be used in constructing\nexplanations, the comparison of instances of human behavior reveals\nthe principles of human nature with increasing generality and\nexactness. Salient human phenomena are collected from history and\nobservation, then compared; if analogies and similarities are found,\nthey are ascribed to some principle of human nature that are also\ncompared, grouped and resolved into more general ones (see also\nSection 4.8 below). This process results in determinable properties of\nhuman nature like the faculties of reason, sympathy, moral sense etc.;\ndetermining how these properties are actually instantiated in\ndifferent social, historical, individual, etc. circumstances provides\nthe explanatory raw material for singular phenomena (EHU 8.7, 8.9).\nThus we reach the principles of human nature that are the proper aim\nof inquiry in the science of man. These principles can be used, at the\nstage of synthesis, to explain why our impressions and ideas follow\none another in the order they do. \nThe outcome of these procedures is the refinement of the theory of\nhuman nature. While exploring exceptions and eliminating superfluous\nconditions it turns out, for example, that some principles of human\nnature are universal, some others are particular (THN 1.4.4.1). Some\nprinciples of imagination are then constitutive of human nature, but\nsome others are just contingent on culture or history, or even\nidiosyncratic, and can lead to local superstitions or philosophical\nchimeras, like presupposing “substance” as the bearer of\nproperties in scholastic metaphysics. The universal principles provide\nthe fundamental framework of determinable human properties that are\nactually determined by social and historical circumstances. This\nexplains why certain virtues, like courage, are evaluated differently\nin different historical periods (EPM 7.11–14), and also why a\ncreature without sympathy, however contingent its degree and direction\nmay be, would count as a “monster” and not a\n“man” (EPM 6.1–2). Sympathy is a universal principle\nof human nature, but the principles of the degree and direction of its\nsensitivity are determined by the conditions within which it is\ndeveloped and refined through social interaction (EPM 5.41–42).\nThis amounts to saying that Hume’s account of human nature has\nboth universalistic and contextualist elements, and this is the\noutcome of his experimental methodology: it is through a series of\nsuccessive approximation through a comparative study of changing\ncircumstances that the universal and contingent principles of human\nnature can be distinguished. \nAnalysis and synthesis so understood constitutes the core of\n“the experimental method of reasoning” that distinguishes\nHume’s enterprise from the alternative approach that Newton\n(2004: 121) had termed “hypothetical philosophy”. Hume is\naware of this distinction and explicitly sides with the\nexperimentalist camp. His methodological pronouncements and\ncommitments situate him in the context of “methodological\nNewtonianism” characteristic to Scottish moral and natural\nphilosophers, who “dealt with aspects of philosophy for which\nNewton had not laid down the specific postulates upon which future\ntheories were to be built” (Donovan 1975: 29, see also Demeter\n2016). \nAs Hume repeatedly emphasizes, it is impossible to reveal the\n“ultimate causes of our mental actions”, and we have to be\ncontent with “experience and analogy” in explaining any\nact of the mind “by producing other instances, which are\nanalogous to it, and other principles, which facilitate its\noperation” (THN 1.1.7.11). Finding analogies between different\ninstances gives one the chance to explain causes and reduce them to\n“more general principles” (THN App. 3). For Hume,\nanalogical reasoning is the key to most of our everyday and\nphilosophical conclusions in empirical matters. Causal reasoning is\npartly but crucially founded on our capacity to recognize resemblances\namong different instances, and to extend our inferences based on\nprevious observations to similar but unobserved instances. Thus, the\nrecognition of resemblances is at the heart of our reasoning\nconcerning any matter of fact, and the limits of this kind of\nreasoning are exactly where our capacity to recognize resemblances\nends (THN 1.3.13.25). The proper method of both natural and moral\nphilosophy is  \nto reduce the principles, productive of natural phaenomena, to a\ngreater simplicity, and to resolve the many particular effects into a\nfew general causes, by means of reasonings from analogy, experience,\nand observation. (EHU 4.12, 11.30; THN 1.1.7.11)  \nIt is history—natural and civil as well—that provides the\npool of observations from which philosophers—natural and moral\nones as well—relying on analogies can establish explanatory\nprinciples. Finding analogies between different instances gives one\nthe chance to explain causes and reduce them to “more general\nprinciples” (THN App.3). \nIn the Dialogues, and especially in the sections criticizing\nthe design argument, Hume seems to be more critical of analogical\nreasoning than he is in his other passages of similar methodological\nrelevance; nevertheless, Philo pronounces “analogies and\nresemblances” reliable enough to serve as the “sole proofs\nof the Copernican system” (Dialogues 2.26). Given that\nin Hume’s epistemology the category of proof provides\nthe highest level of epistemic certainty available for any piece of\nempirical knowledge, analogical reasoning is a highly esteemed way of\nreaching theoretical conclusions in exploring the principles of nature\nand human nature (EHU 6n10). Hume’s doubts in the\nDialogues concerning analogical arguments from design\nprimarily do not arise from the weaknesses of analogical reasoning,\nbut mainly from the uniqueness of the world, which does not provide a\nsufficient pool of instances among which analogies can be found (EHU\n11.26). \nAlthough the cognitive role of analogy is central, it relies on\nsubjective judgment and so it can have idiosyncratic manifestations.\nThings are similar in an infinite number of ways, and only some of\nthese similarities can be exploited with the hope of cognitive benefit\n(THN 1.1.5.3). As any thing may resemble any other in an infinite\nnumber of ways only some resemblances can explain associative\nrelations between ideas. Resemblances of cognitive relevance are\ntherefore not passively detected, but they are actively produced by\nmemory: we remember past instances as resembling (THN\n1.4.6.18). Depending on the resemblances one recognizes among\nparticular instances, one can end up with different and potentially\nconflicting conclusions concerning the causes of phenomena. Therefore,\nas Hume puts it: \nNo questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of\ncauses present themselves for the same phaenomenon, to determine which\nis the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise\nargument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by\na kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of\nsimilar instances. (THN 3.2.3.4n71) \nThis is one reason why “Tis not solely in poetry and music, we\nmust follow our taste and sentiment, but likewise in philosophy”\n(THN 1.3.8.12). And while the subjectivity of analogical reasoning is\na source of creativity and insight, it also puts the objectivity and\ncertainty of Newton’s epistemic ideal beyond reach.","contact.mail":"nescio2@yahoo.com","contact.domain":"yahoo.com"},{"date.published":"2007-01-05","date.changed":"2020-04-21","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-newton/","author1":"Eric Schliesser","author2":"Tamás Demeter","entry":"hume-newton","body.text":"\n\n\nDavid Hume’s philosophy, especially the positive project of his\n“science of man”, is often thought to be modeled on\nNewton’s successes in natural philosophy. Hume’s\nself-described “experimental method” (see the subtitle to\nTreatise) and the resemblance of his “rules of\nreasoning” (THN\n 1.3.15)[1]\n with Newton’s are said to be evidence for this position (Noxon\n1973; Stroud 1977; de Pierris 2002; Penelhum 2000; Bennett 2001;\nBeebee 2006; Hazony 2014; Demeter 2016 etc.). Hume encourages this\nview of his project by employing Newtonian metaphors: he talks of an\n“attraction” in the “mental world” on a par\nwith that in the “natural world” (THN 1.1.4.6). Hume\ninfers the existence of “habits” as a kind of mental\n“force” (EHU 5.22) analogous to gravity; the discovery of\nthe “the principles of association”, which in the Abstract\nhe calls his most important achievement (see the\n section on association in the entry on Hume),\n are, then, analogous to the laws of motion. Hume certainly appears to\nwant his readers to feel that he is modeling his project on the\nsuccesses of natural philosophy, exemplified by Newton. In the\n“Introduction” to the Treatise and even more\nexplicitly in the opening pages of Enquiry (EHU 1.15), Hume\nsuggests that his “science of man” can parallel recent\nachievements in natural philosophy (with rather obvious nods to\nNewton’s successes in planetary astronomy). And at the start of\nEPM (1.10), he echoes Newton’s rejection of\n“hypotheses”, and restates his allegiance to the\nexperimental method in contrast with its speculative alternative (on\nthe contrast see Anstey 2005). There is, thus, no doubt that Hume\nwants his readers to believe that Newton forms a kind of model.\n\n\nYet, in the totality of Hume’s oeuvre the technical details of\nNewton’s philosophy are rarely discussed explicitly. In fact,\nsome of the most sophisticated analyses of the implications of\nNewton’s philosophy are attributed to Cleanthes, the\nspokesperson for the inductive argument from design in the\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Dialogues).\nWhile in recent years many commentators have come to doubt that Philo\nshould be considered a straightforward spokesperson of Hume’s\nviews, few suggest that Hume endorses without qualification\nCleanthes’s Newtonian argument from design—the foundations\nof which are undermined throughout Hume’s writings (e.g., Harris\n2015: 447ff). But this raises further complications because Hume can\nbe read as implying that criticism of the design argument can be\ngenerated on strictly Newtonian methodological grounds: the authority\nof “experience”—to which Hume and Newton both\nappeal—does not license an inference (supported by analogical\nreasoning) to a God-like designer of the universe. This would make\nHume something of an internal critic of Newtonianism (Hurlbutt 1985).\nThe same strategy—generate internal criticism to Newtonian\nnatural philosophy—may be thought to operate in Hume’s\nEmpiricist attack on the putative meaningfulness of invisible or\ntheoretical entities (e.g., forces, powers, and masses) that made him\na favorite of Logical Positivists early in the twentieth century (see\nthe entry on\n Alfred Jules Ayer).\n This Positivist interpretation seemed to go well with Hume’s\nreputation for skepticism. Yet, as Positivism gave way to Naturalism\nas the dominant force in twentieth century Anglophone philosophy,\nscholarship on Hume has increasingly emphasized the naturalistic\nelements in Hume, while reinterpreting, even downplaying, his\nskeptical tendencies (Kemp Smith, 1941; Stroud 1977; Garrett 1997).\nBut if by naturalism one (also) means that one is willing to accept\nthe authority of science (see the section on\n Naturalism and Holism in the entry on indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics)\n then one runs into a problem: it is by no means clear that Hume\naccepts the independent intellectual authority of natural philosophers\n(including Newton) to have the final word in interpreting\nNewton’s achievements.\n\n\nBefore, turning to discussion of Hume’s relationship to Newton\nand Newtonianism, one ought to emphasize three problems that beset the\nscholarly literature on this topic. First, much scholarship on Hume is\nstill surprisingly ahistorical; especially among philosophers, it\ntends to favor rational reconstruction of arguments over attention to\nmore contextual forms of interpretation. If such philosophers pay\nattention to historical figures, these tend to be other canonical\nphilosophers: Descartes, Locke, Malebranche, and Berkeley. Second,\neven scholars that emphasize the historical Hume (e.g., Wright 1983;\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997; Winkler 2000) do not tend to exhibit a\nworking knowledge of the details of Newton’s natural philosophy\n(but see Demeter 2016; Slavov 2016; Biener & Schliesser 2014; Belkind 2019). Nearly all of\nthe literature in this genre, most of it quite careful, compares the\ndetails of Hume’s philosophy to evidence from various text-books\n(often “Newtonian”) potentially available to Hume.\nFinally, even the most careful and insightful scholarship on Hume\ntends to ignore the recent scholarly literature generated by the\nrenewed philosophic and historical interest in Newton’s\nphilosophy (Cohen & Smith 2002; see also\n entry on Newton’s philosophy).\n \n\n\n\nThis section analyzes Hume’s relationship to the public Newton\nand other early interpreters of Newton as available to Hume. The\nanalysis reveals that Hume is more critical of and less indebted to\ncore elements of Newton’s philosophy than commonly thought. A\nbenefit of this analysis is that many interpretive debates over how to\nunderstand Hume’s philosophy can be reformulated clearly and\nwith fewer anachronisms. \nHume’s explicit reflections on Newton’s writings and\ncharacter reveal a more ambivalent picture than commonly thought: Hume\nshows respect, even admiration for Newton’s achievements, but he\nalso expresses reservations. Behind this ambivalence one can find\nserious philosophic objections to Newton’s life and project.\nThis section looks, first, at Hume’s brief discussions of\nNewton’s life and achievements and, then, analyzes the aims\nbehind Hume’s “science of man”. \nHume does not doubt the longevity of Newton’s intellectual\nachievement:  \nThe severest scrutiny, which NEWTON’S theory has undergone,\nproceeded not from his own countrymen, but from foreigners; and if it\ncan overcome the obstacles, which it meets with at present in all\nparts of Europe, it will probably go down triumphant to the latest\nposterity. (“Of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and\nSciences”, EMPL 121)  \nBut elsewhere, when Hume comments more directly on Newton, there are\nsigns of ambivalence:  \nWere we to distinguish the Ranks of Men by the Genius and Capacity\nmore than by their Virtue and Usefulness to the Public, great\nPhilosophers would certainly challenge the first Rank, and must be\nplac’d at the Top of human Kind. So rare is this Character,\nthat, perhaps, there has not, as yet, been above two in the World, who\ncan lay a just Claim to it. At least, Galileo and Newton seem to me so\nfar to excel all the rest. (“Of the Middle Station of\nLife”, EMPL 550)  \nAccording to Hume, Newton has unusual philosophic talent. Yet, the\nbackhanded nature of Hume’s compliment is unmistakable.\nNewton’s work is not characterized by its virtue; the\nachievements of Newton’s philosophy are not very useful to the\nrest of mankind. For Hume there is a moral point of view from which\nNewton’s achievements may seem less than entirely\npraiseworthy. \nThis ambivalence about Newton is not an isolated incident in\nHume’s writings. In the last volume of The History of\nEngland, Hume writes: \nIn Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and\nrarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies. From modesty, ignorant of his superiority above the rest of\nmankind; and thence, less careful to accommodate his reasonings to\ncommon apprehensions: More anxious to merit than to acquire fame: He\nwas, from these causes, long unknown to the world; but his reputation\nat last broke out with a lustre, which scarcely any writer, during his\nown life-time, had ever before attained. (HE VI, 542) \nIn this passage, Hume singles out Newton as the “greatest\ngenius” (no mention of Galileo this time). Hume is following\nFontenelle’s interpretation of Newton as a modest genius not\nconcerned with acquiring fame (Fontenelle 1728—see\n Other Internet Resources\n below). But again, Hume’s praise is not entirely\nstraightforward. It turns out that part of Newton’s achievement\nis due to his failure to possess two kinds of self-knowledge: Newton\ndid not understand how much smarter he was than others and Newton did\nnot understand how far removed from ordinary people’s concerns\nhis theories were. Hume implies that if Newton had been more\nself-aware and more attuned to the environment in which he was\nwriting, he would have been more likely to adjust his mode of\nreasoning to public prejudice. On Hume’s account Newton did not\nproperly understand his relationship to his readership and,\nparadoxically, this partly accounts for Newton’s success. It\nseems not to have occurred to Hume that Newton’s mode of\npresentation in the Principia was a deliberate one to avoid\ncontroversy with those who could not follow its intricate geometric\narguments—an intention Newton makes explicit in the introduction\nto Book 3 of the Principia. \nMoreover, Hume thinks that in certain other respects, Newton shares in\nthe superstitious prejudices of his time. This shows another sense in\nwhich Hume’s admiration for Newton’s genius is limited.\nWhile defending the stylistic abilities of King James I, Hume\ncomments:  \n[King James I] has composed a commentary on the Revelations, and\nproved the pope to be Antichrist; may not a similar reproach be\nextended to the famous writer Napier; and even to Newton, at a time\nwhen learning was much more advanced than during the reign of James?\nFrom the grossness of its superstitions, we may infer the ignorance of\nan age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an\nindividual, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated by the\nappearance of religion. (HE V, 155)  \nHowever, Hume did not doubt Newton’s religious sincerity:  \nIt is for the same reason, I maintain, that Newton, Locke, Clarke,\netc. being Arians or Socinians, were very sincere in the creed they\nprofest: And I always oppose this argument to some libertines, who\nwill needs have it, that it was impossible, but that these\nphilosophers must have been hypocrites. (NHR 12.23n78) \nThus, Hume has no doubts about the intellectual quality of\nNewton’s achievements. His reservations are moral even\ntheological in nature. One can distinguish these along a private and a\npublic dimension. Hume thinks that Newton’s life reveals a man\nwith genuine limitations in understanding (let alone transcending)\nhimself and his times. Hume calls into question the moral quality of\nNewton’s works because they do not serve the public interest and\nthey, and the Newtonians that follow him, are infected with\nsuperstitious beliefs (this line of argument is pursued more fully in\nRussell 2008). While Hume’s criticism of Newton as a man are\nrevealing of Hume’s understanding of what it is to be a\nphilosopher, Hume’s criticism of the purpose behind\nNewton’s project ties directly to the anti-Newtonian aims of\nHume’s “science of man”. This project is viewed by\nmany contemporary scholars, who emphasize Hume’s\n“naturalism”, as Hume’s equivalent of what one today\nwould call “cognitive science” (Garrett 1997). \nWhile Hume admits that Newton was the “greatest genius”\nthat “ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies”, he is unwilling to acknowledge Newton’s\n“Virtue” or “Usefulness to the Public”.\nMoreover, Newton’s project lends cover for gross\n“superstition”. Instead, in the “Introduction”\nto the Treatise, Hume offers an ambitious alternative\nproject: his “science of man”. (In EHU 1.12 he calls it a\n“true metaphysics”, which battles “abstruse\nphilosophy and metaphysical jargon…mixed up with popular\nsuperstition”. Given Hume’s criticism of Newton, he may\nhave Newton in mind here.) Hume emphasizes the foundational nature of\nthis project: \nThere is no question of importance, whose decision is not comprised in\nthe science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any\ncertainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In\npretending, therefore, to explain the principles of human nature, we\nin effect propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can\nstand with any security. (THN “Introduction”, see Boehm\n2016) \nThe success of Hume’s systematic “science of man”\nhas a positive and a negative component. On the positive side,  \nIn these four sciences of Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics\n[i.e., political economy], is comprehended almost everything, which it\ncan any way import us to be acquainted with, or which can tend either\nto the improvement or ornament of the human mind.  \nHume makes it absolutely clear where his priorities are:  \nNor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of\nman will do less honour to our native country than the former in\nnatural philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory,\nupon account of the greater importance of that science, as well as the\nnecessity it lay under of such a reformation.  \nIn short, according to Hume his “science of man” is far\nmore valuable than Newton’s natural philosophy. This is why Hume\nends the “Introduction” to the Treatise with the\nclaim that  \nwe may hope to establish…a science [of man], which will not be\ninferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility to any\nother of human comprehension. \nMoreover, the content of the “science of man” reveals that\neven the very Newtonian sciences of  \nMathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some\nmeasure dependent on the science of MAN; since they lie under the\ncognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties.\n(THN “Introduction”)  \nFor Hume the “science of man” is the\n“foundational” science because it is presupposed to some\ndegree by all the other sciences (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016; Boehm 2016, 2019). \nThe details of Hume’s “science of man” show the\nweakness of our ordinary cognitive capacity; at the same time it\noffers an argument for staying within confines of (potential) ordinary\nexperience. Hume’s cognitive science has a normative consequence\nin that knowledge of it is supposed to reduce the inclination toward\nintellectual overreaching. For, the practitioners of “mitigated\nscepticism” (cf. the “modest scepticism” of\n“Appendix” to the Treatise) will not  \nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations. (EHU 12.3.25)  \nHume’s “science of man” constrains the extent of our\ntheorizing. In subsequent sections it will be illustrated how Hume\nreinterprets the limits and content of Newtonian natural philosophy in\nlight of his “science of man” or “true\nmetaphysics”. \nThere is surprisingly little direct evidence of Hume’s knowledge\nof Newton’s texts. Most of it is circumstantial. Recent archival\nand careful hermeneutic research by Michael Barfoot (1990) has\nincreased our knowledge of the kind of education in different elements\nof natural philosophy Hume would have received as a student at\nEdinburgh (see also Emerson 2009; Stewart 2005; Wright 1990). This\nusefully supplements what can be gleaned from Hume’s writings\nand letters. While new material may show up one day, four important\nconclusions follow from his study. \nFirst, it is very likely that Hume was exposed to many works in the\nnew natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics in Europe and\nBritain. Second, while Hume was a student, Boyle’s writings and\nmethodology were emphasized at The University of Edinburgh. It appears\nthat Boyle was favored as the pre-eminent exemplar of modern natural\nphilosophy because of the theological uses of this form of knowledge\nin eighteenth century natural religion. Given the tenor of the\neducation at Edinburgh and evidence derived from Hume’s oeuvre,\nit is very likely that Hume had a working knowledge of Boyle’s\nhydrostatics. Besides, if Hume’s project aims at an account of\nhidden processes underlying observed regularities (as Landy 2017\nsuggests), as opposed to inductively establishing those regularities,\nthen Hume’s project is consonant with much of Boyle’s (see\nSargent 1995). \nSecond, while at the Jesuit College at La Flèche\n(1735–37) Hume was certainly exposed to Cartesian and\nMalebranchian ideas (Perinetti 2018), and some of his most influential\narguments, concerning, e.g., causation and natural theology had their\norigins in this intellectual environment. Some commentators (e.g.,\nWright 2009: 51ff) have argued that the proper interpretation of\nHume’s methodological aspirations and his account of the mind\nshould spring primarily from this Cartesian and Malebranchian\ncontext. \nThird, Hume would have been reasonably familiar with Newton’s\nOpticks, especially his writings on colors. It is less clear\nhow thorough his working knowledge of it was (see Schliesser 2004 for\nsome concerns). However, it is less likely that he was exposed to most\nof the technically challenging parts of Principia. As the\ncatalogue at La Flèche testifies, there was four entries\ndirectly related to Newton, of which only one, a 1720 French edition\nof Newton’s Opticks (but no edition of\nPrincipia), refers to an edition that could have been there\nduring Hume’s stay (Perinetti 2018: 51). Moreover, if Hume never\nread the third edition of the Principia, then this could help\nexplain his lack of interest in Newton’s fourth rule of\nreasoning which was added to the third edition (see\n section 4.5,\n Rules of Reasoning). \nFourth, it remains unclear how proficient Hume became in mathematics.\nThere is manuscript evidence that he attended George Campbell’s\nextramural lectures on\n fluxions.[2]\n These notes require careful study, but Barfoot reports that these\nmanuscripts show “little evidence of the application of fluxions\nto natural philosophy as such” (1990: 190 fn76). Barfoot is\ncorrect to suggest that Hume’s treatment of mathematics shows\ndebts to Berkeley’s criticism of Newton. There is less evidence\nfor Barfoot’s claim that Hume would have had working knowledge\nof the most technical parts of the Principia. \nIt is likely that Hume did get to know the relevant editions of\nOpticks already during his years spent at the University of\nEdinburgh, and may well have been exposed to lectures on it as well,\nbut it is uncertain how reliable his working knowledge of it was\n(Barfoot 1990, esp. 158 and 152). Although in general he was\ndissatisfied with university education, at least he found some\nsatisfaction in his natural philosophy class taught by Robert Steuart\n(Stewart 2005: 21–25). A probably more important introduction to\nthe outlook that has spread due to the influence of the\nOpticks came from Hume’s medical readings in relation\nto his mental breakdown at the age of 18. The most important document\nof this struggle is his 1734 “Letter to a Physician”\n(Letters 1:14–18.), in which the medical description of\nhis condition, as M.A. Stewart (2005: 24n48) puts it, “seems to\nbe consciously modelled on George Cheyne’s The English\nMalady”, published in 1733. A similarly likely source is\nMandeville’s Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick\nDiseases (1st ed. 1711, 2nd ed. 1730, see\nWright 2009: 8–9). In his latter life he probably benefitted\nfrom discussions with philosophical friends and colleagues, most\nnotably with William Cullen and Joseph Black, these discussions,\nhowever, came only after the publication of Hume’s chief\nphilosophical works. These friendships were indeed philosophical in\nthe sense that they were founded, at least partly, on sympathies for\nHume’s philosophical project (see, e.g., Hume’s letter to\nCullen in Letters 1:163) \nIt should be emphasized, however, that archival evidence may radically\nchange our picture of Hume’s formal education and continuing\ninterest in Newton’s natural philosophy. In addition to the\nmanuscript mentioned above, known marginal notes in Hume’s hand\nin a copy of the Edinburgh Review, where works in Newtonian\nnatural philosophy were reviewed, may reveal further evidence about\nthe nature and quality of his response to issues in Newtonian natural\n philosophy.[3] \nIn The History of England, Hume writes about Newton’s\nresearch methodology as follows:  \nthere flourished during this period a Boyle and a Newton: men who trod\nwith cautious, and therefore the more secure steps, the only road\nwhich leads to true philosophy…[Newton is] cautious in\nadmitting no principles but such as were founded on experiment; but\nresolute to adopt every such principle, however new or unusual. (HE\nVI, 542)  \nWhile this is rather terse, Hume calls attention to three important\nelements in Newton’s natural philosophy: (a) Newton’s\ncommitment to an experimental method; (b) the cautious nature of\nNewton’s methodology; (c) Newton’s boldness once\nexperiments have established a “principle”. In eighteenth\ncentury terminology, a “principle” is akin to what we\nwould call a “law” or a “fundamental/causal\nexplanation”. In order to avoid misunderstanding, Hume equates\nNewton’s methodology with Boyle’s only on points (a) and\n(b), not point (c). Moreover, Hume is aware (as will be shown in\n section 4.1)\n that Newton rightly rejected Boyle’s conception of mechanism.\nSo, Hume admires Newton’s methodology, and sees it as a source\nof progress. \nSo, for Hume, Newton uses experiment to arrive at explanations. Thus,\nhe seems to echo and accept Newton’s claim about\n“hypotheses non fingo” (see the relevant section\nin the\n entry on Newton).\n Once such “principles” or explanations have been arrived\nat experimentally, Hume sees Newton as adopting them boldly, even if\nthey are unusual or surprising. Hume appears to have assimilated the\nimportance of Newton’s third rule of reasoning (see\n section 4.5\n below). Moreover, Hume is discerning the (broad) outlines of\nNewton’s commitment to the method of analysis and synthesis\n(Newton’s Opticks, Query 31; for discussion, see\n section 4.7).\n But in Hume’s account there is no mention of the importance of\nmathematics in Newton’s methodology (see\n section 4.6).\n Hume lack of interest in this aspect of Newton’s methodology\nmay be a consequence of his education (see\n section 2). \nNevertheless, Hume’s interpretation of the status of\n“principles” makes him deviate from Newton’s\nmethodology in a fundamental fashion. In the Treatise, he\nuses the “science of man” to claim it is “beyond the\nreach of human understanding” to “penetrate into the\nnature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their\noperations”. He cannot “approve” of the ambition to\ngo beyond knowing bodies by their external properties (THN 1.2.5.25).\nThis contradicts the final paragraph of the “General\nScholium” of the Principia, where Newton promises a\nprogram of research, perhaps inspired by the success of Francis\nHauksbee’s electrical experiments, to penetrate into the nature\nof matter. Although this program was by no means finished by the time\nof Newton’s death, Newton’s optical research had revealed,\nfor example, that light has an internal constitution characterized by\nthe proportions, in it, of the distinct homogeneal (or\n“uniform”) kinds, which have different degrees of\nrefrangibility (Schliesser 2004). \nTo see why Hume cannot “approve”, going beyond external\nproperties of bodies, let us take a brief detour through some core\nelements of Hume’s epistemology. For Hume, we build up our\ncausal theories from experience of particular events (see, for\ninstance, the demands at THN 1.3.14.6–15 and also the footnote\nat EHU 11.26). This is an important constraint for Hume because it\nallows him to ask who has ever perceived an instance of a power or\nforce in action. This is crucial for Hume’s attack on\ntheoretical and invisible entities. \nFor Hume all our simple ideas are derived from impressions (THN\n1.2.3.2–3). Hume’s attacks on notions of substance, mode,\nessence, force, power, self, and—of course—God, all rely\non his rhetorically powerful ability to ask to what impression such\nnotions can be traced (e.g., THN 1.1.6; 1.2.5.28; 1.4.14, and\n1.4.5.3–4; on idea of God, see EHU 2.6). For, “[I]deas\nalways represent the objects or impressions, from which they are\nderived” (THN 1.2.3.11). In the scholarly literature, this has\nbecome known as the “copy principle” (Garrett 1997:\nchapter 2). If no such objects or impressions are to be found, then\none must conclude that such ideas are the product of “passions\nand emotions” (THN 1.1.6.1), a “trivial suggestion of the\nfancy” (THN 1.4.7.6), or “some imperfection in [the]\nfaculties [of mind]” (THN 1.1.7.8). The thrust of Hume’s\naccount is to make talk of, say, substance or force (power, God, etc.)\nseem either meaningless or restricted to the particular qualities of\nbodies from which the idea is derived (THN 1.1.6.1; EHU 4.2.16). At\nbest, they have reference to “an effect, or some other event\nconstantly conjoined with” the cause (EHU 7.2.29; for a more\ndetailed account, see the entry on Hume   ).\n Thomas Reid, who saw what was at stake, described the strategy as\n“a tribunal of inquisition erected by certain modern\nphilosophers before which every thing in nature must answer”\n(An Inquiry into the Human Mind: or the Principles of Common\nSense, Chapter 6, Section VIII).     \nHume’s “science of man” will not permit a realist\ninterpretation of forces as real causes (see, for different arguments,\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997). When the sciences talk about forces or\npowers, these words must be reinterpreted (for example, the note to\nEHU, 4.2.16 tells us to look for this in section 7 of EHU). According\nto Hume, word’s like “force” and “power”\nhave, at best, a reference to “an effect, or some other\nevent”. And  \nForce, Power, Energy…[these] words, as commonly used, have very\nloose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very uncertain and\nconfused. (EHU 7.2.29; cf. THN 1.3.14.27)  \nHume denies here the fundamental achievement of the\n Principia.[4]\n Rather, he offers a reinterpretation of Newton (Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016). \nThis is made very clear by his addition to the Treatise: I\nmust, he writes,  \nconfine our speculations to the appearances of objects to our senses,\nwithout entering into disquisitions concerning their real nature and\noperations.  \nHume is willing to grant that Newton has experimentally discovered\nvarious “principles”. But given Hume’s aversion to\ntalk of forces, it is likely that he thinks these principles must be\nunderstood at best as a means to keep track of the phenomena. This is,\nin fact, for Hume the  \nNewtonian philosophy … rightly understood …\nNothing is more suitable to that philosophy, than a modest skepticism\nto a certain confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human\ncapacity. (THN 1.2.5.26n12; emphasis in original)  \nIn context, Hume re-describes the Newtonian commitment to a vacuum. So\nwhen, elsewhere, Hume describes the “philosopher” [i.e.,\nNewton] who had “determined the laws and forces, by which the\nrevolutions of the planets are governed and directed”, (EHU 1.8)\nhis language of “forces” must be interpreted in light of\nhis deflationary commitments. \nOne may think that Hume’s use of “Newtonian\nphilosophy” in the addition to the Treatise suggests\nthat Hume has described Newton’s natural philosophy as Newton\nunderstood it (as understood by Hume). But this is not likely because\nelsewhere he writes,  \nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at the end of EHU\n7.1.25: a note on Hume’s Terminology: God is the “first\ncause;” “second causes” are ordinary finite causes\nthat operate in nature)  \nSo, first, Hume’s Newton accepts some real causes in nature;\nHume’s Newton is neither a skeptic about causation nor an\noccasionalist (Leibniz had raised this concern in his exchange with\nClarke). Second, Hume is careful to distinguish Newton from the\nNewtonians (for more evidence on this, see\n section 4.2). \nThus, a more likely interpretation is that Hume believes he has\noffered a prescriptive interpretation of how Newtonian philosophy\nshould be viewed in light of the results of his “science of\nman” (which shows the limitations of our cognitive capacity),\nand his restrictive form of Empiricism which contribute to his\n“modest” (or “mitigated”) skepticism. Hume may\nwell have thought himself as an internal critic or “cautious\nNewtonian”. For Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\nexperience. Nevertheless, the “copy principle” guides how\nHume believes how “experiment” or\n“experience”—authoritative for Newton as well as\nHume—should be analyzed. This may be why Hume claims that Boyle\nand Newton have shown the road to the “true philosophy”,\nnot that they completed it. One way to understand Hume’s\n“science of man” is to see it, then, as the fulfillment of\nthe Newtonian philosophy, “rightly understood”, that is,\nby Hume. \nWhile Hume does not match Berkeley’s detail in offering\narguments or in explaining how to reinterpret Newtonian invisible\nentities, Hume does not accept that we can know that invisible causal\nforces operate in a largely empty universe as anything other than\nuseful means to track the appearances. In fact, there is no room in\nHume’s explanatory model for invisible forces acting as causes.\nThis becomes clear if we reflect on a passage that has received\nintense scrutiny in the context of the problem of induction (which we\nignore for present purposes; for Hume’s skepticism see\n section 4.2): \nWe are determined by custom alone to suppose the future conformable to\nthe past. When I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, my mind\nis immediately carry’d by habit to the usual effect, and\nanticipates my sight by conceiving the second ball in motion. There is\nnothing in these objects, abstractly considered, and independent of\nexperience, which leads me to form any such conclusion: and even after\nI have had experience of many repeated effects of this kind, there is\nno argument, which determines me to suppose, that the effect will be\nconformable to past experience. The powers, by which bodies operate,\nare entirely unknown. We perceive only their sensible qualities: and\nwhat reason have we to think, that the same powers will always be\nconjoined with the same sensible qualities?  \nTis not, therefore, reason, which is the guide of life, but custom.\nThat alone determines the mind, in all instances, to suppose the\nfuture conformable to the past. However easy this step may seem,\nreason would never, to all eternity, be able to make it. (THN Abstract\n15–16) \nHume here is calling attention to the (terse) argument of\nTreatise 1.3.6. Our interest is in his claim that  \n[t]he powers, by which bodies operate, are entirely unknown. We\nperceive only their sensible qualities: and what reason have we to\nthink, that the same powers will always be conjoined with the same\nsensible qualities?  \nIn dialectical context, Hume is here presupposing (i) an explanatory\nmodel familiar from Locke (and Spinoza, Aristotle, Boyle, etc.) in\nwhich hidden powers (insensible qualities) of an entity are (causally)\nresponsible for the sensible qualities. So, it is completely natural\nfor early modern natural philosophers to say that these sensible\nqualities express the essence. These hidden powers may be (part of)\nthe essence of the entity or (as Newton suggests about gravity in the\nthird rule of reasoning) universal qualities of an entity. So,\nHume’s implied targets accept something akin to (i). That is not\ninsignificant because (i) is the main explanatory template of early\nmodern science. \nNow, if one accepts (i), then the problem of induction reveals two\n(related) problems: (a) one concerns the connection among\nsensible qualities, and (b) the other concerns the connection between\nhidden qualities and the visible qualities. So, if one accepts (i),\none might have thought, for example, that routinely (if not\nexception-less) conjoined sensible qualities must always presuppose\nthe same combination of hidden/invisible qualities that produce them.\nSo, one could solve the problem associated with (a) by an appeal to\nhidden qualities. In thinking this one could, in fact, appeal to a\nsame effect/same cause principle of the sort Newton articulates in the\nsecond rule of reasoning: “to the same natural effects we must,\nas far as possible, assign the same causes”. To be sure,\nNewton’s version of the rule recognizes exceptions and is\nclearly regulative (“as far as possible”) and it does not\nrely on (i). Rather, in Newton the rule is a direct consequence of a\nparsimony principle (“admit no more causes of natural things\nthan such as are both true and sufficient to explain their\nappearances”). \nBut as Hume discerns, the explanatory model of (i) lacks resources to\nsecure anything like “same visible effect/same hidden\ncause”. That’s because Hume thinks there is always a\nbarrier in moving from sensible qualities to the structure of hidden\nqualities. (In the literature on Newton, who also rejects (i), this is\ncalled the “transduction problem” since an influential\narticle by McGuire 1970a.) Hume makes this point fully explicit in the\nfirst Enquiry: “he has not, by all his experience,\nacquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power, by which the one\nobject produces the other” (EHU 5.4). \nThis is why Hume’s philosophy of science is so deflationary: all\nany science can show is the relations that obtain among visible\nqualities, and perhaps those that can be represented on an analogy\nwith them (see Landy 2017). These relations can be grouped together\nand given names (“elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse”) and be treated as\n“causes” of the phenomena, but these names do not signify\nor explain features of hidden powers. In Hume’s philosophy of\nscience, science remains at the surface. Hume made the point explicit\nin a note added to the Treatise:  \nIf the Newtonian philosophy be rightly understood it will be found to\nmean no more. A vacuum is asserted: That is, bodies are said to be\nplac’d after such a manner, as to receive bodies betwixt them,\nwithout impulsion or penetration. The real nature of this position of\nbodies is unknown. We are only acquainted with its effects on the\nsenses, and its power of receiving body. (THN 1.2.5.26n12 (App.)) \nThis barrier between visible and hidden qualities/powers is\nindependent of the more fundamental problem of induction that even\nwhen one grasps, in some way, the structure of the hidden qualities\nordinarily responsible for conjunction of sensible qualities, one\ncannot feel secure about their presence and role in any claim one\nmakes about sensible qualities. For, a different set of hidden\nqualities may be responsible for any ordinarily conjoined set of\nsensible qualities. (Hume here discerns the outlines of the problem of\nmultiple realization as a general metaphysical problem.) That, in\naddition, nature may change its course (and so change the\nconfiguration of hidden qualities that produce sensible qualities)\nmeans that the main explanatory framework of early modern science (i)\nis without foundation (see also Belkind 2019). \nIt is often argued that the subtitle of the Treatise,\n“Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into\nMoral Subjects”, shows Hume’s self-conscious debt to\nNewton. Experiments certainly play an important role in Newton’s\nscience. But only after 1712 does Newton refer to his own philosophy\nas “experimental” (in the context of his polemic with\nLeibniz; see Shapiro 2004). In general, Newton emphasizes the\nmathematical nature of his philosophy; he calls attention to this in\nthe full title of the Principia: Mathematical Principles of\nNatural Philosophy. \nHowever one interprets Hume’s “experimental method”,\nit is in no sense mathematical. Hume’s so-called\n“experiments” do not have the tacit logic of Newtonian\nexperiments; they almost never offer measurements (which are very\nimportant for Newton’s focus on successive approximation); they\ndo not connect to a tight mathematical structure (Smith 2002).\nMoreover, by the standards of Newtonian natural philosophy, many of\nHume’s so-called “experiments”, for all their\ningenuity (see, e.g., the eight experiments at THN 2.2.2), have a\nrather simple structure. They are more akin to systematic observations\n(cf. THN I.8, 1.3.8.3, 1.3.12.11, 3.3.1.10). In fact, there is\n(almost) nothing to distinguish Humean “experiment” from\nnormal, daily experience. In Hume the word “experiment”\nseems to be nearly synonymous with “experience”, which is\nnot uncommon in the period. This interpretation is also suggested by\nHume’s description of his experiments as being based on “a\ncautious observation of human life” (THN\n“Introduction”). This is why Hume can claim that  \nexperimental inference and reasoning concerning the actions of others\nenters so much into human life, that no man, while awake, is ever a\nmoment without employing it. (EHU 8.1.17)  \nEven if we allow for some hyperbole, it would betray considerable\nignorance to confuse Newton’s “experimental method”\nwith ordinary human “experimental inference and\nreasoning”. \nSo it is not so much the production of data that makes Hume’s\nmethod experimental rather than his way of “processing”\nthe data gathered in various forms of experiments. This method can be\nreconstructed as a version of analysis and synthesis inspired by\nNewton’s Opticks (see\n section 4.8\n below), that begins with phenomena from the historical and everyday\nobservation of human behavior, and its analysis proceeds by such\n“experiments … judiciously collected and\ncompar’d” (THN I.10), in order to arrive at analogies\namong various instances “from the observation of several\nparallel instances” (EHU 8.13). The products of comparative\nanalysis so conducted are the principles of various faculties, like\nperception, imagination, reason, etc., whose interaction results in\nideas and impressions causing behaviour, but their contribution can\nhardly be measured and the principles of their interaction can hardly\nbe quantified—not even in principle (see also Hume’s\nanti-mathematicism discussed in\n section 4.7).\n So their relations cannot be represented in an algebraic way, in\nterms of relations of quantities, so they cannot be mathematized\neither. Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them. \nThese findings are generalized by induction: “What I discover to\nbe true in some instances, I suppose to be so in all” (THN\n2.1.5.1), and consequently, they are fallible, and the account of\nhuman nature founded on them may be misconstrued (THN 1.2.5.19). Even\nif it is sometimes possible  \nto attain what natural philosophers, after Lord BACON, have affected\nto call the experimentum crucis, or that experiment which points out\nthe right way in any doubt or ambiguity. (EPM 5.17)  \nIt is rarely so. Therefore, inquiry into moral matters is just as\nopen-ended as inquiry into natural matters, and the cure is the same\nhere as there, pretty much as Newton envisaged: it is in further\nenquiry (Smith 2002: 160–161). So, for Hume experimental\nfindings can and need to be further refined by methods that rightly\nbelong to the family of Newtonian successive approximations: by\nexploring exceptions and limitations, or by eliminating superfluous\nconditions in order to identify the efficacious one (Demeter 2019b). One could see this feature\nof Hume’s method as anticipating Mill’s method of\ndifference as much as resembling Newton of Opticks (see\n Section 3.3 of the entry on John Stuart Mill). \nIn our analysis of Hume’s “science of man”, we have\nalready encountered Hume’s claim that we are unable to penetrate\ninto the internal constitution of matter\n (section 3).\n So, however else Hume’s skepticism is understood—and it\nhas been the subject of intense scholarly discussion (including the\nso-called “New Hume” debate, see Read & Richman 2000)\nduring the last three decades—the science of man has skeptical\nimplications with regard to his interpretation of Newton’s\nphilosophy. Hume’s evaluation of Newton is an additional source\nof evidence in understanding the nature of Hume’s skepticism.\nThis evidence reveals that in evaluating Newton’s achievement\nHume is pessimistic about the extent and possibility of knowledge of\nnature. It also shows that Hume rejected important Newtonian\nstandards/criteria in evaluating the claims of natural philosophy. \nIn The History of England, Hume writes: \nBoyle was a great partizan of the mechanical philosophy: a theory,\nwhich, by discovering some of the secrets of nature, and allowing us\nto imagine the rest, is so agreeable to the natural vanity and\ncuriosity of men…While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from\nsome of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the\nimperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her\nultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever\nwill remain. (HE VI, 542; emphasis added) \nThis quote reveals crucial details about Hume’s position in\nthree areas: a) Hume’s understanding of the relative merits of\nNewton’s philosophy and the mechanical philosophy of Boyle; b)\nHume’s attitude toward criteria of intelligibility; c)\nHume’s skepticism. \nFirst, Hume treats Newton’s account as a refutation of the\nmechanical philosophy. Yet, while as we have seen\n (section 3),\n Hume certainly saw it as part of the road to “true\nphilosophy”, he does not view Newton’s achievement as a\ndecisive advance in knowledge of nature but, instead, as decisive\nevidence for the claim that nature will remain unknowable in\nprinciple. Hume understands Newton’s success as a double-edged\nsword: even if Newton removed a source of error and/or enlarged our\nknowledge, he did so at the cost of undermining any hope of\nestablishing what we might call a “final theory” (see the\n entry on physicalism).\n Moreover, it is by no means clear whether Hume is willing to accept\nNewtonian natural philosophy as a form of knowledge. A natural reading\nof the passage is to conclude that Hume views Newton as successfully\n(to use an anachronistic term) falsifying the mechanists’\nprogram, while Hume hedges his bets on offering any evaluation of the\npositive side of Newton’s system (notice also the grudging use\nof “seemed”). \nThe way to make sense of Hume’s remarks in The History of\nEngland is that they reveal that he implicitly accepts the\nMechanists’ insistence—explicitly associated with\nBoyle—that theirs was the only program that offered the\npossibility of intelligible explanation (even if in the hands of many\nof its practitioners it only offered hope of post-facto rational\nreconstruction; see also Hume on Causation in\n section 4.4).\n Hume’s treatment of Boyle reveals that he thought it was a good\nthing Newton falsified the mechanical philosophy. Hume acknowledges\nthat the mechanical philosophy could offer some successful\nexplanations. But he emphasizes that its practitioners were likely to\noverestimate—on psychological and methodological\ngrounds—its potential. Hume appears to have assimilated\nNewton’s devastating criticisms of the mechanical\nphilosophy. \nFurthermore, the passage in The History of England, lends\nsupport for a skeptical interpretation of Hume’s philosophy.\nHume thinks the Newtonian project will enable some knowledge of nature\nat the cost of keeping a “final theory” permanently\nunavailable to human inquiry. Earlier Hume had offered a positive\naccount of the explanatory principles knowable to mankind:  \nElasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by\nimpulse; these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which\nwe shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves\nsufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can\ntrace up the particular phenomena to, or near to, these general\nprinciples. (EHU 4.1.12)  \nLet’s leave aside, for the moment, the ultimate metaphysical\nstatus of “ultimate causes and principles” in Hume’s\nthought. He is willing to accept that some limited set of fundamental\nscientific laws (i.e., “ultimate causes and principles”)\nare available to human researchers. (Hume hedges his bets a bit; note\nhis use of “probably”.) Moreover, these four principles\nare all associated with Newton’s project; the mechanical\nphilosophy had only accepted communication of motion by impulse as an\nexplanatory principle. Of course, Hume treats these laws not so much\nas describing genuine “causes” or “powers” of\nnature, but rather—in opposition to Newton’s own view\nwhich insisted on the reality and causal nature of forces (Janiak\n2007)—as a way to keep track of the appearances (recall\n section 3\n above). \nFinally, these passages show that Hume rules out that we could ever\nhope to explain the causes of these laws (or unify them in some more\nultimate principle). Newton would agree he did not know the cause of\nthese laws (“General Scholium”, Principia), but\nhe would treat it as a question open to further research and\nspeculation. In the context of a discussion of the doctrine of\noccasionalism, Hume shows he is aware of this:  \nSir Isaac Newton (tho’ some of his Followers have taken a\ndifferent Turn of thinking) plainly rejects it, but substituting the\nHypothesis of an Aetheral Fluid, not the immediate Volition of the\nDeity, as the Cause of Attraction. (“A Letter From a Gentleman\nto his Friend in Edinburgh”, THN p. 429)  \nThis quote is revealing in two more ways: besides showing that Hume\nmay have been aware of some of Newton’s attempts at articulating\na mechanism for the operation of attraction (i.e., Newton’s\nletters to Bentley or Boyle; see Newton 2004), Hume recognizes that\nNewton’s followers can deviate from Newton (recall\n section 3). \nIn light of the text of The History of England (VI, 542)\nquoted at the start of this sub-section, it is clear Hume thinks that\nNewton’s laws are not sufficient for explaining all of nature.\nSo without (yet) taking a stance on how to interpret Hume’s\ntreatment of induction or his account of causation, one can\ndistinguish two further strands of Hume’s skepticism: i) Hume\ntreats Newton as showing conclusively that the domain of possible\nknowledge will leave parts of nature unknown forever; ii) in\nparticular, this will include the cause(s) behind our fundamental\nprinciples. The combination of (i–ii) entails that Newtonian\nnatural theology—a very popular eighteenth century intellectual\nenterprise (see the\n entry on natural theology and natural religion)—is\n based on shaky foundations. \nTogether with Hume’s emphasis on accounting for the phenomena in\nhis interpretation of Newtonian philosophy, Hume is far removed from\nNewton’s realist ontology of interacting forces (Janiak 2007;\nSmeenk & Schliesser 2013). Two further sources for this difference\nare revealed when we analyze Hume’s departure from\nNewton’s account of causation\n (§4.4)\n and Newton’s rules of reasoning\n (§4.5). \nOne of Hume’s great claims to fame is his articulation of what\nhas come to be known as the “problem of induction”, or, to\nuse language closer to Hume’s: the problematic status of\ninferences. An informal way to express his insight is that no claim to\nknowledge of matters of fact ought to be thought of as definitive\nbecause in all of our inductive reasoning (or inferences) we\npresuppose that the future will be the same as the past. But we can\nnever be certain that the future will be the same as the past because\nthe evidence for the assumption is based on the uniformity of nature\nin the past. The uniformity of nature is presupposed in our knowledge,\nbut our belief in it cannot be secured by reason. Infamously, Hume\nclaimed the source of the belief is not reason but habit and our\nconfidence in it is derived from instinct (see Millican 1995). While\nthere is ongoing scholarly debate over the extent of Hume’s\nskepticism that follows from this insight, it is less controversial\nthat for Hume knowledge of matters of fact, whatever its ultimate\nstatus in Hume’s thought, is always tentative, subject to\nrevision. This is known as fallibilism. While Hume’s argument\nappears unique to him (although elements of it are prefigured in\nBerkeley and the Dutch Newtonian, Willem ’s Gravesande), the\nposition is anticipated by Newton. \nNewton’s fourth rule of reasoning reads: \nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by\ninduction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena\nmake such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions.\n(Newton 2004, Principia, Book III, Rule IV) \nThe rule is that we should treat well-confirmed propositions as true\n(or nearly true) until there are deviations that promote new research,\nwhich, in turn, lead us to refine our original propositions or reject\nthem for new ones (Smith 2002). But while one has a theory, one must\nnot be distracted by possible differing explanations for the found\nregularities until one has empirical reason. One accepts a theory as\ntrue as a means to developing a better theory. As Newton writes in the\n“Preface” to the Principia, “the principles\nset down here will shed some light on either this mode of\nphilosophizing or some truer one” (emphasis added). Thus, Newton accepts that\nphysical inquiry is forward-looking and may be open-ended; not only\nits theories may evolve, but also its methods. Rule IV implicitly\naccepts that the future may bring surprises and new evidence, and,\nthus, anticipates Hume’s fallibilistic insights. As commentators\non Hume have noted, this strand of Hume’s skepticism is shared\nby Newton. It is less clear if Hume learned it from Newton because\nthere is no evidence that he was acquainted with Newton’s fourth\nrule of reasoning (added to the third edition of the\nPrincipia); there is no equivalent in Hume’s rules of\nreasoning to Newton’s fourth rule. In the section on\nHume’s Rule of Reasoning\n (§4.5),\n the significance of the absence of an equivalent to Newton’s\nrule 4 in Hume’s thought is explored. \nIn\n section 3,\n we saw that Hume rejected Newtonian forces as real causes; he argues\nthat we must reinterpret forces and powers as being ideas about\neffects (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony & Schliesser 2016). In that\nsection no reference to Hume’s widely discussed views on\ncausation was made. In this section Hume’s account of causation\nis analyzed. Given our focus on the Hume-Newton relationship no stance\non the most controversial issue in Hume scholarship are taken: are\ncauses mere (psychological) regularity or are they found in nature.\nHowever, recall that Hume insists that  \nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at EHU 7.1.25)\n \nSo Hume’s Newton accepts some real causes in nature. \nHume’s account of causality covers at least five related issues:\n(1) how we acquire an idea of cause; (2) what we mean by\n“cause;” (3) how we reason about causes; (4) whether\ncauses are in the mind or in nature; (5) how we could infer the\nexistence of causes. In this section, we explore how Hume’s\ntreatment of what we mean by “cause” illustrates\nHume’s critical response to and departure from Newton’s\nphilosophy (see also Schliesser 2007). Hume’s treatment of\ncausation straightforwardly rejects at least two kinds of causes that\nappear in Newton’s philosophy: final causes and simultaneous\ncauses (Schliesser 2009). Moreover, we show that the structure of\nHumean causes is deeply indebted to the Pre-Newtonian mechanical\nphilosophy associated with Boyle. \nHume analyzes how “our” notion of causality—one\napplying to events that are contiguous, exhibit temporal priority of\nthe cause, and have constant conjunction (THN 1.3, Sections 2, 6, and\n15)—is derived from experiencing constant conjunction of objects\nthat produce a union in the imagination (THN 1.3.6.16). Hume’s\naccount is causal in its own terms, that is, his two definitions of\nthe meaning of “cause” (THN 1.3.14.31) are patterned on\nthe chain of events that he thinks lead people to acquire the idea of\ncause. Hume’s analysis is a first approximation of and unifies\nwhat “Moderns” tend to mean by “causation”. In\nhis hands, a redefined version of Aristotelian “efficient\ncausation” is the only kind of causation available for use (THN\n1.3.14.32). There is, thus, a stipulative quality to Hume’s\ndiscussion (see also the treatment of his Rules of Reasoning, THN\n1.3.15 discussed in\n section 4.5).\n One of the tacit targets of Hume’s approach is Newton. For\nHume’s treatment of causation rules out the permissibility of\nNewton’s appeal to “final causes” in the\njustification of the (inductive and probable) argument from design in\nthe “General Scholium” of the Principia:\n“we know [the Deity] only by his most wise and excellent\ncontrivances of things, and final causes” (for discussion, see\nStein 2002). \nMoreover, while Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\n“experience”, there are further serious tensions between\nHume’s account of causation and the contents of Newton’s\nnatural philosophy. For Newton, the behavior of the moon in its orbit\nand that of, say, apples falling on the earth have the same cause:\nnamely, the force of gravity, or weight, towards the earth\n(Principia, Book III, Scholium to Proposition IV, Theorem\nIV). This conflicts with the contiguity requirement, which Hume\nconsiders “essential” to “causation” (THN 1.3.2.6).\nIt is hard to see how contiguity could be made consistent with the\nuniversal nature of attraction. The most distant particles of the\nuniverse attract each other. (The contiguity requirement notably\ndisappears in EHU.) More important, according to Newton the\nacceleration produced by the exercise of a force is simultaneous with\nthat exercise—thus defying temporal priority (Smeenk &\nSchliesser 2013). Hume claims that temporal priority of the cause is\n“of no great importance” (THN 1.3.2.8), yet it appears\nexplicitly or implicitly throughout his treatment of causation. Be\nthat as it may, Hume explicitly attacks the possibility of an effect\nbeing simultaneous with its cause (THN 1.3.2.7–8; Ryan\n2003). \nFinally, there is a fundamental structural similarity between Humean\ncauses and the causes favored by pre-Newtonian Mechanical philosophers\n(i.e., Boyle, Huygens, etc; for a different argument, see McGuire\n1972). They have the same structure: i.e., priority of the cause over\nthe effect, contiguity, and constant conjunction. Now, to be sure,\nHume is aware that Newton decisively refuted the Mechanical\nPhilosophy’s program which insisted that explanations be cast in\nterms of the impact of colliding bodies\n (section 4.2).\n Hume rejects the ontological and explanatory reductionism of the\nMechanical philosophy. Hume introduces eight “rules by which to\njudge of causes and effects” (see\n section 4.5\n below) because it is “possible for all objects to become causes\nor effects to each other” (THN 1.3.15). This is why Hume’s\nlist of “ultimate causes” and “general\nprinciples”—“Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse” (EHU 4.1.12)—is more\ninclusive than the Mechanical philosophy would allow. \nSo, even if we leave aside the controversial question to what degree\nHume would allow the existence and our potential knowledge of real\ncauses in nature (as discussed in the “new Hume” debate),\nhis analysis of what we mean by “cause” is hostile to\nNewtonian natural philosophy. Hume rules out final and simultaneous\ncauses. The former play only a role in Newton’s theology and\nnatural religion, but the latter are an integral part of what we could\nhis “science”. \nConsider these passages: \nIn Treatise 1.3.15, Hume states eight “rules by which\nto judge of causes and effects” (see the block-quote above)\nbecause it is “possible for all objects to become causes or\neffects to each other”. The source of these rules is ambiguous.\nAlthough they “might have been supply’d by the natural\nprinciples of our understanding” (THN 1.3.15.11), Hume provides\nno evidence for this. Nevertheless, Hume thinks it is\n“proper” to employ them in his “reasoning”\n(THN 1.3.15.11; 1.3.15.2). Earlier in the Treatise, he was even more\nadamant about the regulative character of these rules:  \nWe shall afterwards take notice of some general rules, by which we\nought to regulate our judgment concerning causes and effects; and\nthese rules are form’d on the nature of our understanding, and\non our experience of its operations in the judgments we form\nconcerning objects. (emphasis added, THN 1.3.13.11; see de Pierris 2001)  \nSo, while these rules may be derived from reflection on how our minds\nwork or some may be derived “from experience” (THN\n1.3.15.6), they prescribe how we should ascribe causes to\n“objects” in the world, especially in “most of our\nphilosophical reasonings”. But on Hume’s definition of a\ncause (rules 1–3), rules 4–8 are at most useful\nstipulations (Hume uses “to fix” at THN 1.3.15.2) that\nhelp one identify causal relations. This is not the place to resolve\nhow Hume is entitled to the normative character of these rules (see\nMartin 1993). Now we examine these rules and their debt to\nNewton’s. \nThe first three rules define what it is to be cause and effect: as we\nhave seen, they must be contiguous in space and time; the cause must\nbe a prior to the effect; there must a constant union between cause\nand effect (THN 1.3.15.3–5). With the exception of these first\nthree (see\n section 4.4),\n Hume’s rules of reasoning have a strong resemblance to\nNewton’s four “Rules for the Study of Natural\nPhilosophy” outlined at the start of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia (third edition). For example, Hume’s fourth\nrule, “The same cause always produces the same effect, and the\nsame effect never arises but from the same cause”, is explained\nby  \n[F]or when by any clear experiment I have discover’d the causes\nor effects of any phænomenon, I immediately extend our\nobservation to every phenomenon of the same kind.  \nThis echoes Newton’s second rule of\n reasoning,[5]\n especially in its generalizing tendency, which Newton explicitly\nasserts in his third\n rule.[6]\n That is to say, in his fourth rule, Hume makes explicit what is\nimplied by the simplicity of nature assumption in Newton’s first\n rule:[7]\n that the same cause always produces the same effect. Also,\nHume’s fifth rule is an articulation of Newton’s first and\nthird rules. Hume’s sixth rule is itself an extension of\nHume’s fifth. \nHume’s seventh and eighth rules do not directly echo\nNewton’s four rules. Hume admits, however, that one should be\ncautious in applying and extending the seventh rule because one cannot\nextrapolate from a “few experiments” (THN 1.3.15.9; he\nappeals to the rule at 2.2.8.4). The example Hume offers (on the\nrelationship between heat and pleasure/pain) is about a mental\nphenomenon. Even so we think there is an important critical\nrelationship between Hume’s Rule VII and Newtonian gravitation\n(what follows is taken over from Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\nrelationship is not explicit in his text, it is established by\nHume’s wording, which closely follows Newton’s phrasing in\ndiscussing gravity in the Principia: In his Book 3,\nProposition 7, Corollary 1, Newton describes gravitation as an action\nin which “every attraction toward a whole arises from the\nattractions toward the individual parts”. In Rule VII, Hume\nspeaks in these same terms, arguing that a quality that\n“encreases or diminishes with the encrease or diminution of its\ncause”, should be “regarded as a compounded effect,\nderiv’d from the union of the several different effects, which\narise from the several different parts of the cause”. And,\nelsewhere in the Treatise, Hume writes explicitly of the\nforce of gravitation using just this language (THN 1.3.2.16). On the\nface of it, then, Hume’s Rule VII seems to adopt Newtonian\nlanguage in order to provide an alternative description of the kind of\nextrapolation involved in establishing Newtonian gravitation. \nBut only the first half of Rule VII is compatible with Newton’s\nscience. In the latter half, Hume turns against Newton, warning\nagainst the attempt to “draw such a conclusion from a few\nexperiments” (THN 1.3.15.9). Indeed, we know quite well that\neffects can vary proportionately within a certain range of experience\nand yet behave completely differently outside of this range. Hume\ngives the example of our experience of fire.  \nA certain degree of heat gives pleasure; if you diminish that heat,\nthe pleasure diminishes; but it does not follow, that if you augment\nit beyond a certain degree, the pleasure will likewise augment; for we\nfind that it degenerates into pain.  \nThis argument, made with respect to heat, is no less applicable to the\nNewtonian force of gravitation: what appears to be a strictly\nproportional relation over a given range of experience can turn into\nsomething quite different when one strays from this range. \nWhat we have, therefore, is as follows. Newton’s Rule III, which\nis the basis for the claimed universality for his law of gravitation,\nis met and replaced by Hume’s Rule VII, whose intent is in a\ncertain sense precisely the opposite: The so-called universal law of\ngravitation must be regarded only as characterizing a certain range of\nhuman experience and no more. Extension of this law beyond our\nexperience (or beyond what “perceptible models” allow for,\nsee Landy 2017), whether into the heavens or the microworld, cannot be\nadmitted into science (except as “hypothesis”). And the\nsame will have to be said for all other qualities that are attributed\nto bodies significantly outside of the bounds of our actual\nexperience. What to Newton is nothing less than the “foundation\nof all natural philosophy”—his Rule III—is in\nHume’s philosophy shown to be unnecessary for scientific\nreasoning and of questionable validity. \nThis suggests that it is Newton’s Rule II that Hume considers to\nbe “Newton’s chief rule of philosophizing”—an\ninterpretation that fits well with what Hume writes about method in\nboth the Treatise and in his later writings. It also\nreinforces the view that Hume rejects Rule III as being that part of\nNewton’s philosophy that is worthy of being adopted and\nimitated. Indeed, Hume’s point is precisely that it is\nNewton’s Rule II, chiefly, that we should be interested in. Rule\nIII, with its extravagant claims concerning the presence of supposedly\nessential qualities in every body in the universe far from common life\nis one we can afford to set aside. The view we have presented here is\nat odds with that of Graciela de Pierris, who builds her discussion of\nHume’s debt to Newton around Hume’s putative embrace of\nNewton’s Rule III as the cornerstone for his philosophical\nmethod (de Pierris 2006:\n306–310, 312; for detailed criticism see Hazony & Schliesser\n2016). \nHume’s eighth rule is, as Hume himself implies, a refinement of\nHume’s fourth rule; it prevents over-zealous causal ascription\nto an object. (In his explanation of the rule, Hume presupposes the\nspatial and temporal contiguity requirement of cause and effect, but\nit is not an essential feature of the rule.) But the first part of it\n(“an object, which exists for any time in its full perfection\nwithout any effect”) appears to target non-Newtonian theological\nor Spinozistic arguments, so will not be discussed here. \nOn Hume’s interpretation, Newton’s second rule is the only\nrule that is said to be derived (un-controversially) “from\nexperience” (THN 1.3.15.6). It is a crucial rule because the\nfifth and sixth rules are, by Hume’s lights, extensions of the\nfourth (THN 1.3.15.7–8). Moreover, the conjunction of\nHume’s fourth and seventh rules produces a new rule: “An\neffect always holds proportion with its cause” (“Of\nInterest”, EMPL 297). We can call this Hume’s ninth rule.\nIf one assumes (or prescribes) that linear causal relationships are\nthe only possible ones, this new rule allows Hume to rule out\ncompeting claims that posit the existence of causal relationships that\nare not “proportional”. Hume can use the rule as a\nconstraint on theory. It plays a prominent role in Hume’s\npolitical economy when he rejects Mercantilism and, more important for\nour present purposes, in his criticism of the use of analogy in the\nNewtonian argument from Design (see EHU XI, and Dialogues\nParts V–VII). \nHume’s ninth rule also has Newtonian debts. Since the time of\nAristotle, many philosophers have asserted proportionality between\ncause and effect in one fashion or another. Hume’s ninth rule\nechoes, for instance, a principle Leibniz uses quite frequently: the\nprinciple of the equality of cause and effect. It is the basis of\narguments Leibniz gives for his conservation principles (e.g.,\nSpecimen Dynamicum). But Leibniz’s formulation is in terms of\nequality and not proportionality. Unlike Leibniz and other Cartesians,\nNewton preferred to reason in terms of proportionality. Although\nHume’s ninth rule is not derived from any of Newton’s\nofficial Rules of Reasoning, Newton does implicitly use a rule like\nHume’s ninth throughout the Principia. For example, the\nimportance of a proportion between cause and effect is emphasized\nthroughout the treatment of the behavior of bodies in resisting fluids\n(e.g., the Scholium to Proposition 40, Book 2, Section 7, especially\nExperiment 14), which, given the importance, for Hume, of treating\nmoney as a fluid (“Of the Balance of Trade”, EMPL\n312–315; see Schabas 2001) may have caught Hume’s\nattention. Hume also treats resistance in his footnote to the EHU,\n7.1.15. Moreover, there is a prominent place in the Principia\n(the Scholium following Proposition 69, Book I, Section 11), where\nNewton implicitly transforms a version of Hume’s seventh rule\ninto Hume’s ninth rule in which proportionality is emphasized.\nIn this Scholium, Newton starts employing the language and emphasizing\nthe importance of proportionality. This is not ruled out by\nNewton’s own “rules”, but it was not emphasized\nthere. This passage could have attracted Hume’s attention for\ntwo reasons: it is one of the few explicit methodological passages in\nthe Principia, and it offers an account of what Newton means\nby “attraction”. Hume was almost certainly aware of this\npassage because the proper meaning of “attraction” is\ndiscussed, with explicit appeal to Newton’s intentions, in\nHume’s footnote to EHU 7.1.25. Hume makes the ninth rule\nexplicit and uses it as a constraint with which competing theories (in\npolitical economy, the argument from design, etc) can be ruled out.\nHume’s use of it in his attack on the design argument is an\ninstance where Hume attacks Newton with Newtonian tools. \nMoreover, there are two connected, important further differences\nbetween Hume’s and Newton’s rules. First, Hume never quite\nendorses the universal reach implied by Newton’s third rule. For\nNewton we extend the known qualities of bodies within our experimental\nreach to all bodies in the universe. While it could be compatible with\nNewton’s third rule, Hume’s fourth rule does not go that\nfar. There is one instance where Hume appears to accept an implication\nof Newton’s rule: “The production of motion by impulse and\ngravity is an universal law, which has hitherto admitted of no\nexception” (EHU 6.4). Leaving aside the fact that this would a\nvery puzzling way to express the inverse-square law, the context makes\nclear that Hume has in mind causes that “are entirely uniform\nand constant” on Earth, not their universal reach; this is why\nin context his other examples involve the burning of fire and the\nsuffocation of every human creature by water. There is textual support\nto suspect that Hume would deny the universal scope implied by\nNewton’s third rule. Hume states a “maxim” in a\nfootnote to section XI of EHU which argues against inferring new\neffects from any cause only “known only by its particular\neffects”. This denies Newton’s strategy of making ever\nmore audacious inferences (about planetary motions, the tides, the\nshape of the Earth, comets, etc) based on the acceptance of universal\ngravity (recall Hume’s treatment of Newton’s methodology\nin HE, VI, 542, discussed in\n section 3).[8]\n The argument in favor of the “maxim” reveals the tension\nwith Newton’s third rule: \nTo say, that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the\nsame energy, which is already known from the first effects, will not\nremove the difficulty. For even granting this to be the case (which\ncan seldom be supposed), the very continuation and exertion of a like\nenergy (for it is impossible it can be absolutely the same), I say,\nthis exertion of a like energy, in a different period of space and\ntime, is a very arbitrary supposition. (EHU 11.26) \nNewton’s first three rules offer a bold methodological program\nthat attempts to unify science across different periods of space and\ntime; it is a bet on the causal unity of nature. The maxim cautions\nagainst overconfidence in this regard. Hume’s caution is\nprophetic because it turns out that sub-atomic entities behave very\ndifferently than macroscopic bodies. However, it is not entirely\ncertain if one should ascribe the “maxim” in the footnote\nto Hume because it is offered in the voice of a “friend”,\nwho is pretending to be Epicurus. \nSecond, Hume lacks an equivalent to Newton’s Rule 4. Hume is not\nalone in ignoring rule 4. Even Reid and Priestley, who have much to\nsay about the authority of Newton’s Rules of Reasoning, tend to\nignore the fourth rule (Tapper 2002). Adam Smith seems to have been\none of few eighteenth century figures to have taken it seriously\n(Schliesser 2005a and 2005b). Recall (from\n section 4.2)\n that Newton’s Rule IV can be viewed as (1) an encouragement to\nfind and exploit known deviations from the regularities one has\nestablished in order to make them “more exact”. (2) A\nproposal about how to treat a theory, that is, as true until proven\notherwise. Hume seems to have not appreciated the first point at all\n(Schliesser 2004). On the second point, we have seen that Hume shares\nNewton’s commitment to fallibilism. But this common commitment\nalso hides an important difference between Hume and Newton which is\nconnected to the observation just made about the contrast between\nNewton’s third rule and the maxim in the footnote to section XI\nof EHU. Newton’s fallibilism includes commitment to the truth of\nthe propositions within one’s scientific theory until it is\nproven to be false. Newton realizes that induction can never be\ncertain for all time; he does anticipate Hume in this respect. But it\nis also an expression of Newton’s “scientific\nnaturalism”. Empirical science is authoritative until one has\nempirical reason to refine theory. This means that at any time one\nrisks the danger of going beyond one’s evidence, but this is the\nmethodological price one must pay to make further progress. In his\neagerness to combat Newtonian superstition, Hume is willing to be more\ncautious. \nHume’s omission of an equivalent rule has several implications\nfor his philosophy and its relationship to Newton’s. First Hume\nreplaces the authority of natural philosophy by his own criterion, the\n“copy principle”, when it comes to existence claims (see\n section 2, of the entry on Hume).\n Only the ideas that can be traced to a distinct impression will be\npermissible. Thus, Hume’s “science of man”, or\n“true philosophy”, offers to evaluate the claims of\nnatural philosophy from a privileged position. This is the sense in\nwhich Hume is not a scientific naturalist. \nSecond, without commitment to the truth of a “scientific”\ntheory, Hume has conceptual elbow room for a distinction between the\nprovable, experimental claims of common life (including some parts of\nnatural philosophy) and the lesser, probable commitments of the more\nabstract parts of natural philosophy. This, too, is a result of\nHume’s “science of man”. Recall (from\n section 1)\n that the Humean practitioners of “mitigated scepticism”\nwill not  \nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations.  \nThe distinction between a provable common life and the far less\nprobable parts of natural philosophy runs through all of Hume’s\nmajor works. Yet, its implications for Hume’s attitude toward\nNewtonian natural philosophy are not discussed until the Dialogues.\nThere, Cleanthes, the spokesperson for a Newtonian natural religion,\nattacks the Humean position: \nThey are even obliged to acknowledge, that the most abstruse and\nremote objects are those, which are best explained by philosophy.\nLight is in reality anatomized: The true system of the heavenly bodies\nis discovered and ascertained. But the nourishment of bodies by food\nis still an inexplicable mystery: The cohesion of the parts of matter\nis still incomprehensible…In reality, would not a man be\nridiculous, who pretended to reject Newton’s explication of the\nwonderful phenomenon of the rainbow, because that explication gives a\nminute anatomy of the rays of light; a subject, forsooth, too refined\nfor human comprehension? And what would you say to one, who having\nnothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and\nGalileo for the motion of the earth, should withhold his assent, on\nthat general principle, That these subjects were too magnificent and\nremote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of\nmankind?… In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between\nscience and common life, or between one science and another. The\narguments, employed in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and\ncontain the same force and evidence. Or if there be any difference\namong them, the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and\nnatural religion. Many principles of mechanics are founded on very\nabstruse reasoning; yet no man, who has any pretensions to science,\neven no speculative sceptic, pretends to entertain the least doubt\nwith regard to them. The Copernican system contains the most\nsurprising paradox, and the most contrary to our natural conceptions,\nto appearances, and to our very senses: yet even monks and inquisitors\nare now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it.\n(Dialogues Part I) \nCleanthes points out that if philosophy asserts the distinction\nbetween common life and science, philosophy would set itself against\nsome of the best supported parts of natural philosophy which are often\nmost removed from common life. We may naturally think that the Sun is\nin motion, but the reality behind the appearances can be very\nsurprising. Cleanthes’s point is that philosophy cannot hope to\nargue against the authority of science without looking as backward as\nmonks and inquisitors (who attacked Copernicanism). \nFor our purposes, there are three important features in\nCleanthes’s discussion. First, he claims that the same kind of\ncorrect reasoning applies to all domains. This is a very popular\nargument among religious Newtonians (e.g., Reid). So just because\nscience deals with uncommon domains and obscure topics, it can still\ncontain “just reasoning”. This is, in fact, one of the\nmajor assumptions behind Hume’s own Rules of Reasoning. So,\nCleanthes uses Hume’s philosophy to undercut part of\nHume’s anti-Newtonian strategy. Even if Philo were not bound by\nHume’s philosophy (and there is no evidence he should be\nconsidered a strict spokesperson for Hume), as a defender of the\nepistemic priority of common life he has no resources to claim that\nthere is a different, correct form of reasoning for areas beyond\ncommon life. Second, if there is a debate between science and common\nlife, the advantage is with science. No skeptic, who at least pretends\nto be informed, is seriously willing to doubt the results of natural\nphilosophy. That is, by the last third of the eighteenth century\nnatural philosophy has an authoritative claim to knowledge even if it\nis founded on very uncommon, “abstruse” principles. Third,\nCleanthes assimilates the success of natural philosophy to theology\nand natural religion; he does not recognize a principled distinction\nbetween science and religion. If Philo attacks natural religion he\nattacks science itself. Contemporary advocates of “intelligent\ndesign”, who claim that it should be treated as a scientific\ntheory (see the\n entry on teleological arguments for God’s existence),\n follow the same strategy as Cleanthes. \nInitially it seems that Cleanthes’s argument is left without a\nresponse. So there appears no room for a principled difference between\ncommon life, on the one hand, and natural philosophy and natural\nreligion, on the other hand. In the remainder of the Dialogues, Philo\nmakes sure not to be thought of as attacking natural philosophy again.\nIn the context where the intellectual authority of science has become\nunchallengeable, Philo’s best hope lies in driving a wedge\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion. This may explain why\nin undermining Newtonian natural religion, Philo does not draw on some\ncore elements of Hume’s philosophy: the “copy\nprinciple” or Hume’s attack on the permissibility of final\ncauses. Rather, throughout the Dialogues, Philo offers more narrow\narguments attacking the content of natural religion. So, while in Part\nI of the Dialogues Philo has no immediate response to\nCleanthes’s argument, later in the Dialogues he continues to use\nsome distinction between the secure reasoning available in common life\nand those too far removed from it. For example, by using Hume’s\nninth rule, Philo is critical of the use of analogy in making claims\nabout the nature of the first cause. Philo relies on common sense to\nformulate the problem of evil—if God is all powerful then he is\nresponsible for natural and moral evil (see Part XI). At the end of\nthe Dialogue, Philo is willing to grant Cleanthes “that the\ncause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote\nanalogy to human intelligence” (Part XII; emphasis in\noriginal). So,\nwhile Philo is unable to draw a conclusive, principled distinction\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion, he reduces the latter\nto a very minimal thesis. \nIt may, of course, be possible that by the end of his life, Hume had\nlimited his aims to removing the “superstitious” elements\nin Newtonianism (recall his criticism of Newton in Section 1). Perhaps he had given up on\nclaiming the priority of the science of man over natural philosophy.\nBut it would be a mistake to identify the posthumous Dialogues as\nHume’s final, definitive philosophy. Hume appended an\n“advertisement” to EHU, which was printed at the start of\nthe posthumous 1777 edition. After distancing himself (to some degree)\nfrom his “juvenile work”, the Treatise, he says\nabout EHU: “Henceforth, the Author desires, that the following\nPieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles”. EHU contains, of course,\nHume’s copy principle and the attack on final causes. Perhaps,\nthe closing remarks of Philo, where he apologizes for  \nintervening in the education and instruction of his [i.e.,\nCleanthes’s] pupil [i.e., Pamphillus—the official narrator\nof (and witness to) the dialogues among Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea],\n \nshould be taken more seriously by more of Hume’s readers. The\nDialogues are Hume’s efforts to educate the students of natural\nreligion; they are not a statement of Hume’s positive\n“science of man” or “true metaphysics”. \nThere has been a persistent strain of criticism of David Hume that has\ninsinuated that he simply did not understand Newton or lacked\nmathematical competence. But when Hume (or any other historical\nfigure) deviates from Newton this need not entail lack of\nunderstanding, it can, depending on other evidence, also be taken as\ninformed criticism (Schliesser 2011). In Hume’s case, critical\nscholars also draw on a (1772) letter to William Strahan in which he\nmentions a 1755 draft essay “On the Metaphysical Principles of\nGeometry” that he withdrew upon the advice of his friend the\nmathematician Lord Stanhope, “who convinced me that either there\nwas some defeat in the argument or in its perspicuity” (Newman\n1981). This remark is taken as evidence of Hume’s acknowledged\nlack of competence in mathematics. But it could also be taken at face\nvalue and an expression of scholarly integrity: he accepted a\ncompelling criticism. \nHowever far his understanding of complex mathematics reached, he\nadvanced a radical sceptical challenge for mathematics, and thereby he\nalso undermined knowledge claims associated with demonstrative\nreasoning (Meeker 2007). The sceptical problem arises from the\ninexactness of geometrical ideas and the fallibility of our reasoning\nprocesses. Geometry for Hume is about actual figures and shapes whose\nideas cannot be perfectly exact because our perceptual abilities are\nlimited, and reasoning based on these ideas inherits this inexactness.\nIdeas relevant for arithmetic, i.e., numbers, do not suffer from this\nimprecision, but arithmetical reasoning is just as fallible as human\nreasoning in general. The outcome of our demonstrative reasoning must\nbe judged by a probabilistic judgment on the reliability of our\nreasoning faculties, which in turn must be judged by a further\nprobabilistic judgment on the probabilistic judgment on the\nreliability of our faculties. The apparent demonstrative certainty of\nour mathematical reasoning degenerates into probability, and we are\nleft with fallible and uncertain conclusions even in our demonstrative\nsciences (THN 1.4.1.2–6). \nBut Hume does not stop there: he offers a sceptical solution to this\nchallenge (Demeter 2019a). First he offers an individual\nremedy for the mathematician: to go back and to check again his\nreasoning, because “[e]very time he runs over his proofs, his\nconfidence increases” (THN 1.2.4.23). Secondly, social\nprocesses are more effective in reducing doubt, because his certainty\nis increased “still more by the approbation of his friends; and\nis rais’d to its utmost perfection by the universal assent and\napplauses of the learned world” (THN 1.4.1.2). Even if all\ndemonstrative knowledge remains probabilistic in this approach too,\nthe certainty of mathematical reasoning reaches its peak due to the\nacknowledgment of epistemic peers. \nThe popularity of a mathematical proof (or demonstration) among\nexperts in the field naturally speaks in favor of the proof. This\nfeature is not peculiar to mathematical conclusions, because as Hume\npoints out: “I feel all my opinions loosen and fall of\nthemselves, when unsupported by the approbation of others” (THN\n1.4.7.4). What makes mathematics peculiar is that, in addition to\nindividual reasoning, the approbation of the mathematician’s\nclose circle of “friends”, and the approval of the\nscholarly community seem to be the only sources of\njustification in matters of mathematics. \nBy connecting mathematical certainty to the approbation of others Hume\ngives an essentially social character to mathematical knowledge. No\nmatter the different metaphysical and epistemic pedigree of its\nbranches, it is their practices that determine the certainty of\nmathematical conclusions (THN 2.3.10.2). In practice geometrical\nreasoning is elevated to the same level of certainty as our reasoning\nin arithmetic and algebra—and his may be one way to explain why\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.1, 7.1–2, 12.20) lists all of them\nas demonstrative. The limitations of our practices, arising from human\nnature, condemn all branches of mathematics to eventual fallibility\nand uncertainty. But that is not the main lesson we should draw here.\nWhat really matters is that despite this fallibility we\ngenerate certainty through our predominantly social\npractices. So geometry in practice can be as certain and\ndemonstrative as arithmetic is in principle demonstrative,\nbut in practice, fallible. Taken together, the metaphysics and\npractice of mathematics leads us to pretty much the same epistemic\ngrounds in all branches of mathematics. \nHume’s reservations about the demonstrability of mathematics\nimply a critique of Newton’s programme of mathematizing natural\nphilosophy (for details see Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\ncriticism is not wholly implicit; rather Newton is very clearly the\ntarget of remarks made in the context of Hume’s discussion of\nthe principle of “infinite divisibility” in the paragraphs\nsubsequent to THN 1.2.4.17: \nwe are not possess’d of any instrument or art of\nmeasuring, which can secure us from all error and uncertainty…\nwe therefore suppose some imaginary standard of equality, by which the\nappearances and measuring are exactly corrected, and the figures\nreduc’d entirely to that proportion… But tho’ this\nstandard be only imaginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor\nis any thing more usual, than for the mind to proceed after this\nmanner with any action, even after the reason has ceas’d, which\nfirst determin’d it to begin. This appears very conspicuously\nwith regard to time; where tho’ ’tis evident we have no\nexact method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so\nexact as in extension, yet the various corrections of our measures,\nand their different degrees of exactness, have given us an obscure and\nimplicit notion of a perfect and entire equality. The case is the same\nin many other subjects. A painter forms the same fiction with regard\nto colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. (THN 1.2.4.24) \nInstead of introducing certainty into natural philosophy as Newton\nclaimed, mathematics, albeit a useful device “in almost every\nart and profession” (THN 2.3.3.2), is thus grounded in natural\nfictions. It has a limited contribution to the advancement of\nknowledge. Mathematics in Hume’s eyes is only another human\ncognitive enterprise that has no potential to make other fields of\nknowledge immune to human fallibility. This is in sharp contrast with\nthe cognitive optimism Newton expresses in the Preface to the\nPrincipia and several other passages about the role of\nmathematics in natural inquiry (see Guicciardini 2009, esp. ch. 13\n& 14; Zemplén & Demeter 2010). Newton is confident that\nby making the method of inquiry mathematical, natural philosophy can\nbe infused with certainty and demonstrativity. This confidence is\nundermined by Hume’s account of how mathematical knowledge is\npossible at all. \nWhat is distinctive about the method of the Principia is what\nI.B. Cohen termed the “Newtonian style”. Its constitutive\nfeature is the mathematization of nature, i.e., “dealing\nmathematically with the realities of the external world”. This\nmeant much more than deriving numerical results from experiments, or a\nfocus on measurement, or a commitment to a means of exposition that\nproceeded from definitions and axioms. Instead, it meant taking\nmathematics as the model of reality: constructing “the\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation” and then to\nadvance from this idealized case by the addition of further conditions\ntoward more accurate mathematical analogues of actual situations\n(Cohen 1980: 51, 151, see also Smith 2002; Smeenk & Schliesser\n2013). There are no traces of this approach in Hume, so if one takes\nthe Principia’s “Newtonian style” as the\nessence of Newton’s method, then one should also conclude that\nHume’s experimental method is not Newtonian. (For a contrasting\nview see de Pierris 2015 who credits Hume with a\nPrincipia-style Newtonian inductive methodology, and for a\ncritique of her views see Landy 2017.) \nAs McGuire (1970b: 182) points out “Newton did not see any\ndichotomy in method between that used in the Principia and\nthat found in the Opticks”. But even if he considered\nhis methodology fundamentally the same in both works, and he treated\nmathematical and experimental analyses as contributing to inquiry in\nthe same manner, this was perceived differently by subsequent\ngenerations. In Query 31 Newton himself introduces two different ways\nof analysis that “may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and\nfrom motions to the forces producing them” (Opticks, Query 31 added in 1718, Newton 2004:\n139; for a discussion\nsee e.g. Ducheyne 2012; Demeter 2016): the first way allows for a\nqualitative analysis that does not require the centrality of a\nmathematical framework of analysis. The crucial element is indeed\ncommon to their methodology, namely the idea of causal\nanalysis—this is the core of Newtonian analysis, and these\nare the terms in which Colin Maclaurin (1775: 8–10) introduces\nthe Newtonian method to his contemporaries. Nevertheless, it is\nimmediately clear from this passage that an analysis “from\ncompounds to ingredients” must proceed differently and find\ndifferent causes from an analysis “from motions to the forces\nproducing them”: they will be different with respect to both the\nmethod of analysis, and the nature of the causes\nthat can be so analysed. \nFrom the angle of Newton’s Preface to the first edition of the Principia,  \nthe basic problem of philosophy seems to be to discover the forces of\nnature from the phenomena of motions and then to demonstrate the other\nphenomena from these forces. (Newton 2004: 41)  \nSo its method is focused on analysing the causes of motions\nin terms of forces, a quantifiable natural kind that is\ndefined in terms of other quantities. So defined, the problem cries\nout for a mathematical apparatus, and so it fosters what I.B. Cohen\ntermed “the Newtonian style” in philosophy: taking\nmathematics as the model of reality, constructing “the\nmathematical analogue of a natural situation”, and then\nproducing from this idealized case by the addition of further\nconditions more and more accurate mathematical analogues of actual\nsituations (Cohen 1980: 51, 151). Through this series of\n“successive approximations”, Newton’s axioms or laws\nof motion function as “inference tickets” that allow for\ndrawing conclusions from motions to forces and vice versa,\nand also from macrophysical to microphysical forces composing them\n(Smith 2002: 143, 155–159; Smeenk & Schliesser 2013). \nThe analysis of compounds to ingredients, followed in the\nOpticks, looks for parts, components, constituents etc., and\naccompanies the mathematical methods of analysis where they prove to\nbe inadequate in themselves. The qualitative component of analysis is\nintended to reveal the composition of optical and, especially\nin the Queries, chemical phenomena. The paradigmatic cases are, of\ncourse, Newton’s prism experiments that revealed the composition\nof white light. In the first two books of the Opticks Newton\nhimself uses the method of analysis of compounds into ingredients\n“to discover and prove the original differences of rays of\nlight” (Query 31, Newton 2004: 140), that is to discover\nqualitative differences that persist due to the lack of their analysis\nin the “Newtonian style”. Most notable among them, as the\nexperimentum crucis had revealed, are colours that\n \nare not Qualifications of Light, derived from Refractions, or\nReflections of natural Bodies (as ’tis generally believed,) but\nOriginal and connate properties, which in divers\nRays are divers. (Newton 1671/72: 3081; for discussion and context see\nDucheyne 2012: 190–192) \nIn this vein, the Opticks provides a more appropriate setting\nfor understanding the character of Hume’s experimentalism than\nthe context of the Principia. As Colin Maclaurin put it in\nhis 1748 account of Newton’s discoveries: while the\nPrincipia inquires into forces acting between bodies in great\ndistance, the Opticks explores the “hidden parts of\nnature”, which are not so easily “subjected to\nanalysis” because of the subtlety and minuteness of the\nagents (Maclaurin 1775: 21). The principles of human nature that Hume\nendeavours to explore also belong to the hidden parts of nature that\ncan be explored by a method of qualitative analysis and\nsynthesis similar to the one advertised in Query 31. (Landy 2017\noffers a consonant reconstruction of Hume’s philosophy of\nscience as aiming at the exploration of hidden processes of the\nmind.) \nThe Treatise begins with setting up a “scheme of\nfundamental ‘elements’” for analyzing human\nphenomena in terms of ideas and impressions. Humean analysis begins\nwith phenomena from the historical and everyday observation of human\nbehavior, and the analysis proceeds by “experiments …\njudiciously collected and compar’d” (THN I.10), in order\nto arrive at analogies among various instances “from the\nobservation of several parallel instances” (EHU 8.13). The\nproducts of comparative analysis so conducted are the principles of\nvarious faculties, like perception, imagination, reason, etc., whose\ninteraction results in ideas and impressions causing behaviour, but\ntheir contribution can hardly be measured and the principles of their\ninteraction can hardly be quantified—not even in principle, so\nthey cannot be mathematized either (see also\n section 4.6\n above). Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them (Demeter 2016). \nThe methodological core thus consists in collecting relevant\nphenomena, finding analogies between them, and ascribing those\nanalogies to similar causes, thereby reducing a variety of phenomena\nto regular principles underlying them (THN App.3, Abs.1, EHU\n4.12)—while knowing that our knowledge cannot transcend what we\ncan infer on an analogical basis from the effects themselves (THN\nI.8). Just as comparing rays of light reveals their determinable\nproperties which, once determined, can be used in constructing\nexplanations, the comparison of instances of human behavior reveals\nthe principles of human nature with increasing generality and\nexactness. Salient human phenomena are collected from history and\nobservation, then compared; if analogies and similarities are found,\nthey are ascribed to some principle of human nature that are also\ncompared, grouped and resolved into more general ones (see also\nSection 4.8 below). This process results in determinable properties of\nhuman nature like the faculties of reason, sympathy, moral sense etc.;\ndetermining how these properties are actually instantiated in\ndifferent social, historical, individual, etc. circumstances provides\nthe explanatory raw material for singular phenomena (EHU 8.7, 8.9).\nThus we reach the principles of human nature that are the proper aim\nof inquiry in the science of man. These principles can be used, at the\nstage of synthesis, to explain why our impressions and ideas follow\none another in the order they do. \nThe outcome of these procedures is the refinement of the theory of\nhuman nature. While exploring exceptions and eliminating superfluous\nconditions it turns out, for example, that some principles of human\nnature are universal, some others are particular (THN 1.4.4.1). Some\nprinciples of imagination are then constitutive of human nature, but\nsome others are just contingent on culture or history, or even\nidiosyncratic, and can lead to local superstitions or philosophical\nchimeras, like presupposing “substance” as the bearer of\nproperties in scholastic metaphysics. The universal principles provide\nthe fundamental framework of determinable human properties that are\nactually determined by social and historical circumstances. This\nexplains why certain virtues, like courage, are evaluated differently\nin different historical periods (EPM 7.11–14), and also why a\ncreature without sympathy, however contingent its degree and direction\nmay be, would count as a “monster” and not a\n“man” (EPM 6.1–2). Sympathy is a universal principle\nof human nature, but the principles of the degree and direction of its\nsensitivity are determined by the conditions within which it is\ndeveloped and refined through social interaction (EPM 5.41–42).\nThis amounts to saying that Hume’s account of human nature has\nboth universalistic and contextualist elements, and this is the\noutcome of his experimental methodology: it is through a series of\nsuccessive approximation through a comparative study of changing\ncircumstances that the universal and contingent principles of human\nnature can be distinguished. \nAnalysis and synthesis so understood constitutes the core of\n“the experimental method of reasoning” that distinguishes\nHume’s enterprise from the alternative approach that Newton\n(2004: 121) had termed “hypothetical philosophy”. Hume is\naware of this distinction and explicitly sides with the\nexperimentalist camp. His methodological pronouncements and\ncommitments situate him in the context of “methodological\nNewtonianism” characteristic to Scottish moral and natural\nphilosophers, who “dealt with aspects of philosophy for which\nNewton had not laid down the specific postulates upon which future\ntheories were to be built” (Donovan 1975: 29, see also Demeter\n2016). \nAs Hume repeatedly emphasizes, it is impossible to reveal the\n“ultimate causes of our mental actions”, and we have to be\ncontent with “experience and analogy” in explaining any\nact of the mind “by producing other instances, which are\nanalogous to it, and other principles, which facilitate its\noperation” (THN 1.1.7.11). Finding analogies between different\ninstances gives one the chance to explain causes and reduce them to\n“more general principles” (THN App. 3). For Hume,\nanalogical reasoning is the key to most of our everyday and\nphilosophical conclusions in empirical matters. Causal reasoning is\npartly but crucially founded on our capacity to recognize resemblances\namong different instances, and to extend our inferences based on\nprevious observations to similar but unobserved instances. Thus, the\nrecognition of resemblances is at the heart of our reasoning\nconcerning any matter of fact, and the limits of this kind of\nreasoning are exactly where our capacity to recognize resemblances\nends (THN 1.3.13.25). The proper method of both natural and moral\nphilosophy is  \nto reduce the principles, productive of natural phaenomena, to a\ngreater simplicity, and to resolve the many particular effects into a\nfew general causes, by means of reasonings from analogy, experience,\nand observation. (EHU 4.12, 11.30; THN 1.1.7.11)  \nIt is history—natural and civil as well—that provides the\npool of observations from which philosophers—natural and moral\nones as well—relying on analogies can establish explanatory\nprinciples. Finding analogies between different instances gives one\nthe chance to explain causes and reduce them to “more general\nprinciples” (THN App.3). \nIn the Dialogues, and especially in the sections criticizing\nthe design argument, Hume seems to be more critical of analogical\nreasoning than he is in his other passages of similar methodological\nrelevance; nevertheless, Philo pronounces “analogies and\nresemblances” reliable enough to serve as the “sole proofs\nof the Copernican system” (Dialogues 2.26). Given that\nin Hume’s epistemology the category of proof provides\nthe highest level of epistemic certainty available for any piece of\nempirical knowledge, analogical reasoning is a highly esteemed way of\nreaching theoretical conclusions in exploring the principles of nature\nand human nature (EHU 6n10). Hume’s doubts in the\nDialogues concerning analogical arguments from design\nprimarily do not arise from the weaknesses of analogical reasoning,\nbut mainly from the uniqueness of the world, which does not provide a\nsufficient pool of instances among which analogies can be found (EHU\n11.26). \nAlthough the cognitive role of analogy is central, it relies on\nsubjective judgment and so it can have idiosyncratic manifestations.\nThings are similar in an infinite number of ways, and only some of\nthese similarities can be exploited with the hope of cognitive benefit\n(THN 1.1.5.3). As any thing may resemble any other in an infinite\nnumber of ways only some resemblances can explain associative\nrelations between ideas. Resemblances of cognitive relevance are\ntherefore not passively detected, but they are actively produced by\nmemory: we remember past instances as resembling (THN\n1.4.6.18). Depending on the resemblances one recognizes among\nparticular instances, one can end up with different and potentially\nconflicting conclusions concerning the causes of phenomena. Therefore,\nas Hume puts it: \nNo questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of\ncauses present themselves for the same phaenomenon, to determine which\nis the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise\nargument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by\na kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of\nsimilar instances. (THN 3.2.3.4n71) \nThis is one reason why “Tis not solely in poetry and music, we\nmust follow our taste and sentiment, but likewise in philosophy”\n(THN 1.3.8.12). And while the subjectivity of analogical reasoning is\na source of creativity and insight, it also puts the objectivity and\ncertainty of Newton’s epistemic ideal beyond reach.","contact.mail":"tsd2333@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
