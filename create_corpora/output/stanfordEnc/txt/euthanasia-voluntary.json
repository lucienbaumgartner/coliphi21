Accordingly,\nthe motive of the person who performs an act of euthanasia is to\nbenefit the one whose death is brought about. (This also holds for\nmany instances of physician-assisted suicide, but use of the latter\nterm is usually restricted to forms of assistance which stop short of\nthe physician ‘bringing about the death’ of the patient,\nfor example, those involving means that have to be activated by the\npatient.)  \n\nIt is important to emphasize the motive of benefiting the person who\nis assisted to die because well-being is a key value in relation to\nthe morality of euthanasia (see Section 3 below). Nonetheless, the defensibility of the\ncontention that someone can be better off dead has been the subject of\nextensive philosophical deliberation. Those who claim that a person\ncan be better off dead believe this to be true when the life that\nremains in prospect for that person has no positive value for her (a\npossibility which is discussed by e.g., Foot, 1977; McMahan 2002; Bradley 2009), whereas some of those who hold that a person’s\nlife is inviolable deny that a person can ever be better off dead\n(e.g., Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012). A Kant-inspired variant on\nthis latter position has been advanced by Velleman (1999). He\nconsiders that a person’s well-being can only matter if she is of\nintrinsic value and so that it is impermissible to violate a person’s\nrational nature (the source of her intrinsic value) for the sake of\nher well-being. Accordingly, he holds that it is impermissible to\nassist someone to die who judges that she would be better off dead and\ncompetently requests assistance with dying. The only exception is when\na person’s life is so degraded as to call into question her rational\nnature, albeit he thinks it unlikely that anyone in that position will\nremain competent to request assistance with dying. This position\nappears to be at odds with the well-established right of a\ncompetent patient to refuse life-prolonging medical treatment, at\nleast when further treatment is refused because she considers that her\nlife no longer has value for her and further treatment will not restore \nits value to her.  (For further reasons to reject\narguments for the inviolability of the life of a person, including\nVelleman’s, see e.g., McMahan 2002; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.)    \n\nBecause our concern will be with voluntary euthanasia – that \nis, with those instances of euthanasia in which a clearly\ncompetent person makes a voluntary and enduring request to be helped\nto die (or, by extension, when an authorised proxy makes a substituted\njudgment by choosing in the manner the no-longer-competent person\nwould have chosen had he remained competent) – a second key\nvalue is the competence of the person requesting assistance with\ndying. There will be occasion to mention non-voluntary\neuthanasia – instances of euthanasia where a person lacks\nthe competence at the time when a decision is to be made to request\neuthanasia and has not previously competently declared a preference\nfor it via an advance directive (see the entry on \n advance directives) – only\nwhen consideration is given to the claim that permitting voluntary\neuthanasia will lead via a slippery slope to permitting non-voluntary\neuthanasia. Nothing will be said here about involuntary\neuthanasia, where a competent person’s life is brought to\nan end despite an explicit expression of opposition to euthanasia,\nbeyond saying that, no matter how honorable the perpetrator’s\nmotive, such a death is, and ought to be, unlawful.  Debate about the morality and legality of voluntary euthanasia has\nbeen, for the most part, a phenomenon of the second half of the\ntwentieth century and the beginning of the twenty first\ncentury. Certainly, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not believe that\nlife needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence,\ntolerant of suicide when no relief could be offered to a\ndying person or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, when a person no\nlonger cared for his life. In the sixteenth century, Thomas More, in\ndescribing a utopian community, envisaged such a community as one that\nwould facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome\nas a result of ‘torturing and lingering \npain’. But it has\nonly been in the last hundred years that there have been concerted\nefforts to make legal provision for voluntary euthanasia. Until quite\nrecently there had been no success in obtaining such legal provision\n(though assisted suicide, including, but not limited to,\nphysician-assisted suicide, has been legally tolerated in Switzerland\nfor a number of decades). However, the outlook changed dramatically in the\n1970s and 80s because of a series of court cases in The Netherlands\nwhich culminated in an agreement between the legal and medical\nauthorities to ensure that no physician would be prosecuted for\nassisting a patient to die as long as certain guidelines were strictly\nadhered to (see Griffiths, et al., 1998). In brief, the guidelines were\nestablished to permit physicians to practise voluntary euthanasia in\nthose instances in which a competent patient had made a voluntary and\ninformed request to be helped to die, the patient’s suffering was\nunbearable, there was no way of making that suffering bearable that\nwas acceptable to the patient, and the physician’s judgements as to\ndiagnosis and prognosis were confirmed after consultation with another\nphysician.  The first legislative approval for voluntary euthanasia was\nachieved with the passage in the parliament of Australia’s\nNorthern Territory of a bill enabling physicians to practise voluntary\neuthanasia. Subsequent to the Act’s proclamation in 1996, it\nfaced a series of legal challenges from opponents of voluntary\neuthanasia. In 1997 the challenges culminated in the Australian\nNational Parliament overturning the legislation when it prohibited\nAustralian territories from enacting legislation to permit voluntary\neuthanasia on constitutional grounds.  Australia is a federation\nconsisting of six states and two territories.  Unlike the territories,\nthe states do have the constitutional right to enact such legislation\nand in 2017 the state of Victoria did just that. The legislation came\ninto effect in 2019. In 2019, a second state, Western Australia, enacted legislation to enable voluntary medically assisted death. The legislation becomes effective in 2021. Several other states are considering similar legislation.  \n\nIn November 2000, The Netherlands passed legislation to\nlegalize the practice of voluntary euthanasia. The legislation passed\nthrough all the parliamentary stages early in 2001. The Belgian\nparliament passed similar legislation in 2002 and Luxembourg followed\nsuit in 2009. (For a very helpful comparative study of relevant\nlegislation see Lewis 2007. See also Griffiths, et al. 2008.)  \n\nIn Oregon in the United States, legislation was introduced in 1997 to\npermit physician-assisted suicide after a referendum strongly endorsed\nthe proposed legislation. Later in 1997 the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States ruled that there is no constitutional right to\nphysician-assisted suicide; however, the Court did not preclude\nindividual states from legislating in favor of physician-assisted\nsuicide (so the Oregon legislation was unaffected). Since that time\nthe Oregon legislation has been successfully utilised by a significant\nnumber of people and similar legislation has been passed in the state\nof Washington in 2009, in Vermont in 2013, and more recently still in\nCalifornia, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. A series of judicial\ndecisions in the state of Montana in 2008 and 2009 established that\nthe state could not prohibit physician-assisted suicide but\nlegislation has not yet been introduced to codify the legal\nsituation. A number of other states are currently considering\nphysician-assisted suicide bills. A similar legal position to that in\nMontana has obtained in the nation of Colombia since the late 1990s as\na result of a majority ruling by its Constitutional Court in favor of\nthe legality of physician-assisted suicide. In Canada, the province of\nQuebec introduced legislation permitting medical aid in dying in\n2014. The legislation came into effect in 2016 at around the same time\nthat the Canadian National Parliament passed legislation permitting\nboth physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia throughout\nall of the Canadian federation. (For a brief account of events leading\nup to the enactment of the various pieces of legislation in the United\nStates and in Canada see Sumner 2017.)    \n\nWith that brief sketch of the historical background in place, we will\nproceed first to consider the conditions that those who have advocated\nmaking voluntary medically assisted death legally permissible have\ntypically insisted should be satisfied. Consideration of the proposed\nconditions will establish a framework for the moral interrogation that\nwill follow in Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 will outline the positive\nmoral case put forward by those who want voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide to be legally permissible.  Section 4 will\nbe devoted to scrutinising the most important of the objections that\nhave been levelled against that case by those opposed to the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted\nsuicide. \n\nAdvocates of voluntary euthanasia typically contend that if a person  \n\nthen there should be legal and medical provision to facilitate her being\nallowed to die or assisted to die. \n\nIt should be acknowledged that these conditions are quite restrictive,\nindeed more restrictive than many think appropriate.  In\nparticular, the first condition restricts access to voluntary\neuthanasia to those who are terminally ill. While that\nexpression is not free of all ambiguity, for present purposes it can\nbe agreed that it does not include those who are\nrendered quadriplegic as a result of accidents, or sufferers from motor neurone disease, or\nindividuals who succumb to forms of dementia like Alzheimer’s Disease,\nto say nothing of those afflicted by ‘existential suffering’. Those\nwho consider that cases like these show the first condition to be too\nrestrictive (e.g., Varelius 2014) may, nonetheless, agree\nthat including them as candidates for legalized voluntary euthanasia\nis likely to make it far harder in many jurisdictions to gain sufficient\nsupport for legalization (and so to make it harder to help those\nterminally ill persons who wish to die). Even so, they believe that voluntary\neuthanasia should be permitted for those who consider their lives no\nlonger worth living, not just for for the terminally ill. The fifth\ncondition further restricts access to voluntary euthanasia by\nexcluding those capable of ending their own lives, and so may be\nthought unduly restrictive by those who would wish to discourage\nterminally ill patients from attempting suicide. There will be yet\nothers who consider this condition to be too restrictive because\ncompetent patients can always refuse nutrition and hydration \n(see, e.g., Bernat, et al., 1993; Savulescu 2014). Though this is \ntrue, many competent dying persons still wish to have access\nto legalized medically assisted death, rather than having to rely on\nrefusing nutrition and hydration, so that they may retain control over the\ntiming of their deaths and avoid needlessly prolonging the process\nof dying. \n\nThe second condition is intended simply to reflect the fact that it is\nnormally possible to say when someone’s health status is incurable.\nSo-called ‘miracle’ cures \nmay be proclaimed by sensationalist journalists, but progress toward medical \nbreakthroughs is typically painstaking. If there are miracles wrought by God that\nwill be quite another matter entirely, but it is at least clear that\nnot everyone’s death is thus to be staved off. \n\nThe third condition recognises what many who oppose the legalization\nof voluntary euthanasia do not, namely, that it is not only a desire\nto be released from pain that leads people to request help with\ndying. In The Netherlands, for example, pain has been found to be a less\nsignificant reason for requesting assistance with dying than other\nforms of suffering like frustration over loss of\nindependence (see e.g., Marquet, et al., 2003; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, et al., 2012; Emanuel, et al., 2016). \nSufferers from some terminal conditions may have their\npain relieved but have to endure side effects that, for them, make\nlife unbearable. Others may not have to cope with pain but, instead, with\nhaving to rely on forms of life support that simultaneously\nrob their lives of quality (as with, e.g., motor neurone disease). Yet others \nstruggle with psychological distress and various \npsychiatric conditions and believe these conditions ought to be \ncounted among the forms of suffering \nthat qualify competent individuals to access medical \nassistance with dying. There has been greater recognition of, \nand support for, this position in The Netherlands and Belgium \nthan elsewhere, probably because legislation in those jurisdictions \nmakes the role of unbearable suffering central to the \ndetermination of the eligibility of competent individuals \nfor medical assistance with dying. Even so, inclusion of these forms \nof suffering highlights legitimate issues to do with the competence of at \nleast some of those who suffer from them. (For a helpful recent \nstudy of the handling of requests for assistance with dying by \npsychiatric patients in The Netherlands see Kim, et al., 2016.) \n\nA final preliminary point is that the fourth condition requires that\nthe choice to die not only be uncoerced and competent but that it be\nenduring. The choice is one that will require \ntime for reflection, and, almost certainly, discussion with others, so \nshould not be settled in a moment. Nonetheless, as with\nother decisions affecting matters of importance, adults are\npresumed to choose voluntarily and to be competent unless the presence of defeating\nconsiderations can be established. (See the entry on \n decision-making capacity.) The burden\nof proof of establishing lack of voluntariness, or lack of competence,\nis on those who refuse to accept an adult person’s choice. There is no need\nto deny that this burden can sometimes be met (e.g., by pointing to\nthe person’s being in a state of clinical depression). The claim is\nonly that the onus falls on those who assert that an adult’s\nchoice is not competent.  \n\nClearly the five conditions set out above are likely to require some \nrefinement if complete agreement is to be reached but there is sufficient \nagreement for us to proceed without further ado to consideration of \nthe cases for and against legalization of voluntary euthanasia.\n(However, for a fuller discussion of issues concerning\nthe definition of ‘euthanasia’ see, e.g., Beauchamp and Davidson\n1979.) \n\nOne central ethical contention in support of voluntary euthanasia is\nthat respect for persons demands respect for their autonomous choices\nas long as those choices do not result in harm to others. Respect for\npeople’s autonomous choices is directly connected with the requirement\nfor competence because autonomy presupposes competence (cf., Brock\n1992). People have an interest in making important decisions about\ntheir lives in accordance with their own conception of how they want\nto live. In exercising autonomy, or self-determination, individuals\ntake responsibility for their lives; since dying is a part of life,\nchoices about the manner of their dying and the timing of their death\nare, for many people, part of what is involved in taking\nresponsibility for their lives. Many are concerned about what the last\nphase of their lives will be like, not merely because of fears that\ntheir dying might involve them in great suffering, but also because of\nthe desire to retain their dignity, and as much control over their\nlives as possible, during this phase. A second contention in support\nof voluntary euthanasia was mentioned at the beginning of this\nentry, namely the importance of promoting the well-being of\npersons. When someone is suffering intolerable pain or only has\navailable a life that is unacceptably burdensome (see the third\ncondition above), and he competently requests medical assistance with\ndying, his well-being may best be promoted by affording him that\nassistance. When harnessed together, the value to individuals of making autonomous choices, and \nthe value to those individuals who make such choices of promoting their \nown well-being, provide the moral foundation for requests \nfor voluntary euthanasia. Each consideration is necessary for moral \njustification of the practice, but taken in isolation neither suffices \n(see, e.g., Young 2007, 2017; Sumner 2011, 2017). \n\nThe technological interventions of modern medicine have had the effect\nof stretching out the time it takes for many people to die. Sometimes\nthe added life this brings is an occasion for rejoicing; sometimes it\ndrags out the period of significant physical and intellectual decline\nthat a person undergoes with the result that life becomes no longer\nworth living.  Many believe there is no single, objectively correct\nanswer as to when, if at all, a person’s life becomes a burden and\nhence unwanted. If they are right, that simply points up the\nimportance of individuals being able to decide autonomously for\nthemselves whether their own lives retain sufficient quality and\ndignity to make life worth living. Others maintain that individuals can\nbe in error about whether their lives continue to be worth living\n(cf., Foot 1977). The conditions outlined above in Section 2 are\nintended by those who propose them to serve, among other purposes, to\nsafeguard against such error. But it is worth adding that in the event\nthat a person who considers that she satisfies those conditions is\njudged by her medical attendants to be in error about whether it would\nbe worth her continuing to live, the likely outcome is that those\nattendants will refuse to provide medical assistance with\ndying. (Evidence that will be mentioned below shows that this happens\nfrequently in jurisdictions in which medically assisted dying has been\nlegalized.) Unless a patient is able to be transferred to the care of\nother medical professionals who accept her assessment, she will have\nto rely on her own resources (e.g., by refusing nutrition and\nhydration). Even so, other things being equal, as long as a critically\nill person is competent, her own judgement of whether continued life\nis a benefit to her ought to carry the greatest weight in any\nend-of-life decision making regardless of whether she is in a severely\ncompromised and debilitated state. The idea that a competent individual’s \nautonomous judgment of the value to her of continued life should trump an \nassessment by others of her well-being should not be \nthought surprising because precisely the same happens when a \ncompetent patient refuses life-prolonging treatment. \n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that it is agreed that we should\nrespect a person’s competent request for medical assistance with dying\n(e.g., so as to enable her to achieve her autonomously chosen goal of\nan easeful death). It might be thought that in such an eventuality\ndifferent moral concerns will be introduced from those that arise in\nconnection with competent refusals. After all, while competent\npatients are entitled to refuse any form of medical treatment, they\nare not entitled to insist on the administration of forms of medical\ntreatment that have no prospect of conferring a medical benefit or are\nnot being provided for reasons to do with scarcity of medical resources or \naffordability. While each of these points is sound, it remains the case \nthat medical personnel have a duty to relieve suffering when that is within their\ncapacity. Accordingly, doctors who regard medical assistance with dying as \nan element of appropriate medical care will consider it morally permissible \nto agree to a request for assistance with\ndying by a competent dying patient who wishes to avoid unnecessary suffering. \nThe reason for claiming only that this is morally permissible\nrather than morally obligatory will be explained in a subsequent\nparagraph. (For further reflections on the issue of responses to \nrequests for medical assistance see, for instance,\nDworkin in Frey, et al. 1998; Sumner 2011; Young 2017.)  \n\nNotwithstanding this response, as was seen earlier, at least some\nproponents of voluntary medically assisted dying wish to question why\nmedical assistance with dying should be restricted to those covered\nby, in particular, the first three conditions set out above in Section\n2. If people’s competent requests for medically assisted death\nshould be respected why impose any restrictions at all on who may have\naccess to medically assisted death? Why, for example, should those\nsuffering from depression, or forms of dementia, not be eligible for\nmedically assisted dying? Most proponents of voluntary medically\nassisted dying hold that there are at least two reasons for\nrestricting access to it to those who satisfy the conditions set out\nearlier (or, a modified set that takes account of the concerns\ncanvassed in the discussion of those proposed conditions). First, they\ncontend that there are political grounds for doing so, namely, that\nbecause legalizing medically assisted dying for competent individuals\nis politically contested, the best hope for its legalization lies in\nfocusing on those forms of suffering most likely to effect law\nreform. That is why some proponents deny the eligibility even of\nsufferers from conditions like ‘locked-in’ syndrome, motor\nneurone disease, and multiple sclerosis for voluntary medically\nassisted dying since, strictly, they are not terminally ill, and\nreliance has to be placed in consequence on their claim to be\nsuffering unbearably. Second, and relatedly, most proponents of the\nlegalization of medical assistance with dying have been cautious about\nsupporting medically assisted death for those suffering from, for\nexample, depression and dementia, because not only are they not\nterminally ill, but their competence to request assistance with dying\nis apt to be called into question, particularly in instances where\nthey have given no prior indication of their preference for such\nassistance. Restricting access to medical assistance with dying to\nthose whose suffering is less likely to be disputed avoids becoming\nembroiled in controversy. Some critics of the restrictive approach\n(e.g., Varelius 2014) take a harder line still and claim that it\nshould not even be necessary for a person to be suffering from a\nmedical condition to be eligible for medical assistance with dying; it\nshould be enough to be ‘tired of life’. Only in a few\njurisdictions, viz., Switzerland, The Netherlands and Belgium, has\nthis issue been seriously broached. Regardless of what may happen in\nthose jurisdictions, those seeking the legal provision of medical\nassistance with dying in other jurisdictions seem likely to maintain\nthat if such assistance is to be seen as a legitimate form of medical\ncare it has to be provided in response to a medical condition (rather\nthan because someone is ‘tired of life’), and, indeed,\nrestricted to those who satisfy the conditions outlined earlier in\nSection 2 (or some similar set of conditions). In short, these latter\nhold that making an autonomous request for assistance with dying is\nnecessary, but should not be sufficient, for triggering such\nassistance. \n\nThere is one final matter of relevance to the moral case for voluntary \nmedically assisted death on which comment must be made. The comment\nconcerns a point foreshadowed in a previous paragraph, but it is also\nlinked with the remark just made about the insufficiency of an autonomous \nrequest for assistance with dying to trigger that \nassistance. It is important to make the point that respect \nhas to be shown not only for the dying person’s autonomy but also \nfor the professional autonomy of any medical personnel asked\nto lend assistance with dying. The value (or, as some would prefer,\nthe right) of self-determination does not entitle a patient to try to\ncompel medical professionals to act contrary to their own moral or\nprofessional values. Hence, if voluntary euthanasia is to be legally\npermitted, it must be against a backdrop of respect for professional\nautonomy. Similarly, if a doctor’s view of her moral or professional\nresponsibilities is at odds with her patient’s competent request for\neuthanasia, she should make provision, where it is feasible to do so, for \nthe transfer of the patient to the care of a doctor who faces no such\nconflict. Given that, to date, those who contend that no scope should\nbe permitted for conscientious objection within medical practice have\ngarnered very little support for that view, making use of referrals \nand transfers remains the most effective means of resolving such disagreements. \n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia have endeavored in a variety of ways\nto counter the very straightforward moral case that has been laid out\nabove for its legalization (see, for example, Keown 2002; Foley, et\nal. 2002; Biggar 2004; Gorsuch 2006).  Some of the counter-arguments\nare concerned only with whether the moral case warrants making the\npractice of voluntary euthanasia legal, whereas others are concerned\nwith trying to undermine the moral case itself. In what follows,\nconsideration will be given to the five most important\ncounter-arguments. (For more comprehensive discussions of the morality\nand legality of medically assisted death see Keown 2002; Biggar 2004;\nGorsuch 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.) \n\nIt is sometimes said (e.g., Emanuel 1999; Keown in Jackson and Keown\n2012) that it is not necessary nowadays for people to die while\nsuffering from intolerable or overwhelming pain because the provision\nof effective palliative care has improved steadily, and hospice care\nis more widely available. Some have urged, in consequence, that\nvoluntary euthanasia is unnecessary. \n\nThere are several flaws in this contention. First, while both good\npalliative care and hospice care make important contributions to the\ncare of the dying, neither is a panacea. To get the best palliative\ncare for an individual involves trial and error, with some consequent\nsuffering in the process; moreover, even the best care fails to\nrelieve all pain and suffering. Perhaps even more importantly, high\nquality palliative care commonly exacts a price in the form of\nside-effects such as nausea, incontinence, loss of awareness because\nof semi-permanent drowsiness, and so on. A rosy picture is often\npainted as to how palliative care can transform the plight of the\ndying. Such a picture is misleading according to those who have\nclosely observed the effect of extended courses of treatment with\ndrugs like morphine. For these reasons many skilled palliative care\nspecialists acknowledge that palliative care does not enable an\neaseful death for every patient.  Second, even though the sort of care\nprovided through hospices is to be applauded, it is care that is\navailable to only a small proportion of the terminally ill and then\nusually only in the very last stages of the illness (typically a\nmatter of a few weeks). Notwithstanding that only relatively few of\nthe dying have access to hospice care it is worth drawing attention to\nthe fact that in, Oregon, to cite one example, a high proportion of\nthose who have sought physician-assisted suicide were in hospice\ncare. Third, and of greatest significance for present purposes, not\neveryone wishes to avail themselves of palliative or hospice care. For\nthose who prefer to die on their own terms and in their own time,\nneither option may be attractive. As previously mentioned, a major\nsource of distress for many dying patients is the frustration that\ncomes with being unable to satisfy their autonomous wishes.  Fourth,\nas also indicated earlier, the suffering that occasions a desire to\nend life is not always traceable to pain caused by illness. For some,\nwhat is intolerable is their forced dependence on others or on\nlife-supporting machinery; for these patients, the availability of\neffective pain control is not the primary concern. (In relation to the\npreceding matters see Rietjens, et al., 2009 and Onwuteaka-Philipsen\net al. 2012 for findings for The Netherlands; and, for Oregon,\nGanzini, et al. 2009.) \n\nA second, related objection to the moral and legal permissibility of\nvoluntary euthanasia turns on the claim that we can never have sufficient\nevidence to be justified in believing that a dying person’s request to\nbe helped to die is competent, enduring and genuinely voluntary. \n\nIt is certainly true that a request to die may not reflect an enduring\ndesire to die (just as some attempts to commit suicide may reflect\nonly temporary despair). That is why advocates of the legalization of voluntary \neuthanasia have argued that a cooling off period should normally be required\nbefore euthanasia is permitted to ensure that the request is enduring.\nThat having been said, to claim that we can never be justified in\nbelieving that someone’s request to die reflects a settled preference\nfor death is to go too far. If a competent person discusses the issue\nwith others on different occasions over time, and remains steady in her\nresolve, or privately reflects on the issue for an extended period and does not\nwaver in her conviction, her wish to die surely must be counted as\nenduring. \n\nBut, it might be asked, what if a person is racked with pain, or\nmentally confused because of the measures taken to relieve her pain,\nand is, in consequence, unable to think clearly and rationally about\nthe alternatives? It has to be agreed that a person in those\ncircumstances who wants to die should not be assumed to have a\ntruly voluntary and enduring desire to die. However, there\nare at least two important points to make about those in such\ncircumstances. First, they do not account for all of the terminally\nill, so even if it is acknowledged that such people are incapable of\nagreeing to voluntary euthanasia that does not show that no one can\never voluntarily request help to die. Second, it is possible in at\nleast some jurisdictions for a person to indicate, in advance of\nlosing the capacity to give competent consent,\nhow she would wish to be treated should she become terminally ill and\nsuffer either intolerable pain or an unacceptable loss of control over\nher life (cf., for instance, Dworkin 1993). ‘Living\nwills’ or ‘advance directives’ are legal instruments\nfor giving voice to people’s wishes while they are capable of giving\ncompetent, enduring and voluntary consent, including to their wanting\nhelp to die. As long as they are easily revocable in the event of a\nchange of mind (just as civil wills are), they should be respected as\nevidence of a well thought-out conviction. (For more detailed\nconsideration of these instruments see the entry on\n  advance directives.)  \n\nPerhaps, though, what is really at issue in this objection is whether\nanyone can ever form a competent, enduring and voluntary\njudgement about being better off dead, rather than continuing to\nsuffer from an illness, prior to suffering such an illness\n(cf., Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012). If this is what underlies the\nobjection it is surely too paternalistic to be acceptable. Why is it\nnot possible for a person to have sufficient inductive evidence (e.g.,\nbased on the experience of the deaths of friends or family) to know\nher own mind, and act accordingly, without having had direct experience of \nsuch suffering? \n\nAccording to the traditional interpretation of the ‘doctrine\nof double effect’ it is permissible to act in a way which it is\nforeseen will have a bad effect, provided only that \n\nHence, it is permissible, according to the doctrine of double effect, to, for \nexample, alleviate pain (a good effect) by administering a drug such as\nmorphine, knowing that doing so will shorten life, but\nimpermissible to administer the same drug with the direct intention of\nterminating a patient’s life (a bad effect). This latter claim is said\nto apply regardless of whether the drug is given at the person’s\nrequest.  \n\nThis is not the appropriate forum for a full consideration\nof the doctrine, for which see the entry on the\n  doctrine of double effect. However,\nthere is one very important criticism to be made of the application of\nthe doctrine that has direct relevance to the issue of voluntary\neuthanasia. \n\nOn the most plausible reading, the doctrine of double effect can be\nrelevant to the permissibility of voluntary euthanasia only when a\nperson’s death is bad for her or, to put it another way, a\nharm to her. Sometimes the notion of ‘harm’ is\nunderstood simply as damage to a person’s interests whether consented\nto or not. At other times, it is understood, more strictly, as damage\nthat has been wrongfully inflicted. On either understanding of harm,\nthere can be instances in which death for a person does not constitute\na harm for her because it will either render her better off, or, as some \nwould insist, no worse off, when compared with remaining alive. \nAccordingly, in those instances, the doctrine of\ndouble effect can have no relevance to the debate about the\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia. (For extended discussions of\nthe doctrine of double effect and its bearing on the moral\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia see, e.g., McIntyre 2001;\nWoodward 2001; Cavanaugh 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.) \n\nAs was noted earlier in Section 3, there is a widespread belief \nconcerning the moral acceptability of so-called passive\n(voluntary) euthanasia, wherein life-sustaining or\nlife-prolonging measures are withdrawn or withheld in response to a competent\npatient’s request. The reason why passive (voluntary)\neuthanasia is said to be morally permissible is that the patient is simply\nallowed to die because steps are not taken to preserve or prolong life. \nThis happens, for example, when a dying patient requests\nthe withdrawal or the withholding of measures whose \nadministration would be medically futile, or unacceptably \nburdensome. By contrast, active (voluntary) euthanasia is said to be morally \nimpermissible because it is claimed to require an unjustifiable intentional act of \nkilling to satisfy the patient’s request (cf., for example, Finnis,\n1995; Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012).  \n\nDespite its popularity and widespread use, the distinction between\npassive and active euthanasia is neither particularly clear nor\nmorally helpful. (For a fuller discussion, see McMahan 2002.) Whether\nbehavior is described in terms of acts or omissions (a distinction\nwhich underpins the alleged difference between active and passive\nvoluntary euthanasia and that between killing a person and letting her\ndie), is often a matter of pragmatics rather than anything of deeper\nmoral importance. Consider, for instance, the practice (once common in\nhospitals) of deliberately proceeding slowly to a ward in response to\na request to provide assistance for a patient who has been assigned a\n‘not for resuscitation’ code. \nOr, consider ‘pulling\nthe plug’ on a respirator keeping an otherwise dying patient\nalive, as against not replacing the oxygen supply when it runs out. Are\nthese acts or omissions? If the answers turn on merely pragmatic\nconsiderations the supposed distinction between passive euthanasia and\nactive euthanasia will be hard to sustain. \n\nEven supposing that the distinction between acts and omissions, and\nthe associated distinction between killing and letting die, can be\nsatisfactorily clarified (on which see the entry\n  doing v. allowing harm), there remains the issue of whether these\ndistinctions have moral significance in any particular circumstance.\nConsider a case of a patient suffering from motor neurone disease\nwho is completely respirator dependent, finds her condition\nintolerable, and competently and persistently requests to be removed\nfrom the respirator so that she may die. Even the Catholic Church in\nrecent times has been prepared to agree that it is permissible, in a\ncase like this, to turn off the respirator. No doubt this has been\nbecause the Catholic Church considers such a patient is only being allowed\nto die. Even were it to be agreed, for the sake of argument, that such a\ndeath should be regarded as an instance of letting die, this concession would not show\nthat it would have been morally worse had the patient been killed at\nher request (active voluntary euthanasia) rather than being allowed to\ndie (passive voluntary euthanasia). Indeed, supporters of\nvoluntary medically assisted death maintain that since death is\nbeneficial in such an instance (or, at the very least, leaves the \ndying person no worse off), actively bringing about the death is\nmorally to be preferred to just allowing it to happen because the\ndesired benefit is achieved sooner.   \n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia claim, however, that the difference\nbetween active and passive euthanasia is to be found in the agent’s\nintention: if someone’s life is intentionally terminated she\nhas been killed, whereas if she is just no longer being aggressively\ntreated, her death should be attributed to the underlying disease. Many\nphysicians would say that their intention in withholding or withdrawing\nlife-sustaining medical treatment in such circumstances is simply to\nrespect the patient’s wishes. This is plausible in those instances\nwhere the patient competently requests that aggressive treatment no longer\nbe given (or, the patient’s proxy makes such a request). But it will\noften be implausible. In many cases the most plausible interpretation\nof a physician’s intention in withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining measures is\nthat it is to end the patient’s life. Consider the palliative care\npractice of ‘terminally sedating’ a patient after a decision has been\nmade to cease aggressive treatment. Suppose (as sometimes happens) that this is \nthen followed by withholding artificially supplied nutrition. In\nthese latter instances the best explanation of the physician’s\nbehavior is that the physician intends thereby to end the life of the\npatient. What could be the point of the action, the goal aimed at, the\nintended outcome, if not to end the patient’s life? (Cf. Winkler\n1995.) No sense can be made of the action as being intended to\npalliate the patient’s diseased condition, or to keep the patient\ncomfortable. Nor is it appropriate to claim that what kills the\npatient is the underlying disease. What kills the patient is the act of \ndepriving her of nutrition (i.e., of starving her to death). The point \ncan be generalized to cover many\nmore instances involving either the withdrawal or the withholding of\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. In short, there is no good reason\nto think that whereas so-called passive voluntary euthanasia is morally acceptable\nactive voluntary euthanasia never can be. \n\nBut we can go further. Giving titrated doses of morphine that reach\nlevels beyond those needed to control pain, or removing a respirator\nfrom a sufferer from motor neurone disease, seem to many of us to amount to\nintentionally bringing about the death of the person being cared\nfor. To be sure, as was acknowledged above, there are circumstances in\nwhich doctors can truthfully say that the actions they perform, or\nomissions they make, will bring about the deaths of their patients\neven though it was not their intention that those patients would\ndie. So, for instance, if a patient refuses life-prolonging medical\ntreatment because she considers it futile, it can be reasonable to say\nthat her doctor’s intention in complying with the request was simply\nto respect her wishes. Nevertheless, as we have seen, there are other\ncircumstances in which it is highly stilted to claim, as some doctors\ncontinue to do, that they had no intention of bringing about\ndeath.  \n\nThese considerations should settle matters but do not do so for\nthose who maintain that killing, in medical contexts, is always\nmorally unjustified – a premise that underwrites much of the\ndebate surrounding this fourth objection.  But this underlying\nassumption is open to challenge and has been challenged by, for instance,\nRachels 1986 and McMahan 2002. One of the reasons the\nchallengers have given is that there are cases in which killing a\ncompetent dying person when she requests assistance with dying, is\nmorally preferable to allowing her to die, namely, when taking\nthe latter option would serve only to prolong her suffering against\nher wishes.  Further, despite the longstanding legal doctrine that no\none can justifiably consent to be killed (on which more later), it\nsurely is relevant to the justification of an act of killing that the\nperson killed has autonomously decided that she would be better off\ndead and so asks to be helped to die. \n\nIt is sometimes said that if society allows voluntary\neuthanasia to be legalized, we will then have set foot on a slippery\nslope that will lead us eventually to support other forms of\neuthanasia, including, in particular, non-voluntary\neuthanasia. Whereas it was once the common refrain that that was\nprecisely what happened in Hitler’s Germany, in recent decades the\ntendency has been to claim that experience with legalized euthanasia\nin The Netherlands and Belgium, in particular, has confirmed the reality of the slippery\nslope.  \n\nSlippery slope arguments come in various versions. One (but not\nthe only) way of classifying them has been to refer to logical,\npsychological and arbitrary line versions. The common feature of the\ndifferent forms is the contention that once the first step is taken on\na slippery slope the subsequent steps follow inexorably, whether for\nlogical reasons, psychological reasons, or to avoid arbitrariness in\n‘drawing a line’ between \na person’s actions. (For further\ndiscussion see, e.g., Rachels 1986; Brock 1992; Walton 1992.) \n\nWe need first to consider whether, at the theoretical level, any of\nthese forms of argument is powerful enough to refute the case for\nthe legalization of voluntary euthanasia. We will then be in a\nposition to comment on the alleged empirical support from the\nexperiences of Hitler’s Germany and, more recently, of legalized\neuthanasia in The Netherlands and elsewhere, for the existence of a slippery slope\nthat will supposedly come into being with the legalization of voluntary\neuthanasia. \n\nTo begin with, there is nothing logically inconsistent in supporting voluntary\neuthanasia while maintaining the moral inappropriateness of\nnon-voluntary euthanasia. Undoubtedly, some advocates of voluntary euthanasia \nwish also to lend their support to some acts of non-voluntary\neuthanasia, for example, for those in persistent vegetative states who\nhave never indicated their wishes about being helped to die, or for\ncertain severely disabled infants for whom the outlook is\nhopeless. (See, e.g., Kuhse and Singer 1985; Singer 1994; Stingl 2010; \nSumner 2017.) Others believe that\nthe consent of the patient is strictly required if euthanasia is appropriately to be\nlegalized. The difference is not a matter of logical acumen; it is to\nbe explained by reference to the importance placed on key values by the respective\nsupporters. Thus, for example, those who insist on the necessity for\na competent patient request for medical assistance with\ndying typically believe that such a request is the paramount\nconsideration in end-of-life decision making (even when it is harnessed to the value of individual well-being), whereas those\nwho consider a person’s best interests to be the paramount consideration are\nmore likely to believe in the justifiability of instances of non-voluntary\neuthanasia like those mentioned above. \n\nNext, it is hard to see why moving from voluntary to non-voluntary\neuthanasia is supposed to be psychologically inevitable. Why should\nthose who support the legalization of voluntary euthanasia, because\nthey value the autonomy of the individual, find it psychologically\neasier, in consequence, to endorse the killing of those who are not\nable competently to request assistance with dying? What reason is\nthere to believe that they will, as a result of their support for\nvoluntary euthanasia, be psychologically driven to endorse a practice\nof non-voluntary euthanasia?   \n\nFinally, since there is nothing arbitrary about distinguishing\nvoluntary euthanasia from non-voluntary euthanasia (because the line\nbetween them is based on clear principles), there can be no substance\nto the charge that only by arbitrarily drawing a line between them\ncould non-voluntary euthanasia be avoided were voluntary euthanasia\nto be legalized. \n\nWhat, though, of Hitler’s Germany and the recent experience of \nlegalized voluntary euthanasia in The Netherlands and elsewhere? The\nformer is easily dismissed as an indication of an inevitable descent\nfrom voluntary euthanasia to non-voluntary. There never was a policy\nin favor of, or a legal practice of, voluntary euthanasia in Germany\nin the 1920s to the 1940s (see, for example, Burleigh 1994). There\nwas, prior to Hitler coming to power, a clear practice of killing some\ndisabled persons. But it was never suggested that\ntheir being killed was justified by reference to their best interests; \nrather, it was said that society would be benefited. Hitler’s later revival of\nthe practice and its widening to take in other groups such as Jews and\ngypsies was part of a program of eugenics, not\neuthanasia. \n\nSince the publication of the Remmelink Report in 1991 into the medical\npractice of euthanasia in The Netherlands, it has frequently been said\nthat the Dutch experience shows that legally protecting voluntary\neuthanasia is impossible without also affording shelter to the\nnon-voluntary euthanasia that will follow in its train (see, e.g.,\nKeown 2002). In the period since that report there have been a\nfurther four national studies of the practice of euthanasia in The\nNetherlands. These studies were carried out in 1995, 2001, 2005 and\n2010 respectively (see, e.g., Rietjens, et al. 2009;\nOnwuteaka-Philipsen, et al. 2012). The findings from these national\nstudies have consistently shown that there is no evidence for the\nexistence of such a slippery slope. Among the specific\nfindings the following are worth mentioning: of those terminally ill\npersons who have been assisted to die about sixty per cent have\nclearly been cases of voluntary euthanasia as it has been\ncharacterised in this entry; of the remainder, the vast majority of\ncases were of patients who at the time of their medically assisted\ndeaths were no longer competent. It might be thought that these deaths\nought to be regarded as instances of non-voluntary euthanasia. But, in\nfact, it would be inappropriate to regard them as such. Here is\nwhy. For the overwhelming majority of these cases, the decisions to\nend life were taken only after consultation between the attending\ndoctor(s) and close family members, and so can legitimately be thought\nof as involving substituted judgements. Moreover, according to the\nresearchers, the overwhelming majority of these cases fit within\neither of two common practices that occur in countries where voluntary\neuthanasia has not been legalized, namely, that of terminal sedation\nof dying patients, and that of giving large doses of opioids to\nrelieve pain while foreseeing that this will also end life. In a very\nfew cases, there was no consultation with relatives, though in those\ncases there were consultations with other medical personnel. The\nresearchers contend that these instances are best explained by the\nfact that families in The Netherlands strictly have no final legal\nauthority to act as surrogate decision-makers for incompetent\npersons. For these reasons the researchers maintain that non-voluntary\neuthanasia is not widely practised in The Netherlands. \n\nThat there have only been a handful of prosecutions of Dutch doctors\nfor failing to follow agreed procedures (Griffiths, et al., 1998),\nthat none of the doctors prosecuted has had a significant penalty\nimposed, that a significant proportion of requests for medical assistance with dying \nare rejected as unjustifiable, and that the Dutch public have regularly reaffirmed their\nsupport for the agreed procedures suggests that, contrary to the\nclaims of some critics, the legalization of voluntary euthanasia has\nnot increased the incidence of non-voluntary euthanasia.  A similar\npicture to the one in The Netherlands has emerged from studies of the\noperation of the law concerning physician-assisted suicide in\nOregon. Indeed, in a recent wide-ranging study of attitudes and practices \nof voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide covering two continents,\na prominent critic of these practices has concluded (in agreement with his co-authors)\nthat little evidence exists of  \nabuse, particularly of the vulnerable (see Emanuel, et al., 2016). \nUnfortunately, insufficient time has elapsed for\nappropriate studies to be conducted in the other jurisdictions that\nhave legalized either voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted\nsuicide.  Finally, some commentators have pointed out that there may, in\nreality, be more danger of the line between voluntary and\nnon-voluntary euthanasia being blurred if euthanasia is practised in\nthe absence of legal recognition, since there will, in those\ncircumstances, be neither transparency nor monitoring (which cannot be said of \nThe Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and so on).  \n\nNone of this is to suggest that it is not necessary to ensure the presence of\nsafeguards against potential abuse of legally protected voluntary\neuthanasia. This is particularly important for the protection of those who have become\nincompetent by the time decisions need to be taken about whether to\nassist them to die. Furthermore, it is, of course, possible that the\nreform of any law may have unintended effects. However, if the\narguments outlined above are sound (and the experience in the The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, along with\nthe more limited experience in several states in the United States, is, for the present,\nnot only the best evidence we have that they are sound, but the\nonly relevant evidence), that does not seem very likely.  \n\nIt is now well-established in many jurisdictions that competent\npatients are entitled to make their own decisions about\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. That is why they can refuse such\ntreatment even when doing so is tantamount to deciding to end their\nlife. It is plausible to think that the fundamental basis of the right\nto decide about life-sustaining treatment – respect for a\nperson’s autonomy and her assessment of what will best serve her well-being – has direct relevance to the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia (see, e.g., Dworkin in Frey et al., 1998; Young 2007, 2017; Sumner 2011).\nIn consequence, extending the right of self-determination to cover cases\nof voluntary euthanasia does not require a dramatic shift in legal\npolicy. Nor do any novel legal values or principles need to be\ninvoked. Indeed, the fact that suicide and attempted suicide are no\nlonger criminal offences in many jurisdictions indicates that the\ncentral importance of individual self-determination in a closely\nanalogous context has been accepted.  The fact that voluntary euthanasia \nand physician-assisted suicide have not been more widely decriminalized is\nperhaps best explained along a similar line to the one that has frequently been\noffered for excluding the consent of the victim as a justification for\nan act of killing, namely the difficulties thought to exist in\nestablishing the genuineness of the consent. But, the establishment of\nsuitable procedures for giving consent to voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide is surely no harder than\nestablishing procedures for competently refusing burdensome or\notherwise unwanted medical treatment. The latter has already been\naccomplished in many jurisdictions, so the former should be achievable\nas well. \n\nSuppose that the moral case for legalizing voluntary euthanasia \nand physician-assisted suicide does\ncome to be judged more widely as stronger than the case against legalization, and\nthey are made legally permissible in more jurisdictions\nthan at present. Should doctors take part in the practice? Should only\ndoctors perform voluntary euthanasia? These questions ought to be\nanswered in light of the best understanding of what it is to provide\nmedical care. The proper administration of medical care should promote\nthe welfare of patients while respecting their individual\nself-determination. It is these twin values that should guide medical\ncare, not the preservation of life at all costs, or the preservation\nof life without regard to whether patients want their lives prolonged\nshould they judge that life is no longer of benefit or value to them.\nMany doctors in those jurisdictions where medically assisted death has been \nlegalized and, to judge from available survey\nevidence, in other liberal democracies as well, see the practice of\nvoluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide as not only\ncompatible with their professional commitments but also with their\nconception of the best medical care for the dying. That being so, doctors\nof the same conviction in jurisdictions in which voluntary medically assisted \ndeath is currently illegal should no longer be prohibited by law from \nlending their professional assistance to competent terminally ill \npersons who request assistance with dying because of irremediable suffering \nor because their lives no longer have value for them.","contact.mail":"Robert.Young@latrobe.edu.au","contact.domain":"latrobe.edu.au"}]
