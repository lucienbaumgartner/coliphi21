Reeve","entry":"plato-friendship","body.text":"\n\n\nPlato discusses love (erôs) and friendship\n(philia) primarily in two dialogues, the Lysis and\nthe Symposium, though the Phaedrus also adds\nsignificantly to his views. In each work, Socrates as the\nquintessential philosopher is in two ways center stage, first, as a\nlover of wisdom (sophia) and discussion (logos),\nand, second, as himself an inverter or disturber of erotic norms.\nPlato’s views on love are a meditation on Socrates and the power his\nphilosophical conversations have to mesmerize, obsess, and\neducate.\n\n\nIn what follows, section 1 deals with the Lysis and\nSymposium. Sections 2–4 primarily with the\nSymposium alone. Section 5 deals with the Phaedrus.\nSection 6 with the closing section of the Symposium and with\nparts of the Ion, Protagoras, and Laws.\nSections are not self-contained, however, and are intended to be read\nsequentially. Most scholars agree that the order of composition of the\n“erotic” dialogues is Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus,\nthough some put the Phaedrus earlier than the\nSymposium.\n\n“The only thing I say I know,” Socrates tells us in the\nSymposium, “is the art of love (ta\nerôtika) (177d8–9). Taken literally, it is an\nincredible claim. Are we really to believe that the man who affirms\nwhen on trial for his life that he knows himself to be wise “in\nneither a great nor a small way” (Apology 21b4–5)\nknows the art of love? In fact, the claim is a nontrivial play on\nwords facilitated by the fact that the noun erôs\n(“love”) and the verb erôtan (“to ask\nquestions”) sound as if they are etymologically\nconnected—a connection explicitly exploited in the\nCratylus (398c5-e5). Socrates knows about the art of love in\nthat—but just insofar as—he knows how to ask questions,\nhow to converse elenctically. \nJust how far that is, we discover in the Lysis, where\nSocrates makes a similar claim. Hippothales, like Socrates, loves\nbeautiful boys and philosophical discussions (203b6–204a3). But\nhe does not know the art of love and so does not know how to talk to\nLysis—the boy with whom he is in love. What Hippothales does is\nsing eulogies to Lysis, and that, Socrates argues, no skilled\nlover would ever do. For if your suit succeeds “everything\nyou’ve said and sung turns out to eulogize yourself as victor in\nhaving won such a boyfriend,” but if it fails, then “the\ngreater your praise of his beauty and goodness, the more you will seem\nto have lost and the more you will be ridiculed.” Consequently,\nsomeone “who is wise in the art of love (ta\nerôtika) doesn’t praise his beloved until he has him: he\nfears how the future may turn out” (205e2–206a2).\nConvinced, Hippothales asks Socrates to tell him “what someone\nshould say or do to get his prospective boyfriend to love him?”\n(206c1–3). As in the Symposium, Socrates is\nuncharacteristically forthcoming: “if you’re willing to have him\ntalk with me, I might be able to give you a demonstration of how to\ncarry on a discussion with him” (c4–6). What follows is an\nelenctic examination of Lysis. Socrates’ lessons in love, we may\ninfer, are elenctic lessons—lessons in how to ask and answer\nquestions. \nAt the end of the examination, Socrates characterizes what he has\naccomplished: “This is how you should talk to your boyfriends,\nHippothales, making them humble and drawing in their sails, instead of\nswelling them up and spoiling them, as you do” (210e2–5).\nIt sounds simply chastening put like that. But in the overall context\nof the Lysis, where love is a desire and desire is an\nemptiness, it is much more. It is a step in the creation of the\ncanonical lover—the philosopher: \nThose who are already wise no longer love wisdom\n(philosophein), whether they are gods or men. Neither do\nthose who are so ignorant that they are bad, for no bad and stupid\nperson loves wisdom. There remains only those who have this bad thing,\nignorance, but have not yet been made ignorant and stupid by it. They\nare conscious of not knowing what they don’t know. (218a2-b1) \nSo by showing Lysis that he isn’t already wise, by getting him to\nrecognize that he doesn’t know, Socrates sets him on the road to\nphilosophy (cf. Sophist 231b3–8). \nThe elenchus is important to love, then, because it creates a hunger\nfor wisdom—a hunger which it cannot itself assuage. So even\nthough Lysis is already something of a philosopher when he meets\nSocrates and receives a rare accolade from him—“I was\npleased with his love of wisdom (philosophia)”\n(213d6)—he, too, is left in puzzlement (aporia). He is\nmade aware of his desire by Socrates but the desire itself remains\nunsatisfied. Socrates may be the master of foreplay, of arousing\ndesire, and may to that extent be a master of the art of love, but\nwhen it comes to satisfying desire, he is a failure. \nThe connection—amounting to an identification—between the\nart of discussion and the art of loving boys explored in the\nLysis allows us to see why Plato’s own explorations of love\ninvariably involve an exploration of discussion too—love-talk in\nthe Lysis, symposiastic speech-making and drama in the\nSymposium, oratory and rhetoric in the Phaedrus.\nLoving boys correctly, after all, is—in part at least—just\na matter of knowing how to talk to them, of how to persuade them to\nlove you back. \nAs a man who loves boys in an idiosyncratic, because elenctic, way,\nSocrates is placed in potential conflict with the norms of a peculiar\nAthenian social institution, that of paiderastia—the\nsocially regulated intercourse between an older Athenian male\n(erastês) and a teenage boy (erômenos,\npais), through which the latter was supposed to learn virtue.\nAnd this potential, as we know, was realized with tragic\nconsequences—in 399 BC Socrates was found guilty of corrupting\nthe young men of Athens and condemned to death. The effect on Plato is\npalpable in his works, turning very many of them into\ndefenses—not always uncritical—of Socrates, and of what he\nrepresented for the young men he encountered. His account in the\nSymposium of one such relationship—that with the\nbrilliant and beautiful Alcibiades—is an illuminating case in\npoint. \nAlcibiades was so in love with Socrates—“it was\nobvious,” the Symposium (222c1–2) tells\nus—that when asked to speak of love, he speaks of his beloved.\nNo general theories of love for him, just the vividly remembered story\nof the times he spent with a man so extraordinary there has never been\nanyone like him—a man so powerfully erotic he turned the\nconventional world of love upside down by “seeming to be a lover\n(erastês) while really establishing himself as a\nbeloved boy (pais) instead” (222b3–4). \nThe stories of all the other symposiasts, too, are stories of their\nparticular loves masquerading as stories of love itself, stories about\nwhat they find beautiful masquerading as stories about what\nis beautiful. For Phaedrus and Pausanius, the canonical image\nof true love—the quintessential love story—features the\nright sort of older male lover and the right sort of beloved boy. For\nEryximachus the image of true love is painted in the languages of his\nown beloved medicine and of all the other crafts and sciences. For\nAristophanes it is painted in the language of comedy. For Agathon, in\nthe loftier tones of tragedy. In ways that these men are unaware of,\nthen, but that Plato knows, their love stories are themselves\nmanifestations of their loves and of the inversions or perversions\nexpressed in them. They think their stories are the truth about love,\nbut they are really love’s delusions—“images,” as\nDiotima will later call them. As such, however, they are essential\nparts of that truth. For the power of love to engender delusive images\nof the beautiful is as much a part of the truth about it as its power\nto lead to the beautiful itself. Later, we shall learn why. \nLove stories, however inadequate as theories of love, are nonetheless\nstories, logoi, items that admit of analysis. But because\nthey are manifestations of our loves, not mere cool bits of\ntheorizing, we—our deepest feelings—are invested in them.\nThey are therefore tailor-made, in one way at least, to satisfy the\nSocratic sincerity condition, the demand that you say what you believe\n(Crito 49c11-d2, Protagoras 331c4-d1). Under the\ncool gaze of the elenctic eye, they are tested for consistency with\nother beliefs that lie just outside love’s controlling and often\ndistorting ambit. Under such testing, a lover may be forced to say\nwith Agathon, “I didn’t know what I was talking about in that\nstory” (201b11–12). The love that expressed itself in his\nlove story meets then another love: his rational desire for\nconsistency and intelligibility; his desire to be able to tell and\nlive a coherent story; his desire—to put it the other way\naround—not to be endlessly frustrated and conflicted, because he\nis repetitively trying to live out an incoherent love story. \nIn Alcibiades’ love story, in particular, these two desires are\nself-consciously in play: “Socrates is the only man in the world\nwho has made me feel shame… I know perfectly well that I can’t\nprove he’s wrong when he tells me what I should do: yet, the moment I\nleave his side, I go back to my old ways: I cave in to my desire to\nplease the crowd” (216b1–5). Even such awareness of\nconflict as is manifested here, however, is no guarantee of a\nsatisfactory resolution. For the new love—the one that seems to\noffer coherence, satisfaction, and release from shame—may turn\nout to be just the old frustrating one in disguise.  \nAlcibiades’ famous failed attempt to seduce Socrates shows that this\nis so in his case too (218b8-e5). For Alcibiades doesn’t try to win\nSocrates’ love by undertaking the difficult task of\nself-transformation required to become a more virtuous, and so more\ntruly beautiful and lovable, person. Instead, he takes the easy,\nfamiliar path of offering the physical attractions he already\nhas—the ones that have earned him the approval of the crowd.\nWhen these fail him, it is to the crowd (in the form of the Bacchic\nrevelers we meet at the end of the Symposium) he will\nregressively return, having never really succeeded in turning\naway. \nThat he has never turned away is made yet more vivid in one of the\nmost intriguing passages in the Symposium. Socrates,\nAlcibiades says, is “ironical eirôneuomenos) and\nspends his whole life playing with people. Yet, I don’t know whether\nanyone else has seen the figures within (ta entos agalmata)\nwhen he is serious and opened up, but I saw them once, and I thought\nthat they were so divine and golden, so marvelously beautiful, that I\njust had to do whatever Socrates told me” (216e4–217a2).\nImagine seeing Socrates without his ironic mask of mock modesty. What\nwe wouldn’t give to see that. As is so often the case with love,\nhowever, it is fantasy we are dealing with. What Alcibiades thinks he\nsees in Socrates are embryonic virtues, which—like spermatazoa\nin the embryology the Symposium implicitly embraces when it\nspeaks of the lover as pregnant and as seeking a beautiful\nboy in which to beget an offspring—need only be ejaculated into\nthe right receptacle in order to grow into their mature forms\n(209a5-c2). Sex can lead to virtue, in other words, without the need\nfor hard work. As soon as the illusion is enjoyed, therefore, it gives\nbirth not to a realistic attempt to acquire virtue, but to the sexual\nseduction fantasy mentioned earlier. \nThe origins of this fantasy—though, no doubt, partly\npersonal—are predominantly social. It is the complex ideology of\nAthenian paiderasteia that has shaped Alcibiades’ own\ndesires. For, according to it, love is really “two\nthings”: good Uranian love, whose object is the soul, and whose\naim is to instill virtue in the younger male; and bad Pandemotic love,\nwhose object is the body and whose aim is sexual pleasure for the\nolder lover (180c1-d7). What causes the split is the need Pandemotic\nlove has to mask itself as Uranian love in order to preserve the\nillusion that the young man’s participation in it is compatible with\nhis status as a future male citizen. It cannot, then, be motivated by\na reprehensible desire to adopt a passive, slavish, female\npleasure-seeking role. Instead, another motive must be invented for\nit—a willingness to accept “slavery for the sake of\nvirtue” (184c2–3).  \nA major cost of preserving this split, however, is that the older\nmale’s body-focused, sexual intercourse must itself be masked as\nintercourse of a more respectable sort. Alcibiades’ later\nre-description of Socrates’ inner figures shows him succumbing to the\ndouble-vision that inevitably results: \nIf you were to listen to his arguments, at first they’d strike you as\ntotally ridiculous; they’re clothed in words as coarse as the hides\nworn by the most vulgar satyrs. He’s always going on about pack asses,\nor blacksmiths, or cobblers, or tanners… But if the arguments\nare opened and one sees them from the inside, he will find first that\nthey are the only arguments with any sense in them, and next that they\ncontain within themselves utterly divine and multitudinous figures of\nvirtue (agalmat’ aretês). (221e1–222a4)  \nFor Alcibiades, then, Socrates’ body is identical to his words; the\nvirtues that are in him are in them; talking philosophy is having\nsexual intercourse, and vice versa. \nAt the beginning of the Symposium, an unidentified man wants\nto hear what was said about love by Socrates and the others at\nAgathon’s house. He has heard a garbled account. Now he wants\nApollodorus to tell him what was really said. But Apollodorus wasn’t\nthere either. He got his account of the proceedings second-hand from\nAristodemus. All these men who ought to be chasing boys are presented\nas so besotted with Socrates and his conversations that one of\nthem—Apollodorus—makes it his business to know exactly\nwhat Socrates does and says each day (172c4–6), while\nanother—Aristodemus—is so far gone in his passion for\nSocrates that he walks barefoot like his beloved (173b1–4). One\nreason for this complex set-up is to let us see the inverting impact\nof Socrates—and so of philosophy—on Athenian paiderastic\nnorms. Another is more subtle. Alcibiades’ love for Socrates focuses\non the beautiful figures of virtue which he thinks he sees lying\nbeneath those “words as coarse as the hides worn by the most\nvulgar satyrs,” which are the analog for him of Socrates’ ugly,\nsatyr-like body (215b3-4). Aristodemus’ love for Socrates, by\ncontrast, seems to focus on his coarse exterior, so that Aristodemus\nhimself is a sort of inverted Alcibiades, whose very name associates\nhim with Pausanias’ body-centered goddess of love,\nPandêmos. Loving Socrates, we may infer, is a complex\nbusiness, since just what someone loves in loving him is tied to that\nperson’s peculiar desires, and the limits they impose on how like\nSocrates he can become. \nIn the dialogue’s next few scenes, this point is driven home. When\nAristodemus meets him, Socrates has just bathed and put on his fancy\nsandals—“both very unusual events” (174a3–4).\nAristodemus remarks on this because he is naturally sensitive to those\naspects of Socrates which he himself—perhaps because of his own\nsize and appearance (173b2)—has chosen to emulate. The reason\nfor the departure from his usual habits, Socrates explains, is that he\nis going to Agathon’s party and wants “beauty to go to\nbeauty” (174a9). Oddly, this doesn’t stop him from bringing\nAristodemus—un-bathed, un-sandaled, un-beautiful—along.\nBut what is odd from the point of view of Socrates’\nself-ascribed motivations is not at all odd from that of\nPlato’s. He has now made the complexity of Socrates—his\nbeautiful insides and ugly outsides or vice versa—as\ndramatically present to our eyes as to those of Agathon and his other\nguests. \nSocrates is invited to Agathon’s—Goodman’s.\n(‘Agathon’ means good in Greek.) He thinks—wrongly\nas it happens—that Aristodemus isn’t invited, but offers to take\nhim along anyway. Aristodemus’ reply—“I’ll do whatever you\nsay” (174b2)—again connects him to Alcibiades: “I\njust had to do whatever he told me” (217a1–2). “Come\nwith me then,” Socrates responds, “and we shall prove the\nproverb wrong; the truth is, ‘Good men go uninvited to Goodman’s\nfeast’”\n (174b4–5).[1]\n Aristodemus is not convinced. “Socrates, I’m afraid…\nmine is the case of an inferior arriving uninvited at the table of a\nwise man” (174c5–7). The familiar Socratic\ntri-unity—good, beautiful, wise—are all now in play. \nDespite his reservations, Aristodemus agrees to accompany\nSocrates—but with an important proviso: “See what defense\nyou’re going to make (apologêsê) for bringing me\nalong, because I won’t admit I came uninvited, I’ll say you brought\nme!” (174c7-d1). It is this proviso that initiates the next\nmystifying episode. It begins when Socrates replies by under-quoting\nHomer: “We’ll take counsel about what to say ‘when two go\ntogether along the way’” (174d2–3). What he leaves\nout is what happens when two do go together, namely,\n“one of them knows before the other” (Iliad X.\n24). The elision of this phrase is matched by an elision of Plato’s\nown. For what happened on the road to Agathon’s is that\n“Socrates began to think about something, lost himself in\nthought, and kept lagging behind” (174d4–7). Yet we are\nnever told what he thought about—what it was that one knew\nbefore the other. \nThat the match between these two elisions is significant is\nestablished by another match: the one between the defense Socrates\ndoesn’t give for bringing Aristodemus to Agathon’s and the one he\ndoesn’t give before the jury in 399 B.C., when he is on trial for\ncorrupting the youth. I mean, the defense Socrates’ familiar spirit or\ndaimonion prevents him from giving by not preventing him from\ngiving the one in which he speaks and acts in his own accustomed\nelenctic way—in which he plays the part of himself (Ap.\n40a2-b6). Later in the Symposium, the match is reestablished\nby the close parallels between the preamble to Socrates’ speech in\npraise of Erôs and that to his speech before the jury.\nThere he is “amazed (ethaumasa)” by what his\naccusers say (Ap. 17a4–5); here Agathon’s speech is\n“amazing (thaumasta)” (Smp. 198b4).\nThere he isn’t a clever (deinos) speaker, unless cleverness\nconsists in speaking the truth (Ap. 17a4-b6). Here he isn’t\nclever in the art of love unless encomia to Erôs\ninvolve telling the truth about it (Smp. 198c5–199a6).\nThere “what the jurors will hear will be spoken extemporaneously\n(epituchousin) in whatever words come to mind”\n(Ap. 17c1–2); here the symposiasts will “hear the\ntruth spoken about Erôs in such words and arrangements\nas occur to me extemporaneously (tuchê\nepelthousa)” (Smp. 199b3–5). Whatever\noccupies Socrates on the road to Agathon’s, we may infer, ends not in\nthe knowledge Homer is so confident either he or Aristodemus will\nhave, but in the aporetic awareness of the absence of knowledge that\ndistinguishes Socrates’ “human wisdom” from the\n“more than human wisdom” claimed by the sophists\n(Ap. 20c4-e8). \nThe result of Socrates’ losing his way in thought and ending up\nstymied in Agathon’s neighbor’s porch is that Aristodemus, like a\nproper Socratic paraclete, arrives at Agathon’s quite a bit before\nSocrates. When Socrates finally does arrive in propria\nperson, Agathon says: “Socrates, come lie down next to me.\nWho knows, if I touch you, I may catch a bit of the wisdom that came\nto you under my neighbor’s porch” (175c7-d1). Socrates replies\nwith an obviously sexual simile, which acknowledges, so as later once\nagain to invert, paiderastic norms: “If only wisdom were like\nwater which always flows from a full cup into an empty one when we\nconnect them with a piece of yarn. If wisdom were that way too, I\nvalue the place beside you very much indeed; for I think I will be\nfilled from you with wisdom of great beauty” (175d4-e2). What\nactually happens, however, is the very reverse. Socrates responds to\nAgathon’s fancy speech about love with an elenchus, so that his\nemptiness, his lack of knowledge, flows into Agathon, destroying the\nwisdom of great beauty that had won his tragedy a first prize the day\nbefore (175e4–7). \nSocrates is adept at some parts of the art of love but cannot take his\nbeloveds all the way. So he is clearly in need of further instruction\nin the art of love. In the Symposium, this is provided to him\nby Diotima, whom he describes as “the one who taught me the art\nof love” (201d5). And what she teaches him, in a nutshell, is\nPlatonism. What the elenchus needs if it is to satisfy rather than\nfrustrate love, in other words, is the theory of Platonic Forms. What\nSocrates needs—and so ought to love—is Plato! The story of\nPlatonic love is, one might say, the story of the Platonizing of\nSocrates. \nIf what Socrates learned from Diotima was about all love, however, it\nwould be refuted by the very fact of Alcibiades, whose love for\nSocrates has not led him to love the beautiful itself. It would be\nequally refuted, indeed, by all the other symposiasts, none of whom\nhas been led there by his love. But Diotima’s love story is not so\ngeneral. It is self-advertised as a story about “loving boys\ncorrectly (to orthôs paiderastein)”\n(211b5–6)—as a lesson in “the correct way to go or\nto be led by another to the art of love” (211b7-c1). To be sure,\nit doesn’t itself explicitly provide us with a story about how\nErôs can act as a force which retards development. But\nthat isn’t because Plato thought Erôs could not act as\nsuch a force—consider Alcibiades. Rather, it is because\nDiotima’s story is a story about successful or correct love.  \nThe credibility of Diotima’s love story is another matter, of course.\nTo many, it has seemed both incredible and distasteful, because it\nseems to say that beautiful individuals have only instrumental value.\nWhen one has climbed the ladder, of which they are merely the first\nrung, one should kick it—and them—away. But is this\nmessage really Diotima’s? \nWhat we all love, according to Diotima, is the good—that is to\nsay, we want good things to be ours forever. But because we are\nmortal, the closest we can come to satisfying this desire is to\ninitiate an endless cycle of reproduction in which each new generation\nhas good things. We achieve this, in a famous phrase, by “giving\nbirth in beauty (tokos en kalô)” (206b7–8,\ne5). What does this mean? Like Athenian paiderasteia, Diotima\nrecognizes two fundamentally different kinds of love, two\nfundamentally different varieties of the desire to give birth in\nbeauty. In the case of heterosexual lovers, who are “pregnant in\nbody,” such giving birth consists in producing children who\nresemble, and so share in the beauty of their parents (209a3–4).\nHomosexual lovers, however, are a different story. What they give\nbirth to is “wisdom and the rest of virtue” (209b8). When\na man who is pregnant in soul finds a beautiful boy, Diotima says, it\n“makes him instantly teem with accounts of virtue”\n(209b8), or “beautiful accounts”  (210a8). Giving\nbirth to virtue and giving birth to accounts of it are obviously\ndifferent. But some of the other phrases Diotima uses show us how to\nmitigate the difference. For what homosexual lovers want is to give\nbirth to accounts of virtue of a particular sort—ones that can\nbe used in “the proper ordering of cities and households”\n(209a6–7), and so can “make young men better”\n(210c1–3).  \nIf the lover’s accounts are to achieve this goal, however, they\nmustn’t be the product of distorting fantasy, as Nietzsche thinks so\nmany of our moral concepts are and as some feminists think our concept\nof romantic love itself is. What is intended to insure that they will\nnot is their openness to reality—an openness guaranteed by the\nfact that in the course of his ascent the lover must study the beauty\nof ways of life and laws (210c3–5) and the beauty of the\nsciences (c6–7). What he gains from these studies are the\nconceptual resources needed to see the world, including the human\nworld, aright—to gain knowledge of it. This is not the project\nan analysand takes up in psychoanalysis. Nor is it the one that we\nless formally undertake when we reflect on our own love stories in\nhopes of understanding them (often a project provoked alas by an\nunhappy ending). It is instead the project of philosophy, as Plato\nconceives of it. That is why it culminates in “the birth of many\ngloriously beautiful accounts and theories in unstinting love of\nwisdom (philosophia)” (210d5–6). Yet the grander\nproject intersects with the analysand’s project and with ours in an\ninteresting way. The terms or concepts we use to tell our love stories\nmust themselves be coherent if the stories we use them to tell are\nthemselves to be coherently livable.  \nIn Plato’s view, this means that they must be the concepts the true\nlover uses once he has seen the beautiful itself—the concepts\nwhose ontological correlates are forms. If they are not, they will be\nincoherent and the lover who employs them will find himself embroiled\nin a love story he does not understand, a love story whose incoherence\nthe elenchus, or psychoanalysis, or just plain critical scrutiny will\nreveal. It is this incoherence, indeed, encountered at lower stages in\nthe ascent, that leads the correct lover, under pressure from his\nrational desire for truth and consistency, and the pain of\ninconsistency, to climb to the next stage. \nWe can see Diotima, then, not only as revealing the other more\nabstract loves that a true lover of boys must have, but also as\nexploring the conditions concepts must meet if they are to figure in\ngenuinely coherent love stories. Her story isn’t about a lover who\nabandons the individual boys he loves, but about someone who comes to\nlove boys successfully by coming to love something else as well. \nLike Diotima herself, we have been concentrating on what other things\na lover is led to love by his love for his beloved boy. We have said\nnothing about the changes explorations in this enlarged erotic field\neffect in the desires and feelings of the lover himself. But these,\ntoo, help us to see what happens to his love for his boy in the course\nof his explorations. What hooks the lover to begin with is love for a\nparticular body: “First, if the Leader leads aright, he should\nlove one body and beget beautiful accounts there”\n(210a6–8). At this stage, what the boy engages in the lover is\nhis sexual desire for physical beauty, albeit one which, in firm\nkeeping with the norms of Athenian paiderastia, is supposedly\naim-inhibited: instead of sexual intercourse, it leads to discussions\nabout beauty and to accounts of it. Here the beauty at issue is, in\nthe first instance, the boy who represents beauty itself to the\nlover. That is why, when the lover finally comes to see the\nbeautiful itself, “beauty will no longer seem to you to be\nmeasured by gold or raiment or beautiful boys or youths, which now you\nlook upon dumbstruck” (211d3–5). One effect of generating\naccounts of this beauty, however, is that the lover comes to\nsee his beloved’s beautiful body as one among many: if it is\nbeautiful, so are any other bodies the accounts fit. And this\ninitially cognitive discovery leads to a conative change:\n“Realizing this he is established as a lover of all beautiful\nbodies and relaxes this excessive preoccupation with one, thinking\nless of it and believing it to be a small matter”\n(210b4–6). \nIt is important in reading Diotima’s description of this change that\nwe see it as comparative and contrastive: the lover used to\novervalue his beloved (211d5–8, quoted below)—now\nhe values him appropriately. But valuing appropriately is\nstill valuing. The boy is still included in the class of beautiful\nbodies the lover now loves. It is also important to notice that\ncognitive and conative change are going hand-in-hand. To recognize\nthat his beloved is one among many, the lover’s love for him has to\nchange. And that means that psychological resources within the\nlover—beyond his sexual responsiveness to physical\nbeauty—are coming into play. More of the lover is now involved\nin his love. Hence what his beloved might be thought to lose in\nexclusivity he gains in richness—and no doubt in endurance and\nreliability—of response. When his physical bloom fades, he will\nnow still be loved. \nBut love that is to escape frustration cannot stop with bodies. The\nattempt to formulate an account of love free from puzzles and immune\nto elenctic refutation must lead on from beautiful bodies to beautiful\nsouls, and so to the beautiful laws and practices that will improve\nsouls and make young men better. Again this cognitive achievement is\nmatched by a conative one. When the lover sees that all these\nbeautiful things are somehow akin in the beauty, he comes to think\nthat “bodily beauty is a small thing” (210c5–6), and\nso, as before, becomes less obsessed with it. \nAt the top of the scala amoris lies the beautiful itself, the\nfirst loved object that—like the “primary object of love\n(prôton philon) in the Lysis\n(219d2-e4)—is not in any way gone beyond. Here, it seems, the\nlover at last finds something worthy of the obsessive attention he had\nonce lavished on his beloved boy (211d8–212a7). Nonetheless,\nobsession is out of place even here. For the beautiful itself can no\nmore satisfy the lover’s desires to eat and drink than his beloved\ncan. Here—as there—what he would do if it were possible\nmust not be confused with what he can and does do. After all, the\nlover himself cannot become immortal except by giving birth in the\nbeauty he has at last found. He does that, however, precisely by\narranging for his beloved to grow up, become truly virtuous, and be\nwith him in the contemplation of—and, to the extent that it is\npossible, the possession of—true beauty. \nIn the Phaedrus we find a more detailed account of the\npsychology and art of love than in the Symposium. This\naccount will be our exclusive focus. The soul, whether divine or\nhuman, Socrates claims, is like “the natural union of a team of\nwinged horses and their charioteer” (246a6–7). But whereas\nin a divine soul all three elements are “good and come from good\nstock,” in a human soul the white horse (familiar from\nRepublic IV as the honor-loving spirited element) is\n“beautiful and good, and of similar stock,” while the\nblack one (the Republic’s appetitive element) is “the\nopposite and of the opposite stock,” so that “the driving\nin our case is necessarily difficult and troublesome” (a7-b4).\nWhen spirit together with the charioteer (the Republic’s\nrational element, there too identified with what is truly human rather\nthan bestial in us (588b10–589a4)) “leads us towards what\nis best and is in control,” we possess moderation\n(sôphrosunê) (237e2–3). But when\n“appetite drags us irrationally towards pleasures and rules in\nus, its rule is called excess (hubris)”\n(238a1–2). Of this excess, gluttony is one species, but erotic\nlove another (238b7-c4). This is the bad kind of love—Pandemotic\nin the Symposium—that Lysias rightly disparages in the\nspeech Phaedrus admires and reads to Socrates (230e6–234c5).\n \nIn Socrates’ view, however, there is also another kind of love,\nnamely, “the madness of a man who, on seeing beauty here on\nearth, and being reminded of true beauty, becomes winged, and\nfluttering with eagerness to fly upwards, but unable to leave the\nground, looks upwards like a bird, and takes no heed of things\nbelow—and that is what causes him to be regarded as mad”\n(249d5-e1). This madman is the philosopher of the Symposium,\nwho when he falls in love with a boy is led by his love to ascend by\nstages to the form of the beautiful. What makes his madness a divine\ngift, however, is that the ascent is now revealed as involving\nrecollection of a prior pre-natal ascent taken in the company of a\ngod.  \nFrom the rich literary account of this ascent, we need to take away\njust one idea: souls have different psychological structures depending\non which god they followed, since this sets an upper limit on how much\nof the forms they see, and so how much they can subsequently\nrecollect. Since gaining access to forms nourishes and strengthens the\nrational element in the soul (248b5-c2), this also helps determine\ntheir motivational structure: the stronger their reason is, the more\nlikely it will be to succeed in controlling the other elements in the\nsoul.  \nFollowers of Zeus, for example, choose someone to love whose soul\nresembles their patron god. So they seek someone who is\n“naturally disposed to philosophy and leadership, and when they\nhave found him and fall in love they do everything to make him\nphilosophical” (252e1–5). Nonetheless, the falling itself\ninvolves a huge psychological upheaval. The black horse of appetite\nimmediately urges towards sexual intercourse. The white\nhorse—“constrained then as always by shame”\n(254a2)—holds itself back. Eventually, however, the black horse\nforces both the charioteer and the white horse “to move towards\nthe beloved and mention to him the delights of sex”\n(a5–7). Again they balk, “indignant at being forced to do\nterrible and improper things” (b1). But finally, “when\nthere is no limit to their plight, they follow its lead, giving in and\nagreeing to do what it tells them” (b2–3). As they come\nclose to the beloved, however, to initiate intercourse, the flashing\nface of the beloved reminds the charioteer of the beautiful itself, so\nthat his memory “again sees it standing together with temperance\non a holy pedestal” (b5–7). He becomes frightened and\n“in sudden reverence falls on his back, and is forced at the\nsame time to pull back the reins so violently as to bring the horses\ndown on their haunches, the one willingly, because of it lack of\nresistance to him, but the unruly horse much against its will”\n(b7-c3). Eventually, “when the same thing happens to the evil\nhorse many times, it allows the charioteer with his foresight to\nlead” (e5–7). If this control of appetite by reason and\nspirit continues—even when the boy has accepted his lover and\nembraces, kisses, and lies down with him—and draws them to\n“a well-ordered life and to philosophy,” they are\nblessedly happy here on earth, and, if they live such a life for three\nsuccessive incarnations, they re-grow their wings and re-join the\nentourage of their god (255e2-b7). \nWhen followers of Ares fall in love, on the other hand, they\n“adopt a lower way of living, not philosophical, but\nhonor-loving” (256b7-c1). When they are drinking together, for\nexample, or are careless in some other way, “the licentious\nhorses in the two of them catch their souls off guard,” and\nsince the man’s recollection of beauty is dimmer and is not rekindled\nby philosophical conversation, they end up having sex\ntogether—something “the masses regard as the happiest\nchoice of all” (c1–5). Nonetheless, they don’t have sex\nvery often, because “what they are doing has not been approved\nby their whole mind” (c6–7). So while the degree of their\nlove and happiness is less than the philosophical pair and, on their\ndeath, “they leave the body without wings,” still they\nhave an impulse, coming from love, to try to gain them. Hence they\naren’t punished in the next life, but helped on the way to future\nhappiness together (c7-e2). \nThe love that is divine madness is a good thing, therefore, especially\nwhen, “accompanied by philosophical discussions (erôta\nmeta philosophôn logôn)” (257b6), it leads to\nthe beautiful itself and the other forms, which are what we—as\nmost of all the rational element in our souls—truly love and\ncrave. The question is what makes a discussion philosophical? What\nmakes it of the sort to be included in the true art of love that the\nphilosopher who loves the beautiful itself practices? The answer now\nproposed is that it must be a technê or craft, and so\nmust have the defining characteristics of one. As applied to love\nitself, for example, it must begin with a definition of love, and\nreach its conclusions by ordering its discussion in relation to it\n(263d5-e3). And this definition, in turn, must be established by what\nSocrates refers to as collection and division (266b3–4).  \nCollection is a process of “perceiving together and bringing\ninto one form items that are scattered in many places”\n(265d3–4). It is a process that we, unlike other animals, are\nable to engage in it, because our souls include a rational element\nthat has prior acquaintance with forms: “a soul that never\n[prenatally] saw what is true cannot take a human shape, since a human\nbeing must understand what is said by relation to a form that is\nreached from many sense-perceptions being collected into one by\nreasoning” (249b5-c1). (It is useful to compare this description\nwith the one given in Aristotle, Posterior Analytics II.\n19.) \nOnce a form has been reached in this way, division begins. This is a\nmatter of “cutting the form up again, by relation to\n[sub-]forms, by relation to its natural joints” (265e1-2). As an\nexample, Socrates cites the case of love itself:  \nThus, while each speech tells only half the story, the two together\nshow how correct division should proceed. The goal, however, isn’t\njust truth or correctness, but explanatory adequacy. Thus if the form\nin question “is simple, we should consider…what natural\ncapacity it has for acting and on what, or for being acted upon and by\nwhat,” and if it is complex, we should count its sub-forms, and\nconsider the same things about them as about the simple ones\n(270d3–7). That Socrates—the archetypal searcher for\nexplanatory definitions (Euthyphro 6d9-e6)—should\npronounce himself “a lover of these divisions and\ncollections” is no surprise, therefore (266b3–4). \nPhilosophy aims at true definitions and true stories based on them.\nBut it also aims at persuasion, since the philosophical lover wants to\npersuade his boy to follow him on the path to the forms. Philosophy\nand rhetoric must thus go together, which means that rhetoric, too,\nmust be developed as a technê. It must, first,\ndistinguish and give definitions of the various kinds of souls and\nkinds of speeches, revealing their respective capacities and\nsusceptibilities, and, second, “coordinate each kind of soul\nwith the kind of speech appropriate to it, explaining why one kind of\nsoul is necessarily convinced by one kind of speech, while another is\nnot” (271b1–5). Mastery of such a science, however,\nrequires one further thing: “the student must observe these\nthings as they are in real life, and actually being put into practice,\nand be able to follow them with keen perception” (d8-e1). It\nisn’t enough, in other words, to know what kinds of speeches affect\nwhat kinds of soul, the philosophical rhetorician must also know that\nthis man in front of him is of such and such a kind, and be able to\ntalk in the kind of way that will prove convincing to him\n(e2–272b2). \nAt the end of the Symposium, Alcibiades has gone off,\npresumably with the throng of Bacchic revelers, who burst into his\nlife as representatives of his overpowering love for the approval and\nflattery of the crowd. Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon are left\nbehind discussing tragedy and comedy: “the main point was that\nSocrates was trying to prove to them that the same man knows\n(epistasthai) how to write both comedy and tragedy, that\nsomeone who is by craft (technê) a tragic poet is a\ncomic poet too” (223d2–6).  \nThe key words here, as we learn in the Ion, are\nepistasthai and technê. Ordinary poets cannot\nwrite both comedy and tragedy, because they do not write out of\nknowledge and craft (technê) but out of divine\ninspiration (Ion 534c5–6). If they did write out of\ncraft and knowledge, if they were craftsmen poets, they would\nbe able to write both comedy and tragedy, because opposites are always\nstudied by the same craft. Thus the comedic craft and the tragic craft\nwould have to be one and the same; just as one and the same craft,\nmedicine, deals with both sickness and health. \nSocrates tells us what a craftsman poet would be able to\nwrite, he does not tell us what he would write. Other\nPlatonic spokesmen are somewhat more forthcoming. “We ourselves\nare poets,” the Athenian Stranger tells us in the Laws,\n“who have to the best of our ability created a tragedy that is\nthe finest and the best; at any rate, our entire constitution is\nconstructed as an imitation of the finest and best way of\nlife—the very thing which we claim is the truest tragedy”\n(817b1–5). Earlier in the same discussion, the Stranger is\nequally explicit that this same constitution, though not a comedy,\ndoes nonetheless embody comedic knowledge:  \nSomeone who is going to gain practical wisdom can’t learn serious\nmatters without learning ridiculous ones, or anything else, for that\nmatter, without its opposite. But if we intend to acquire virtue, even\non a small scale, we can’t be serious and comic too, and this is\nprecisely why we must learn to recognize what is ridiculous, to avoid\nbeing trapped by our ignorance of it into doing or saying something\nridiculous, when we don’t have to. (816d5-e5) \nThe Laws is a tragedy, then, because it is “an\nimitation of the finest and best way of life.”  \nThe Symposium is a tragedy for an analogous reason: it\ncontains an imitation of one part of such a life, namely, what the\nProtagoras terms a “symposium of beautiful and good\nmen” who “test each other’s mettle in mutual\nargument” by asking and answering questions (347d3–348a9).\nThis is how Socrates responds to Agathon’s speech. It is how Diotima\nconverses with Socrates. It is the type of symposium Socrates tries to\nre-establish when Alcibiades’ “satyr-play” is finished,\nand the throng of Bacchic revelers has left.  \nUnlike the Laws, however, the Symposium is a comedy\ntoo, since it also contains an imitation of the second best kind of\nsymposium described in the Protagoras—one where there\nare poets present, and where the participants “argue over points\nthat can’t be established with any certainty” (347e1–7).\nAn accurate description, surely, of the speeches made by all the\nsymposiasts who speak prior to Socrates. \nFinally, Alcibiades arrives with—significantly enough—a\nflute-girl (212c5-e3; compare 176e6-7). And though she does not play,\nher arrival inaugurates the further decline of the symposium into\nsomething even more like the kind of symposium reviled in the\nProtagoras as “a symposium of common, vulgar\nfellows… who, unable to entertain one another with their own\nconversation, put up the price of flute-girls, and pay large sums to\nhear the sound of the flute instead of their own talk”\n(347c4-d2). This is the element of satyr-play in the\nSymposium—satyr imagery is frequent in Alcibiades’\n speech.[2] \nThe idea is the one mentioned earlier. Some love stories—the\ngood ones—are tragedies (in the special sense of the term\nintroduced in the Laws): they involve the kind of love found\nin the best kind of life, a life that comes as close as possible to\nthe divine—one in which we achieve happiness by having good\nthings be ours forever (205d1–206a12). Other love stories are\ncomedies: they involve a lesser kind of love. Others still are satyr\nplays: genital farces. But the true story of love, the story that is\nPlato’s Symposium itself, is the story of all these stories.\nIn the Symposium, it takes the form appropriate to its genre\nand audience. But in the Phaedrus, we learn of the longer\nmore technical road it might take in the future, when armed with a\nscientific psychology and rhetoric it becomes a matter for\nexperts.","contact.mail":"cdcreeve@email.unc.edu","contact.domain":"email.unc.edu"}]
