G. Collingwood (1889–1943) was primarily a philosopher of\nhistory, a metaphysican and archaeologist, and considered his work in\naesthetics—the principal work being his The Principles of\nArt (1938)—as secondary (for more about his general\nphilosophy, see the entry on\n  Robin George Collingwood). \nBut the work in aesthetics has enjoyed a persistent readership that\ncontinues into the present. In the years after WWII he was probably\nthe most widely read and influential aesthetician to have written in\nEnglish since Addison, Hutcheson and Hume (not counting Ruskin as an\naesthetician), and to this day continues to make his way into\nanthologies as a principal proponent of the expressive theory of\nart. In the field of the philosophy of history, Collingwood famously\nheld the doctrine of ‘Re-enactment’: since the subject is\nhuman beings in action, the historian cannot achieve understanding by\ndescribing what happened from an external point of view, but must\nelicit in the reader’s own mind the thoughts that were taking\nplace in the principal actors involved in historical\nevents. Similarly, the aesthetic procedure is one whereby the artist\nand spectator jointly come to realize, to come to know, certain mental\nstates (see Guyer 2018). Art is fundamentally expression. Collingwood\nsaw two main obstacles to general understanding and acceptance of\nthis: First, the word ‘art’ has surreptitiously acquired\nmultiple meanings among ordinary folk which should be disentangled;\nsecond, a philosophical theory of the phenomenon of expression is\nneeded to show that it is an essential part of the life of the mind,\nnot just a special activity that poets go in for. (Collingwood\nactually published an earlier theory of art in Outlines of a\nPhilosophy of Art, but came to regard that theory as mistaken,\nsuperseded by the one in Principles of Art; what follows, and\nall references, concern the latter only).\n\nThere are four concepts of human activity which are commonly called\n‘art’, but which according to Collingwood, should be\nsharply distinguished from what he calls ‘art proper’. The\nimplication is that those things are improperly so-called, that is,\nare commonly but wrongly called art. Since today the tendency in\naesthetics is to insist that all things called ‘art’ are\nrightly so-called, it is important emphasize this fact; the\nInstitutional Theory of Art, and the Theory of Mass Art, would no\ndoubt be viewed by Collingwood as pernicious linguistic\nconfusions. But in fact it is worse than this. Art proper is often\nfound within the context of those other things; even particular works\nof art (proper) may at the same time be instances of those\nthings. Furthermore, it is not as if ‘art’ once had the\ntrue meaning appertaining to art proper, and then got extended to\nthese other things; the word has always been more or less subject to\nat least some of these confusions. The task, then, is to distinguish\nthe concept from those of many other competing related human\nactivities, and to claim that it alone deserves to be called art. \nThe first of these things that is easily confused with art proper has\nthe recommendation of having been espoused by Plato and\nAristotle. This is the ‘technical’ theory of art, or the\ntheory that art is craft (from the Greek word\n‘technê’), by which we mean a fully worked out\ntheory of crafts such as watchmaking, joinery, carpentry and so on. In\nfact, the theory of craft, along with the thesis that art is not\ncraft, suffices to show that art proper is a distinct activity from\nthe other three things, by showing that they are essentially\ncrafts. \nThe term ‘craft’ refers to activities which typically\nexemplify the following six characteristics.  None is individually\nnecessary, but the less of them that an activity exemplifies, the less\nsense there is in calling it a craft: (1) The applicability of a\ndistinction amongst actions as means and actions as ends; a baker, for\nexample, whips the egg whites in course of mixing the batter, for the\neventual end of baking a cake. (2) A distinction between planning and\nexecution; a carpenter, for example, may draw up a plan for a table,\nand then in a separate action or set of actions construct a table. (3)\nIn planning, ends precede means in that the latter are chosen for the\nsake of the former, but in execution the means precede the end. (4) We\ncan distinguish between raw material and finished product. (5) A\ndistinction can be drawn been form and matter. (6) Crafts stand in\nthree sorts of hierarchy: (a) The raw material of one craft is the\nfinished product of another; for example the sawmill produces plywood,\nwhich is in turn the raw material for builders. (b) One craft has as\nits end product the tools which are employed as means in another. (c)\nSome trades work in concert to bring about the finished product; for\nexample, the manufacture of a computer may involve separable\nmanufacture of the chip, the hard disc, the monitor and so on, so that\nthe final assembly is ‘only the bringing together of these\nparts’. \nThe point is not that works of art never display any of these\nfeatures; the point is that some works of art involve none of them,\nwithout its detracting from their status as art. Therefore the essence\nof art cannot have to do with any features correctly treated by a\ntheory of craft. A pure case might be the poet for whom the poem\nsimply comes to mind, unbidden, without its being written down or even\nsaid aloud. There is no distinction to be drawn between planning and\nexecution in such a case, and none between actions as means and\nactions as ends. (If the poet had in mind something analogous to a\nblueprint for the poem, he would already have composed it.) \nThat takes care of (1)–(3), and (6) (a)–(c). What of (4)?\nIt might be tempting to think of the words as the raw material, the\npoem as the finished product. But T. S. Eliot for example did not\nchoose the words needed for The Wasteland and then proceed to\narrange them into the poem. The poet can, however, be conceived as\n‘converting emotions into poems’; but this is ‘a\nvery different kind of thing’ from, say, the pasta maker’s\nconversion of flour into spaghetti. Collingwood simply leaves this\npoint hanging, because it would require his own positive account of\nart as expression to explain it; that will come later. (He also\nneglects the possibility that the raw material of the poet is simply\nthe language as a whole.) \nFinally, the distinction between form and matter as it applies to art\nis not the sort required by (5). That distinction requires that the\nself-same matter be capable of having different forms placed upon it;\nif we cannot identify the matter in the first place, then the\ndistinction cannot get a grip. \nIt bears repeating that the claim is not that no works of art have any\ncraft-like features; it simply that any definition of art in terms of\nthose features would exclude some unimpeachable works of art (29). Or\nrather, success in being craft is strictly immaterial to its being\nart; no craft-features make an object into a work of\nart. Collingwood is well aware that for example an opera requires a\ngreat deal of planning, technique, raw materials, and so on. And\nbecause of this, he is well aware that the craft-theory is widely if\nimplicitly held, and devotes a lively excursus to its modern\nmanifestation, namely ‘Art as a Psychological\nStimulus’. This is the account of art whereby it is the craft\n(or ‘technique’) of manipulating certain objects (paint,\nsound, words and on) so as to bring about psychological states in the\naudience, which in turn are known, or least knowable, in advance. But\nthis is to assimilate works of art to mere means; Collingwood is quite\nserious in his denial of this. The artist is not ‘a purveyor of\ndrugs’ (34). \nAlthough as we will see in a moment Collingwood holds that there is\nmore to it than this, representation is, in the first instance, the\nrelation that a portrait bears to its sitter. It is plainly a matter\nof skill, of technique, since one can envisage a successful outcome\nbefore undertaking it. So art cannot be representation (or\n‘mimesis’, in any straightforward sense). But the theory\nthat it is is so venerable and influential that it demands separate\nattention. (Not, however, because of Plato and Aristotle; Collingwood\nholds that despite popular opinion, they did not hold it!).  \nCollingwood advances a very liberal notion of representation, such\nthat a great deal more artefacts than one would initially think could\nrightly qualify as representative. For the standard for fidelity is\nnot resemblance, but that the feeling evoked by the artefact resembles\nthat evoked by the original. Representation comes in three,\noverlapping degrees. The first is that of the ordinary photograph, or\npaintings and the like which attempt that sort of literalness. The\nsecond is that whereby the painter – he mentions van Gogh\n– ‘leaves out some things that he sees, modifies others,\nand introduces some which he not does see in his sitter at all’\n(53–4). At the extreme, he may paint mere patterns, for example,\nof a dance, leaving out the dancers. The third is ‘emotional\nrepresentation’, which represents the inner aspect of emotion,\nbut which is nevertheless distinct from expression. Some types of\nmusic, on this view, represent the mind undergoing its experiences,\nsuch the feeling of ‘lying in deep grass on a summer’s day\nwatching clouds drift across the sky’ (56). Collingwood does not\nsay what the exact difference is between representation and\nexpression, but I assume that it depends first of all on whether or\nnot the artist has a clear conception of what he is trying to\nrepresent; if he does, then his activity is craft, not art proper. As\nwe will see below, this is not implausible because the artist, at\nleast according to Collingwood, does not literally know the expressive\ncontent of his artwork in advance of expressing it. It would be in\nkeeping with Collingwood’s approach to add that the expressed\ncontent is individual, whereas represented contents are\nalways general; perceptually quite different works can\nrepresent exactly the same thing. \nCollingwood takes pains to analyze the notion of magic because\nproperly understood, magic is much more closely intertwined with art\nproper than one would have thought; nevertheless, it too falls prey to\nthe master argument: it is a kind of craft, and art is not craft. \nMagic is not, contra the prevailing anthropology of the time, mere bad\nscience—‘superstitious’ false beliefs like that of\nnot walking under ladders because of the evil that will surely\nfollow. Nor is it explicable as Freudian neurosis, which assumes that\nevery society employing magical practices is to that extent\nsick. Magic is the ritualized representation of useful emotion, not\nfor the sake of catharsis, but for the practical value of the\nemotion. The war-dance, for example, instills courage by dint of drums\nand spears, and frightens the enemy should he catch a glimpse. Of\ncourse false beliefs may play a role, which the theory of\nmagic-as-bad-science seizes upon; the rain dancer may think he\nincreases the probability of rain. But that is a\n‘perversion’ of magic; the true magical effect is the\nreinforcement of hope and hard work that a drought puts to the\ntest. The Freudian theory regards the representation as omnipotent\nwish-fulfilment and therefore fails to account for this latter effect,\nwhich indeed Collingwood supposes to be vital to any healthy\nsociety. Happily, our society, or our societies, are replete with\nmagical phenomena. Religion, patriotism, sport, social customs such as\ndinner parties, weddings, funerals, dances, and so on all involve in\none way or another ritualized actions that are undertaken at least\npartly for magical reasons. (Of course magical phenomena are probably\non the wane.) \nArt proper is often bound up with magical ‘art’, and indeed it is common amongst critics to confuse them. Religious art—say a twelfth-century crucifix—may be aesthetically fine as well as induce a pious awe in the mind of the believer. But the fact that a suitably kitschy product may also serve the latter purpose shows that the magical effect can be aimed at independently from the aesthetic (admittedly, Collingwood underestimates the problem of disentangling these purportedly different responses—for some people, only an aesthetically fine thing can generate strong pious emotions; perhaps Collingwood can allow that some art proper may be instrumentally necessary for the achievement of magical ends). Frequently, the particular form of this mistake is to think that an attitude towards the subject-matter embodied in a work is rightly taken as the object of purely aesthetic criticism. Thus it is common to hear for example of a play praised for taking a salutary view of sexual politics and would therefore encourage the sexes to get on better; to say so is to say that the play is very good at what Collingwood is calling ‘magic’, but is neither here nor there as regards its status as art. \nThe aim of amusement art is to stimulate an emotion by ‘make\nbelieve’ means, and to discharge it. If the emotion is intended\nto remain undischarged—if the aim is that the audience should\nleave the theatre indignant at global warming for example—then\nthe work is one of magic; if the emotions it evokes are intended to be\n‘earthed’, the work is one of amusement. Most of\nliterature and drama are actually amusement—not only for example\nThackeray but most of Shakespeare are included. But remember that\namusement and art proper can co-exist, i.e., in the same work (in\nShakespeare’s case, the same work is often actually a bundle of\nworks, some magical, some amusement, and some, at least in favourable\ncases, of art proper). Collingwood stresses—in 1938—the\nrise of decadent amusement works, especially pornography but also for\nexample the case of literature or film appealing to our love of\nimaginatively dwelling amongst the upper classes. And he warns of a\ndanger they present to our society (or rather of the danger of the\nconditions that give rise to an ever growing demand for them); that is\nwhat Plato meant to proscribe in his famous banishment of the\n‘artist’ from his republic, and Collingwood sees Plato as\nhaving foretold the eventual doom of Greco-Roman civilisation. Now all\nthis is by the way; amusement is craft, not art. But the points he\nraises in this connection are important to his main subject, because a\ncertain tradition wrongly identifies the success-conditions of arts of\namusement as the standard of taste for art proper. Hume, for example,\nwrote as if the criterion for success in a work of art is the\nexcitation of pleasure in suitably refined individuals. But pleasure\nhas a name; the ‘artist’ who busies himself with arousing\nthat particular emotion is merely a craftsman. \nIf art proper is not the stimulation of preconceived emotion, and not\nthe representation of it either, then what precisely does it mean to\nsay that, nevertheless, art is the expression of emotion? The key is\nto remember that art is not craft—Collingwood assumes that the\nreader will accept this, once it is pointed out—and hence the\ndistinction between means and ends does not, strictly speaking,\napply. Nor does the distinction between planning and\nexecution. Instead, Collingwood writes in a passage that is often\nquoted, when a person expresses an emotion, he is \nThe following three points emerge from this. 1. To express is\nto become conscious of an emotion: that is why the\ndistinction between plan and execution cannot be\napplied. 2. Expression individualises; rather than describing\nthe emotion in words whose signification is in principle general, the\nexpression is a intrinsic feature of the utterance, of the\n‘utterance itself’ (although he does not credit him, this\nis an evident example where Collingwood follows Croce). Thus we cannot\nspeak of the emotion embodied in a work of art as if it were the\ncontent which the art provides the form. 3. The\n‘lightening’ of which Collingwood speaks is not that of\ncatharsis, which provides an outlet for the emotion and may take place\nwithout its agents being conscious of it at all. It is the achievement\nof clarity, of focus of mind, which may indeed intensify what is felt\nrather than attenuate it (though typically it does not). \nThis last point suggests that there is such a thing as an\n‘aesthetic emotion’, but it ‘is not a specific kind\nof emotion pre-existing to the expression of it’ (117). Instead,\nit is an ‘emotional colouring which attends the expression of\nany emotion whatever’ (ibid.) Expression, in this\nsense, must be sharply distinguished from the betrayal of emotion;\none’s tears may be said to ‘express’ one’s\nsadness, or stamping one’s feet ones anger, but these can occur\nwithout the making lucid and intelligible of the emotion that is\nrequisite for expression in Collingwood’s sense. Betrayal can\neven occur that is wholly unconscious; one can blush without noticing\nit. The relation between expressive object and emotion is that of\nembodiment or realization, not of inference. \nTo conceive art as the craft of emotional stimulation or\narousal—whether for the sake of amusement or magic—is to\nregard the material work of art as the intended means towards a\npreconceived end. The falsity of that conception—assuming that\nart is essentially the expression of emotion—shows that the work\nof art as not an artifact at all (so artworks are not\nartifacts; Collingwood was aware that language sometimes suggests\ntheoretical mistakes). Instead, the artistic process is a specialized\ntype of making that Collingwood calls creation: to create\nsomething is to make it non-technically, but ‘consciously and\nvoluntarily’ (128), and hence intentionally. The creator\n‘need not be acting in order to achieve any ulterior end; he not\nbe following a preconceived plan; and he is certainly not transforming\nanything that can be properly be called a raw material’\n(129). \nNow take for example a lecture given on a scientific topic. There are,\nin Collingwood’s view, actually at least two things: The lecture\nas a created thing, and the lecture as a particular sound-event. The\nformer may be complete in advance of, or indeed without ever, being\nuttered or written down: the actual speech-event, as a sequence of\nnoise, enables a suitably equipped listener to reconstruct the created\nthing is his own mind, therefore to grasp its scientific content, but\nis inessential to it. And so it is with works of art. A tune, for\nexample, needn’t be sung, played or written down in order to\nexist. Thus Collingwood: \nCollingwood is not supposing that every work of art could in point of\nfact exist only people’s minds; of music, for example, he writes\n‘[P]erhaps no one can do that [possess himself of the music]\nunless he does hear the noises’ (140; of course there are\nsome prima facie counterexamples to this; later Beethoven,\nfor example). The human imagination is typically too weak; in most\ncases we have to depend on the ‘bodily’ work of art for\nsensory helps. But in principle, the ‘total imaginative\nexperience’ that constitutes the proper work of art must be\nconceived as only contingently related to the bodily work. \nWhat precisely is the motivation for this move, the conception of the\nwork of art as imagined or ideal object? Leave aside the special cases\nof music and poetry, which Richard Wollheim notes have the special\nfeature that they can be written down (see Wollheim 1972). Why not\nconceive painting, for example, as the creation of certain painted\nobjects? This would be consistent with the thesis that painting is a\nnot craft. The answer given by Collingwood is clear, but leads to\ntrouble when we consider the question of interpretation. An experience\nof a painting involves a great deal that no one would say is ‘in\nthe painting’, which is, after all, a nearly flat canvas with\npaint on it. Not only do we see things that are not really present,\nbut for example we have impressions of space and mass, perhaps by\nmeans of what Berenson called ‘ideated\nsensations’—those which involve imaginary motor or\nkinaesthetic sensations. These phenomena are not literally features of\nthe canvas, but they are in some sense features of the work. So\nCollingwood, in brief, includes within the work of art proper all that\nwould normally be ascribed to the (correct) interpretation—the\n(correct) experience—of the artwork. But there is no reason to\naccept this, any more we should include all the relational\nfacts—sowing, fertilization, watering and so on—that\ncontribute to a growing plant to the plant itself. On contrary, the\nposition makes it impossible for two spectators to disagree on the\ninterpretation of a work. Irrespective of the concern with the privacy\nof the experience, if they attribute different properties to the\nobject—that is, they find different properties in their\nrespective total imaginative experiences—they are simply\nconcerned with different objects, and their verdicts are\ncompatible. We could set the artist’s own experience as a\ncriterion of understanding the work, but that would make his death\nsignificant in way that we do not actually recognize, and would run\nagainst the grain of Collingwood’s antipathy to aesthetic\nindividualism and the ‘cult of genius’, discussed\nbelow. As a matter of speculation, Collingwood perhaps thought that\naesthetically relevant properties—expressive\nproperties—have to be intrinsic properties of the work of art;\nin that case, perhaps his conclusion does follow. But it is much more\nsatisfactory to hold that what we are arguing over when we disagree\nover the expressive properties of a work of art is the same\nobject. \nNot a great deal hangs on that thesis, at any rate. A great deal more\nhangs on the thesis that art essentially exercises the expressive\nimagination. The difference between the imagined lecture and the tune\nis that the content of the lecture is verbal and cognitive, and brings\nthose departments of mind into play; whilst the tune, among other\nthings, brings the emotional department of the mind much more vividly\ninto play. The substance of Collingwood’s view is largely\ndependent on his account of this distinction. \nAt the most basic level Collingwood distinguishes thinking from\nfeeling. The objects of each, respectively, are thoughts and\n‘sensa’: ‘sensa’ is Collingwood’s name\nfor all the data of the senses—of touch, smell, sight, and so\non. Thoughts can be true or false, justified or not, where sensa have\nno such duality: they are felt or not felt, but cannot contradict each\nother. There is sense in which sensa can be said to be real or unreal,\ntrue or false (for example in hallucination), but this not an\nintrinsic feature of sensa themselves; that distinction applies only\nto thoughts involving them. A first point that is directly relevant to\nthe theory of expression is that probably all sensa have an emotional\n‘charge’. Thus for example every colour carries with it a\ncertain emotional quality. Not that they are invariably experienced\nwith their particular emotional charge; the charge is more like a\ndisposition to be experienced a certain way, under certain\ncircumstances. Children or artists are more likely to experience them;\neducated adult Europeans, Collingwood says, tend to have rather\n‘sterilized’ experience. \nSensa are occurrent phenomena, and therefore fleeting (222): If I hear\nthe bell striking the hour of four, the experience comprises many\npassing sensa, each no sooner generated than gone. But if I am to be\naware of them as a process extended in time with particular\nmorphology, I must retain the sound of the bell, along with the\nsilences in between. The objects that I so retain cannot be the sensa\nthemselves. Instead, the faculty of ‘conscious attention’\ngenerates ‘ideas’ corresponding to the sensa, and which\nare retained. Sensa alone—or sense data, or\nimpressions—are never sufficient for consciousness. Collingwood\ncites Kant approvingly in the connection; noting that we have always\nto ‘fill in’ occurrent perception to generate a complete\nworld of 3-D objects, he writes: \nWhen one is conscious of a feeling of anger, one is aware of it as\none’s own. By becoming conscious of it—therefore not of\nthe sensation of anger but the anger transformed by\nconsciousness—what we feel ‘is correspondingly\nchanged’ (207); the ‘effect of this experience … is\nmake them less violent’ (209). And another word for this is\nimagination. ‘We become able to perpetuate feeling … at\nwill’ (209). ‘Imagination is thus the new form which\nfeeling takes when transformed by the activity of consciousness’\n(215). With this level of consciousness comes the beginning of\nself-consciousness; ‘it is assertion of ourselves as the owners\nof our feeling’ (222; feeling that is ‘as modified by\nconsciousness’). But imagination, since it deals not with sensa\nbut with their ideated analogues, is a type of thought, and with the\nintroduction of thought comes the possibility of error. Thus if the\nbasic action of the consciousness is to think ‘This is how I\nfeel’, its denial is ‘This is not how I feel’\n(216). The possibility of such disowned feeling is the possibility of\nfalse, or corrupt consciousness (217). \nThought is established by the intellect, but there are two, separable\nroles of thought called ‘primary’ and\n‘secondary’. Its primary role is to ‘apprehend or\nconstruct relations’ (216) amongst ideas, as just described (in\nfact Collingwood thinks in such relations the relata are fused in a\nnew idea comprising a ‘peculiar colouring or modification of the\nold’ (223)). The secondary role is to apprehend or construct\n‘relations between acts of primary intellection’; by this\nCollingwood means conceptions of the past, future, the possible etc.,\nand presumably all that content of human thought which can not be\naccounted for in terms of the imagination.  \nThat Collingwood has a theory of language might seem tangential to his\ntheory of art, but in fact it is integral to it. For\nCollingwood’s approach to it comes not from the theory of\nreference and truth as in Frege or Russell, but from the point of view\nwhich regards language as fundamentally or in the first instance\nexpressive behaviour. Concepts of referential semantics—as a\n‘symbolism’ in Collingwood’s\nterminology—become applicable only later, with a certain degree\nof sophistication is attained. ‘In its original or native state,\nlanguage in imaginative or expressive … It is imaginative\nactivity whose function is to express emotion.’ (225). Of course\n‘imaginative’ must be understood in the broader sense just\ndescribed, denoting all consciousness of ideated analogues of\nsensation or feeling. From this angle, we can speak of the\n‘totality of our motor activities’ as a ‘parent\norganism’ (247), from which every type of ‘language\n(speech, gesture, and so forth)’ is an ‘offshoot’\n(246). \nAt the most fundamental level, at the ‘psychic’ level as\nCollingwood calls it, various sorts of bodily activity are said to\npsychically express an underlying emotional charge on a sensum;\ncringing or flinching express fear, for example. At this stage\nconsciousness of the imagination is not involved—only sensa;\nthis level is shared with animals, and is ‘completely\nuncontrollable’ (234). With the consciousness of ideas comes\n‘emotions of consciousness’, which require language for\ntheir expression. A cry from a child, for example, may be either\npsychic or imaginative, depending whether it is involuntary or\nvoluntary. If it is voluntary, it is the work of the conscious\nimagination, and thus in the most rudimentary sense linguistic. \nIt is essential to Collingwood’s view that there are not,\nparadoxical as it sounds, any unexpressed emotions. A psychical\nemotion, on one hand, simply has its being in its expression; an\nemotion of fear must show up somewhere, whether by cringing, shying or\nflinching, an increase in pulse or blood pressure, a tightness of the\nchest, or something else bodily or physiological. On the other hand,\nif someone tries but fails to express an emotion, the emotion at most\nremains ‘shut up’ in the psychic level; in order to be\nconscious of the emotion, ‘the same consciousness which\ngenerates these emotions converts them from impressions into ideas\ngenerates also and simultaneously their appropriate linguistic\nexpression.’(238). There is no other way to be conscious of an\nemotion; to express an emotion is to be conscious of it. \nCollingwood’s remarks about the relation between speaker and\nhearer are of special interest not just to aestheticians but to\nphilosophers of mind interested in knowledge of other minds. A\nvoluntary cry is underpinned by a self-conscious imaginative act; and\nhowever rudimentary it is, self-consciousness is at once the\nconsciousness of others. ‘[A]s persons’, writes\nCollingwood, ‘they construct a new set of relations between\nthemselves, arising out their consciousness of themselves and one\nanother; these are linguistic relations.’ (248). \nThe relation of the listener and speaker to an expressive act is\ntotally symmetric: \nRemember, again, that we are talking of the expressive\ndimension of language, not the referential dimension (about which more\nin a moment). To understand another person’s emotions is\nprecisely to adopt the person’s expressive language as\none’s own, imaginatively experiencing the ideas as if they were\none’s own (that is, as if they expressed one’s own\nemotion; of course the ideas, as analogues of sensation, are\nnecessarily one’s own). This aspect of Collingwood, of the\nnecessary publicity of language and meaning, can be stressed as a\npotential way out of the threat of the seeming privacy of the work of\nart as mentioned above, in connection with p. 134 of\nthe Principles. There is however one evident mistake in Collingwood’s\npresentation. Sensa are, as we’ve seen, fleeting. But no idea\n‘can be formed as such in consciousness except by a mind whose\nsense-emotional experience contains the corresponding impression\n… at that very moment.’ (251). This cannot be right. To\nunderstand Othello, we don’t have to actually have an impression\nof jealousy; we only need to have the idea. In fact, by what we said\nin section IV, there are no impressions (sensa) of jealousy at all;\njealousy is an emotion of consciousness. The solution, which as far as\nI can see is consistent with everything else Collingwood says, is\nsimply to erase the requirement that the listener must undergo\nanything at the psychical level, the level of sensa, coevally\nwith expression (we leave open the question of whether it must have\nhappened to one in the past). \nEarlier, we said that thought involving relations is the domain of\nthought in its ‘secondary’ role, the realm of\nintellect. Thoughts delivered by the imagination are\n‘seamless’: \n‘Analytical thought’—intellect, thought in its\nsecondary role—may begin with the same experience, but instead\nof being ‘an indivisible unity it becomes a manifold, a network\nof things with relations between them’ (253). Collingwood also\ncharacterises the intellect as the domain of concepts, and of\ngeneralisation (273, 281). \nNow one might be tempted to suppose that thoughts as grasped by the\nintellect are roughly the same as propositions, in the sense intended\nby analytical philosophers. But Collingwood holds that the proposition\nis ‘a fictitious entity’ (266), and devotes a long passage\nto excoriating that tendency in philosophy. Every actual episode of\nthought is performed with its own particular degree and character of\nemotion; there is no such thing as the thought shorn of its emotional\nhusk. All mental activity has some emotional character, including\nintellectual activity. The cry of ‘Eureka’ said to have\naccompanied Archimedes’ discovery of a principle of hydrostatics\nis but an extreme example. Thus language is expressive of\nemotion even in its scientific use. This applies even to mathematical\nsymbols and technical symbols. Insofar as they are used, they\nautomatically acquire the expressive character of the underlying\nthoughts. Thus Collingwood says: ‘Symbolism is thus intellectual\nlanguage; language, because it expresses emotions; intellectualized,\nbecause adapted to the expression of intellectual emotions’\n(269). In ‘poeticizing’ such language, Collingwood does\nnot intend to demean it; presumably the aim is to do justice to the\nrarefied air of pure intellect: \nNevertheless, Collingwood’s account of language, needless to\nsay, is radical; he is quite serious in his denial of the possibility\nof what earlier I called a theory of the purely referential dimension\nof language, which generalizes about truth-conditions of sentences in\nabstraction from their use: \nWith his theory of language in place, Collingwood takes the theory of\nart to be complete. At the end of section III we said that Collingwood\ndefines Art as imaginative expression, assuming that readers will\nagree once they have the mistakes of the technical or craft theory\npointed out for them. He then poses a particular theory of mind in\nwhich imagination and expression are built into the structural fabric\nof the mind, so that every intentional mental act is in some sense an\nact of an expressive imagination. That includes linguistic acts. In\nfact, properly understood, language encompasses all expressive acts\nwhatsoever, and every linguistic act is one way or another an\nexpressive act. Language and art become interchangeable\n(274). ‘Every utterance’, Collingwood says, ‘and\nevery gesture that each one of us makes is a work of art’\n(285). Collingwood next turns to ‘practical’ questions, of\nwhich we will consider two: the relation of art to artists, and\nrelation between the artist and the community. In answering them, we\nwill consider some questions naturally arising from the preceding. \nIf all activity is in that sense ‘artistic’, then it is\nnatural to wonder whether the theory has anything to tell us\nabout art, that is, the peculiar business of the painter, the\npoet, the musician and the like. Of course, most activity is\nundertaken with a some purpose in mind or other, in which case it is\ncraft, however hum-drum the theory of it might be. For example, I just\nate an orange which I took from a bowl; the theory of what I did could\nbe written down in a practical guide to eating oranges. But surely I\nwas conscious of eating the orange; by Collingwood’s\ntheory, then, was I not expressing something? In that case, by the\nsame theory, just by being conscious, was I not engaged in art? And is\nthat not absurd? \nCollingwood says nothing in direct reply to this worry, but I think it\nobvious that the reply would be this. In so far as I was conscious of\nthe orange, it is true that I was involved in expression. But this\nconscious experience was un-sustained, fleeting, and lacking in depth\n(307). Furthermore, it took place in a mind that was busy with other\nthings, and which was dominated by an overarching purpose, namely to\neat the orange, whose sub-tasks include selecting it, peeling it,\nputting a section in my mouth, trying not spill too much juice, and so\non; all this would be written down in my practical guide to eating\noranges. Life, then, is full of ‘artworks’, but they are\nmostly shallow, unworthy of comment. However, there are times when\nconsciousness settles on something, such that the mental activity does\napproach the character of art, in the proper sense of the\nword. Sitting in a park, for example, we might dwell on the look of an\noak tree, or suddenly think of an original stanza of poetry, or a\nsnatch of melody. These are instances of imaginative expression, and\nare closer to what we should ordinarily call a work of art. But they\nare likely to be lost, unless some record of the experience is\nmade. The ‘artist’, then, is one who has these experiences\nof consciousness more deeply than the average person, and who has\nmastered the practice of preserving them. \nBut the act of ‘preserving them’ has to be understood in a\nspecial sense. ‘There is no question’, says Collingwood,\n“of ‘externalizing’ an inward experience which is\ncomplete in itself and by itself” (304). Collingwood is denying\nthat a painter could in point of fact dispense with the medium, even\nif in principle he could (in sense of ‘could in principle’\nin which a man might run a hundred miles per hour). Instead, although\n‘you see something in your subject, of course, before you begin\nto paint it’ (303), the ‘experience develops itself and\ndefines itself in your mind as you paint’ (ibid.). The\nwork of art develops by means of positive feedback between painting\nand experience. What develops is the ‘total imaginative\nexperience’ that Collingwood identifies as the work of art,\nstrictly speaking (304). Again, the work of art proper is not to be\nidentified with the ‘bodily work’—the painted\ncanvas, the sculpted bust—but with the experience of it. What is\ntrue that in point of fact the imaginative experiences requires the\nbodily work; the human imagination is not able to hold within it\nanything approaching the richness made available by the plastic\narts. In particular, the ‘outward element’—the\nbodily work—provides the sensuous content or impressions out of\nwhich the conscious imagination generates ideas, constituting the\n‘total imaginative experience’ (see Davies 2008 for more\non this issue). \n‘Theoretically’, Collingwood says, ‘the artist is a\nperson who comes to know himself, to know his own emotion’\n(291). Despite this, however, Collingwood is anxious to show this does\nnot entail aesthetic solipsism, as if the artist need not ever concern\nhimself with others. Quite the opposite: necessarily the artistic\nachievement is collaborative, involving the audience and other\nartists. \nCollingwood begins his account of the relation between artist and\nspectator by saying that a spectator understands a given work just\ninsofar as his imaginative experience is identical with that had by\nthe artist in creating it. This can never be known with certainty, but\nso it is with all understanding of language (remember that\n‘language’ in Collingwood’s usage means all\nexpressive behaviour). It is also piecemeal: ‘Understanding\n… is a complex business, consisting of many phases, each\ncomplete in itself but each leading on to the next’\n(311). Collingwood does speak of identity of understanding,\nbut really his real account is more fluid. First, he accepts that any\nutterance is endlessly interpretable; there no such thing as\n‘the’ meaning of a work (ibid.). Second, the\naudience’s role is collaborative, in the sense that the artist\nis concerned to express emotions that are mutually held; failure in\nthis may rightly cause the artist to doubt whether he expressed\nanything, and suffers instead from a ‘corruption of\nconsciousness’ as explained earlier. The audience, then,\nactively participates in re-creating the imaginative experience. This\nsecond point flows from his conception of art as a language: \nCollingwood further dilutes the air of aesthetic solipsism by\nobserving that the artist never works alone; on the one hand the\nartist freely borrows from what has already been achieved, and on the\nother, at least in the performing arts, the players have their own\nessential role. A work of art is collaborative, not simply the\ncreation of an individual; the ‘cult of individual genius’\nis totally misplaced and indeed pernicious. \nCollingwood’s theory is generally lumped together with that of\nBenedetto Croce as an expressive and idealist theory. There are of\ncourse differences, but the established picture is not inaccurate. And\ntogether with Croce’s theory, Collingwood’s has a fatal\ndefect (without questioning the starting-point, that the essence of\nart to be expressive): In identifying the artwork with what we would\nnormally think of as the experience of the artwork, he makes nonsense\nof the idea that the spectator interprets the artwork, and\ncan do so more or less accurately; that different people can argue\nabout the self-same work of art. It has become a truism that the\nartist is no better placed than the audience to interpret a work\nrightly, a truism that Collingwood, with his fulminations again\naesthetic individualism, would agree. But then the various imaginative\nexperiences have nothing to conform to, if artwork and experience and\nhence artwork and interpretation cannot be separated. That would be\nfatal to the theory; however, it is not clear that anything\nsubstantial would be lost, if Collingwood were simply to identify the\nwork of art with the ‘bodily work’, thereby\nre-establishing room for interpretation to operate. This would seem to\nsit better with his idea that art is on a level with language, where\nlanguage is a public phenomenon. \nAn apparent further defect in Collingwood’s case in particular\nis his account of language. It is full of admirable insights, but it\nis probably misconceived from back to front. The insistence that\nlanguage is always expressive is dogmatic, and leads Collingwood to\ndeny that there in is any categorical distinction been poetry and\nscientific writing, which many may take as a reduction ad\nabsurdum (298). And more seriously so far as his philosophy of\nart is concerned, one might wonder about his account of consciousness\nas tied to language. According to it—the theory of\nimagination—merely to attend to something is thereby\nto express it, and furthermore is to do\nsomething linguistic. Even if we allow Collingwood his\ngeneralised notion of language as appertaining to gesture and so on,\nsurely there has to be a separation between consciousness or attention\nand expression. As C. J. Ducasse pointed out, it seems that when we\nlook at a vase full of flowers, do we not create a “work of\nart” unless we draw or paint it (Ducasse 1929, 52–54). \nFinally, it is hard to swallow whole Collingwood’s distinction\nbetween art and craft. The consequences are too severe. For example,\nCollingwood, rigorously applying the distinction, says that insofar as\nhis activity is art in the proper sense, an artist, since he has no\nidea what he is to express until he expresses it, cannot set out to\nwrite, say, a tragedy \n(116).[2] \nThere is something right in the idea that\nthat the artist cannot ‘plan and execute’ an\ninspiration. But the distinction Collingwood is after is surely not so\ncut and dried as that. He needs at any rate a more selective weapon to\nattack his bugbear of amusement art.","contact.mail":"gary.kemp@glasgow.ac.uk","contact.domain":"glasgow.ac.uk"}]
