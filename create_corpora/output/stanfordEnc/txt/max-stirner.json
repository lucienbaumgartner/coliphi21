This book is usually known as The Ego\nand Its Own in English, but a more literal translation would be\nThe Unique Individual and their Property). Both the form and\ncontent of Stirner’s major work are disconcerting. He challenges\nexpectations about how political and philosophical argument should be\nconducted, and shakes the reader’s confidence in the moral and\npolitical superiority of contemporary civilisation. Stirner provides a\nsweeping attack on the modern world as increasingly dominated by\n“religious” modes of thought and oppressive social\ninstitutions, together with a much briefer sketch of a radical\n“egoistic” alternative in which individual autonomy might\nflourish. The historical impact of The Ego and Its Own is\nsometimes difficult to assess, but Stirner’s work can\nconfidently be said: to have had an immediate and destructive impact\non the left-Hegelian movement; to have played an important\ncontemporary role in the intellectual development of Karl Marx\n(1818–1883); and subsequently to have influenced significantly\nthe political tradition of individualist anarchism.\n\nStirner was born Johann Caspar Schmidt on 25 October 1806, the only\nchild of lower middle class Lutheran parents living in Bayreuth.\n“Stirner” was originally a nickname, resulting from a\nlarge forehead, exaggerated by the way he pushed back his hair, and\nonly later — in the form of “Max Stirner” —\nadopted as a literary pseudonym and his preferred name. His father\ndied when Stirner was only six months old, and he was brought up by\nhis mother (who subsequently remarried) and then later, when his\nmother moved from Bayreuth, by an aunt who looked after him in order\nthat he could continue his schooling at the renowned local Gymnasium.\nStirner subsequently pursued his undergraduate studies, with little\nnotable academic distinction, at the universities of Berlin, Erlangen,\nand Königsberg. At Berlin, he is known to have attended three\nlecture-series given by G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831): on the philosophy of\nreligion; on the history of philosophy; and on the philosophy of\n“subjective spirit” (which concerns the structures and\nprocesses of individual psychology). \nTowards the end of his university career, Stirner devoted much of his\ntime to “family affairs”, possibly a euphemism for his\nmother’s deteriorating mental health. In 1832, he returned with\nhis mother to Berlin, and sought, with qualified success, to train as\na teacher. (Stirner’s mother was committed to a mental home in\n1837 and she would eventually outlive him by three years.) A period of\nprivate study and irregular work followed, including eighteenth months\nworking unpaid as an Latin teacher. During this time he married Agnes\nButz (1815–1838), a member of his landlady’s family. In\nAugust 1838, Agnes died giving birth to a still-born child. Edgar\nBauer (1820–1886) would later record that Stirner had told him\nthat, having once caught sight of his first wife naked, he was unable\nto touch her again. \nBetween 1839 and 1844 Stirner maintained something of a double life in\nBerlin. He obtained a position at a well-regarded private girls’\nschool, and spent the next five years teaching history and literature,\nestablishing a reputation as a polite and reliable teacher in the\nprocess. Away from his teaching post, however, Stirner began to\nfrequent the more avant-garde of Berlin’s intellectual haunts.\nHe used the reading room of the novelist Willibald Alexis\n(1798–1871), spent afternoons at the Café Stehely, and\nfrom 1841 onwards was a regular visitor to Hippel’s wine bar on\nthe Friedrichstrasse. The last of these was the main meeting place of\n“the free”, an increasingly bohemian group of teachers,\nstudents, officers, and journalists, under the loose intellectual\nleadership of the left-Hegelian Bruno Bauer (1809-1882). The latter\nhad recently been dismissed from his teaching post at the University\nof Bonn, following an official inquiry into the orthodoxy of his\nwritings on the New Testament. This group included Marie\nDähnhardt (1818–1902) who became Stirner’s second\nwife (and the dedicatee of The Ego and Its Own). In this\nunconventional environment, and despite his calm and unassuming\npersonal appearance, Stirner gained a reputation for his hostility to\nreligion, intolerance of moderation, and ability to provoke fierce\nargument. \nStirner’s earliest published writings date from this time in\nBerlin. In addition to some short and unremarkable pieces of\njournalism for the Rheinische Zeitung and the Leipziger\nAllgemeine Zeitung, these writings include a knowing review of\nBruno Bauer’s anonymous and parodic attack on Hegel in The\nTrumpet of the Last Judgement (1842) and an article on pedagogy\nentitled “The False Principle of Our Education” (1842).\nThe latter, in particular, adumbrates some of the themes of his own\nlater work; for example, contrasting the training of individuals to an\nalien calling with the cultivation of the predisposition to become\n“sovereign characters”). During this period, Stirner is\nsaid to have occasionally alluded to a book that he was working on,\nbut it seems that few of his associates took its existence seriously.\nThe impact of The Ego and Its Own on these left-Hegelian\ncircles was considerable as well as unexpected. Stirner began serious\nwork on the book in early 1843 and finished it in the middle of 1844.\nThe Ego and Its Own was published by the Leipzig bookseller\nOtto Wigand (1795–1870) in an edition of a thousand copies.\nAlthough dated 1845 the book appears to have been widely available by\nNovember of the previous year. \nMeasured by the reaction that it produced, The Ego and Its\nOwn might be described as a critical success. The book was widely\nreviewed, and attracted attention from such figures as Bettina von\nArnim (1785–1859), the doyenne of the Berlin literati, and Kuno\nFischer (1824–1907), later a distinguished neo-Kantian historian\nof philosophy. The book also generated responses from many of its\nleft-Hegelian targets: Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804–1872), Moses Hess (1812–1875), Arnold Ruge\n(1802–1880), and others, ventured into print in order to defend\ntheir own views against Stirner’s polemic. (Stirner’s\nvarious replies to some of these critics are discussed in Section 3\nbelow.)  \nHowever, The Ego and Its Own was neither a popular nor a\nfinancial success. Stirner had left his teaching post shortly before\nthe book was published, and, by 1846, was reduced to advertising in\nthe Vossische Zeitung for a loan. Stirner had squandered much\nof his second wife’s inheritance, and Marie Dähnhardt left\nhim towards the end of the same year. Many years later she was traced\nto England by Stirner’s loyal biographer, the poet and novelist\nJohn Henry Mackay (1864–1933). She refused to meet Mackay in\nperson but wrote to him portraying Stirner as a very sly man whom she\nhad neither respected nor loved, and describing their relationship\ntogether as more of a cohabitation than a marriage. \nFrom 1847, Stirner’s life was characterised by social isolation\nand financial precariousness. He remained detached from contemporary\nevents — for example, he seems to have largely ignored the\nrevolution of 1848 — and his daily life was dominated by\ndomestic routine and economic hardship. Stirner continued to write\nintermittently, but commentators have generally found his later work\nto be of little independent interest; that is, of little interest\napart from its disputed potential to illuminate The Ego and Its\nOwn). He translated into German some of the economic writings of\nJean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832) and Adam Smith (1723–1790),\nand may have written a series of short journalistic pieces for the\nJournal des oesterreichischen Lloyd. In 1852, he contributed\nsome material to a History of Reaction, consisting mainly of\nexcerpts from other authors, including Edmund Burke (1729–1797).\nStirner’s strategy for economic survival in this period involved\nrepeatedly changing addresses in order to evade his creditors,\nalthough not quickly enough to avoid two brief periods in a\ndebtors’ prison in 1853 and 1854. \nIn May 1856, still living in reduced circumstances in Berlin, Stirner\nfell into a “nervous fever”, reputedly after being stung\nin the neck by an insect. Following a brief remission, he died on 25\nJune (aged 49 years and 8 months). His death went largely unnoticed by\nthe outside world. \nThere looks to be a fairly stark contrast between the often\nmelodramatic and provocative tone of Stirner’s best-known work,\non the one hand, and the rather more mundane, sometimes poignant,\nevents of his somewhat solitary life, on the other. However,\ncommentators have frequently tried to link his life and philosophical\nviews together. John Henry Mackay, for instance, emphasizing the\n“ataraxic”dimension of The Ego and Its Own,\nportrayed Stirner’s life as an authentic embodiment of the\nemotional detachment that the egoist must cultivate in order to avoid\nbeing enslaved by his own passions and commitments. Even the pathos of\nStirner’s death was said to reflect the egoist’s refusal\nto love life, or fear death, excessively.(Mackay 1914: 212.) Such\nclaims are not without interest, but the lack of direct evidence\nregarding Stirner’s own interior life makes them difficult to\nevaluate and endorse.  \nModern readers hoping to understand The Ego and Its Own are\nconfronted by several obstacles, not least the form, structure, and\nargument, of Stirner’s book. \nMuch of Stirner’s prose—crowded with aphorisms, emphases,\nand hyperbole—appears calculated to disconcert. Most striking,\nperhaps, is the use of word play. Rather than reach a conclusion\nthrough the conventional use of argument, Stirner often approaches a\nclaim that he wishes to endorse by exploiting words with related\netymologies or formal similarities. For example, he associates words\nfor property (such as “Eigentum”) with words\nconnoting distinctive individual characteristics (such as\n“Eigenheit”) in order to promote the claim that\nproperty is expressive of selfhood. (Stirner’s account of\negoistic property—see 2.4 below—gives this otherwise\northodox-looking Hegelian claim a distinctive twist.) \nThis rejection of conventional forms of intellectual discussion is\nlinked to Stirner’s substantive views about language and\nrationality. His distinctive style reflects a conviction that both\nlanguage and rationality are human products which have come to\nconstrain and oppress their creators. Stirner maintains that accepted\nmeanings and traditional standards of argumentation are underpinned by\na conception of truth as a privileged realm beyond individual control.\nAs a result, individuals who accept this conception are abandoning a\npotential area of creative self-expression in favour of adopting a\nsubordinate role as servants of truth. In stark contrast, Stirner\ninsists that the only legitimate restriction on the form of our\nlanguage, or on the structure of our arguments, is that they should\nserve our individual ends. It is the frequent failure of conventional\nmeanings and received forms of argument to satisfy his interpretation\nof this criterion which underpins the remorselessly idiosyncratic form\nof Stirner’s prose. \nThe Ego and Its Own has an intelligible, but scarcely\ntransparent, structure. It is organised around a tripartite account of\nhuman experience, initially introduced in a description of the stages\nof an individual life. The first stage in this developmental narrative\nis the realistic one of childhood, in which children are\nconstrained by material and natural forces such as their parents.\nLiberation from these external constraints is achieved with what\nStirner calls the self-discovery of mind, as children find the means\nto outwit those forces in their own determination and cunning. The\nidealistic stage of youth, however, contains new internal\nsources of constraint, as individuals once more become enslaved, this\ntime to the spiritual forces of conscience and reason. Only with the\nadulthood of egoism do individuals escape both material\n(external) and spiritual (internal) constraints, learning to value\ntheir personal satisfaction above all other considerations. \nStirner portrays this dialectic of individual growth as an analogue of\nhistorical development, and it is a tripartite account of the latter\nwhich structures the remainder of the book. Human history is reduced\nto successive epochs of realism (the ancient, or pre-Christian,\nworld), idealism (the modern, or Christian, world), and egoism (the\nfuture world). Part One of The Ego and Its Own is devoted to\nthe first two of these subjects (providing a negative critique of the\npast), whilst Part Two is concerned with the third of them (providing\na positive account of the future). \nIn both individual and historical forms, the second stage of this\ndevelopmental narrative is presented as a negation of the first, and\nthe third stage, in turn, as the negation of that negation. The\ntriadic structure of this argument has been read as confirming\nStirner’s Hegelian formation and commitments (Stepelevich:\n1985), but might also be seen as embodying a self-conscious parody of\nHegelianism. In this context, Stirner has plausibly been understood as\noffering both a provocation and a knowing attempt at humour, utilising\na dialectical structure in order to advance his own anti-Hegelian\nposition. (De Ridder: 2008.) \nPart One of The Ego and Its Own is backward-looking, in that\nit is concerned with the ancient and modern worlds rather than with\nthe future, and negative, in that its primary aim is to demonstrate\nthe failure of modernity to escape from the very religious modes of\nthought which it claims to have outgrown. The bulk of Stirner’s\ngenealogical account is devoted to the modern epoch, and he only\ndiscusses the ancient world insofar as it contributes to the genesis\nof modernity. In both cases, however, the majority of his examples are\ntaken from the realm of cultural and intellectual affairs.\nCumulatively these examples are meant, not only to undermine\nhistorical narratives which portray the modern development of\nhumankind as the progressive realisation of freedom, but also to\nsupport an account of individuals in the modern world as increasingly\noppressed by the spiritual. For Stirner, the subordination of the\nindividual to spirit—in any of its guises—counts as\nreligious servitude. \nStirner’s account of the historical development of modernity\nlargely revolves around a single event, the Reformation. He attempts\nto show that, from the perspective of the individual, the movement\nfrom Catholic to Protestant hegemony is not a liberating one, but\ninstead constitutes both an extension and intensification of the\ndomination of spirit. The Reformation extends, rather than contracts,\nthe sphere of religious control over the individual because it refuses\nto recognise the distinction between the spiritual and the sensuous.\nRather than preventing priests marrying, for example, Protestantism\nmakes marriage religious, thereby extending the sphere of the\nspiritual to include the sensuous. The Reformation also intensifies,\nrather than relaxes, the bond between individuals and religion. The\nmore inward faith of Protestantism, for example, establishes a\nperpetual internal conflict between natural impulses and religious\nconscience. In a typically vivid and combative metaphor, Stirner\ndescribes this internal conflict in the individual as analogous to the\nstruggle between the population and the secret police in the\ncontemporary body politic. \nStirner’s claim that the modern world reproduces, rather than\nabolishes, religious modes of thought provides the opportunity for a\nsustained attack on the writings of his left-Hegelian contemporaries.\nLudwig Feuerbach, in particular, is singled out for failing to\novercome the subordination of the individual to spirit. \nThe centrality of the critique of Feuerbach to Stirner’s project\nis clear from the form of The Ego and Its Own which embodies\na structural parody of Feuerbach’s best-known work. Where the\ntwo halves of Feuerbach’s Das Wesen des Christentums\nhad been entitled God and Man — with the first\nattacked and the second celebrated —the two corresponding parts\nof Stirner’s opus are named Man and I. More\nsubstantively, Stirner seeks to challenge the progressive verdict on\nFeuerbach’s achievement. He maintains that the celebration of\nFeuerbach for having completed the critique of religion, is not merely\nmistaken but nearer the opposite of the truth. Far from undermining\nreligion, the Feuerbachian problematic is said to reproduce and\namplify its central features. \nFor Feuerbach, the primary error of Christianity was that it took\nhuman predicates and projected them into another world as if they\nconstituted an independent being. He saw religious belief as a\nnecessary step in the progress of humankind to self-understanding.\nMore precisely, it was through transformative criticism —\nrecovering the correct relation of subject and predicate from its\ninversion in Christianity — that we first come to understand\nwhat human nature is. Moreover, Feuerbach maintains that, once\nliberated from their otherworldly form, these essential human\ncharacteristics — and especially perhaps our love for others\n— would come to form the basis of the unalienated social and\npolitical life of the future. This emancipatory ambition also helps to\nclarify Feuerbach’s insistence that he should be seen as a\nfriend, and not an enemy, of religion; in particular, he sought not to\ndestroy Christianity, but to liberate its content from otherworldly\nforms. This claim is also at the heart of his distinctive — and\nperhaps idiosyncratic — denial that he was an atheist. Feuerbach\nmaintains that true atheism requires the rejection not only of God as\nsubject, but also of those predicates — love, wisdom, justice,\nand so on — traditionally associated with divinity. \nStirner might be said to pick up this, perhaps idiosyncratic,\ncharacterisation of “true atheism” and run with it.\nStirner maintains that religion, properly understood, is characterised\nby the subordination of the individual to “spirit” in any\nof its guises. Consequently, the rejection of God as a transcendental\nsubject leaves the essential character and failing of religion intact.\nFeuerbach’s perfectionist problematic, Stirner remarks, might\nhave altered “the tinsel” (the divine subject)\nbut it leaves “the main thing” (the divine predicates)\nunchanged (56). (Page references in parenthesis are to the 1995\nCambridge edition of The Ego and Its Own cited in the\nBibliography below.) The sacred is allowed to remain, if not as God,\nthen as “Man with a capital M” in\nByington’s inspired English rendering of Stirner’s\n“Der Mensch”. In short, rather than describing\nhuman nature as it is, Feuerbach is said to have deified a\nprescriptive account of what being human involves. As a result, the\nreal kernel of religion, the positing of an “essence over\nme” (46), has been left intact. Indeed, Stirner suggests that\nFeuerbach’s achievement was to have effected a “change of\nmasters” (55) which actually made the tyranny of the divine over\nthe individual even more complete. First, it extends domination,\nbecause this new deity is no longer the preserve of the faithful, but\ncan possess everyone, believers and unbelievers alike. And, second, it\nintensifies domination, because the scrutiny of our own conscience is\nmuch harder to evade than that of a transcendental subject that a\nflutters “over our heads as a dove” (86). \nStirner extends this critique to the work of all the left-Hegelians,\nincluding those with whom he had associated in Berlin. Although they\ndisagree about the content of human nature—for “political\nliberals” like Arnold Ruge human nature is identified with\ncitizenship, for “social liberals” like Moses Hess human\nnature is identified with labour, and for “humane\nliberals” like Bruno Bauer human nature is identified with\ncritical activity—all the left-Hegelians are said to have\nreproduced the basic Feuerbachian error: separating the individual\nfrom his human essence, and setting that essence above the individual\nas something to be striven for. In contrast, Stirner maintains that\nbecause it has no universal or prescriptive content, human nature\ncannot ground any claim about how we ought to live. His own\nintellectual project—which he describes as an attempt to\nrehabilitate the prosaic and mortal self, the\n“un-man”(124) for whom the notion of a calling is\nalien—is intended as a radical break with the work of these\ncontemporaries. \nIt may seem obvious that Stirner subscribes to a resolutely\nanti-perfectionist position here. However, this obvious reading has\nbeen challenged. Stirner certainly rejects what might be called\n“essentialist perfectionism”; that is, ethical theories\nwhich value certain characteristics of the individual precisely\nbecause they realise some aspect of human nature. However, he\nnonetheless continues to embrace a character ideal, a picture of a\nself-ruling individual whose perfection is valuable apart from any\nhappiness or pleasure that it might bring. The Stirnerian egoist must\nnot only avoid submission to external powers, but must also cultivate\na kind of emotional detachment towards their own thoughts and\nfeelings, ensuring that the latter do not subjugate the egoist, or\nmake the egoist an instrument of their own realisation. The\ninterpretative suggestion here is that an “anti-essentialist\nperfectionism” survives in this ideal of character, in\nStirner’s celebration of the “un-man” and the\negoist. (Leopold 2019.) \nPart Two of The Ego and Its Own is forward-looking, in that\nit is concerned with the egoistic future rather than the ancient or\nmodern worlds, and positive, in that it aims to establish the\npossibility that Stirner’s contemporaries could be liberated\nfrom the tyranny of religion. \nStirner’s account of the developing historical relationship\nbetween the individual and society is advanced in a series of\nparallels which are designed to portray egoism as the embodiment of a\nmore advanced civilisation. At one point, he takes the early modern\nidea of a social contract, in which progress consists of a move from\nan individualistic state of nature to a communal civil society, and\nneatly inverts it. It is membership of society, and not isolation,\nStirner suggests, which is humankind’s “state of\nnature” (271), an early stage of development whose inadequacies\nare, in due course, outgrown. Elsewhere, he describes the developing\nrelationship between the individual and society as analogous to that\nbetween a mother and her child. As the individual (the child) develops\na mature preference for a less suffocating environment, they must\nthrow off the claims of society (the mother) which seeks to maintain\nthem in a subordinate position. In both cases, Stirner draws the\nlesson that the individual must move from social to egoistic\nrelationships in order to escape subjection. \nWhat is meant by “egoism”, however, is not always clear.\nStirner is occasionally portrayed as a psychological egoist, that is,\nas a proponent of the descriptive claim that all (intentional) actions\nare motivated by a concern for the self-interest of the agent.\nHowever, this characterisation of Stirner’s position can be\nquestioned. Not least, The Ego and Its Own is structured\naround the opposition between egoistic and non-egoistic forms of\nexperience. Indeed, he appears to hold that non-egoistic action has\npredominated historically (in the epochs of realism and idealism).\nMoreover, at one point, Stirner appears explicitly to consider\nadopting the explanatory stance of psychological egoism only to reject\nit. In a discussion of a young woman who sacrifices her love for\nanother in order to respect the wishes of her family, Stirner remarks\nthat an observer might be tempted to maintain that selfishness has\nstill prevailed in this case since the woman clearly preferred the\nwishes of her family to the attractions of her suitor. However,\nStirner rejects this hypothetical explanation, insisting that,\nprovided “the pliable girl were conscious of having left her\nself-will unsatisfied and humbly subjected herself to a higher\npower” (197), we should see her actions as governed by piety\nrather than egoism. \nIt would also be a mistake to think of Stirner as advocating a\nnormative proposition about the value of self-interested action as\nordinarily understood. Stirnerian egoism needs to be distinguished\nfrom the individual pursuit of conventional self-interest. In The\nEgo and Its Own, Stirner discusses the important example of an\navaricious individual who sacrifices everything in pursuit of material\nriches. Such an individual is clearly self-interested (he acts only to\nenrich himself) but it is an egoism which Stirner rejects as one-sided\nand narrow. Stirner’s reason for rejecting this form of egoism\nis instructive. He suggests that the avaricious man has become\nenslaved to a single end, and that such enslavement is incompatible\nwith egoism properly understood. \nStirnerian egoism is perhaps best thought of, not in terms of the\npursuit of self-interest, but rather as a variety of individual\nself-rule or autonomy. Egoism properly understood is to be identified\nwith what Stirner calls “ownness [Eigenheit]”, a\ntype of autonomy which is incompatible with any suspension, whether\nvoluntary or forced, of individual judgement. “I am my\nown”, Stirner writes, “only when I am master of myself,\ninstead of being mastered … by anything else” (153). As\nalready noted, this Stirnerian ideal of self-rule has external and\ninternal dimensions, requiring not only that we avoid subordinating\nourselves to others, but also that we escape being “dragged\nalong” (56) by our own appetites. In short, Stirner not only\nrejects the legitimacy of any subordination to the will of another but\nalso recommends that individuals cultivate an ideal of emotional\ndetachment towards their own appetites and ideas. \nJudged against this account of egoism, characterisations of Stirner as\na “nihilist”—in the sense that he rejects all\nnormative judgement—would also appear to be mistaken. The\npopular but doubtful description of Stirner as a\n“nihilist” is encouraged by his explicit rejection of\nmorality. Morality, on Stirner’s account, involves the positing\nof obligations to behave in certain fixed ways. As a result, he\nrejects morality as incompatible with egoism properly understood.\nHowever, this rejection of morality is not grounded in the rejection\nof values as such, but in the affirmation of what might be called\nnon-moral goods. That is, Stirner allows that there are actions and\ndesires which, although not moral in his sense (because they do not\ninvolve obligations to others), are nonetheless to be assessed\npositively. Stirner is clearly committed to the non-nihilistic view\nthat certain kinds of character and modes of behaviour (namely\nautonomous individuals and actions) are to be valued above all others.\nHis conception of morality is, in this respect, a narrow one, and his\nrejection of the legitimacy of moral claims is not to be confused with\na denial of the propriety of all normative or ethical judgement. There\nis, as a result, no inconsistency in Stirner’s frequent use of\nan explicitly evaluative vocabulary, as when, for example, he praises\nthe egoist for having the “courage” (265) to lie, or\ncondemns the “weakness” (197) of the individual who\nsuccumbs to pressure from their family. \nTwo features of Stirner’s position emerge as fundamental. First,\nhe values “ownness” not as one good amongst many, but as\nthe most important good, a good which trumps all others. Second, he\nadopts an account of self-rule which is incompatible with the\nexistence of any legitimate obligations to others, even those which an\nindividual has voluntarily undertaken; thereby rejecting perhaps the\nmost familiar way of reconciling individual autonomy with the\nexistence of binding obligations. In short, Stirner appears to value\nindividual self-rule above all else, and he interprets that self-rule\nin a stringent and idiosyncratic manner. \nThe consequences of Stirner’s position appear extreme and\nfar-reaching. As the example of morality suggests, egoists are likely\nto find themselves in conflict with some cherished social institutions\nand practices. Stirner consistently associates (non-egoistic) society\nwith relationships of “belonging”, which he treats as\ninvolving the subjugation of individuals. For example, he maintains\nthat “the forming of family ties binds a man” (102).\n(Stirner never appears to consider seriously the possibility that\nbelonging might, at least potentially or in some cases, have more\npositive associations; for example, of being at home or of feeling\nsecure.) Confronted with the conflict between egoism and\n“society”, Stirner is not prompted to re-examine his\ncommitment to, or understanding of, self-rule, but instead confidently\ndenies the legitimacy of those conventional institutions and\npractices. Two examples of this response may suffice. \nOn Stirner’s account, there is a necessary antipathy between the\negoistic individual and the state. This inevitable hostility is based\non the conflict between Stirner’s conception of autonomy and any\nobligation to obey the law. “Own will and the state”, he\nwrites, “are powers in deadly hostility, between which no\n‘perpetual peace’ is possible” (175). Since\nself-rule is incompatible with, and valued more highly than, any\nobligation to obey the law, Stirner rejects the legitimacy of\npolitical obligation. Note that this rejection stands irrespective of\nthe foundation of that political obligation, and whatever the form of\nthe state. “Every state”, Stirner insists, “is a\ndespotism, be the despot one or many” (175). Even in the\nhypothetical case of a direct democracy in which a collective decision\nhad been made unanimously, Stirner denies that the egoist would be\nbound by the result. To be bound today by “my will of\nyesterday”, he maintains, would be to turn my\n“creature”, that is “a particular expression of\nwill”, into my “commander”; it would be to freeze my\nwill, and Stirner denies that “because I was a fool yesterday I\nmust remain such” (175). \nPromise-keeping is another early victim of this commitment to, and\nunderstanding of, self-rule. Stirner associates the institution of\npromising with illegitimate constraint, since the requirement that\nduly made promises be kept is incompatible with his understanding of\nindividual autonomy. Stirner rejects any general obligation to keep\npromises as just another attempt to bind the individual. The egoist,\nhe suggests, must embrace the heroism of the lie, and be willing to\nbreak even his own word “in order to determine himself instead\nof being determined” (210). Note that Stirner’s enthusiasm\nis reserved not for those who break their word in the service of some\nlarger spiritual goal (as Luther, for example, became unfaithful to\nhis monastic vows for God’s sake), but rather for those\nindividuals who are willing to break their word for their own\nsake. \nAs well as a negative account of the institutions and practices that\negoists must reject as incompatible with autonomy, The Ego and Its\nOwn also contains some positive suggestions about the possible\nshape of egoistic relationships which do not conflict with individual\nself-rule. In particular, Stirner provides a brief sketch of what he\ncalls the “union of egoists [Verein von\nEgoisten]” (161). \nThe egoistic future is said to consist not of wholly isolated\nindividuals but rather in relationships of “uniting”, that\nis, in impermanent connections between individuals who themselves\nremain independent and self-determining. The central feature of the\nresulting union of egoists is that it does not involve the\nsubordination of the individual. The union is “a son and\nco-worker” (273) of autonomy, a constantly shifting alliance\nwhich enables individuals to unite without loss of sovereignty,\nwithout swearing allegiance to anyone else’s “flag”\n(210). This union of egoists constitutes a purely instrumental\nassociation whose good is solely the advantage that the individuals\nconcerned may derive for the pursuit of their individual goals; there\nare no shared final ends and the association is not valued in itself.\nIn his reply to “Stirner’s Critics”, he imagines two\nheart-warming street scenes to illustrate egoistic union: in the\nfirst, children happen upon each other and spontaneously engage in the\n“comradeship of play [Spielkameradschaft]”; and,\nin the second, Moses Hess (one of the critics in question) bumps into\nfriends before adjourning for a drink, not out of loyalty, but in the\nexpectation of pleasure. (Stirner 1914: 295-6.) \nStirner sometimes seems torn as how best to elucidate this basic\naccount of egoistic social relations. At least, in The Ego and Its\nOwn, his elaboration of egoistic relations can appear to take\ndivergent paths. \nIn the first, and least typical, of these moods, Stirner strives to\navoid suggesting, at least too strongly, that his views might have\nradical and unforeseen consequences. More precisely, he seeks to\nsuggest that certain familiar and worthwhile relationships (such as\n“love”) might continue into the egoistic future. This\nsuggestion is presumably aimed at making that future appear more\nattractive, not least to those attached to these familiar and\nworthwhile relationships.  \nThat said, it is far from certain that all of the relationships that\nhe mentions would survive intact from their reincarnation in egoistic\nform. Consider, for example, Stirner’s contrast between two\ndifferent kinds of love: the “bad case” where\n“ownness” is sacrificed, and egoistic love in which\nself-rule is retained. Egoistic love allows the individual to deny\nthemself something in order to enhance the pleasure of another, but\nonly because their own pleasure is enhanced as a result. The object of\negoistic love, in other words, remains the individual themself. The\negoist will not sacrifice their autonomy and interests to another, but\nrather loves only as long as “love makes me happy” (258).\nAt one point, Stirner characterises this relationship as one in which\nthe individual “enjoys” the other (258). The description\nis a revealing one, since enjoying another person and loving them\nwould appear to be rather different matters. Loving another person in\nthe conventional (and non-egoistic) sense might be thought to include\nthe desire to promote the welfare of that person, even when it is not\nin our interests, or when it conflicts with our own wants and\nhappiness. In this respect, it stands at some distance from\nStirner’s account of egoistic love. The point here is not a\nterminological one—Stirner rightly cares little whether we call\negoistic love “love” and “hence stick to the old\nsound” (261) or whether we invent a new vocabulary—but\nrather that a world without this experience would be an unfamiliar and\nimpoverished one. Stirner has not obviously succeeded in establishing\nthat this particular familiar and worthwhile relationship would\nsurvive reestablishment on egoistic premises. \nIn the second, and more predominant, of these moods, Stirner\ncelebrates the radical and unfamiliar consequences of adopting an\negoistic order. Indeed, in places, he seems to revel in acknowledging\nthat his views have startling consequences from which few of his\nreaders will take any solace. This is one of the sources of the\nmelodramatic and provocative tone of parts of The Ego and Its\nOwn. \nStirner describes the appropriate relation between the egoist and\ntheir objects — which include, of course, other persons as well\nas things — as a property relation. The egoist properly stands\nin a relation of “ownership” to the wider world. This\nnotion of “egoistic property” is not to be confused with\nmore familiar juridical concepts of ownership (such as private\nproperty or collective ownership). These more familiar forms of\nproperty rest on notions of right, and involve claims to exclusivity\nor constraints on use, which Stirner rejects. Egoistic property is\nrather constituted by the “unlimited dominion” (223) of\nindividuals over the world, by which Stirner appears to mean that\nthere are no moral constraints on how an individual might relate to\nthese persons and things. Stirner sometimes describes the resulting\nassociation between people as involving relationships “of\nutility, of use” (263). The egoist, he suggests, views others as\n“nothing but—my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to\nuse by you” (263). Stirner embraces the stark consequences of\nthis rejection of any general obligation towards others, insisting,\nfor example, that the egoist does not renounce “even the power\nover life and death” (282). Over the course of the book, he\nvariously declines to condemn the officer’s widow who strangles\nher child (281), the man who treats his sister “as wife\nalso” (45), and the murderer who no longer fears his act as a\n“wrong” (169). In a world in which “we owe each\nother nothing” (263), it seems that acts of infanticide, incest,\nand murder, might all turn out to be justified. \nAt one point, Stirner acknowledges that few readers of The Ego and\nIts Own will draw any comfort from his vision of an egoistic\nfuture, but insists that the welfare of this audience is not of any\ninterest to him. Indeed, Stirner suggests that, if he had been\nmotivated by a concern for others, then he would have had to conceal\nrather than propagate his ideas. As it is, Stirner maintains that even\nif he had believed that these ideas would lead to the “bloodiest\nwars and the fall of many generations” (263) he would still have\ndisseminated them. \nAt the time of his death, Stirner’s brief period of notoriety\nwas long over, his book had been out of print for several years, and\nthere was little sign that his work might have any longer term impact.\nSince then, however, The Ego and Its Own has been translated\ninto at least eight languages, and appeared in over one hundred\neditions. \nSubsequent interpretations of Stirner have often followed contemporary\nintellectual fashion. For example, at the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, Stirner was frequently portrayed as a precursor of Friedrich\nNietzsche (1844–1900), as having anticipated, if not influenced\n— it is far from certain that Nietzsche had read Stirner’s\nwork— both the style and substance of Nietzsche’s\nwork.(Carus 1914: 74–99.) In the 1960s and early 1970s, Stirner\nwas rediscovered as a forerunner of existentialism, whose\nanti-essentialist concept of the self as a ‘creative\nnothing’ had affinities with the notion of human nature employed\nby Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980). (Paterson 1971.) More recently,\nStirner has been identified as a nascent poststructuralist (linked not\nleast with Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995)), rejecting the idea of a\nuniversal human nature, employing a genealogical critique of humanist\ndiscourses of power and identity, and opposing various forms of\nstate-centric thought. (Newman 2009.) These parallels are often\nplausible and interesting, although the sceptic might suspect that\nthey reveal changing historical enthusiasms as much as they illuminate\naspects of Stirner’s philosophical and political thought. \nThe historical influence of Stirner’s work is perhaps more\nplausibly located in two different contexts. Concerning its\ncontemporary impact on the intellectual life of Vormärz\nGermany, The Ego and Its Own had a destructive impact on\nStirner’s left-Hegelian contemporaries, and played a related and\nsignificant role in the evolution of the thought of Karl Marx.\nConcerning its longer term historical influence, Stirner’s\nbest-known work has become a founding text in the political tradition\nof individualist anarchism. \nStirner’s insistence that his radical Hegelian contemporaries\nhad failed to break with religious modes of thought prompted most of\nthe leading left-Hegelians to defend their own work in public against\nthis attack. In perhaps the most important of these replies, Feuerbach\n— who appeared defensive and irritated (suspecting Stirner of\ntrying to make a name for himself at his own expense) — was\nwidely seen as struggling to maintain a besieged and outdated\nposition. Bruno Bauer also offered a critical response, seeking to\ndefend his own philosophy of self-consciousness against what he saw as\nStirner’s inadequate form of subjectivity. (Moggach and de\nRidder, 2013.) Stirner replied directly to three of these\nleft-Hegelian reviews—the defence of Bauer’s “humane\nliberalism” by “Szeliga” (the pseudonym of Franz\nZychlinski (1816–1900)); the defence of socialism by Moses Hess;\nand the defence of Feuerbach by Feuerbach himself—in an article\nentitled “Stirner’s Critics” (1845). In this\nconfident rejoinder, Stirner reiterated some of the central themes of\nThe Ego and Its Own and clarified the character of his own\ncommitment to egoism. Stirner may also have provided a final reply to\ncontemporary critics in a pseudonymous article entitled “The\nPhilosophical Reactionaries”, in which the author responds to a\nyoung Kuno Fischer. (The caution is needed since the identification of\n“G. Edward” as Max Stirner is plausible but not\nincontrovertible.)  \nStirner’s work also had a significant impact on a then\nlittle-known contemporary associate of these left-Hegelians, one Karl\nMarx. (Stirner mentions Marx indirectly, in a footnote which treats\nhim as something like a radical Feuerbachian.) Between 1845 and 1846,\nMarx collaborated with Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) on a group\nof manuscripts now usually called The German Ideology, which\nincluded a fierce and sustained attack on their erstwhile\nphilosophical contemporaries. Most of these texts were not published\nat the time, and it was 1932 before this critical engagement with the\nwork of Bauer, Feuerbach, and Stirner, appeared fully in print. The\naccount of Stirner contained in the so-called The German\nIdeology takes up over three hundred pages of the published text\n— abridged editions often omit much of this dense but\nfascinating material — and, although Marx is remorselessly\ncritical of Stirner’s position, it scarcely follows that The\nEgo and Its Own was without influence on the former’s\nideas. Not least, Stirner’s book appears to have been decisive:\nin motivating Marx’s break with the work of Feuerbach (whose\nconsiderable influence on many of Marx’s earlier writings is\nreadily apparent); in making Marx reconsider the role that concepts of\nhuman nature should play in social criticism; and in forcing him to\nthink more clearly about how far communism should be, in some sense,\nindividualistic. \nFinally, and over a longer period of time, the author of The Ego\nand Its Own has become best-known as a member of, and influence\nupon, the anarchist tradition. In particular, Stirner’s name\nregularly appears in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist\nthought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of\nindividualist anarchism. The affinity between Stirner and the\nanarchist tradition lies in his endorsement of the claim that the\nstate is an illegitimate institution. His elaboration of this claim is\nan interesting and distinctive one. (Leopold 2006) For Stirner, a\nstate can never be legitimate, since there is a necessary conflict\nbetween individual self-rule and the obligation to obey the law (with\nwhich the legitimacy of the state is identified). Given that\nindividual self-rule trumps any competing consideration, Stirner\nconcludes that the demands of the state are not binding on the\nindividual. However, he does not think that individuals have, as a\nresult, any general obligation to oppose and attempt to eliminate the\nstate (insofar as this is within their power). Rather the individual\nshould decide in each particular case whether or not to go along with\nthe state’s demands. Only in cases where there is a conflict\nbetween the autonomy of the egoist and the demands of the state, does\nhe recommend evading the requirements of law. That said, whilst\nindividuals have no duty to overthrow the state, Stirner does think\nthat the state will eventually collapse as a result of the spread of\negoism. The cumulative effect of a growing egoistic disrespect for\nlaw, he suggests, would be to “scuttle” the “ship of\nstate”. (54) Anarchists influenced by Stirner’s\nindividualism and his suspicion of the state can be found in several\nEuropean countries. In Great Britain, his ideas influenced Dora\nMarsden (1882–1960), and her journals The New Freewoman\nand The Egoist. In America, James L Walker (1845–1904),\nauthor of The Philosophy of Egoism was interested in, and\ninfluenced by, Stirner’s thought, although the best-known\nanarchist admirers of the latter in America were in the circle which\nformed around Benjamin R. Tucker (1854–1939) and the remarkable\njournal Liberty (founded in 1881). (Welsh 2010:\n117–225.) It has often been individualist anarchists who were\nresponsible for keeping Stirner’s ideas available to others,\nproviding many of the editions and translations of his work. \nStirner is unlikely to have regretted these disputes about the nature\nand influence of The Ego and Its Own. In considering various\ninterpretative accounts of the Bible, he declines to adjudicate\nbetween the judgement of the child who plays with the book, the Inca\nemperor Atahualpa (c.1502–1533) who threw it away when it failed\nto speak to him, the priest who praises it as the word of God, and the\ncritic who dissects it as a purely human invention. The plurality of\ninterpretations of his own work might well have amused Stirner and\nencouraged him in his view that there could be no legitimate\nconstraints on the meaning of a text. Stirner once described himself\nas writing only to procure for his thoughts an existence in the world,\ninsisting that what subsequently happens to those ideas “is your\naffair and does not trouble me” (263).","contact.mail":"david.leopold@politics.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"politics.ox.ac.uk"}]
