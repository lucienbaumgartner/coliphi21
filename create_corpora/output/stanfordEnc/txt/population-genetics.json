Population geneticists pursue their goals\nby developing abstract mathematical models of gene frequency dynamics,\ntrying to extract conclusions from those models about the likely\npatterns of genetic variation in actual populations, and testing the\nconclusions against empirical data. A number of the more robust\ngeneralizations to emerge from population-genetic analysis are\ndiscussed below.\n\n\n\nPopulation genetics is intimately bound up with the study of evolution\nand natural selection, and is often regarded as the theoretical\ncornerstone of modern Darwinism. This is because natural selection is\none of the most important factors that can affect a population's\ngenetic composition. Natural selection occurs when some variants in a\npopulation out-reproduce other variants as a result of being better\nadapted to the environment, or ‘fitter’. Presuming the\nfitness differences are at least partly due to genetic differences,\nthis will cause the population's genetic makeup to be altered over\ntime. By studying formal models of gene frequency change, population\ngeneticists therefore hope to shed light on the evolutionary process,\nand to permit the consequences of different evolutionary hypotheses to\nbe explored in a quantitatively precise way.\n\n\n\nThe field of population genetics came into being in the 1920s and\n1930s, thanks to the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall\nWright. Their achievement was to integrate the principles of Mendelian\ngenetics, which had been rediscovered at the turn of century, with\nDarwinian natural selection. Though the compatibility of Darwinism with\nMendelian genetics is today taken for granted, in the early years of\nthe twentieth century it was not. Many of the early Mendelians did not\naccept Darwin's ‘gradualist’ account of evolution,\nbelieving instead that novel adaptations must arise in a single\nmutational step; conversely, many of the early Darwinians did not\nbelieve in Mendelian inheritance, often because of the erroneous belief\nthat it was incompatible with the process of evolutionary modification\nas described by Darwin. By working out mathematically the consequences\nof selection acting on a population obeying the Mendelian rules of\ninheritance, Fisher, Haldane and Wright showed that Darwinism and\nMendelism were not just compatible but excellent bed fellows; this\nplayed a key part in the formation of the ‘neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis’, and explains why population genetics came to occupy\nso pivotal a role in evolutionary theory.\n\n\n\nThe discussion below is structured as follows. Section 1 outlines the\nhistory of population genetics, focusing on major themes. Section 2\nexplains the Hardy-Weinberg principle, one of the most important\nconcepts in population genetics. Section 3 introduces the reader to\nsimple population-genetic models of the evolutionary process, and\ndiscusses their significance. Section 4 discusses the status of\npopulation genetics in modern biology, and some criticisms that have\nbeen leveled against it. Section 5 examines some of the philosophical\nissues raised by population genetics. \n\n\n\nTo understand how population genetics came into being, and to\nappreciate its intellectual significance, a brief excursion into the\nhistory of biology is necessary. Darwin's Origin of Species,\npublished in 1859, propounded two main theses: firstly, that modern\nspecies were descended from common ancestors, and secondly that the\nprocess of natural selection was the major mechanism of evolutionary\nchange. The first thesis quickly won acceptance in the scientific\ncommunity, but the second did not. Many people found it difficult to\naccept that natural selection could play the explanatory role required\nof it by Darwin's theory. This situation—accepting that\nevolution had happened but doubting Darwin's account of what had\ncaused it to happen—persisted well into the twentieth\ncentury (Bowler 1988). \n\nOpposition to natural selection was understandable, for Darwin's\ntheory, though compelling, contained a major lacuna: an account of the\nmechanism of inheritance. For evolution by natural selection to occur,\nit is necessary that parents should tend to resemble their offspring;\notherwise, fitness-enhancing traits will have no tendency to spread\nthrough a population. (For example, if fast zebras leave more offspring\nthen slow ones, this will only lead to evolutionary change if the\noffspring of fast zebras are themselves fast runners.) In the\nOrigin, Darwin rested his argument on the observed fact that\noffspring do tend to resemble their parents—‘the\nstrong principle of inheritance’—while admitting that he\ndid not know why this was. Darwin did later attempt an explicit theory\nof inheritance, based on hypothetical entities called\n‘gemmules’, but it turned out to have no basis in fact. \n\nDarwin was deeply troubled by not having a proper understanding of the\ninheritance mechanism, for it left him unable to rebut one of the most\npowerful objections to his overall theory. For a population to evolve\nby natural selection, the members of the population must vary—if\nall organisms are identical, no selection can occur. So for selection\nto gradually modify a population over a long period of time, in the\nmanner suggested by Darwin, a continual supply of variation is\nneeded. This was the basis for Fleeming Jenkins' famous objection to\nDarwin, namely that the available variation would be used up too\nfast. Jenkins' reasoning assumed a ‘blending’ theory of\ninheritance, i.e. that an offspring's phenotypic traits are a\n‘blend’ of those of its parents. (So for example, if a\nshort and a tall organism mate, the height of the offspring will be\nintermediate between the two.) Jenkins argued that given blending\ninheritance, a sexually reproducing population will become\nphenotypically homogenous in just a few generations, far shorter than\nthe number of generations needed for natural selection to produce\ncomplex adaptations. \n\nFortunately for Darwin's theory, inheritance does not actually work\nthe way Jenkins thought. The type of inheritance that we call\n‘Mendelian’, after Gregor Mendel, is\n‘particulate’ rather than\n‘blending’—offspring inherit discrete hereditary\nparticles (genes) from their parents, which means that sexual\nreproduction does not diminish the heritable variation present in the\npopulation. (See section 2, ‘The Hardy-Weinberg\nPrinciple’, below.) However, this realisation took a long time\nto come, for two reasons. Firstly, Mendel's work was overlooked by the\nscientific community for forty years. Secondly, even after the\nrediscovery of Mendel's work at the turn of the twentieth century, it\nwas widely believed that Darwinian evolution and Mendelian inheritance\nwere incompatible. The early Mendelians did not accept that natural\nselection played an important role in evolution, so were not well\nplaced to see that Mendel had given Darwin's theory the lifeline it\nneeded. The synthesis of Darwinism and Mendelism, which marked the\nbirth of modern population genetics, was achieved by a long and\ntortuous route (Provine 1971). \n\nThe key ideas behind Mendel's theory of inheritance are\nstraightforward. In his experimental work on pea plants, Mendel\nobserved an unusual phenomenon. He began with two ‘pure\nbreeding’ lines, one producing plants with round seeds, the\nother wrinkled seeds. He then crossed these to produce the first\ndaughter generation (the F1 generation). The F1 plants all had round\nseeds—the wrinkled trait had disappeared from the\npopulation. Mendel then crossed the F1 plants with each other to\nproduce the F2 generation. Strikingly, approximately one quarter of\nthe F2 plants had wrinkled seeds. So the wrinkled trait had made a\ncomeback, skipping a generation. \n\nThese and similar observations were explained by Mendel as follows.\nHe hypothesised that each plant contains a pair of\n‘factors’ that together determine some aspect of its\nphenotype—in this case, seed shape. A plant inherits one\nfactor from each of its parents. Suppose that there is one factor for\nround seeds (R), another for wrinkled seeds (W). There are then three\npossible types of plant: RR, RW and WW. An RR plant will have round\nseeds, a WW plant wrinkled seeds. What about an RW plant? Mendel\nsuggested that it would have round seeds—the R factor is\n‘dominant’ over the W factor. The observations could then\nbe easily explained. The initial pure-breeding lines were RR and WW.\nThe F1 plants were formed by RR × WW crosses, so were all of the\nRW type and thus had round seeds. The F2 plants were formed by RW\n× RW crosses, so contained a mixture of the RR, RW and WW\ntypes. If we assume that each RW parent transmits the R and W factors\nto its offspring with equal probability, then the F2 plants would\ncontain RR, RW and WW in the ratio 1:2:1. (This assumption is known as\nMendel's First Law or The Law of Segregation.) Since\nRR and RW both have round seeds, this explains why three quarters of\nthe F2 plants had round seeds, one quarter wrinkled seeds. \n\nObviously, our modern understanding of heredity is vastly more\nsophisticated than Mendel's, but the key elements of Mendel's\ntheory—discrete hereditary particles that come in different\ntypes, dominance and recessiveness, and the law of\nsegregation—have turned out to be essentially correct.  Mendel's\n‘factors’ are the genes of modern population genetics, and\nthe alternative forms that a factor can take (e.g. R versus W in the\npea plant example) are known as the alleles of a gene. The\nlaw of segregation is explained by the fact that during gametogenesis,\neach gamete (sex cell) receives only one of each chromosome pair from\nits parent organism. Other aspects of Mendel's theory have been\nmodified in the light of later discoveries. Mendel thought that most\nphenotypic traits were controlled by a single pair of factors, like\nseed shape in his pea plants, but it is now known that most traits are\naffected by many pairs of genes, not just one. Mendel believed that\nthe pairs of factors responsible for different traits (e.g. seed shape\nand flower colour) segregated independently of each other, but we now\nknow that this need not be so (see section 3.6, ‘Two-Locus\nModels and Linkage’, below). Despite these points, Mendel's\ntheory marks a turning point in our understanding of inheritance. \n\nThe rediscovery of Mendel's work in 1900 did not lead the\nscientific community to be converted to Mendelism overnight. The\ndominant approach to the study of heredity at the time was biometry,\nspearheaded by Karl Pearson in London, which involved statistical\nanalysis of the phenotypic variation found in natural populations.\nBiometricians were mainly interested in continuously varying traits\nsuch as height, rather than the ‘discrete’ traits such as\nseed shape that Mendel studied, and were generally believers in\nDarwinian gradualism. Opposed to the biometricians were the Mendelians,\nspearheaded by William Bateson, who emphasized discontinuous variation,\nand believed that major adaptive change could be produced by single\nmutational steps, rather than by cumulative natural selection à\nla Darwin. A heated controversy between the biometricians and the\nMendelians ensued. As a result, Mendelian inheritance came to be\nassociated with an anti-Darwinian view of evolution. \n\nPopulation genetics as we know it today arose from the need to\nreconcile Mendel with Darwin, a need which became increasingly urgent\nas the empirical evidence for Mendelian inheritance began to pile up.\nThe first significant milestone was R.A. Fisher's 1918 paper,\n‘The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of\nMendelian Inheritance’, which showed how the biometrical and\nMendelian research traditions could be unified. Fisher demonstrated\nthat if a given continuous trait, e.g. height, was affected by a large\nnumber of Mendelian factors, each of which made a small difference to\nthe trait, then the trait would show an approximately normal\ndistribution in a population. Since the Darwinian process was widely\nbelieved to work best on continuously varying traits, showing that the\ndistribution of such traits was compatible with Mendelism was an\nimportant step towards reconciling Darwin with Mendel. \n\nThe full reconciliation was achieved in the 1920s and early 30s,\nthanks to the mathematical work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright. Each of\nthese theorists developed formal models to explore how natural\nselection, and other evolutionary forces such as mutation, would modify\nthe genetic composition of a Mendelian population over time. This work\nmarked a major step forward in our understanding of evolution, for it\nenabled the consequences of various evolutionary hypotheses to be\nexplored quantitatively rather than just qualitatively. Verbal\narguments about what natural selection could or could not achieve, or\nabout the patterns of genetic variation to which it could give rise,\nwere replaced with explicit mathematical arguments. The strategy of\ndevising formal models to shed light on the process of evolution is\nstill the dominant research methodology in contemporary population\ngenetics. \n\nThere were important intellectual differences between Fisher,\nHaldane and Wright, some of which have left legacies on the subsequent\ndevelopment of the subject. One difference concerned their respective\nattitudes towards natural selection. Fisher and Haldane were both\nstrong Darwinians—they believed that natural selection was by\nfar the most important factor affecting a population's genetic\ncomposition. Wright did not downplay the role of natural selection, but\nhe believed that chance factors also played a crucial role in\nevolution, as did migration between the constituent populations of a\nspecies (See sections 3.3, ‘Random Drift’, and 3.4,\n‘Migration’.) A related difference is that Wright emphasized\nepistasis, or non-additive interactions between the genes within a\nsingle genome, to a much greater extent than Fisher or Haldane. Despite\nthese differences, the work of all three was remarkably consonant in\noverall approach. \n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle, discovered independently by G.H.\nHardy and W. Weinberg in 1908, is one of the simplest and most\nimportant principles in population genetics. To illustrate the\nprinciple, consider a large population of sexually reproducing\norganisms. The organisms are assumed to be diploids, meaning\nthat they contain two copies of each chromosome, one received from each\nparent. The gametes they produce are haploid, meaning that\nthey contain only one of each chromosome pair. During sexual fusion,\ntwo haploid gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, which then grows and\ndevelops into an adult organism. Most multi-celled animals, and many\nplants, have a lifecycle of this sort. \n\nSuppose that at a given locus, or chromosomal ‘slot’,\nthere are two possible alleles, A1 and\nA2; the locus is assumed to be on an autosome, not\na sex chromosome. With respect to the locus in question, there are\nthree possible genotypes in the population,\nA1A1,\nA1A2 and\nA2A2 (just as in Mendel's pea\nplant example above). Organisms with the\nA1A1 and\nA2A2 genotypes are called\nhomozygotes; those with the\nA1A2 genotype are\nheterozygotes. The proportions, or relative frequencies, of\nthe three genotypes in the overall population may be denoted\nf(A1A1),\nf(A1A2) and\nf(A2A2) respectively,\nwhere f(A1A1) +\nf(A1A2) +\nf(A2A2) = 1. It is\nassumed that these genotypic frequencies are the same for both males\nand females. The relative frequencies of the A and B\nalleles in the population may be denoted p and q,\nwhere p + q = 1. \n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle is about the relation between the allelic\nand the genotypic frequencies. It states that if mating is random in\nthe population, and if the evolutionary forces of natural selection,\nmutation, migration and drift are absent, then in the offspring\ngeneration the genotypic and allelic frequencies will be related by\nthe following simple equations: \n\nRandom mating means the absence of a genotypic correlation between\nmating partners, i.e. the probability that a given organism mates with\nan A1A1 partner, for example,\ndoes not depend on the organism's own genotype, and similarly for the\nprobability of mating with a partner of one of the other two\ntypes. \n\nThat random mating will lead the genotypes to be in the above\nproportions (so-called Hardy-Weinberg proportions) is a\nconsequence of Mendel's law of segregation. To see this, note that\nrandom mating is in effect equivalent to offspring being formed by\nrandomly picking pairs of gametes from a large ‘gamete\npool’ and fusing them into a zygote. The gamete pool contains\nall the successful gametes of the parent organisms. Since we are\nassuming the absence of selection, all parents contribute equal\nnumbers of gametes to the pool. By the law of segregation, an\nA1A2 heterozygote produces\ngametes bearing the A1 and A2\nalleles in equal proportion. Therefore, the relative frequencies of\nthe A and B alleles in the gamete pool will be the\nsame as in the parental population, namely p and q\nrespectively.  Given that the gamete pool is very large, when we pick\npairs of gametes from the pool at random, we will get the ordered\ngenotypic pairs {A1A1},\n{A1A2},\n{A2A1},\n{A2A2} in the proportions\np2:pq:qp:q2.\nBut order does not matter, so we can regard the\n{A1A2} and\n{A2A1} pairs as equivalent,\ngiving the Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the unordered offspring\ngenotypes. \n\nThis simple derivation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle deals with two\nalleles at a single locus, but can easily be extended to multiple\nalleles. (Extension to more than one locus is trickier; see section\n3.6, ‘Two-Locus Models and Linkage’, below.) For the\nmulti-allelic case, suppose there are n alleles at the locus,\nA1 … An, with\nrelative frequencies of p1 …\npn respectively, where\np1 + p2 + … +\npn = 1. Assuming again that the\npopulation is large, mating is random, evolutionary forces are absent,\nand Mendel's law of segregation holds, then in the offspring\ngeneration the frequency of the\nAiAi\ngenotype will be pi2, and the\nfrequency of the (unordered)\nAiAj\ngenotype (i ≠ j) will be\n2pipj.  It\nis easy to see that the two allele case above is a special case of\nthis generalized principle. \n\nImportantly, whatever the initial genotypic proportions, random mating\nwill automatically produce offspring in Hardy-Weinberg proportions\n(for one-locus genotypes). So if generations are non-overlapping,\ni.e. parents die as soon as they have reproduced, just one round of\nrandom mating is needed to bring about Hardy-Weinberg proportions in\nthe whole population; if generations overlap, more than one round of\nrandom mating is needed. Once Hardy-Weinberg proportions have been\nachieved, they will be maintained in subsequent generations so long as\nthe population continues to mate at random and is unaffected by\nevolutionary forces such as selection, mutation etc. The population is\nthen said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium—meaning\nthat the genotypic proportions are constant from generation to\ngeneration. \n\nThe importance of the Hardy-Weinberg principle lies in the fact that it\ncontains the solution to the problem of blending that troubled Darwin.\nAs we saw, Jenkins argued that with sexual reproduction, the variation\nin the population would be exhausted very rapidly. But the\nHardy-Weinberg principle teaches us that this is not so. Sexual\nreproduction has no inherent tendency to destroy the genotypic\nvariation present in the population, for the genotypic proportions\nremain constant over generations, given the assumptions noted above. It\nis true that natural selection often tends to destroy\nvariation, and is thus a homogenizing force; but this is a quite\ndifferent matter. The ‘blending’ objection was that sexual\nmixing itself would produce homogeneity, even in the absence\nof selection, and the Hardy-Weinberg principle shows that this is\nuntrue. \n\nAnother benefit of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is that it greatly\nsimplifies the task of modelling evolutionary change. When a\npopulation is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it is possible to track\nthe genotypic composition of the population by directly tracking the\nallelic frequencies (or gametic frequencies). That this is so is\nclear—for if we know the relative frequencies of all the alleles\n(at a single locus), and know that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium, the entire genotype frequency distribution can be easily\ncomputed. Were the population not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we\nwould need to explicitly track the genotype frequencies themselves,\nwhich is more complicated. \n\nPrimarily for this reason, many population-genetic models assume that\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium obtains; as we have seen, this is\ntantamount to assuming that mating is random with respect to\ngenotype. But is this assumption empirically plausible? The answer is\nsometimes but not always. In the human population, for example, mating\nis close to random with respect to ABO blood group, so the genotype that\ndetermines blood group is found in approximately Hardy-Weinberg proportions in many\npopulations (Hartl 1980). But mating is not random with respect to\nheight; on the contrary, people tend to choose mates similar in height\nto themselves.  So if we consider a genotype that influences height,\nmating will not be random with respect to this genotype (see section\n3.5 ‘Non-Random Mating’). \n\nThe geneticist W.J. Ewens has written of the Hardy-Weinberg principle,\n‘it does not often happen that the most important theorem in any\nsubject is the easiest and most readily derived theorem for that\nsubject’ (1969, p. 1). The main importance of the principle, as\nEwens stresses, is not the gain in mathematical simplicity that it\npermits, which is simply a beneficial side effect, but rather what it\nteaches us about the preservation of genetic variation in a sexually\nreproducing population. \n\nPopulation geneticists usually define ‘evolution’ as any\nchange in a population's genetic composition over time. The four\nfactors that can bring about such a change are: natural selection,\nmutation, random genetic drift, and migration into or out of the\npopulation. (A fifth factor—changes to the mating\npattern—can change the genotype but not the\nallele frequencies; many theorists would not count this as an\nevolutionary change.) A brief introduction to the standard\npopulation-genetic treatment of each of these factors is given\nbelow. \n\nNatural selection occurs when some genotypic variants in a population\nenjoy a survival or reproduction advantage over others. The simplest\npopulation-genetic model of natural selection assumes one autosomal\nlocus with two alleles, A1 and\nA2, as above. The three diploid genotypes\nA1A1,\nA1A2 and\nA2A2 have different fitnesses,\ndenoted by w11, w12 and\nw22 respectively. These fitnesses are assumed to\nbe constant across generations. A genotype's fitness may be defined,\nin this context, as the average number of successful gametes that an\norganism of that genotype contributes to the next\ngeneration—which depends on how well the organism survives, how\nmany matings it achieves, and how fertile it is. Unless\nw11, w12 and\nw22 are all equal, then natural selection will\noccur, possibly leading the genetic composition of the population to\nchange. \n\nSuppose that initially, i.e. before selection has operated, the zygote\ngenotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions and the frequencies of the\nA1 and A2 alleles are\np and q respectively, where p + q\n= 1. The zygotes then grow to adulthood and reproduce, giving rise to\na new generation of offspring zygotes. Our task is to compute the\nfrequencies of A1 and A2 in\nthe second generation; let us denote these by p′ and\nq′ respectively, where p′ +\nq′ = 1. (Note that in both generations, we consider\ngene frequencies at the zygotic stage; these may differ from the adult\ngene frequencies if there is differential survivorship.) \n\nIn the first generation, the genotypic frequencies at the zygotic\nstage are p2, 2pq and\nq2 for\nA1A1,\nA1A2,\nA2A2 respectively, by the\nHardy-Weinberg law. The three genotypes produce successful gametes in\nproportion to their fitnesses, i.e. in the ratio\nw11:w12:w22. The\naverage fitness in the population is\n w =\np2w11 + 2pq\nw12 + q2w22, so the total number of successful gametes\nproduced is\n Nw,\n where N is\npopulation size. Assuming there is no mutation, and that Mendel's law\nof segregation holds, then an\nA1A1 organism will produce\nonly A1 gametes, an\nA2A2 organism will produce\nonly A2 gametes, and an\nA1A2 organism will produce\nA1 and A2 gametes in equal\nproportion.  Therefore, the proportion of A1\ngametes, and thus the frequency of the A1 allele\nin the second generation at the zygotic stage, is: \n\nEquation (1) is known as a ‘recurrence’ equation—it\nexpresses the frequency of the A1 allele in the second\ngeneration in terms of its frequency in the first generation. The\nchange in frequency between generations can then be written as: \n\nIf Δp > 0, then natural selection has led the\nA1 allele to increase in frequency; if\nΔp < 0 then selection has led the\nA2 allele to increase in frequency. If\nΔp = 0 then no gene frequency change has occurred,\ni.e. the system is in allelic equilibrium. (Note, however, that the\ncondition Δp = 0 does not imply that no\nnatural selection has occurred; the condition for that is\nw11 = w12 =\nw22.  It is possible for natural selection to\noccur but to have no effect on gene frequencies.) \n\nEquations (1) and (2) show, in precise terms, how fitness differences\nbetween genotypes will lead to evolutionary change. This enables us to\nexplore the consequences of various different selective\nregimes.  \n\nSuppose firstly that w11 >\nw12 > w22, i.e. the\nA1A1 homozygote is fitter than\nthe A1A2 heterozygote, which\nin turn is fitter than the\nA2A2 homozygote. By inspection\nof equation (2), we can see that Δp must be positive\n(so long as neither p nor q is zero, in which case\nΔp = 0). So in each generation, the frequency of the\nA1 allele will be greater than in the previous\ngeneration, until it eventually reaches fixation and the\nA2 allele is eliminated from the population. Once\nthe A1 allele reaches fixation, i.e. p =\n1 and q = 0, no further evolutionary change will occur, for\nif p = 1 then Δp = 0. This makes good sense\ninutitively: since the A1 allele confers a fitness\nadvantage on organisms that carry it, its relative frequency in the\npopulation will increase from generation to generation until it is\nfixed.  \n\nIt is obvious that analogous reasoning applies in the case where\nw22 > w12 >\nw11. Equation (2) tells us that Δp\nmust then be negative, so long as neither p nor q is\nzero, so the A2 allele will sweep to fixation,\neliminating the A1 allele.  \n\nA more interesting\nsituation arises when the heterozygote is superior in fitness to both\nof the homozygotes, i.e.  w12 >\nw11 and w12 >\nw22—a phenomenon known as\nheterosis.  Intuitively it is clear what should happen in\nthis situation: an equilibrium situation should be reached in which\nboth alleles are present in the population. Equation (2) confirms this\nintuition. It is easy to see that Δp = 0 if either\nallele has gone to fixation (i.e. if p = 0 or q =\n0), or, thirdly, if the following condition obtains: \n\nwhich reduces to \n\n(The asterisk indicates that this is an equilibrium condition.)  Since\np must be non-negative, this condition can only be satisfied\nif there is heterozygote superiority or heterozygote inferiority; it\nrepresents an equilibrium state of the population in which both\nalleles are present. This equilibrium is known as\npolymorphic, by contrast with the monomorphic\nequilibria that arise when either of the alleles has gone to\nfixation. The possibility of polymorphic equilibrium is quite\nsignificant. It teaches us that natural selection will not always\nproduce genetic homogeneity; in some cases, selection preserves the\ngenetic variation found in a population. \n\nNumerous further questions about natural selection can be addressed\nusing a simple population-genetic model. For example, by incorporating\na parameter which measures the fitness differences between genotypes,\nwe can study the rate of evolutionary change, permitting us\nto ask questions such as: how many generations are needed for\nselection to increase the frequency of the A1\nallele from 0.1 to 0.9? If a given deleterious allele is recessive,\nhow much longer will it take to eliminate it from the population than\nif it were dominant? By permitting questions such as these to be\nformulated and answered, population geneticists have brought\nmathematical rigour to the theory of evolution, to an extent that\nwould have seemed unimaginable in Darwin's day. \n\nOf course, the one-locus model discussed above is too simple to apply\nto many real-life populations, for it incorporates simplifying\nassumptions that are unlikely to hold true. Selection is rarely the\nonly evolutionary force in operation, genotypic fitnesses are unlikely\nto be constant across generations, Mendelian segregation does not\nalways hold exactly, and so-on. Much research in population genetics\nconsists in devising more realistic evolutionary models, which rely on\nfewer simplifying assumptions and are thus more complicated. But the\none-locus model illustrates the essence of population-genetic\nreasoning, and the attendant clarification of the evolutionary process\nthat it brings. \n\n Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation,\npreventing populations from becoming genetically homogeneous in\nsituations where they otherwise would. Once mutation is taken into\naccount, the conclusions drawn in the previous section need to be\nmodified. Even if one allele is selectively superior to all others at\na given locus, it will not become fixed in the population; recurrent\nmutation will ensure that other alleles are present at low frequency,\nthus maintaining a degree of polymorphism. Population geneticists have\nlong been interested in exploring what happens when selection and\nmutation act simultaneously. \n\nContinuing with our one-locus, two allele model, let us suppose that\nthe A1 allele is selectively superior to\nA2, but recurrent mutation from\nA1 to A2 prevents\nA1 from spreading to fixation. The rate of\nmutation from A1 to A2 per\ngeneration, i.e. the proportion of A1 alleles that\nmutate every generation, is denoted u.  (Empirical estimates\nof mutation rates are typically in the region of 10-6.)\nBack mutation from A2 to A1\ncan be ignored, because we are assuming that the\nA2 allele is at a very low frequency in the\npopulation, thanks to natural selection.  What happens to the gene\nfrequency dynamics under these assumptions?  Recall equation (1)\nabove, which expresses the frequency of the A1\nallele in terms of its frequency in the previous generation. Since a\ncertain fraction (u) of the A1 alleles\nwill have mutated to A2, this recurrence equation\nmust be modified to: \n\nto take account of mutation. As before, equilibrium is reached when\np′ = p, i.e. Δp = 0. The\ncondition for equilibrium is therefore: \n\nA useful simplification of equation (3) can be achieved by making some\nassumptions about the genotype fitnesses, and adopting a new\nnotation. Let us suppose that the A2 allele is\ncompletely recessive (as is often the case for deleterious\nmutants). This means that the\nA1A1 and\nA1A2 genotypes have identical\nfitness. Therefore, genotypic fitnesses can be written\nw11 = 1, w12 = 1,\nw22 = 1 − s, where s\ndenotes the difference in fitness of the\nA2A2 homozygote from that of\nthe other two genotypes. (s is known as the selection\nco-efficient against\nA2A2). Since we are assuming\nthat the A2 allele is deleterious, it follows that\ns > 0.  Substituting these genotype fitnesses in equation\n(3) yields: \n\nwhich reduces to: \n\nor equivalently (since p + q = 1): \n\nEquation (4) gives the equilibrium frequency of the\nA2 allele, under the assumption that it is\ncompletely recessive. Note that as u increases, q*\nincreases too. This is highly intuitive: the greater the mutation rate\nfrom A1 to A2, the greater the\nfrequency of A2 that can be maintained at\nequilibrium, for a given value of s. Conversely, as\ns increases, q* decreases. This is also intuitive:\nthe stronger the selection against the\nA2A2 homozygote, the lower the\nequilibrium frequency of A2, for a given value of\nu. \n\nIt is easy to see why equation (4) is said to describe\nselection-mutation balance—natural selection is\ncontinually removing A2 alleles from the\npopulation, while mutation is continually re-creating them. Equation\n(4) tells us the equilibrium frequency of A2 that\nwill be maintained, as a function of the rate of mutation from\nA1 to A2 and the magnitude of\nthe selective disadvantage suffered by the\nA2A2 homozygote. Importantly,\nequation (4) was derived under the assumption that the\nA2 allele is completely recessive, i.e. that the\nA1A2 heterozygote is\nphenotypically identical to the\nA1A1 homozygote. However, it\nis straightforward to derive similar equations for the cases where the\nA2 allele is dominant, or partially dominant. If\nA2 is dominant, or partially dominant, its\nequilibrium frequency will be lower than if it is completely\nrecessive; for selection is more efficient at removing it from the\npopulation. A deleterious allele that is recessive can\n‘hide’ in heterozygotes, and thus escape the purging power\nof selection, but a dominant allele cannot. \n\nBefore leaving this topic, one final point should be noted. Our\ndiscussion has focused exclusively on deleterious mutations, i.e. ones\nwhich reduce the fitness of their host organism. This may seem odd,\ngiven that beneficial mutations play so crucial a role in the\nevolutionary process. The reason is that in population genetics, a\nmajor concern is to understand the causes of the genetic variability\nfound in biological populations. If a gene is beneficial, natural\nselection is likely to be the major determinant of its equilibrium\nfrequency; the rate of sporadic mutation to that gene will play at\nmost a minor role. It is only where a gene is deleterious that\nmutation plays a major role in maintaining it in a population. \n\nRandom genetic drift refers to the chance fluctuations in gene\nfrequency that arise in finite populations; it can be thought of as a\ntype of ‘sampling error’. In many evolutionary models, the\npopulation is assumed to be infinite, or very large, precisely in\norder to abstract away from chance fluctuations. But though\nmathematically convenient, this assumption is often unrealistic. In\nreal life, chance factors will invariably play a role, particularly in\nsmall populations. The term 'random drift' is sometimes used in broad\nsense, to refer to any stochastic factors that affect gene frequencies\nin a population, including for example chance fluctuations in survival\nand mating success; and sometimes in a narrower sense, to refer to the\nrandom sampling of gametes to form the offspring generation (which\narises because organisms produce many more gametes than will ever make\nit into a fertilized zygote). The broader sense is used here. \n\nTo understand the nature of random drift, consider a simple example.\nA population contains just ten organisms, five of type A and\nfive of type B; the organisms reproduce asexually and beget\noffspring of the same type. Suppose that neither type is selectively\nsuperior to the other—both are equally well-adapted to the\nenvironment. However, this does not imply that the two types will\nproduce identical numbers of offspring, for chance factors may play a\nrole. For example, it is possible that all the type Bs might\ndie by accident before reproducing; in which case the frequency of\nB in the second generation will fall to zero. If so, then the\ndecline of the B type (and thus the spread of the A\ntype) is the result of random drift. Evolutionists are often\ninterested in knowing whether a given gene frequency change is the\nresult of drift, selection, or some combination of the two. \n\nThe label ‘random drift’ is slightly misleading. In saying\nthat the spread of the A type is due to random drift, or\nchance, we do not mean that no cause can be found of its spread. In\ntheory, we could presumably discover the complete causal story about\nwhy each organism in the population left exactly the number of\noffspring that it did. In ascribing the evolutionary change to random\ndrift, we are not denying that there is such a causal story to be\ntold. Rather, we mean that the spread of the A type was not\ndue to its adaptive superiority over the B type. Put\ndifferently, the A and the B types had the same\nexpected number of offspring, so were equally fit; but the\nA types had a greater actual number of offspring. In\na finite population, actual reproductive output will almost always\ndeviate from expectation, leading to evolutionary change. \n\nAn analogy with coin tossing can illuminate random drift. Suppose a\nfair coin is tossed ten times. The probability of heads on any one\ntoss is ½, and so the expected frequency of heads in\nthe sequence of ten is 50%. But the probability of actually\ngetting half heads and half tails is only 242/1024, or approximately\n23.6%. So even though the coin is fair, we are unlikely to get equal\nproportions of heads and tails in a sequence of ten tosses; some\ndeviation from expectation is more probable than not. In just the same\nway, even though the A and B types are equally fit\nin the example above, it is likely that some evolutionary change will\noccur. This analogy also illustrates the role of population size. If\nwe tossed the coin a hundred times rather than ten, the proportion of\nheads would probably be very close to ½. In just the same way,\nthe larger the population, the less important the effect of random\ndrift on gene frequencies; in the infinite limit, drift has no\neffect. \n\nDrift greatly complicates the task facing the population geneticist.\nIn the example above, it is obviously impossible to deduce\nthe composition of the population in the second generation from its\ncomposition in the first generation; at most, we can hope to deduce\nthe probability distribution over all the possible compositions. So\nonce drift is taken into account, no simple recurrence relation for\ngene frequencies, of the sort expressed in equation (1) above, can be\nderived. To analyse the evolutionary consequences of drift, population\ngeneticists use a mathematical technique known as diffusion modelling,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this article; see Gillespie (2004) or\nRice (2004) for good introductions. However, many of these\nconsequences are quite intuitive, and can be understood without the\nmathematics. \n\nOne important effect of random drift is to decrease the degree of\nheterozygosity in a population over time. This happens because, given\nenough time, any finite population will eventually become homozygous\nthrough drift (though if the population is large, the approach to\nhomozygosity will be slow.) It is easy to see why this is—for\ngene frequencies of 0 and 1 are ‘absorbing boundaries’,\nmeaning that once the boundary is reached, there is no way back from\nit (apart from mutation). So eventually, a given allele will\neventually become fixed in a population, or go extinct, the latter\nbeing the more likely fate. Indeed mathematical models show that a\nneutral allele arising by mutation has a very low probability of\nbecoming fixed in a population; the larger the population, the lower\nthe probability of fixation. \n\nAnother important effect of random drift is to cause the different\nsubpopulations of a species to diverge genetically from each other,\nas the chance accumulation of alleles will probably proceed\ndifferently in each, particularly if the alleles confer little\nselective advantage or disadvantage. By chance, one population may\nbecome fixed for allele A1, while a second\npopulation becomes fixed for another allele\nA2. This possibility is an important one, for if\nwe ignore it, we may mistakenly conclude that the\nA1 allele must have been advantageous in the\nenvironment of the first population, the A2 allele\nin the environment of the second, i.e. that selection was responsible\nfor the genetic differentiation. Such an explanation might be\nright, but it is not the only one—random drift provides an\nalternative. \n\nThe question of whether drift or selection plays a more important role\nin molecular evolution was much debated in the 1960s and 1970s; it lay\nat the heart of the heated controversy between\n‘selectionists’ and ‘neutralists’ (see\nDietrich 1994). The neutralist camp, headed by M. Kimura, argued that\nmost molecular variants had no effect on phenotype, so were not\nsubject to natural selection; random drift was the major determinant\nof their fate. Kimura argued that the apparently constant rate at\nwhich the amino acid sequences of proteins evolved, and the extent of\ngenetic polymorphism observed in natural populations, could best be\nexplained by the neutralist hypothesis (Kimura 1977,\n1994). Selectionists countered that natural selection was also capable\nof explaining the molecular data. In recent years, the controversy has\nsubsided somewhat, without a clear victory for either side. Most\nbiologists believe that some molecular variants are indeed neutral,\nthough fewer than were claimed by the original neutralists. \n\nMigration into or out of a population is the fourth and final factor\nthat can affect its genetic composition. Obviously, if immigrants are\ngenetically different from the population they are entering, this will\ncause the population's genetic composition to be altered. The\nevolutionary importance of migration stems from the fact that many\nspecies are composed of a number of distinct subpopulations, largely\nisolated from each other but connected by occasional migration. (For\nan extreme example of population subdivision, think of ant colonies.)\nMigration between subpopulations gives rise to gene flow, which acts\nas a sort of ‘glue’, limiting the extent to which\nsubpopulations can diverge from each other genetically. \n\nThe simplest model for analysing migration assumes that a given\npopulation receives a number of migrants each generation, but sends\nout no emigrants. Suppose the frequency of the A1\nallele in the resident population is p, and the frequency of\nthe A1 allele among the migrants arriving in the\npopulation is pm. The proportion of\nmigrants coming into the population each generation is m\n(i.e. as a proportion of the resident population.) So post-migration,\nthe frequency of the A1 allele in the population\nis: \n\nThe change in gene frequency across generations is therefore: \n\nTherefore, migration will increase the frequency of the\nA1 allele if pm >\np, decrease its frequency if p >\npm, and leave its frequency unchanged if\np = pm. It is then a\nstraightforward matter to derive an equation giving the gene frequency\nin generation t as a function of its initial frequency and\nthe rate of migration. The equation is: \n\nwhere p0 is the initial frequency of the\nA1 allele in the population, i.e. before any\nmigration has taken place.  Since the expression (1 −\nm)t tends towards zero as t\ngrows large, it is easy to see that equilibrium is reached when\npt = pm,\ni.e. when the gene frequency of the migrants equals the gene frequency\nof the resident population. \n\nThis simple model assumes that migration is the only factor affecting\ngene frequency at the locus, but this is unlikely to be the case. So\nit is necessary to consider how migration will interact with\nselection, drift and mutation. A balance between migration and\nselection can lead to the maintenance of a deleterious allele in a\npopulation, in a manner closely analogous to mutation-selection\nbalance, discussed above. The interaction between migration and drift\nis especially interesting. We have seen that drift can lead the\nseparate subpopulations of a species to diverge\ngenetically. Migration opposes this trend—it is a homogenising\nforce that tends to make subpopulations more alike. Mathematical\nmodels suggest that that even a fairly small rate of migration will be\nsufficient to prevent the subpopulations of a species from diverging\ngenetically. Some theorists have used this to argue against the\nevolutionary importance of group selection, on the grounds that\ngenetic differences between groups, which are essential for group\nselection to operate, are unlikely to persist in the face of\nmigration. \n\nRecall that the Hardy-Weinberg law, the starting point for most\npopulation-genetic analysis, was derived under the assumption of\nrandom mating. But departures from random mating are actually quite\ncommon.  Organisms may tend to choose mates who are similar to them\nphenotypically or genotypically—a mating system known as\n‘positive assortment’. Alternatively, organisms may choose\nmates dissimilar to them—‘negative assortment’.\nAnother type of departure from random mating is inbreeding, or\npreferentially mating with relatives. \n\nAnalysing the consequences of non-random mating is quite complicated,\nbut some conclusions are fairly easily seen. Firstly and most\nimportantly, non-random mating does not in itself affect gene\nfrequencies (so is not an evolutionary ‘force’ on a par\nwith selection, mutation, migration and drift); rather, it affects\ngenotype frequencies. To appreciate this point, note that the gene\nfrequency of a population, at the zygotic stage, is equal to the gene\nfrequency in the pool of successful gametes from which the zygotes are\nformed. The pattern of mating simply determines the way in which\nhaploid gametes are ‘packaged’ into diploid zygotes. Thus\nif a random mating population suddenly starts to mate non-randomly,\nthis will have no effect on gene frequencies. \n\nSecondly, positive assortative mating will tend to decrease the\nproportion of heterozygotes in the population, thus increasing the\ngenotypic variance. To see this, consider again a single locus with\ntwo alleles, A1 and A2, with\nfrequencies p and q in a given population. Initially\nthe population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so the proportion of\nA1A2 heterozygotes is\n2pq. If the population then starts to mate\ncompletely assortatively, i.e. mating only occurs between organisms of\nidentical genotype, it is obvious that the proportion of heterozygotes\nmust decline. For A1A1 ×\nA1A1 and\nA2A2 ×\nA2A2 matings will produce no\nheterozygotes; and only half the progeny of\nA1A2 ×\nA1A2 matings will be\nheterozygotic. So the proportion of heterozygotes in the second\ngeneration must be less than 2pq. Conversely,\nnegative assortment will tend to increase the proportion of\nheterozygotes from what it would be under Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium. \n\nWhat about inbreeding? In general, inbreeding will tend to increase\nthe homozygosity of a population, like positive assortment. The reason\nfor this is obvious—relatives tend to be more genotypically\nsimilar than randomly chosen members of the population. In the\nmajority of species, including the human species, inbreeding has\nnegative effects on organismic fitness—a phenomenon known as\n‘inbreeding depression’. The explanation for this is that\ndeleterious alleles often tend to be recessive, so have no phenotypic\neffect when found in heterozygotes. Inbreeding reduces the proportion\nof heterozygotes, making recessive alleles more likely to be found in\nhomozygotes where their negative phenotypic effects become\napparent. The converse phenomenon—‘hybrid vigour’\nresulting from outbreeding—is widely utilised by animal and\nplant breeders. \n\nSo far, our exposition has dealt with gene frequency change at a\nsingle locus, which is the simplest sort of population-genetic\nanalysis. However, in practice it is unlikely that an organism's\nfitness will depend on its single-locus genotype, so there is a limit\non the extent to which single-locus models can illuminate the\nevolutionary process. The aim of two-locus (and more generally,\nmulti-locus) models is to track changes in gene frequency at more than\none locus simultaneously. Such models are invariably more complicated\nthat their single-locus counterparts, but achieve greater realism. \n\nThe simplest two-locus model assumes two autosomal loci, A\nand B, each with two alleles, A1 and\nA2, B1 and\nB2 respectively. Thus there are four types of\nhaploid gamete in the\npopulation—A1B1,\nA1B2,\nA2B1 and\nA2B2—whose frequencies\nwe will denote by x1, x2,\nx3 and x4 respectively. (Note\nthat the xi are not allele\nfrequencies; in the two-locus case, we cannot equate ‘gamete\nfrequency’ with ‘allelic frequency’, as is possible\nfor a single locus.) Diploid organisms are formed by the fusion of two\ngametes, as before. Thus there are ten possible diploid genotypes in\nthe population—found by taking each gamete type in combination\nwith every other. \n\nIn the one-locus case, we saw that in a large randomly mating\npopulation, there is a simple relationship between the frequencies of\nthe gamete types and of the zygotic genotypes that they form. In the\ntwo-locus case, the same relationship holds. Thus for example, the\nfrequency of the A1B1 /\nA1B1 genotype will be\n(x1)2; the frequency of the\nA1B1 /\nA2B1 genotype will be\n2x1x3, and so-on. (This can be\nestablished rigorously with an argument based on random sampling of\ngametes, analogous to the argument used in the one-locus case.) The\nfirst aspect of the Hardy-Weinberg law—genotypic frequencies\ngiven by the square of the array of gametic\nfrequencies—therefore transposes neatly to the two-locus\ncase. However, the second aspect of the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw—stable genotypic frequencies after one round of random\nmating—does not generally apply in the two-locus case, as we\nwill see. \n\nA key concept in two-locus population genetics is that of\nlinkage, or lack of independence between the two loci. To\nunderstand linkage, consider the set of gametes produced by an\norganism of the A1B1 /\nA2B2 genotype, i.e. a double\nheterozygote. If the two loci are unlinked, then the\ncomposition of this set will be {¼\nA1B1, ¼\nA1B2, ¼\nA2B1, ¼\nA2B2}, i.e. all four gamete\ntypes will be equally represented. (We are presuming that Mendel's\nfirst law holds at both loci.) So unlinked loci are\nindependent—which allele a gamete has at the A locus\ntells us nothing about which allele it has at the B\nlocus. The opposite extreme is perfect linkage. If the two loci are\nperfectly linked, then the set of gametes produced by the\nA1B1 /\nA2B2 double heterozygote has\nthe composition {½\nA1B1, ½\nA2B2}; this means that if a\ngamete receives the A1 allele at the A\nlocus, it necessarily receives the B1 allele at\nthe B locus and vice versa. \n\nIn physical terms, perfect linkage means that the A and\nB loci are located close together on the same chromosome; the\nalleles at the two loci are thus inherited as a single unit. Unlinked\nloci are either on different chromosomes, or on the same chromosome\nbut separated by a considerable distance, hence likely to be broken up\nby recombination.  Where the loci are on the same chromosome, perfect\nlinkage and complete lack of linkage are two ends of a continuum. The\ndegree of linkage is measured by the recombination fraction\nr, where 0 ≤ r ≤ ½. The composition of\nthe set of gametes produced by an organism of the\nA1B1 /\nA2B2 genotype can be written\nin terms of r, as follows: \n\nIt is easy to see that r = ½ means that the loci are\nunlinked, so all four gamete types are produced in equal proportion,\nwhile r = 0 means that they are perfectly linked. \n\nIn a two-locus model, the gametic (and therefore genotypic)\nfrequencies need not be constant across generations, even in the\nabsence of selection, mutation, migration and drift, unlike in the\none-locus case. (Though allelic frequencies will of course\nbe constant, in the absence of any evolutionary forces.) It is\npossible to write recurrence equations for the gamete frequencies, as\na function of their frequencies in the previous generation plus the\nrecombination fraction. The equations are: \n\n(See Ewens 1969 or Edwards 2000 for an explicit derivation of these\nequations.) \n\nFrom the recurrence equations, it is easy to see that gametic (and\nthus genotypic) frequencies will be stable across generations, i.e.\nxi′ =\nxi for each i, under either of\ntwo conditions: (i) r = 0, or (ii)\nx2x3 −\nx1x4 = 0. Condition (i) means\nthat the two loci are perfectly linked, and thus in effect behaving as\none locus; condition (ii) means that the two loci are in\n‘linkage equilibrium’, which means that the alleles at the\nA-locus are in random association with the alleles at the\nB-locus. More precisely, linkage equilibrium means that the\npopulation-wide frequency of the\nAiBi gamete\nis equal to the frequency of the Ai\nallele multiplied by the frequency of the\nBi allele. \n\nAn important result in two-locus theory shows that, given random\nmating, the quantity (x2x3\n− x1x4) will decrease\nevery generation until it reaches zero—at which point the\ngenotype frequencies will be in equilibrium. So a population initially\nin linkage disequilibrium will approach linkage equilibrium over a\nnumber of generations. The rate of approach depends on the value of\nr, the recombination fraction. Note the contrast with the\none-locus case, where just one round of random mating is sufficient to\nbring the genotype frequencies into equilibrium. \n\nThe basic models of classical population genetics, expounded in the\nprevious sections, have been around for nearly a century; they derive\nfrom the work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright in the 1920s. Modern\npopulation genetics has built on this theoretical edifice in a number\nof ways, most notably by integrating the theory with data from\nmolecular biology. Advances in molecular biology have produced an\nenormous supply of data on the genetic variability of actual\npopulations, which has enabled a link to be forged between abstract\npopulation-genetic models and empirical data. This is not in itself a\nnew development: the selectionist-neutralist controversy of the 1960s,\nmentioned above, was fuelled by the then-new data on protein\npolymorphism in fruit-fly populations (see Lewontin and Hubby\n1966). More recently, extensive data sets on variation at the DNA\nrather than the protein level have become available; this has led to\nthe rise of ‘molecular population genetics’ and an\nassociated set of ideas known as ‘coalescent theory’ (see\nWakeley 2006). Unlike traditional population-genetic analysis, which\ntries to determine how a given population will evolve in the future,\ncoalescent theory tries to reconstruct the ancestral state of a\npopulation from its current state, based on the idea that all the\ngenes in a population ultimately derive from a single common\nancestor. Coalescent theory underpins much contemporary research in\npopulation genetics. \n\nThe status of population genetics in contemporary biology is an\ninteresting issue. Despite its centrality to evolutionary theory, and\nits historical importance, population genetics is not without its\ncritics. Some argue that population geneticists have devoted too much\nenergy to developing theoretical models, often with great mathematical\ningenuity, and too little to actually testing the models against\nempirical data (Wade 2005). Others argue that population-genetic\nmodels are usually too idealized to shed any real light on the\nevolutionary process, and are limited in what they can teach us about\nphenotypic evolution (Pigliucci 2008). Still others have argued that,\nhistorically, population genetics has had a relatively minor impact on\nthe actual practice of most evolutionary biologists, despite the\nlip-service often paid to it (Lewontin 1980). However, not all\nbiologists accept these criticisms. Thus the geneticist Michael Lynch\n(2007), for example, has recently written that “nothing in\nbiology makes sense except in the light of population genetics”,\nin a reference to Dobzhanksy's famous dictum; see Bromham (2009) and\nPigliucci (2008) for discussion. \n\nPopulation-genetic models of evolution have also been criticised on\nthe grounds that few phenotypic traits are controlled by genotype at a\nsingle locus, or even two or three loci. (Multi-locus\npopulation-genetic models do exist, but they tend to be extremely\ncomplicated.) There is an alternative body of theory, known as\nquantitative genetics, which deals with so-called 'polygenic' or\n'continuous' traits, such as height, which are thought to be affected\nby genes at many different loci in the genome, rather than just one or\ntwo; see Falconer (1995) for a good introduction. Quantitative\ngenetics employs a quite different methodology from population\ngenetics. The latter, as we have seen, aims to track gene and genotype\nfrequencies across generations. By contrast, quantitative genetics\ndoes not directly deal with gene frequencies; the aim is to track the\nphenotype distribution, or moments of the distribution such as the\nmean or the variance, across generations. Though widely used by animal\nand plant breeders, quantitative genetics is usually regarded as a\nless fundamental body of theory than population genetics, given its\n'phenotypic' orientation, and plays less of a role in evolutionary\ntheorising. Nonetheless, the relationship between population and\nquantitative genetics is essentially harmonious. \n\nA different criticism of the population-genetic approach to evolution\nis that it ignores embryological development; this criticism really\napplies to the evolutionary theory of the ‘modern\nsynthesis’ era more generally, which had population genetics at\nits core. As we have seen, population-genetic reasoning assumes that\nan organism's genes somehow affect its phenotype, and thus its\nfitness, but it is silent about the details of how genes actually\nbuild organisms, i.e. about embryology. The founders of the modern\nsynthesis treated embryology as a ‘black box’, the details\nof which could be ignored for the purposes of evolutionary theory;\ntheir focus was on the transmission of genes across generations, not\nthe process by which genes make organisms. This strategy was perfectly\nreasonable, given how little was understood about development at the\ntime. In recent years, great strides have been made in molecular\ndevelopmental genetics, which has renewed hopes of integrating the\nstudy of embryological development with evolutionary theory; hence the\nemerging new discipline of ‘evolutionary developmental\nbiology’, or evo-devo. It is sometimes argued that evo-devo is\nin tension with traditional neo-Darwinism (e.g. Amundson 2007), but it\nis more plausible to view them as compatible theories with different\nemphases. \n\nIn a recent book, Sean Carroll, a leading evo-devo researcher, argues\nthat population genetics no longer deserves pride-of-place on the\nevolutionary biology curriculum. He writes: “millions of biology\nstudents have been taught the view (from population genetics) that\n‘evolution is change in gene frequencies’ … This\nview forces the explanation toward mathematics and abstract\ndescriptions of genes, and away from butterflies and zebras, or\nAustralopithecines and Neanderthals” (2005 p. 294). A similar\nargument has been made by Massimo Pigliucci (2008). Carroll argues\nthat instead of defining evolution as ‘change in gene\nfrequencies’, we should define it as ‘change in\ndevelopment’, in recognition of the fact that most morphological\nevolution is brought about through mutations that affect organismic\ndevelopment. Carroll may be right that evo-devo makes for a more\naccessible introduction to evolutionary biology than population\ngenetics, and that an exclusive focus on gene frequency dynamics is\nnot the best way to understand all evolutionary phenomena; but\npopulation genetics arguably remains indispensable to a full\nunderstanding of the evolutionary process. \n\nDespite the criticisms levelled against it, population genetics has\nhad a major influence on our understanding of how evolution works. For\nexample, the well-known ‘gene's eye’ view of evolution,\ndeveloped by biologists such as G.C. Williams, W.D. Hamilton and\nRichard Dawkins, stems directly from population-genetic reasoning;\nindeed, important aspects of gene's eye thinking were already present\nin Fisher's writings (Okasha 2008). Proponents of the gene's eye view\nargue that genes are the real beneficiaries of the evolutionary\nprocess; genotypes and organisms are mere temporary\nmanifestations. Natural selection is at root a matter of competition\nbetween gene lineages for greater representation in the gene pool;\ncreating organisms with adaptive features is a ‘strategy’\nthat genes have devised to secure their posterity (Dawkins 1976,\n1982). Gene's eye thinking has revolutionised many areas of\nevolutionary biology in the last thirty years, particularly in the\nfield of animal behaviour; but in many ways it is simply a colourful\ngloss on the conception of evolution implicit in the formalisms of\npopulation genetics. \n\nPopulation genetics raises a number of interesting philosophical\nissues. One such issue concerns the concept of the gene itself. As we\nhave seen, population genetics came into being in the 1920s and 1930s,\nlong before the molecular structure of genes had been discovered. In\nthese pre-molecular days, the gene was a theoretical entity,\npostulated in order to explain observed patterns of inheritance in\nbreeding experiments; what genes were made of, how they caused\nphenotypic changes, and how they were transmitted from parent to\noffspring were not known. Today we do know the answers to these\nquestions, thanks to the spectacular success of the molecular genetics\nushered in by Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA in\n1953. The gene has gone from being a theoretical entity to being\nsomething that can actually be manipulated in the laboratory. \n\nThe relationship between the gene of classical (pre-molecular)\ngenetics, and the gene of modern molecular genetics is a subtle and\nmuch discussed topic (Beurton, Falk and Rheinberger (eds.) 2000,\nGriffiths and Stotz 2006, Moss 2003). In molecular genetics,\n‘gene’ refers, more or less, to a stretch of DNA that\ncodes for a particular protein—so a gene is a unit of\nfunction. But in classical population genetics, ‘gene’\nrefers, more or less, to a portion of hereditary material that is\ninherited intact across generations—so a gene is a unit of\ntransmission, not a unit of function. In many cases, the two concepts\nof gene will pick out roughly the same entities—which has led\nsome philosophers to argue that classical genetics can be\n‘reduced’ to molecular genetics (Sarkar 1998). But it is\nclear that the two concepts do not have precisely the same extension;\nnot every molecular gene is a classical gene, nor vice-versa. Some\ntheorists go further than this, arguing that what molecular biology\nreally shows is that there are no such things as classical genes. \n\nWhatever one's view of this debate, it is striking that virtually all\nof the central concepts of population genetics were devised in the\npre-molecular era, when so little was known about what genes were; the\nbasic structure of population-genetic theory has changed little since\nthe days of Fisher, Haldane and Wright. This reflects the fact that\nthe empirical presuppositions of population-genetic models are really\nquite slim; the basic presupposition is simply the existence of\nhereditary particles which obey the Mendelian rules of transmission,\nand which somehow affect the phenotype. Therefore, even without\nknowing what these hereditary particles are made of, or how they exert\ntheir phenotypic effects, the early population geneticists were able\nto devise an impressive body of theory. That the theory continues to\nbe useful today illustrates the power of abstract models in\nscience. \n\nThis leads us to another facet of population genetics that has\nattracted philosophers' attention: the way in which abstract models,\nthat involve simplifying assumptions known to be false, can illuminate\nactual empirical phenomena. Idealized models of this sort play a\ncentral role in many sciences, including physics, economics and\nbiology, and raise interesting methodological issues. In particular,\nthere is often a trade-off between realism and tractability; the more\nrealistic a model the more complicated it becomes, which typically\nlimits its usefulness and its range of applicability. This general\nproblem and others like it have been extensively discussed in the\nphilosophical literature on modelling (e.g. Godfrey-Smith 2006,\nWeisberg 2006, Frigg and Hartmann 2006), and are related to population\ngenetics by Plutynski (2006). \n\nIt is clear that population genetics models rely on assumptions known\nto be false, and are subject to the realism / tractability\ntrade-off. The simplest population-genetic models assume random\nmating, non-overlapping generations, infinite population size, perfect\nMendelian segregation, frequency-independent genotype fitnesses, and\nthe absence of stochastic effects; it is very unlikely (and in the\ncase of the infinite population assumption, impossible) that any of\nthese assumptions hold true of any actual biological population. More\nrealistic models, that relax one of more of the above assumptions,\nhave been constructed, but they are invariably much harder to\nanalyze. It is an interesting historical question whether these\n‘standard’ population-genetic assumptions were originally\nmade because they simplified the mathematics, or because they were\nbelieved to be a reasonable approximation to reality, or both. This\nquestion is taken up by Morrison (2004) in relation to Fisher's early\npopulation-genetic work. \n\nAnother philosophical issue raised by population genetics is\nreductionism. It is often argued that the population-genetic view of\nevolution is inherently reductionistic, by both its critics and its\ndefenders. This is apparent from how population geneticists define\nevolution: change in gene frequency. Implicit in this definition is\nthe idea that evolutionary phenomena such as speciation, adaptive\nradiation, diversification, as well as phenotypic evolution, can\nultimately be reduced to gene frequency change. But do we really know\nthis to be true? Many biologists, particularly ‘whole\norganism’ biologists, are not convinced, and thus reject both\nthe population-genetic definition of evolution and the primacy\ntraditionally accorded to population genetics within evolutionary\nbiology (Pigliucci 2008). \n\nThis is a large question, and is related to the issues discussed in\nsection 4. The question can be usefully divided into two: (i) can\nmicroevolutionary processes explain all of evolution?; (ii) can all of\nmicro-evolution be reduced to population genetics?\n‘Microevolution’ refers to evolutionary changes that take\nplace within a given population, over relatively short periods of time\n(e.g. three hundred generations). These changes typically involve the\nsubstitution of a gene for its alleles, of exactly the sort modelled\nby population genetics. So over microevolutionary time-scales, we do\nnot typically expect to see extinction, speciation or major\nmorphological change — phenomena which are called\n‘macroevolutionary’. Many biologists believe that\nmacroevolution is simply ‘microevolution writ large’, but\nthis view is not universal. Authors such as Gould (2002) and Eldredge\n(1989), for example, have argued persuasively that macro-evolutionary\nphenomena are governed by autonomous dynamics, irreducible to a\nmicroevolutionary basis. Philosophical discussions of this issue\ninclude Sterelny (1996), Grantham (1995) and Okasha (2006). \n\nSetting aside the reducibility of macro to micro-evolution, there is\nstill the issue of whether an exclusively population-genetic approach\nto the latter is satisfactory. Some reasons for doubting this have\nbeen discussed already; they include the complexity of the\ngenotype-phenotype relation, the fact that population genetics treats\ndevelopment as a black-box, and the idealizing assumptions that its\nmodels rest on. Another point, not discussed above, is the fact that\npopulation genetics models are (deliberately) silent about\nthe causes of the fitness differences between genotypes whose\nconsequences they model (Sober 1984, Glymour 2006). For example, in\nthe simple one-locus model of section 3.1, nothing is said about why\nthe three genotypes leave different numbers of successful gametes. To\nfully understand evolution, the ecological factors that lead to these\nfitness differences must also be understood. While this is a valid\npoint, the most it shows is that an exclusively population-genetic\napproach cannot yield a complete understanding of the evolutionary\nprocess. This does not really threaten the traditional view that\npopulation genetics is fundamental to evolutionary theory. \n\nA final suite of philosophical issues surrounding population genetics\nconcerns causation. Evolutionary biology is standardly thought of as a\nscience that yields causal explanations: it tells us the causes of\nparticular evolutionary phenomena (Okasha 2009). This causal dimension\nto evolutionary explanations is echoed in population genetics, where\nselection, mutation, migration and random drift are often described as\ncauses, or ‘forces’, which lead to gene frequency change\n(Sober 1984). The basis for this way of speaking is obvious enough. If\nthe frequency of gene A in a population increases from one generation\nto another, and if the population obeys the rules of Mendelian\ninheritance, then as a matter of logic one of three things must have\nhappened: organisms bearing gene A must have outreproduced organisms\nwithout (I); organisms bearing gene A must have migrated into the\npopulation (II); or there must have been mutation to gene A from one\nof its alleles (III). It is straightforward to verify that if none of\n(I)-(III) had happened, then the frequency of gene A would have been\nunchanged. Note that case (I) covers both selection and random drift,\ndepending on whether the A and non-A organisms reproduced\ndifferentially because of their genotypic difference, or by\nchance. \n\nDespite this argument, a number of philosophers have objected to the\nidea that evolutionary change can usefully be thought of as caused by\ndifferent factors, including natural selection (e.g. Matthen and Ariew\n2009, Walsh 2007). A variety of objections to this apparently innocent\nway of speaking have been levelled; some of these seem to be\nobjections to the metaphor of ‘evolutionary forces’ in\nparticular, while others turn on more general considerations to do\nwith causality and chance. The status of these objections is a\ncontroversial matter; see Reisman and Forber (2005), Brandon and\nRamsey (2007) and Sarkar (2011) for critical discussion. The\n‘non-causal’ (or ‘statistical’ as it is\nsometimes called) view of evolution is certainly a radical one, since\nthe idea that natural selection, in particular, is a potential cause\nof evolutionary change is virtually axiomatic in evolutionary biology,\nand routinely taught to students of the subject. As Millstein (2002)\npoints out, if one abandons this view it becomes hard to make sense of\nimportant episodes in the history of evolutionary biology, such as the\nselectionist / neutralist controversy. \n\nA full resolution of this issue cannot be attempted here; however, it\nis worth making one observation about the idea that mutation,\nselection, migration and drift should be regarded as\n‘causes’ of gene frequency change. There is an important\ndifference between drift on the other hand and the other three factors\non the other. This is because mutation, selection and migration are\ndirectional; they typically lead to a non-zero expected change in gene\nfrequencies (Rice 2004 p. 132). Random drift on the other hand is\nnon-directional; the expected change due to drift is by definition\nzero. As Rice (2004) points out, this means that mutation, selection\nand migration can each be represented by a vector field on the space\nof gene frequencies; their combined effects on the overall\nevolutionary change is then represented by ordinary vector\naddition. But drift cannot be treated this way, for it has a magnitude\nbut not a direction. In so far as proponents of the\n‘non-causal’ view are motivated by the oddity of regarding\ndrift, or chance, as a causal force, they have a point. However this\nline of argument is specific to random drift; it does not generalize\nto all the factors that affect gene frequency change. \n\nA related consideration is this. Suppose that instead of selection and\ndrift we use the expression ‘differential reproduction’ to\ncover both. This gives us three ‘factors’ that can lead to\ngene-frequency change in Mendelian populations: differential\nreproduction, mutation, and migration. It is straightforward to verify\nthat at least one of these three factors must have operated, if gene\nfrequencies in a population change. It seems unproblematic to regard\nthese three factors as causes of evolution. However, the idea that\ndifferential reproduction can be decomposed into two\n‘sub-causes’, namely natural selection and random drift,\nis much more dubious. When we speak of differential reproduction as\nbeing ‘due‘ to random drift, or chance, this is not\nhappily construed as a causal attribution. Rather, what we mean is\nthat the differential reproduction was not the result of systematic\ndifferences in how well the genotypes were adapted to the\nenvironment. \nTo conclude, it is unsurprising to find so much philosophical\ndiscussion of population genetics given its centrality to evolutionary\nbiology, a science which has long attracted the attention of\nphilosophers. The preceding discussion has focused on the most\nprominent debates surrounding population genetics in the recent\nphilosophical literature; but in fact population genetics is relevant,\nat least indirectly, to virtually all of the topics traditionally\ndiscussed by philosophers of evolutionary biology.
