He was renowned for his conversational\nbrilliance, his defence of liberalism and pluralism, his opposition to\npolitical extremism and intellectual fanaticism, and his accessible,\ncoruscating writings on people and ideas. His essay Two Concepts\nof Liberty (1958) contributed to a revival of interest in\npolitical theory in the English-speaking world, and remains one of the\nmost influential and widely discussed texts in that field: admirers\nand critics agree that Berlin’s distinction between positive and\nnegative liberty remains, for better or worse, a basic starting point\nfor discussions of the meaning and value of political freedom. Later\nin his life, the greater availability of his numerous essays began to\nprovoke increasing interest in his work, particularly in the idea of\nvalue pluralism; that Berlin’s articulation of value pluralism\ncontains many ambiguities and even obscurities has only encouraged\nfurther work on this rich and important topic by other\nphilosophers.\n\nIsaiah Berlin was born in 1909 in Riga (then capital of the Govenorate\nof Livonia in the Russian Empire, now capital of Latvia), the only\nsurviving child (after a stillborn daughter) of Mendel Berlin, a\nprosperous Russian Jewish timber merchant, and his wife Marie,\nnée Volshonok. In 1915 the family moved to the forestry town of\nAndreapol’ (then in Russia’s Pskov Govenorate),\nand in 1916 to Petrograd (now St Petersburg), where they remained\nthrough both the Russian Revolutions of 1917, which Isaiah would\nremember witnessing. Despite early harassment by the Bolsheviks, the\nfamily was permitted to return to Riga with Latvian citizenship in\n1920; from there they emigrated, in 1921, to Britain. They lived in\nand around London; Isaiah attended St Paul’s School and Corpus\nChristi College, Oxford, where he studied Greats (classical languages,\nancient history, and philosophy) and PPE (philosophy, politics and\neconomics), taking Firsts in both. In 1932 he was appointed to a\nlectureship at New College; the same year he became the first Jew to\nbe elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls, considered one of the\nhighest accolades in British academic life. \nThroughout the 1930s Berlin was deeply involved in the development of\nwhat became known as Oxford philosophy, or ordinary language\nphilosophy; his friends and colleagues included J. L. Austin, A. J.\nAyer and Stuart Hampshire, all of whom met regularly (with others) in\nBerlin’s rooms to discuss philosophy. However, he also evinced\nan early interest in a more historical approach to philosophy, and in\nsocial and political theory, reflected in his lectures and reviews of\nthe 1930s, as well as in his intellectual biography of Karl Marx\n(1939), still in print, in its fifth edition (2013), over eighty years\nlater. \nDuring the Second World War Berlin served in British Information\nServices in New York City (1940–2) and at the British Embassy in\nWashington, DC (1942–6), where he was responsible for drafting\nweekly reports on the American political scene. For four months in\n1945–6 he visited the Soviet Union: his meetings there with\nsurviving but persecuted members of the Russian intelligentsia,\nparticularly the poets Anna Akhmatova and Boris Pasternak, reinforced\nhis staunch opposition to Communism, and had a formative influence on\nhis future intellectual agenda. After the war he returned to Oxford.\nAlthough he continued to teach and write on philosophy throughout the\nlater 1940s and into the early 1950s, his interests had shifted to the\nhistory of ideas, particularly Russian ideas, Marxist and other\nsocialist theories, and the Enlightenment and its critics. He also\nbegan to publish widely-read articles on contemporary political and\ncultural trends, political ideology, and the internal workings of the\nSoviet Union. In 1950, election to a research fellowship at All Souls\nallowed him to devote himself more fully to his historical, political\nand literary interests, which lay well outside the mainstream of\nphilosophy as it was then practised and taught at Oxford. He was,\nhowever, one of the first of the founding generation of Oxford\nphilosophers to make regular visits to American universities, and\nplayed an important part in spreading ‘Oxford philosophy’\nto the USA. \nIn 1957, a year after he had married Aline Halban (née de\nGunzbourg), Berlin was elected Chichele Professor of Social and\nPolitical Theory at Oxford (his inaugural lecture, delivered in 1958,\nwas Two Concepts of Liberty). Later in 1957 he was knighted.\nHe resigned his chair in 1967, the year after becoming founding\nPresident of Wolfson College, Oxford (which he essentially created),\nretiring in 1975. In his later years he hoped to write a major work on\nthe history of European Romanticism, but this hope was unfulfilled.\nFrom 1966 to 1971 he was also a visiting Professor of Humanities at\nthe City University of New York, and he served as President of the\nBritish Academy from 1974 to 1978. Collections of his writings, edited\nby Henry Hardy (sometimes with a co-editor), began appearing in 1978:\nthere are, to date, fourteen such volumes (plus new editions of four\nworks published previously by Berlin), as well as an anthology,\nThe Proper Study of Mankind, and a four-volume edition of his\nletters. Berlin received the Agnelli, Erasmus and Lippincott Prizes\nfor his work on the history of ideas, and the Jerusalem Prize for his\nlifelong defence of civil liberties, as well as numerous honorary\ndegrees. He died in 1997. \nAn early influence on Berlin was a waning British Idealism, as\nexpounded by T. H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet and F. H. Bradley. While\nan undergraduate, Berlin was converted to the Realism of G. E. Moore\nand John Cook Wilson. By the time he began teaching philosophy he had\njoined a new generation of rebellious empiricists, some of whom (most\nnotably A. J. Ayer) embraced the logical positivist doctrines of the\nVienna Circle and Wittgenstein’s earlier writings. Although\nBerlin was always sceptical towards logical positivism, its suspicion\nof metaphysical claims and its preoccupation with the nature and\nauthority of knowledge strongly influenced his early philosophical\nenquiries. These, combined with his historical bent, led him back to\nthe study of earlier British empiricists, particularly Berkeley and\nHume, on whom he lectured in the 1930s and late 1940s, and about whom\nhe contemplated writing books (which never materialised). \nBerlin was also influenced by Kant and his successors. His first\nphilosophical mentor was an obscure Russian Jewish Menshevik\némigré named Solomon Rachmilevich, who had studied\nphilosophy at several German universities, and who introduced Berlin\nto the great ideological quarrels of Russian history, as well as to\nthe history of German philosophy since Kant. Later, at Oxford, R. G.\nCollingwood fostered Berlin’s interest in the history of ideas,\nintroducing him in particular to such founders of historicism as\nGiambattista Vico and J. G. Herder. Collingwood also reinforced\nBerlin’s belief – heavily influenced by Kant – in\nthe importance to human life of the basic concepts and categories in\nterms of which human beings organise and analyse their experience (see\nfurther 2.1 and note 2). \nWhile working on his biography of Marx in the mid 1930s, Berlin came\nacross the works of two Russian thinkers who would be important\ninfluences on his political and historical outlook. One of these was\nAlexander Herzen, who became a hero, and to whom Berlin would\nsometimes attribute many of his own beliefs about history, politics\nand ethics. The other was the Russian Marxist publicist and historian\nof philosophy G. V. Plekhanov. Despite his opposition to Marxism,\nBerlin admired and praised Plekhanov both as a man and as a historian\nof ideas. It was initially by reading Plekhanov’s writings that\nBerlin became interested in the naturalistic, empiricist and\nmaterialist thinkers of the Enlightenment, as well as their Idealist\nand historicist critics. Both Herzen and Plekhanov fuelled\nBerlin’s absorption in the political debates of nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century Russian liberals and radicals of various\nstripes, which in turn informed his concern with both the philosophy\nof history and the ethics of political action. \nDuring the Second World War, separated from his Oxford philosophical\nbrethren, and exposed to political action, Berlin began to drift away\nfrom his early philosophical concerns. His doubts were encouraged by a\nmeeting with the Harvard logician H. M. Sheffer, who asserted that\ngenuine increase in knowledge was possible only in such hybrid\nsubfields of philosophy as logic and psychology. His meeting with\nSheffer led Berlin to realise that he lacked the passion and the\nbelief in his own ability to continue pursuing pure philosophy. He\nconcluded that as a professional philosopher (as he then understood\nthat role) he would make no original contributions, and would end his\nlife knowing no more than he did when he began. He therefore\ndetermined to switch to the history of ideas, in which (he believed)\noriginality was less essential, and which would allow him to learn\nmore than he already knew. Berlin’s approach to the history of\nideas would, however, remain deeply informed by his philosophical\npersona, as well as by his political beliefs. His historical work was,\nin effect, the practice of philosophy in a historical key. \nBy the early 1950s Berlin’s central beliefs had crystallised\nfrom the confluence of his philosophical preoccupations, historical\nstudies, and political and moral commitments and anxieties; and his\nmajor ideas were either already fully formed, or developing. Such\nessays of the late 1950s as Two Concepts of Liberty served as\nthe occasion for a synthesis and solidification of his thoughts.\nBerlin had always been a liberal; but from the early 1950s the defence\nof liberalism became central to his intellectual concerns. This\ndefence was, characteristically, closely related to his moral beliefs\nand to his preoccupation with the nature and role of values in human\nlife. In the early 1960s Berlin’s focus moved from the more\npolitical concerns that occupied him in the 1950s to an examination of\nthe nature of the humanities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s he was\nworking on the history of ideas, and from the mid 1960s nearly all of\nhis writings took the form of essays in this field, particularly on\nthe Romantic and reactionary critics of the Enlightenment. In the\nfinal decades of his life Berlin continued to refine and re-articulate\nhis ideas, and particularly his formulation of pluralism; but his\ncourse was set, and he appears to have been little affected by later\nintellectual developments. \nBerlin’s conception of philosophy was shaped by his early\nexposure to, and rejection of, both Idealism and logical \n positivism.[1]\nWith the former he associated an excessively exalted view of\nphilosophy as the ‘queen of the sciences’, capable of\nestablishing fundamental, necessary, absolute, universal truths. With\nthe latter he associated the reductionist and deflationary view of\nphilosophy as, at best, a handmaiden to the sciences, and at worst a\nsign of intellectual immaturity bred of scientistic confusion and\ncredulity. \nBerlin’s approach combined a sceptical empiricism with\nneo-Kantianism to offer a defence of philosophy. Like Vico and Wilhelm\nDilthey, as well as neo-Kantians such as Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, Berlin insisted on the fundamental difference between the\nsciences and the humanities. He classed philosophy among the\nhumanities, but even there its status was unique. Those working in\nother fields aimed to discover authoritative methods for acquiring\nknowledge of the subjects to which they were devoted. Philosophy,\nhowever, was for Berlin concerned with questions which not only could\nnot at present be answered, but for which no clearly proper method of\ndiscovering an answer was known (see e.g. ‘The Purpose of\nPhilosophy’ in 1978b and 2000a). \nIn the case of non-philosophical questions, even if the answer is\nunknown, the means for discovering the answer is known, or accepted,\nby most people. Thus questions of empirical fact can be answered by\nobservation. Other questions can be answered deductively, by referring\nto established rules: this is the case, for example, with mathematics,\ngrammar and formal logic. For example, even if we do not know the\nsolution to a difficult mathematical problem, we do know the rules and\ntechniques that should lead us to the answer.  \nAccording to Berlin, philosophy concerns itself with questions of a\nspecial, distinctive character. To such questions not only are the\nanswers not known, but neither are the means for arriving at answers,\nor the standards of judgement by which to evaluate a suggested answer.\nThus the questions ‘How long does it take to drive from\nx to y?’ or ‘What is the cube root of\n729?’ are not philosophical; while ‘What is time?’\nor ‘What is a number?’ are. ‘What is the purpose of\nhuman life?’ or ‘Are all men brothers?’ are\nphilosophical questions, while ‘Do most of such-and-such a group\nof men think of one another as brothers?’ or ‘What did\nLuther believe was the purpose of life?’ are not.  \nBerlin related this view to Kant’s distinction between matters\nof fact and those conceptual structures and categories that we use to\nmake sense of facts. Philosophy, being concerned with questions that\narise from our attempts to make sense of our experiences, involves\nconsideration of the concepts and categories through which experience\nis perceived, organised and explained.  \nWhile Kant saw these organising categories as fixed and universal,\nBerlin believed that they are, to different degrees, varying,\ntransient or malleable. ‘All our categories are, in theory,\nsubject to change’ (2002b, 144, note 1). No categories are\nwholly prior to, or independent of, experience, even though in\npractice some of them are pragmatically fixed, whether by the world or\nby our minds or both. Rather, the ideas in terms of which we make\nsense of the world are closely tied up with our experiences: they\nshape those experiences, and are shaped by them, and as experience\nvaries from one time and place to another, so do basic\n concepts.[2]\n Recognition of the basic concepts and categories of human experience\ndiffers both from the acquisition of empirical information and from\ndeductive reasoning, for the categories are logically prior to,\npresupposed by, both. \nPhilosophy, then, is the study of the ‘thought-spectacles’\nthrough which we view the world; and since at least some of these\nchange over time, at least some philosophy is necessarily historical.\nBecause these categories are so important to every aspect of our\nexperience, philosophy – even if it is always tentative and\noften seems abstract and esoteric – is a crucially important\nactivity, which responds to the vital, ineradicable human need to\ndescribe and explain the world of experience.  \nBerlin insisted on philosophy’s social usefulness, however\nindirect and\n unobtrusive.[3]\n By bringing to light often subconscious presuppositions and models,\nand scrutinising their validity, philosophy identifies errors and\nconfusions that lead to misunderstanding, distort experience, and thus\ndo real harm. Because philosophy calls commonly accepted assumptions\ninto question, it is inherently subversive, opposed to all orthodoxy,\nand often troubling; but this is inseparable from what makes\nphilosophy valuable, and indeed indispensable, as well as liberating.\nPhilosophy’s goal, Berlin concluded, was ‘to assist men to\nunderstand themselves and thus operate in the open, and not wildly, in\nthe dark’ (1978b, 14). \nPerhaps the most important work Berlin did in ‘pure’\nphilosophy, in the light of his later ideas, concerned ‘logical\n translation.’[4]\n In his essay of that title (reprinted in 1978b), Berlin criticised\nthe assumption that all statements, to be genuine and meaningful, or\nto claim correctness, must be capable of being translated into a\nsingle, ‘good’ type of proposition, and asserted that the\nideal of a single proper type of proposition was illusory and\nmisleading. He identified two different, opposed approaches based on\nthis erroneous assumption. One was the ‘deflationary’\napproach, which sought to assimilate all propositions to one true\ntype. Thus, phenomenalism sought to translate all statements into\nassertions about immediately perceived sense data. The other was the\n‘inflationary’ approach, which posited entities\ncorresponding to all statements, thus ‘creating’ or\nasserting the existence of things that didn’t exist at all. Both\nof these errors stemmed from a demand for a ‘forcible\nassimilation’ of all propositions to a single type. Berlin\nsuggested that such a demand was based, not on a true perception of\nreality, but rather on a psychological need for certainty, uniformity\nand simplicity, as well as what he termed the ‘Ionian\nFallacy’, the assumption that everything is made out of, or can\nbe reduced to or understood in terms of, one and the same substance or\n type.[5] \nBerlin insisted that there is no single criterion of meaningfulness,\nno absolutely incorrigible type of knowledge. The quest for certainty\nwas self-defeating: to restrict oneself to saying only that which\ncould be said without any doubt or fear of being mistaken was to\nsentence oneself to silence. To say anything about the world requires\nbringing in something other than immediate experience: \nAt the heart of Berlin’s philosophy was an awareness of the\nenormous variety and complexity of reality, which we can only begin to\ncomprehend: the many strands that make up human experience are\n‘too many, too minute, too fleeting, too blurred at the edges\n[to be integrated into a total picture of experience]. They\ncriss-cross and penetrate each other at many levels simultaneously,\nand the attempt to prise them apart […] and pin them down, and\nclassify them, and fit them into their specific compartments, turns\nout to be impracticable’ (1978b, 156). \nThese two closely related propositions – that absolute certainty\nis an impossible ideal (Berlin once wrote that, if his work displayed\nany ‘single tendency’, it was a ‘distrust of all\nclaims to the possession of incorrigible knowledge about issues of\nfact or principle in any sphere of human behaviour’: 1978a, x),\nand that not everything can or should be reduced or related to a\nsingle ideal, model, theory or standard – might be considered\nthe centrepieces of Berlin’s philosophy. They are central to his\nview of language and knowledge; they are equally important to his\nethics and his philosophy of the humanities. Also central to these\ndifferent facets of his thought was Berlin’s emphasis on the\nimportance, and indeed priority, of particular things as objects of\nknowledge and of individual people as moral subjects. \nBerlin’s individualism, the influence on him of neo-Kantianism,\nand what one scholar (Allen 1998) has called his anti-Procrusteanism\n– his opposition to attempts dogmatically and inappropriately to\nimpose standards or models on aspects of human experience which they\ndon’t fit – shaped his view of what he usually referred to\nas the ‘humanities’ (sometimes as ‘humane\nstudies’) and their relationship to the (natural) sciences. By\n‘humanities’ he meant all disciplines concerned with the\nstudy of human conduct and experience – thus encompassing many\nso-called ‘social sciences’ as well as the fields of study\ntraditionally classed as ‘humanities’ (see note 1).  \nBerlin criticised the positivist view of the sciences as the\nparadigmatic form of knowledge, which the humanities should measure\nthemselves by and seek to emulate. He argued that the humanities\ndiffered fundamentally from the sciences both in the nature of their\nsubject matter (as Vico and Dilthey had maintained), and in the sort\nof knowledge that they sought (as Rickert insisted). As a result,\ndifferent methods, standards and goals were appropriate to each. \nMost obviously, the humanities study the world that human beings\ncreate for themselves and inhabit, while the sciences study the\nphysical world of nature. Why should this make a difference to the way\nthey are studied? One answer is that the two worlds are fundamentally\ndifferent in themselves. But Berlin preferred the argument that the\nhuman and natural worlds must be studied differently because of the\ndiffering relationship between the observer or thinker and the object\nof study. We study nature from without, culture from within. In the\nhumanities the scholar’s own ways of thinking, the fabric of his\nor her life, every facet of his or her experience is part of the\nobject of study. The sciences, on the other hand, aim to understand\nnature objectively and dispassionately. The scientist must take as\nlittle for granted as possible, preferring hard evidence to\n‘common sense’ when they diverge. But in the humanities\none cannot act in this manner: to study human life, it is necessary to\nbegin from our understanding of other human beings, of what it is to\nhave motives and feelings. Such understanding is based on our own\nexperience, which in turn necessarily involves certain\n‘common-sense’ assumptions, which we use to fit our\nexperience into patterns that make it explicable and comprehensible.\nThese patterns may be more or less accurate; and we can judge their\naccuracy by seeing how well they fit experience as we know it. But we\ncannot divest ourselves entirely of the assumptions that underlie\nthem. (The human world can also itself be a legitimate subject of\nscientific study, of course, but only incompletely, by bracketing off\nwhat makes it distinctive. Cf. note 7.) \nBerlin asserted that the humanities also differed from the sciences in\nthat the former were concerned with understanding the particulars of\nhuman life in and of themselves, while the sciences sought to\nestablish general laws which could explain whole classes of phenomena.\nThe sciences are concerned with types, the humanities with\nindividuals. Scientists concentrate on similarities and look for\nregularities; at least some practitioners of the humanities –\nhistorians, in particular – are interested in differences. To be\na good historian requires a ‘concentrated interest in particular\nevents or persons or situations as such, and not as instances of a\ngeneralisation’ (1978b, 180). The humanities should not aim to\nemulate the sciences by seeking laws to explain or predict human\nactions, but should concern themselves with understanding every\nparticular human phenomenon in its uniqueness. In the case of a\nscience we think it more rational to put our trust in general laws\nthan in specific phenomena; in the case of the humanities, the\nopposite is true. If someone claims to have witnessed a phenomenon\nthat contradicts well-established laws of science, we seek an\nexplanation that will reconcile that perception with science; if none\nis possible, we may conclude that the witness is deceived. In the case\nof history we do not usually do this: we look at particular phenomena\nand seek to explain them in\n themselves.[6]\n There are, Berlin claimed, ‘more ways than one to defy\nreality’. It is unscientific to ‘defy, for no good logical\nor empirical reason, established hypotheses and laws’. But it is\nunhistorical, on the other hand, to ‘ignore or twist one’s\nview of particular events, persons, predicaments in the name of laws,\ntheories, principles derived from other fields, logical, ethical,\nmetaphysical, scientific, which the nature of the medium renders\ninapplicable’ (1978b, 185).  \nBerlin emphasised the importance to a sense of history of the idea of\nits ‘one-directional’ flow (ibid., 144). This sense of\nhistorical reality makes it seem not merely inaccurate, but\nimplausible, and indeed ridiculous, to suggest, for example, that\nHamlet was written in the court of Genghis Khan (ibid., 142,\n175). The historical sense involves, not knowledge of what happened\n– this is acquired by empirical means – but a sense of\nwhat is plausible and implausible, coherent and incoherent, in\naccounting for human action (1978b, 183). There is no a priori\nshortcut to such knowledge. Historical thinking is much more like the\noperation of common sense, involving the weaving together of various\nlogically independent concepts and propositions, and bringing them to\nbear on a particular situation as best we can, than like the\napplication of laws or formulae. The ability to do this is a knack\n– judgement, or a sense of reality (1978b, 152).  \nUnderstanding of history is based on knowledge of humanity, which is\nderived from direct experience, consisting not merely of\nintrospection, but of interaction with others. This is the basis for\nVerstehen, or imaginative understanding: the\n‘recognition of a given piece of behaviour as being part and\nparcel of a pattern of activity which we can follow, […] and\nwhich we describe in terms of the general laws which cannot possibly\nall be rendered explicit (still less organised into a system), but\nwithout which the texture of normal human life – social or\npersonal – is not conceivable’ (1978b, 168). The challenge\nof history is the need for the individual to go beyond his or her own\nexperience, which is the basis of his or her ability to conceive of\nhuman behaviour. We must reconstruct the past not only in terms of our\nown concepts and categories, but in terms of how past events must have\nlooked to those who participated in them. The practice of history thus\nrequires gaining knowledge of what consciousness was like for other\npersons, in situations other than our own, through an\n‘imaginative projection of ourselves into the past’ in\norder to ‘capture concepts and categories that differ from those\nof the investigator by means of concepts and categories that cannot\nbut be his own. […] Without a capacity for empathy and\nimagination beyond any required by a physicist, there is no vision of\neither past or present, neither of others nor of ourselves’\n(1978b, 177–8). Historical reconstruction and explanation\ninvolves ‘entering into’ the motives, principles, thoughts\nand feelings of others; it is based on a capacity for knowing like\nthat of knowing someone’s character or face (1978b,\n173–5). \nThe sort of historical understanding that Berlin sought to depict was\n‘related to moral and aesthetic analysis’. It conceives of\nhuman beings not merely as organisms in space, but as ‘active\nbeings, pursuing ends, shaping their own and others’ lives,\nfeeling, reflecting, imagining, creating, in constant interaction and\nintercommunication with other human beings; in short, engaged in all\nthe forms of experience that we understand because we share in them,\nand do not view them purely as external observers’ (1978b,\n173–4). For Berlin, the philosophy of history was tied not only\nto epistemology, but to ethics. The best-known and most controversial\nfacet of his writings on the relationship of history to the sciences\nwas his discussion of the problem of free will and determinism, which\nin his hands took on a distinctly moral\n cast.[7]\n In Historical Inevitability Berlin radically questioned\ndeterminism (the view that human beings do not possess free will, that\ntheir actions and indeed thoughts are predetermined by forces beyond\ntheir control) and historical inevitability (the view that all that\noccurs in the course of history does so because it must, that history\npursues a particular course which cannot be altered, and which can be\ndiscovered, understood and described through laws of historical\ndevelopment). In particular he mounted a critique of the belief that\nhistory is controlled by impersonal forces beyond human control. \nBerlin did not assert that determinism was untrue, but rather that to\naccept it required a radical transformation of the language and\nconcepts we use to think about human life – especially a\nrejection of the idea of individual moral responsibility. To praise or\nblame individuals, to hold them responsible, is to assume that they\nhave some control over their actions, and could have chosen\ndifferently. If individuals are wholly determined by unalterable\nforces, it makes no more sense to praise or blame them for their\nactions than it would to blame someone for being ill, or praise\nsomeone for obeying the laws of gravity. Indeed, Berlin further\nsuggested that acceptance of determinism – that is, the complete\nabandonment of the concept of human free will – would lead to\nthe collapse of all meaningful rational activity as we know it. \nThis is an extension into the realm of the understanding of human\nbeings of Kant’s ‘Copernican’ revolution (to use\nKant’s own epithet). Kant gave full recognition, for the first\ntime, to the inescapable contribution made by our minds to grasping\nthe non-human world; Berlin mirrors this move with a scarcely less\nfundamental claim of his own, that there are equally inescapable ways\nin which, at any given time or at all times known to us, we cannot but\nthink of and understand the behaviour and experience of our own\nkind. \nHere ‘freedom’ means the centrally important concept of\nfree will. We cannot help experiencing human behaviour as causally\nundetermined and freely chosen. That we have free will is not a\nscientific hypothesis, but a precondition of our experience of\nhumanity, to abandon which would leave our world-view in ruins.\n(Whether this entails that determinism is false is a further question,\nwhich Berlin does not fully confront; nor do we pursue it here.) \nBerlin also insisted that belief in historical inevitability was\ninspired by psychological needs, and not required by known facts; and\nthat it had dangerous moral and political consequences, justifying\nsuffering and undermining respect for the ‘losers’ of\nhistory. A belief in historical inevitability served as an\n‘alibi’ for evading responsibility and blame, and for\ncommitting enormities in the name of necessity or reason. It provided\nan excuse both for acting badly and for not acting at\n all.[8] \nBerlin’s insistence on the importance of the idea of free will,\nand the incompatibility of consistent and thoroughgoing determinism\nwith our basic sense of ourselves and our experience as human beings,\nwas closely tied to his liberalism and pluralism, with their emphasis\non the importance, necessity and dignity of individual choice. This\ninsistence involved him in a number of debates with other philosophers\nand historians in the 1950s and early 1960s, and helped to provoke a\nspate of writing in the English-speaking world on the philosophy of\nhistory, which might otherwise have languished. \nAlso controversial was Berlin’s claim that the writing and\ncontemplation of history necessarily involves moral evaluation. He did\nnot, as some of his critics charged (e.g. Carr 1961), mean this as a\ncall for moralising on the part of historians. Berlin’s argument\nwas that, first, our normal way of regarding human beings as agents\nwho make choices necessarily involves moral evaluation; to eliminate\nmoral evaluation from our thinking completely would be to alter\nradically the way that we view the world. Nor would such an alteration\ntruly move beyond moral evaluation; for strenuous attempts to be\nmorally neutral are themselves motivated by a moral commitment to the\nideal of impartiality. Furthermore, given the place of moral\nevaluation in ordinary human thought and speech, an account couched in\nmorally neutral terms will fail accurately to reflect the experience\nor self-perception of the historical actors in question. This last\nargument was particularly important to Berlin, who believed that\nhistorical writing should reflect and convey past actors’\nunderstanding of their situation, so as to provide explanations of\nwhy, thinking as they did, they acted as they did. He therefore\ninsisted that the historian must attend to the moral claims and\nperceptions underlying historical events. \nBerlin’s emphasis on the subversive, liberating, anti-orthodox\nnature of philosophy was accompanied by a particular interest in\nmoments of radical change in the history of ideas, and in original and\noften marginal thinkers, while his emphasis on the practical\nconsequences of ideas led him to focus on those transformations and\nchallenges which, in his view, had wrought particularly decisive\nchanges in people’s moral and political consciousness, and in\ntheir behaviour. Finally, his concern with the conflicts of his own\nday led him to concentrate mainly on modern intellectual history, and\nto trace the emergence of certain ideas that he regarded as\nparticularly important, for good or ill, in the contemporary\n world.[9] \nMany of Berlin’s writings on the history of ideas were connected\nto his philosophical work, and to one another, in their examination of\ncertain overarching themes. These included the relationship between\nthe sciences and the humanities; the philosophy of history; the\norigins of nationalism and socialism; the revolt against what Berlin\ncalled ‘monism’ in general, and scientism in particular,\nin the early nineteenth century and thereafter; and the vicissitudes\nof ideas of liberty. \nThe narrative of the history of ideas that Berlin developed and\nrefined over the course of his works began with the Enlightenment, and\nfocused on the initial rebellion against what he regarded as that\nepoch’s dominant\n assumptions.[10] \nIn Berlin’s account, the thinkers of the Enlightenment believed\nhuman beings to be naturally either benevolent or malleable. This\ncreated a tension within Enlightenment thought between the view that\nnature dictates human ends, and the view that nature provides more or\nless neutral material, to be moulded rationally and benevolently\n(ultimately the same thing) by conscious human interventions –\neducation, legislation, rewards and punishment, the whole apparatus of\n society.[11]\n Berlin also attributed to the Enlightenment the beliefs that all\nhuman problems, both of knowledge and ethics, can be resolved through\nthe discovery and application of the proper method (generally reason,\nthe conception of which was based on the methods of the sciences,\nparticularly Newtonian physics); and that genuine human goods and\ninterests were ultimately compatible, so that conflict, like\nwickedness, was the result of ignorance, misunderstanding, or\ndeception and oppression practiced by corrupt authorities\n(particularly the\n Church).[12] \nBerlin saw the school (or schools) of thought that began to emerge\nshortly before the French Revolution, and became ascendant during and\nafter it, as profoundly antagonistic towards the Enlightenment. He was\nmost interested in German Romanticism, but also looked at other\nmembers of the larger tendency he referred to as the\n ‘Counter-Enlightenment’.[13]\n Berlin’s account sometimes focused on a attack on the\nEnlightenment’s benevolent and optimistic liberalism by\nnationalists and reactionaries; sometimes on the rejection of moral\nand cultural universalism by champions of cultural particularism and\npluralism; and sometimes on the critique of naturalism and scientism\nby thinkers who advocated a historicist view of society as essentially\ndynamic, shaped not by the laws of nature, but by the unlawlike,\nsenseless contingencies of history.  \nBerlin has been viewed both as an adherent of the Enlightenment who\nshowed a fascination, whether eccentric or admirable, with its\ncritics; and as a critic and even opponent of the Enlightenment, who\nfrankly admired its enemies. There is some truth in both of these\npictures, neither of which does justice to the complexity of\nBerlin’s views. Berlin admired many of the thinkers of the\nEnlightenment, and explicitly regarded himself as ‘on their\nside’ (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70); he believed that much of what they\nhad accomplished had been for the good; and, as an empiricist, he\nrecognised them as part of the same philosophical tradition to which\nhe belonged. But he also believed that they were wrong, and sometimes\ndangerously so, about some of the most important questions of society,\nmorality and politics. He regarded their psychological and historical\nvision as shallow, excessively uniform, and naive; and he traced to\nthe Enlightenment a technocratic, managerial view of human beings and\npolitical problems to which he was profoundly opposed, and which, in\nthe late 1940s and early 1950s, he regarded as one of the gravest\ndangers facing the world. \nBerlin regarded the Enlightenment’s critics as in many ways\ndangerous and deluded. He attacked or dismissed their metaphysical\nbeliefs, particularly the philosophies of history of Hegel and his\nsuccessors. He was also wary of the aesthetic approach to politics\nthat many Romantics had practised and fostered. And, while\nappreciative of some elements in the Romantic conception of liberty,\nhe saw Romanticism’s influence on the development of the idea of\nliberty as largely perverting. But at the same time he thought the\nEnlightenment’s opponents had pointed to many important truths\nthat the Enlightenment had neglected or denied, both negative (the\npower of unreason, and particularly the darker passions, in human\naffairs) and positive (the inherent value of variety and of personal\nvirtues such as integrity and sincerity, and the centrality to human\nnature and dignity of the capacity for choice). Romanticism rebelled\nin particular against the constricting order imposed by reason, and\nchampioned the human will. Berlin was sympathetic to this stance, but\nalso believed that the Romantics had gone too far both in their\nprotests and in their celebrations. He remained committed to the goal\nof understanding the world so as to be able to ‘act rationally\nin it and on it’ (1990, 2). His interest in critics of the\nEnlightenment reflected both curiosity about the views of those with\nwhom he often disagreed, and a desire to learn from the most acute\nchallenges to a progressive, ‘liberal\n rationalist’[14]\n (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70) or ‘rational-liberal’ (Berlin\n2006a, 104) position, so as to appreciate, and repair, its\nshortcomings and vulnerabilities. Berlin’s own articulation of\nliberalism and pluralism attempted to integrate a defence of the\nEnlightenment’s legacy with the insights of its critics.  \nThe republication of Berlin’s numerous essays in thematic\ncollections, beginning with Four Essays on Liberty (1969) and\nVico and Herder (1976), and continuing at an increased pace\nfrom 1978 under the general (and mostly specific) editorship of Henry\nHardy, served to highlight as a central dimension of Berlin’s\nthought his advocacy of the doctrine of value pluralism (which he\nhimself called pluralism). Increasingly from the early 1990s value\npluralism has come to be seen by many as Berlin’s ‘master\nidea’, and has become the most discussed, most admired and most\ncontroversial of his ideas. \nValue pluralism was indeed at the centre of Berlin’s ethical\nthought; but there is more to that thought than value pluralism alone.\nBerlin defined ethical thought as ‘the systematic examination of\nthe relations of human beings to one another, the conceptions,\ninterests and ideals from which human ways of treating one another\nspring, and the systems of value on which such ends of life are\nbased’. These systems of value are ‘beliefs about how life\nshould be lived, what men and women should be and do’ (1990,\n1–2). Just as Berlin’s conception of philosophy was based\non a belief about the important role of concepts and categories in\npeople’s lives, his conception of ethics was founded on his\nbelief in the importance of normative or ethical concepts and\ncategories – especially\n values.[15] \nBerlin did not set out a systematic theory about the nature of values,\nand so his view must be gleaned from his writings on the history of\nideas. His remarks on the status and origins of values are ambiguous,\nthough not necessarily irreconcilable with one another. He seems,\nfirst, to endorse the Romantic view – which he traces to Kant\n(although he also sometimes attributes it to Hume) – that values\nare not discovered ‘out there’, as\n‘ingredients’ in the universe, not deduced or derived from\nnature. Rather, they are human creations, and derive their authority\nfrom this fact. From this followed a theory of ethics according to\nwhich individual human beings are the most morally valuable things, so\nthat the worth of ideals and actions should be judged in relation to\nthe meanings and impact they have for and on such individuals. This\nview underlay Berlin’s passionate conviction of the error of\nlooking to theories rather than human realities, of the evil of\nsacrificing living human beings to abstractions (which he found\nemphasised in Herzen); it also related to Berlin’s theory of\nliberty, and his belief in liberty’s special importance. \nAt other times Berlin seems to advance what amounts almost to a theory\nof natural law, albeit in minimalist, empirical dress. In such cases\nhe suggests that there are certain unvarying features of human beings,\nas they have been constituted throughout recorded history, that make\ncertain values important, or even necessary, to them. Values, then,\nwould be beliefs about what it is good to be and do – about what\nsort of life, what sort of character, what sort of actions, what state\nof being it is desirable, given human nature, for us to aspire to.\nThis view of the origin of values also comes into play in\nBerlin’s defence of the value of liberty, when he suggests that\nthe freedom to think, to enquire, to imagine and above all to choose,\nwithout constraint or fear, is valuable because human beings need such\nmental freedom; to deny it to them is a denial of their nature,\nimposes an intolerable burden, and at the extreme entirely dehumanises\nthem. \nIn an attempt to reconcile these two strands, one might say that, for\nBerlin, the values that humans create are rooted in the nature of the\nbeings who pursue them. But this is simply to move the question back a\nstep, for the question then immediately arises: Is this human nature\nnatural and fixed, or created and altered over time through conscious\nor unconscious human action? Berlin’s answer (see e.g. 1990,\n319–23) comes in two parts. He rejects the idea of a fixed,\nfully specified human nature, regarding natural essences with\nsuspicion. Yet he does believe (however under-theorised, unsystematic\nand undogmatic this belief may be) in boundaries to, and requirements\nmade by, human nature as we know it. This common human nature may not\nbe fully specifiable in terms of a list of unvarying characteristics;\nbut, while many characteristics may vary from individual to individual\nor culture to culture, there is a limit on the variation – just\nas the human face may vary greatly from person to person in many of\nits properties, while remaining recognisably human, but at the same\ntime it is possible to distinguish between a human and a non-human\nface, even if the difference between them cannot be reduced to a\nformula. Indeed, at the core of Berlin’s thought was his\ninsistence on the importance of humanity, or the distinctively human,\nboth as a quasi-Kantian category and as a moral reality, which does\nnot need to be reduced to an unvarying essence in order to have\ndescriptive and normative force. \nThere is a related ambiguity about whether values are objective or\nsubjective. One might conclude from Berlin’s view of values as\nhuman inventions that he would regard them as subjective. Yet he\ninsisted, on the contrary, that values are objective, even going so\nfar as to label his position ‘objective pluralism’ (2015,\n210; 2000b, 245, note 1). Yet it is unclear what exactly he meant by\nthis, or how this belief relates to his view of values as human\ncreations. There are at least two accounts of the objectivity of\nvalues that can be plausibly attributed to Berlin. The first is that\nvalues are ‘objective’ in that they are simply facts about\nthe people who hold them – so that, for instance, liberty is an\n‘objective’ value because I value it, and would feel\nfrustrated and miserable without at any rate a minimal amount of it.\nThe second is that the belief in or pursuit of certain values is the\nresult of objective realities of human nature – so that, for\ninstance, liberty is an ‘objective’ value because certain\nfacts about human nature make liberty good and desirable for human\nbeings. These views are not incompatible with one another, but they\nare distinct; and the latter provides a firmer basis for the minimal\nmoral universalism that Berlin espoused. \nFinally, Berlin insisted that each value is binding on human beings by\nvirtue of its own claims, in its own terms, and not in terms of some\nother value or goal, let alone the same value in all cases. This view\nwas one of the central tenets of Berlin’s pluralism. \nBerlin’s development and definition of pluralism both began\nnegatively, with the identification of the opposing position, which he\nusually referred to as ‘monism’, and sometimes as\n‘the Ionian fallacy’ or ‘the Platonic ideal’.\nHis definition of monism may be summarised as follows: \nWe have seen that Berlin denied that the first two of these\nassumptions are true. In his ethical pluralism he pushed these denials\nfurther, and added a forceful denial of the third assumption.\nAccording to Berlin’s pluralism, genuine values are many. They\nmay – and often do – come into conflict with one another.\nWhen two or more values clash, it is not because one or another has\nbeen misunderstood; nor can it be said, a priori, that any one value\nis always more important than another. Liberty can conflict with\nequality or with public order; mercy with justice; love with\nimpartiality and fairness; social and moral commitment with the\ndisinterested pursuit of truth or beauty (the latter two values,\ncontra Keats, may themselves be incompatible); knowledge with\nhappiness; spontaneity and free-spiritedness with dependability and\nresponsibility. Conflicts of values are ‘an intrinsic,\nirremovable element in human life’; ‘the notion of total\nhuman fulfilment is a […] chimera’. ‘These\ncollisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we\nare’; a world in which such conflicts are resolved is not the\nworld we know or understand (2002b, 213; 1990, 13). \nBerlin further asserted that values may be not only incompatible, but\nincommensurable. There has been considerable controversy over what he\nmeant by this, and whether his understanding of incommensurability was\neither correct or coherent. In speaking of the incommensurability of\nvalues, Berlin seems to have meant that there is no common measure, no\n‘common currency’ in terms of which the relative\nimportance of any two values can be established in the abstract. Thus\none basic implication of pluralism for ethics is the view that a\nquantitative approach to ethical questions (such as that envisaged by\nUtilitarianism) is impossible. In addition to denying the existence of\na common currency for comparison, or a governing principle (such as\nthe utility principle), value incommensurability holds that there is\nno general procedure for resolving value conflicts – there is\nnot, for example, a lexical priority rule (that is, no value always\nhas priority over another). \nBerlin based these assertions on empirical grounds – on\n‘the world that we encounter in ordinary experience’, in\nwhich ‘we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate,\nand claims equally absolute, the realisation of some of which must\ninevitably involve the sacrifice of others’ (2002b,\n213–14). Yet he also held that the doctrine of pluralism\nreflected logically necessary rather than contingent truths about the\nnature of human moral life and the values that are its ingredients.\nThe idea of a perfect whole or ultimate solution is not only\nunattainable in practice, but also conceptually incoherent. To avert\nor overcome conflicts between values once and for all would require\nthe transformation, which amounted to the abandonment, of those values\nthemselves. It is not clear that this logical point adds anything\nsignificant to the empirical point about human ends recorded in the\nlast quotation, but we do not pursue this doubt here. \nBerlin’s pluralism was not free-standing: it was modified and\nguided by other beliefs and commitments. One of these, discussed\nbelow, was liberalism. Another was humanism – the view that\nhuman beings are of primary importance, and that avoiding harm to\nhuman beings is the first moral priority (Aarsbergen-Ligtvoet 2006;\nCherniss and Hardy 2018). Berlin therefore held that, in navigating\nbetween conflicting values, ‘The first public obligation is to\navoid extremes of suffering.’ He insisted that moral collisions,\neven if unavoidable, can be softened, claims balanced, compromises\nreached. The goal should be the maintenance of a ‘precarious\nequilibrium’ that avoids, as far as possible, ‘desperate\nsituations’ and ‘intolerable choices’. Philosophy\nitself cannot tell us how to do this, though it can help by bringing\nto light the problem of moral conflict and all of its implications,\nand by weeding out false solutions. But in dealing with conflicts of\nvalues, ‘The concrete situation is almost everything’\n(1990, 18–19). \nOne of the main features of Berlin’s account of pluralism is the\nemphasis placed on the act of choosing between values. Pluralism holds\nthat, in many cases, there is no single right answer. Berlin used this\nas an argument for the importance of liberty (see note 25) – or,\nperhaps more precisely, an argument against the restriction of liberty\nin order to impose the ‘right’ solution by force. Berlin\nalso made a larger argument about making choices. Pluralism involves\nconflicts, and thus choices, not only between particular values in\nindividual cases, but between ways of life. While Berlin seems to\nsuggest that individuals have certain inherent traits – an\nindividual nature, or character, which cannot be wholly altered or\nobscured – he also insisted that they make decisions about who\nthey will be and what they will do. Choice is thus both an expression\nof an individual personality, and part of what makes that personality;\nit is essential to the human self. \nBerlin provided his own (inconsistent and somewhat peculiar)\ngenealogies of pluralism. He found the first rebellion against monism\neither in Machiavelli (1990, 7–9) or in Vico and Herder (2000a,\n8–11), who were also decisive figures in the first account. Yet\nhe acknowledged that Machiavelli wasn’t really a pluralist, but\na dualist; and other scholars have questioned his identification of\nVico and Herder as pluralists, when both avowed belief in a higher,\ndivine or mystical, unity behind variety. Other scholars have credited\nother figures in the history of philosophy, such as Aristotle, with\npluralism (Nussbaum 1986, Evans 1996). James Fitzjames Stephen\nadvanced something that looks very much like Berlin’s pluralism\n(Stephen 1873), though he allied it to a conservative critique of\nMill’s liberalism. \nIn Germany, Dilthey came close to pluralism, and Max Weber presented a\ndramatic, forceful picture of the tragic conflict between\nincommensurable values, belief systems and ways of life (Weber 1918,\nesp. 117, 126, 147–8, 151–3; cf. Weber 1904, esp.\n17–18). \nEthical pluralism first emerged under that name, however, in America,\ninspired by William James’s pluralistic view of the universe, as\nwell as his occasional gestures towards value pluralism (James 1891).\nJohn Dewey and the British theologian Hastings Rashdall both\napproximated pluralism in certain writings (Dewey 1908, Rashdall\n1907); but pluralism was apparently first proposed, under that name,\nand as a specifically ethical doctrine,\n in language strikingly similar to Berlin’s,\n by Sterling Lamprecht, a naturalist philosopher and scholar of Hobbes\nand Locke, in two articles (1920, 1921), as well as, somewhat later,\nby A. P. Brogan (1931). The dramatic similarities between not only\nBerlin’s and Lamprecht’s ideas, but also their language,\nmake it difficult to believe that Lamprecht was not an influence on\nBerlin. However, there is no independent evidence that Berlin knew\nLamprecht’s work; and Berlin’s tendency was more often to\ncredit his own ideas to others than to claim the work of others as his\nown. \nVersions of pluralism were also advocated by Berlin’s\ncontemporaries Raymond Aron, Stuart Hampshire, Reinhold Niebuhr and\nMichael Oakeshott (although Oakeshott seems to have attributed\nconflicts of values to a mistakenly reflective approach to ethical\nissues, and suggested that they could be overcome through relying on a\nmore habitual, less self-conscious, ethical approach: see Oakeshott\n1962, 1–36). \nSome of the elements of value pluralism are detectable in\nBerlin’s early essay ‘Some Procrustations’ (1930),\npublished while he was still an undergraduate at Oxford. This essay,\ndrawing on Aristotle, and focusing on literary and cultural criticism\nrather than philosophy proper, made the case for epistemological and\nmethodological, rather than ethical, pluralism. Berlin criticised the\nbelief in, and search for, a single method or theory, which could\nserve as a master key for understanding all experience. He insisted\nthat, on the contrary, different standards, values and methods of\nenquiry are appropriate for different activities, disciplines and\nfacets of life. In this can be seen the seeds of his later work on the\ndifferences between the sciences and the humanities, of his attacks on\nsystematic explanatory schemes, and of his value pluralism; but all\nthese ideas had yet to be developed or applied. \nBerlin was further nudged towards pluralism by discovering what he saw\nas a suggestion by Nicolas Malebranche that simplicity and goodness\nare incompatible (1680, e.g. 116–17, 128–30); this struck\nhim at the time as an ‘odd interesting view!’, but it\nstuck, and he became convinced of its central and pregnant truth\n(2004,\n 72).[16]\n Berlin set out his basic account of what he would later label monism\nin his biography of Marx (1939, 37), but did not explicitly criticise\nit or set out a pluralistic alternative to it, although his lecture\n‘Utilitarianism’ (1937b), dating from the late 1930s, does\nset out an argument that anticipates his later claim that values are\nincommensurable. The basic crux of pluralism, and Berlin’s\nconnection of it to liberalism, is apparent in rough, telegraphic form\nin Berlin’s notes for his lecture ‘Democracy, Communism\nand the Individual’ (1949), and pluralism is also advanced in an\naside, though not under that name, in ‘Historical\nInevitability’ (1954: see 2000b, 151). Berlin referred to\npluralism and monism as basic, conflicting attitudes to life in 1955\n(Berlin et al. 1955, 504). But his use of the term and his explication\nof the concept did not fully come together, it appears, until Two\nConcepts of Liberty (1958; even then, his articulation of\npluralism is incomplete in the first draft of the essay). \nThereafter, variations on Berlin’s account of pluralism appear\nthroughout his writings on Romanticism. Late in his life, taking stock\nof his career, and trying to communicate what he felt to be his most\nimportant philosophical insights, Berlin increasingly devoted himself\nto the explicit articulation and refinement of pluralism as an ethical\ntheory. He had referred in a private letter of 1968 (Ignatieff 1998,\n246) to ‘the unavoidability of conflicting ends’ as his\none genuine discovery. He devoted the lecture he gave in accepting the\nAgnelli Prize in 1988, ‘The Pursuit of the Ideal’, to\nexplaining what pluralism meant, and this remains the most eloquent\nand concentrated summary of pluralism. Berlin also discussed pluralism\nin many interviews and printed exchanges with other scholars from the\n1970s onward, in an attempt to work through the conflicts,\ncontroversies and confusions to which his ideas gave rise; but many of\nthese resisted Berlin’s attempts at resolution, and continue to\nfigure in, and sometimes dominate, discussions of his work. \nSince the 1990s, pluralism has become the most widely and hotly\ndebated of Berlin’s ideas. This is due in part to Berlin’s\nwork, and in part to that of later philosophers who, as followers or\nallies of Berlin or independently, have also articulated and advanced\nvalue pluralism or similar\n positions.[17]\n Although pluralism achieved its current prominence in interpretations\nof Berlin’s work later in his life, it was identified earlier as\na key component in his thought by a few prescient readers. Two of\nthese readers advanced what remains one of the most common criticisms\nof Berlin’s pluralism: that it is indistinguishable from\nrelativism (Strauss 1961; Momigliano 1976; see MacCallum 1967a and\nKocis 1989 for other early\n critiques).[18] \nOne problem that has bedevilled the debate is a persistent failure to\ndefine the terms at issue with adequate clarity and precision.\nPluralism, of course, has been the subject of repeated definition by\nBerlin and others (the repetition not always serving a clarifying\npurpose). However, the term ‘relativism’ often remains\nunderanalysed in these discussions. Whether pluralism can be\ndistinguished from relativism depends largely on how relativism is\ndefined, as well as on how certain obscure or controversial components\nof pluralism are treated. It should also be noted that the question of\nwhether values are plural is logically distinct from the question of\nwhether they are objective, despite the frequent elision of the two\ntopics in the literature on this subject. \nOne way of defining relativism is as a form of subjectivism or moral\nirrationalism. This is how Berlin defined it in his attempts to refute\nthe charge of relativism brought against his pluralism. For Berlin,\nthe model of a relativist statement is ‘I like my coffee white,\nyou like yours black; that is simply the way it is; there is nothing\nto choose between us; I don’t understand how you can prefer\nblack coffee, and you cannot understand how I can prefer white; we\ncannot agree.’ Applied to ethics, this same relativist attitude\nmight lead its holder to say: ‘I like human sacrifice, and you\ndo not; our tastes, and traditions, simply differ.’ Pluralism,\non the other hand, as Berlin defines it, holds that understanding of\nmoral views is possible among all people (unless they are so alienated\nfrom normal human sentiments and beliefs as to be considered really\nderanged). Relativism, in Berlin’s definition, would make such\nmoral understanding impossible; while pluralism explains the\npossibility of (and acceptance of pluralism may facilitate) moral\ncommunication. \nAnother (related) way of differentiating pluralism and relativism,\nemployed by Berlin and others, holds that pluralism accepts a basic\n‘core’ of human values, and that these and other values\nadopted alongside them in a particular context fall within a\n‘common human horizon’. This ‘horizon’ sets\nlimits on what is morally permissible and desirable, while the\n‘core’ of shared or universal values allows us to reach\nagreement on at least some moral issues. This view rests on a belief\nin a basic, minimum, universal human nature beneath the widely diverse\nforms that human life and belief have taken across time and place. It\nmay also involve a belief in the existence of a specifically\n‘moral sense’ inherent in human beings. Berlin seems to\nhave believed in such a faculty, and linked it to empathy, but did not\ndevelop this view in his writings. \nYet another way of defining relativism is to view it as holding that\nthings have value only relative to particular situations or\noutlooks; nothing is intrinsically good – that is, valuable in\nand for itself. A slightly different way of putting this would be to\nmaintain that there are no such things as values that are always\nvalid; values are valid to different degrees in different\ncircumstances, but not others. For instance, liberty may be a leading\nvalue in one place at one time, but has a much lower status as a value\nat another. Here, again, Berlin’s pluralism seems opposed to\nrelativism, since it is committed to the belief that, for human\nbeings, at least some values are intrinsically rather than\ninstrumentally good, and that at least some values are universally\nvalid, even if others aren’t, and even if this universal\nvalidity isn’t recognised. Berlin admitted that liberty, for\ninstance, had historically been upheld as a pre-eminent ideal only by\na minority of human beings; yet he still held it to be a genuine value\nfor all human beings, everywhere, because of the way that human beings\nare constituted, and, so far as we know, will continue to be\nconstituted. Similarly, Steven Lukes has suggested that relativism\nseeks to avoid or dismiss moral conflict, to explain it away by\nholding that different values hold for different people\n(‘Liberalism for the liberals, cannibalism for the\ncannibals’: Lukes 2001b; cf. Hollis 1999, 36), and by denying\nthat the competing values may be, and often are, binding on all\npeople. Pluralism, on the other hand, sees conflicts of values as\noccurring both within, and across, cultures, and (at least in\nLukes’s formulation) maintains that custom or relatively valid\nbelief-systems or ways of life cannot be appealed to as ways of\novercoming value-conflict (Lukes 1989). This is not a position that\nBerlin explicitly advances; but his later writings suggest a sympathy\nfor it. \nBerlin’s own position seems to lie somewhere between this\nversion of relativism and Lukes’s proposal. He acknowledged that\ncultures are not monolithic or morally ‘rational’ (that\nis, conflicts of values are endemic within cultures), and denies that\ncultural traditions or norms can be invoked to dissipate or\nauthoritatively resolve conflicts between values (as Michael Oakeshott\nsuggested when he appealed to the ‘intimations’ of\ntradition as a way of resolving apparent conflicts generated by\nattempts at ‘rational’ action: see Oakeshott 1962,\n125–34; Oakeshott 1965). But Berlin did hold that, as an\nempirical matter, most individuals do make decisions about how to\nbalance, reconcile, or choose between competing values in light of\ntheir existing general commitments and visions of life, which are\nshaped (though not completely determined) by cultural tradition and\ncontext. Liberty may be a genuine, and important, good for human\nbeings in general; but how human beings decide to promote or actualise\nliberty in relation to a whole web of other values will differ between\ndifferent societies. \nYet the charge that pluralism is equivalent to relativism is not so\neasily refuted, given certain ambiguities in Berlin’s account.\nThese centre on the nature and origins of values, the related question\nof the role of cultural norms, and the meaning of\n‘incommensurability’.  \nAs stated above, Berlin held both that values are human creations, and\nthat they are ‘objective’. The foundation for this latter\nclaim is unclear in Berlin’s work. The claim that values are\nobjective in being founded on (or expressions of) and limited by\ncertain realities of human nature would seem to provide a defence\nagainst relativism, in holding that there is an underlying, shared\nhuman nature which makes at least some values non-relative. The\nargument that values are objective simply because they are pursued by\nhuman beings may seem to allow for relativism, if it makes the\nvalidity of values dependent on nothing but human preferences, and\nallows any values actually pursued by human beings (and, therefore,\nany practices adopted in pursuing those values) to claim\n validity.[19]\n But this is a reductio ad absurdum, to be deflected by\nadding two further considerations: how widespread aspirant universal\nvalues are; and whether they can be justified in terms of some\nrationally defensible conception of human welfare. \nOne of the knottiest dimensions of Berlin’s pluralism is the\nidea of incommensurability, which has led to diverging\ninterpretations. One can make a three-way distinction, between weak\nincommensurability, moderate incommensurability and radical\nincommensurability. Weak incommensurability is the view that values\ncannot be ranked quantitatively, but can be arranged in a qualitative\nhierarchy that applies consistently in all cases. Berlin goes further\nthan this, but it is not clear whether he presents a moderate or a\nradical version of incommensurability. The former holds that there is\nno single, ultimate scale or principle with which to measure values\n– no moral ‘slide-rule’ (2002b, 216) or universal\nunit of normative measurement. This view is certainly consistent with\nall that Berlin wrote from the 1930s onwards. Such a view does not\nnecessarily rule out making judgements between values on a\ncase-by-case basis: just because values can’t be compared or\nranked in terms of one master-value or formula, we can’t\nconclude that it is impossible to compare or deliberate between them\nat all, as we indeed do in actual cases. \nBerlin does sometimes offer more starkly dramatic accounts of\nincommensurability, which make it hard to rule out the more radical\ninterpretation of the concept, according to which incommensurability\nis more or less synonymous with incomparability. This interpretation\nstates that values cannot be compared at all, since there is no\n‘common currency’ in terms of which to compare them: each\nvalue, being sui generis, cannot be judged in relation to any\nother value, because there is nothing in relation to which both can be\njudged or measured. As a result, choices among values cannot be based\non (objectively valid) evaluative comparisons, but only on personal\npreference, or on an act of radical, arbitrary choice, which Berlin\nsometimes calls ‘plumping’. But plumping need not be a\ndisembodied, inexplicable act: it can draw, albeit subconsciously, on\na hinterland of moral understanding rooted in the moral experience of\nthe plumper and in his cultural tradition. \nA related question concerns the role of reason in moral deliberation.\nIf values are incommensurable, must all choices between conflicting\nvalues be ultimately subjective or irrational? If so, how does\npluralism differ from radical relativism and subjectivism? If not,\nhow, exactly, does moral reasoning work? How can we rationally make\nchoices between values when there is no system or unit of measurement\nthat can be used in making such deliberations? One possible answer to\nthe last question is to offer an account of practical, situational\nreasoning that is not quantitative or rule-based, but appeals to the\nmoral sense mentioned above. This is what Berlin suggests; but, once\nagain, he does not offer a systematic explanation of the nature of\nnon-systematic reason. (On incommensurability see Chang 1997 and\nCrowder 2002.)  \nIn the area of political philosophy, the most widespread controversy\nover pluralism concerns its relationship to liberalism. This debate\noverlaps with that regarding pluralism’s relationship to\nrelativism, to the extent that liberalism is regarded as resting on a\nbelief in certain universal values and fundamental human rights, a\nbelief which relativism undermines. However, there are some who\nmaintain that, while pluralism is distinct from, and preferable to,\nrelativism, it is nevertheless too radical, contested and subversive\nto be be depended on for a justification of liberalism (or,\nconversely, that liberalism is too universalistic or absolutist to be\nlinked to pluralism). The main proponent of this view, more\nresponsible than any other thinker for the emergence and wide\ndiscussion of this issue, is John Gray (see, especially, Gray 1995).\nGray asserts that pluralism is true, that pluralism undermines\nliberalism, and that therefore liberalism should be abandoned, at\nleast in its traditional role of a political philosophy claiming\nuniversal\n status.[20] \nGray’s case has spawned a vast literature, concerning both\nBerlin’s own treatment of the relationship between pluralism and\nliberalism in particular, and this issue in general. Some theorists\nhave agreed with Gray (Kekes, 1993, 1997); others have sought to show\nthat pluralism and liberalism are reconcilable, although this\nreconciliation may require modifications to both liberalism and\npluralism – modifications that are, however, justifiable, and\nindeed inherently desirable. The most extensive discussions to date\nare those by George Crowder and William Galston (Crowder 2002, 2004, 2019,\nGalston 2002,\n 2004).[21] \nBerlin himself was devoted both to pluralism and to liberalism, which\nhe saw not as related by logical entailment (though he sometimes comes\nclose to positing this: e.g. 2002b, 216; Jahanbegloo 1992, 44), but as\ninterconnected and harmonious. The version of pluralism he advanced\nwas distinctly liberal in its assumptions, aims and conclusions, just\nas his liberalism was distinctly pluralist. As Michael Walzer has\nremarked, Berlin’s pluralism is characterised by\n‘receptivity, generosity, and scepticism’, which are,\n‘if not liberal values, then qualities of mind that make it\n[…] likely that liberal values will be accepted’ (Galston\n2002, 60–1; Walzer 1995, 31).  \nBerlin’s best-known contribution to political theory is his\nessay on the distinction between positive and negative liberty. This\ndistinction is explained, and the vast literature on it summarised,\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia; the following therefore focuses only\non Berlin’s original argument, which has often been\nmisunderstood, in part because of his own ambiguities. It should be\nstressed that the essay in question is principally concerned with\npolitical liberty, not with what, late in life, he dubbed\n‘basic liberty’, which is freedom of choice (or free\nwill), without which any other kinds of liberty would be impossible:\nindeed, ‘which men cannot be without and remain men’ (A\n518; cf. UD 218, CTH2 309, and 2.4 above). \nIn Two Concepts of Liberty Berlin sought to explain the\ndifference between two (out of more than two hundred, he said)\ndifferent ways of thinking about political liberty. These, he said,\nhad run through modern thought, and were central to the ideological\nstruggles of his day. Berlin called these two conceptions of liberty\nnegative and\n positive.[22]\n Berlin’s treatment of these concepts was less than fully\neven-handed from the start: while he defined negative liberty fairly\nclearly and simply, he gave positive liberty two different basic\ndefinitions, from which still more distinct conceptions would branch\nout. Negative liberty Berlin initially defined as freedom\nfrom, that is, the absence of constraints on the agent imposed by\nother people. Positive liberty he defined both as freedom to,\nthat is, the ability (not just the opportunity) to pursue and achieve\nwilled goals; and also as autonomy or self-rule, as opposed to\ndependence on others. These are not the same. \nBerlin’s account was further complicated by combining conceptual\nanalysis with history. He associated negative liberty with the liberal\ntradition as it had emerged and developed in Britain and France from\nthe seventeenth century to the early nineteenth. He later regretted\nthat he had not made more of the evils that negative liberty had been\nused to justify, such as exploitation under laissez-faire capitalism;\nin Two Concepts, however, negative liberty is portrayed\nfavourably, and briefly. It is on positive liberty that Berlin\nfocused, since it was, he claimed, both a more ambiguous concept, and\none which had been subject to greater and more sinister\ntransformation, and ultimately perversion. \nBerlin traced positive liberty back to theories that focus on the\nautonomy, or capacity for self-rule, of the\n agent.[23]\n Of these, he found Rousseau’s theory of liberty particularly\ndangerous. For, in Berlin’s account, Rousseau had equated\nfreedom with self-rule, and self-rule with obedience to the so-called\n‘general will’. By this, Berlin alleged, Rousseau meant,\nessentially, the common or public interest – that is, what was\nbest for all citizens qua citizens. The general will was quite\nindependent of, and would often be at odds with, the selfish wills of\nindividuals, who, Rousseau charged, were often deluded as to their own\ngenuine interests.  \nThis view clashed with Berlin’s political and moral outlook in\ntwo ways. First, it posited the existence of a unique,\n‘true’ public interest, a single set of arrangements that\nwas best for all citizens, and was thus opposed to the main thrust of\npluralism. Second, it rested on a bogus transformation of the concept\nof the self. In his doctrine of the general will Rousseau moved from\nthe conventional and, Berlin insisted, correct view of the self as\nindividual to the self as citizen – which for Rousseau meant the\nindividual as member of a larger community, an individual whose\nidentity and well-being were exactly the same as those of the larger\ncommunity. Rousseau transformed the concept of the self’s will\nfrom what the empirical individual actually desires to what the\nindividual as citizen ought to desire, that is, what is in\nindividuals’ real best interest, whether they realise it or\nnot. \nFor Berlin, this transformation became more sinister still in the\nhands of Kant’s German disciples. Kant himself had identified\n‘positive’ freedom with autonomy, or self-determination,\nby the rational personality – the self freed from all that\nrenders it ‘heteronymous’ and irrational. Later German\nphilosophers influenced by Kant went further in identifying the\n‘self’ whose self-determination constitutes freedom with\nentities other than the individual. Freedom becomes a matter of\novercoming the poor, flawed, false, empirical self – what one\nappears to be and want – in order to realise one’s\n‘true’, ‘real’, ‘noumenal’ self.\nThis ‘true’ self may be identified with one’s best\nor true interests, either as an individual or as a member of a larger\ngroup or institution. Thus Fichte (who began as a radically\nindividualist liberal, only to become, later, an ardent, even\nhysterical, nationalist – an intellectual forefather of Fascism\nand even Nazism) came to equate freedom with the rule of the\n‘true’ self understood as the nation, or Volk. On\nthis view, the individual achieves freedom only through renunciation\nof his or her desires and beliefs as an individual and submersion in a\nlarger group. The ‘true’ self might also be identified\nwith a cause, an idea, or the dictates of rationality, as in the case\nof Hegel’s definition of liberty, which equated it with\nrecognition of, and obedience to, the laws of history as revealed by\nreason. Such theoretical shifts set the stage, for Berlin, for the\nideologies of the totalitarian movements of the twentieth century,\nboth Communist and Fascist–Nazi, which claimed to liberate\npeople by subjecting – and often sacrificing – them to\nlarger groups or principles. To do this was the greatest of political\nevils; and to do it in the name of freedom, a political principle that\nBerlin, as a genuine liberal, especially cherished, struck him as a\n‘strange […] reversal’ or ‘monstrous\nimpersonation’ (2002b, 198, 180). Against this, Berlin\nchampioned, as ‘truer and more humane’, negative liberty\nand an empirical view of the self. \nThis account is subject to serious and plausible objections, on both\nhistorical and conceptual grounds. But beyond the considerable debates\nconcerning the conceptual validity and historical accuracy of\nBerlin’s account (extensively documented in Harris 2002 and\nCrowder 2016), there is considerable misunderstanding of\nBerlin’s own attitudes to the concepts he discussed, and of the\ngoals of his lecture. Berlin has often been interpreted, not entirely\nunreasonably, as a staunch enemy of the concept of positive liberty.\nThis was simply false, and elides opposition to distortions of\npositive liberty with opposition to positive liberty itself. Berlin\nregarded both concepts of liberty as centring on valid claims about\nwhat is necessary and good for human beings; both negative and\npositive liberty were for him genuine values, which might in some\ncases clash, but in other cases could be combined and might even be\nmutually interdependent. Indeed, Berlin’s own earlier\narticulations of his political values included a notable component of\npositive liberty alongside negative liberty (see e.g. 2002b,\n336–44). What Berlin attacked were the many ways in which\npositive liberty had been used to justify the denial, betrayal or\nabandonment of both negative liberty and the undistorted forms of\npositive liberty itself. Berlin’s main targets were not positive\nliberty as such, but the metaphysical or psychological assumptions\nwhich, combined with the concept of positive liberty, had led to its\nperversion: monism, and a metaphysical or collective conception of the\nself. Two Concepts of Liberty, and Berlin’s liberalism,\nare therefore based not on championing negative liberty against\npositive liberty, but on advocating individualism, empiricism and\npluralism against collectivism, holism, metaphysical rationalism (cf.\nnote 14a) and monism. \nIn Berlin’s account, the main connection between pluralism and\nliberalism is the centrality of choice to both. His argument goes as\nfollows. The conflicts between values and ways of life that are the\nsubject matter of pluralism require people to make choices. These\nchoices are of the utmost importance, because they involve the most\nbasic and essential questions of human life – what one is to be\nand do. Those who have to make such choices are therefore likely to\ncare about them, and to want to be the ones to make them.\nFurthermore, the freedom and ability to make one’s own choices\nbetween conflicting values and possible lives is the crux of\none’s identity as a moral agent. (This step of the argument, it\nshould be noticed, does not strictly follow from pluralism itself; but\nit is an assumption central to Berlin’s moral individualism,\nwhich Berlin imports into his pluralism.) \nWhy might one deny individuals the opportunity to make choices for\nthemselves? One possible answer (though not the only one) is that\nindividuals may make the wrong choices, so that it is necessary to\ncoerce or manipulate them into choosing correctly. But pluralism holds\nthat, where there are conflicts between genuine values, there may be\nno single right choice – more than one choice may equally serve\ngenuine human values and interests, even if they also involve the\nsacrifice or violation of other values or interests that are neither\nmore nor less true and important. Similarly, there is no single ideal\nlife, no single model of how to think or behave or be, to which people\nshould attempt, or be brought, to conform. There are indeed chooseable\noptions that are beyond the pale from any humane viewpoint, and these\nmay reasonably be blocked off. But the limits of humanity should not\nbe confused with the limits of a particular perspective as against\nother reasonable possibilities that lie within the ‘human\nhorizon’. \nPluralism, then, for Berlin, both undermines one of the main\nrationales for violating freedom of choice, and corroborates the\nimportance and value of being able to make choices\n freely.[24]\n Some interpreters have argued that the high value that Berlin accords\nto the freedom to choose, while it rests in part on his pluralism,\nalso requires the addition of moral principles, ideals and assumptions\nexternal to pluralism (though this need not, contra John Gray, mean\nthat pluralism is incompatible with, or necessary undermines,\nliberalism). Others (such as George Crowder) have argued that\nBerlin’s liberalism can be deduced from his pluralism alone, though more recently Crowder has modified his view, now holding that pluralism justifies liberalism only under the historical conditions of modernity (2019, 105–12, 135–8, 221–2). \nAt the same time, while pluralism is a key ingredient in\nBerlin’s argument for the importance of liberty, it also\nmodifies and moderates his liberalism, and prevents Berlin from being\n(as many proponents of negative liberty in the twentieth century and\nafter have been) a dogmatic, unqualified classical liberal or\nlibertarian. Negative and positive liberty are both genuine values\nwhich must be balanced against each other; and political liberty of\nany sort is one value among many, with which it may conflict, and\nagainst which it needs to be weighed. Berlin was more sensitive than\nmany classical liberal or libertarian thinkers to the fact that\ngenuine liberty may conflict with genuine equality, or justice, or\npublic order, or security, or efficiency, or happiness, and therefore\nmust be balanced against, and sometimes sacrificed in favour of, other\nvalues. Berlin’s liberalism includes both a conservative or\npragmatic appreciation of the importance of maintaining a balance\nbetween different values, and a social-democratic appreciation of the\nneed to restrict liberty in some cases so as to promote equality and\njustice, and to protect the weak against victimisation by the strong\n(see 2002b, 214–15). Nevertheless Berlin remains a liberal in\nmaintaining that the preservation of a certain minimum of individual\nliberty is a political priority. He justifies this view by an appeal\nto an empiricist version of a natural law argument, writing of the\nexistence of ‘natural rights’ based on the way that human\nbeings are constituted, mentally or physically; to attempt to alter or\nlimit human life in certain ways is to block the desires, goals,\naspirations inherent in being human as we know it (1996, 90–2).\nTo deprive human beings of certain basic rights is to dehumanise them.\nWhile liberty should not be the only good pursued by society, and\nwhile it should not always trump other values, ethical pluralism lends\nit a special importance: for people must be free in order to allow for\nthe recognition and pursuit of all genuine human values. Society\nshould therefore make it a priority to provide the liberty necessary\nfor Millian ‘experiments in living’ and for the\nperpetuation of social and personal variety (see Berlin 2002b,\n218–51). \nSection VI of Two Concepts of Liberty is an ambivalent\ndiscussion of the ideals of national self-rule and ‘national\nliberation’, suggesting that these should not be identified with\nliberty, strictly speaking, but nevertheless reflect deep human needs\nfor belonging and recognition as members of a self-ruling group (see\nalso 2002a, 229). Berlin used the term ‘nationalism’\nsomewhat confusingly, to refer to two quite distinct, and morally very\ndifferent, phenomena. The first of these was what he also called\n‘national consciousness’, the sense of belonging, of\ncollective identity, of which Herder had written. The second was the\n‘inflamed’ form of this sentiment, which, feeding off of\nresentment, frustration and humiliation, became\n‘pathological’. Berlin was sympathetic to the former,\ncritical of the latter, but he recognised the relationship between the\ntwo, and was thus aware of the power and allure of nationalism. \nAlthough Berlin traced to Herder the insight that belonging, and the\nsense of self-expression that membership bestows, are basic human\nneeds, it seems unlikely that he would have had to learn this lesson\nfrom him. It is more probable that it was his own appreciation of\nthese needs that attracted him to that author in the first place. He\nwas sharply aware of the pain of humiliation and dependency, the\nhatefulness and hurtfulness of paternalistic rule. His individualism\nand emphasis on liberty were qualified not only by his awareness of\nthe extent to which we are social beings whose identities are partly\ndetermined by the way we are regarded by others (2002b, 201), but also\nby his understanding of the human need for a sense of belonging to a\ncommunity – an awareness sharpened, if not generated, by his own\nexperience of exile, as well as by the influence of his mother’s\npassionate\n Zionism.[25] \nApart from his better-known writings on liberty and pluralism,\nBerlin’s political thought centred on two interrelated topics:\nthe nature of political judgement, and the ethics of political action.\nBerlin addressed the former subject both directly and through his\nwritings on individual statesmen who exemplified different sorts of\nsuccessful political judgement (see the portraits collected in Berlin\n1980, and Hanley 2004).  \nBerlin disputed the idea that political judgement was a body of\nknowledge which could be reduced to rules. Political action should be\nbased on a ‘sense of reality’ founded on experience,\nempathetic understanding of others, sensitivity to the social and\npolitical environment, and personal judgement about what is true or\nuntrue, significant or trivial, alterable or unalterable, effective or\nuseless, etc. Such judgement necessarily involves personal instinct\nand flair, ‘strokes of unanalysable genius’. In the realm\nof political action, laws are few and skill is all (1996, 53).  \nLike the study of history, political judgement involves reaching an\nunderstanding of the unique set of characteristics that constitute a\nparticular individual, atmosphere, state of affairs or event (ibid.,\n56). This requires a capacity for integrating ‘a vast amalgam of\nconstantly changing, multicoloured, evanescent, perpetually\noverlapping data’, a ‘direct, almost sensuous contact with\nthe relevant data’, and ‘an acute sense of what fits with\nwhat, what springs from what, what leads to what; […] what the\nresult is likely to be in a concrete situation of the interplay of\nhuman beings and impersonal forces’ (ibid., 57–8). Such a\nsense is qualitative rather than quantitative, specific rather than\ngeneral, for all that it may be built on past experience. \nThe faculty that allows for such judgement is, Berlin insists, not\nmetaphysical, but ‘ordinary, empirical, and\nquasi-aesthetic’ (ibid., 57). This sense is distinct from any\nsort of ethical sense; it could be possessed or lacked by both\nvirtuous and villainous politicians. Recognition of the importance of\nthis sense of political reality should not discourage the spirit of\nscientific enquiry or serve as an excuse for obscurantism. But it\nshould discourage the attempt to transform political action into the\napplication of scientific principles, and government into technocratic\n administration.[26] \nBerlin intended his writings on political judgement as a warning to\npolitical theorists not to overreach themselves. Political theory can\ndo much good in helping us to make sense of politics. But political\naction is a practical matter, which should not, and cannot, be founded\non, or dictated by, general principles established through abstract\ntheorising.  \nBerlin’s writings on political judgement, activity and\nleadership are of a piece with his larger epistemological project: to\nbring to light the tension between abstract or a priori theory and\ndirect perception; and to warn against the dangers of the former and\nassert the importance of the latter. While he acknowledged that it was\nimpossible to think without the use of analogies and metaphors, that\nthought necessarily involves generalisation and comparison, he warned\nthat it was important to be cautious, self-conscious and critical in\nthe use of general models and analogies (see 1978b, 207–8).\nThese writings also reassert the message of the youthful essay\n‘Some Procrustations’ (1930, discussed in 4.3 above): that\nthe same rules should not be automatically applied to every facet of\nhuman life. Rationality consists of the application, not of a single\ntechnique or set of rules, but of those methods that have proven to\nwork best in each particular field or situation. This view of\npolitical judgement also relates to Berlin’s attempt to\nvindicate the importance of individual agency and personality, by\ninsisting that political judgement is a personal quality, and\neffective political activity a matter of personal consideration,\ndecision and action rather than (or at least in addition to)\nimpersonal administration or the deployment of institutional\nmachinery. \nWhile Berlin emphasised the place of questions about the proper ends\nof political action in the subject matter of political theory, he also\nrecognised the importance of discussions of the proper means to\nemploy, and the relationship between these and the ends at which they\naim. Berlin did not treat this question – the question of\npolitical ethics – directly in his work; nor did he offer simple\nor confident answers to the perennial questions of the morality of\npolitical action. Nevertheless, he did advance some theses about this\nbranch of morality; and these were among his most heartfelt\npronouncements. \nBerlin’s primary mouthpiece for these messages was Alexander\nHerzen, the nineteenth-century Russian radical\n publicist.[27]\n The words of Herzen that Berlin repeated most insistently were those\ncondemning the sacrifice of human beings on the altar of abstractions,\nthe subordination of the realities of individual happiness or\nunhappiness in the present to glorious but fantastical dreams of the\nfuture (Berlin 1990, 16–17; Berlin also quoted similar\nsentiments from Benjamin Constant: see Berlin 2002b, 3, as well as\n1978a, 93–129 and 212–39 passim). The first\nprinciple of Berlin’s political ethics was to oppose such\nsubordination, which Berlin viewed as the essence of fanaticism, and a\nrecipe for inhumanity that was as futile as it was horrible. \nBerlin, like Herzen, believed that ‘the goal of life is life\nitself’ (1978a, 221; Herzen 1842, 217), and that each life and\neach age should be regarded as its own end and not as a means to some\nfuture goal. To this he added a caution (evocative as much of Max\nWeber as of Herzen) about the unpredictability of the future.\nBerlin’s belief in the power of human agency was qualified by an\nawareness of how the consequences of any course of action are\nunknowable, and likely to be quite different from what was intended.\nThis led him, on the one hand, to stress the need for caution and\nmoderation; and, on the other, to insist that uncertainty is\ninescapable, so that all action, however carefully undertaken,\ninvolves the risk of error, and of disastrous, or at least unexpected\nand troubling, consequences. The result was an ethic of political\nhumility, similar to Weber’s ethic of responsibility, but\nlacking its tone of grim, stoic grandeur. \nBerlin often noted the dangers of utopianism, and stressed the need\nfor a measure of political pragmatism. He may therefore appear to have\nbeen staunchly in the tradition of ‘political realism’,\ntypically seen as running from Machiavelli (or Thucydides) through to\nrecent scholars, and practitioners, of realpolitik such as E. H. Carr,\nGeorge Kennan or Henry\n Kissinger.[28]\n Yet this was not quite so. Berlin did indeed seek to warn against the\ndangers of idealism, and to chasten it, in order to save it from\nitself and better defend it against cynicism. But in writing of\n‘realism in politics’ he distinguished between a correct\nperception of reality, free of emotional distortions, and another,\n‘more sinister’ sense of the term, deployed by people who\nadmitted to being ‘realists’, ‘usually to explain\naway some unusually mean or brutal decision’. In this sense,\n‘realistic’ had come to mean ‘harsh and brutal, not\nshrinking from what is usually considered immoral, not swayed by soft\nsentimental moral considerations’; it was also identified, in\nBerlin’s mind, with the ‘identification of what is good\nand what is successful’, and a tendency to celebrate ‘the\nbig battalions, marching down a broad avenue, with all the unfulfilled\npossibilities, all the martyrs and visionaries, wiped out’\n(2000a, 163; 2002a, 103–6). While he insisted on the importance\nof a ‘sense of reality’, Berlin was highly critical of the\nsecond form of ‘political realism’, which scornfully\ndisregarded moral ideals or scruples, and embraced dubious means to\nachieve desired ends. He also saw this sort of cynical, brutal realism\nas a powerful political force in the world (2002b, 343–4; see\nalso Cherniss 2013, 67–87, 112–21, and Cherniss 2018). \n‘Realism’ understood as a justification for cynical and\nbrutal conduct was, according to Berlin, not only morally repulsive,\nbut unrealistic, in so far as it rested on an assumption that one\ncould achieve truly desirable ends through the use of morally wicked\nmeans; against this, Berlin asserted that ‘evil means destroy\ngood ends’ (1978a, 345). Indeed, the problem of the relationship\nbetween ends and means runs through his writings. Characteristically,\nhe warned against both an insistence on total political purity –\nfor, when values conflict and consequences are often unexpected,\npurity is an impossible ideal – and a disregard for the ethical\nniceties of political means. He regarded the latter attitude as not\nonly morally ugly, but foolish: for good ends tend to be corrupted and\nundermined by unscrupulous means. Furthermore, since the consequences\nof actions are so uncertain, political actors often don’t\nachieve their goals, or they achieve them imperfectly; so it is best\nnot to make too many sacrifices in the course of accomplishing\none’s political goals, since that accomplishment is uncertain.\nTo the realist argument that ‘You cannot make an omelette\nwithout breaking eggs’, Berlin responded: ‘The one thing\nthat we may be sure of is the reality of the sacrifice, the dying and\nthe dead. But the ideal for the sake of which they die remains\nunrealised. The eggs are broken, and the habit of breaking them grows,\nbut the omelette remains invisible’ (1990, 17).  \nBerlin was thoroughly anti-absolutist; but he did insist that there\nwere certain actions that were, except in the most drastic of\nsituations, unacceptable. Foremost among these were the manipulation\nand humiliation of individuals by others, to the extent that those who\nare ‘got at’ or ‘tampered with’ by others are\ndeprived of their humanity (see 2002b, 184, 337, 339, 341–2).\nBerlin also warned particularly against the use of violence. He\nacknowledged that the use of force was sometimes necessary and\njustified; but he also reminded his readers that violence has\nparticularly volatile and unpredictable consequences, and tends to\nspiral out of control, leading to terrible destruction and suffering,\nand undermining the noble goals it seeks to achieve. He also stressed\nthe dangers of paternalistic, or otherwise humiliating and\ndisempowering, attempts to institute reform or achieve improvement,\nwhich had a tendency to inspire a backlash of hatred and\nresistance. \nBerlin’s political ethics are best summarised in his own\nwords: \nBerlin’s life and work continue to be the subject of\nconsiderable attention. This attention has yet to yield a settled\nconsensus about the merits or the meaning of Berlin’s work\n– and not only because Berlin evokes strong personal reactions,\nattracting admiration and affection, if not outright veneration as a\nliberal saint (see e.g. Annan 1980, 1990, 1999; Hausheer 1979 and\n2004), and inspiring hostility from critics on both the right and\nleft, who have detected in Berlin’s stance complacency,\nhypocrisy, a want of courage and an excess of tolerance (see e.g.\nScruton 1989, Hitchens 1998). This is to be expected, given\nBerlin’s fierce opposition to Communism, combined with his\nrefusal to ally himself to extreme anti-Communism, as well as his\nambivalence or reticence on many divisive political issues of his own\nday. \nHowever, even as the ideological battles of the Cold War recede into\nthe past (not everywhere: in post-Communist Europe, in China and\nelsewhere they are still very much alive), Berlin remains the object\nof varying interpretations and evaluations. This may appear odd in a\nthinker who wrote clearly, and without obfuscating jargon. But it is\nunsurprising, given the complexity of Berlin’s vision, his\naversion to systematic exposition or theorising, the multifaceted\nnature of his work, and the uniqueness of his position in the\nintellectual life of his times. These qualities make it difficult not\nonly to evaluate Berlin, but also to situate him in the history of\nideas; for he appears at once typical and atypical of the period in\nwhich he lived, and also both ahead of his time and somewhat\nold-fashioned. \nIn his youth, Berlin’s intellectual development followed that of\nEnglish-language philosophy; yet he drifted away from the analytic\nphilosophy in which he had once been deeply involved, and his later\nwritings are a world away from most Anglo-American philosophy of their\ntime. On the other hand, for all his range of historical and cultural\nreference, and his concern with moral and aesthetic questions, and\ndespite the influence of Kant and Kant’s successors on his\nthought, Berlin seems out of place in the world of Continental\nphilosophy. Yet it would be a mistake to accept Berlin’s own\njudgement that he had departed from the realm of philosophy\naltogether. For both the views he had formed while working as a\nprofessional philosopher, and his tendency to connect political,\nhistorical and cultural issues to deeper moral and epistemological\nquestions, set his work apart from that of other historians and\n‘public intellectuals’ of his day. \nBerlin was, for much of his life, an intellectually lonely figure,\npursuing the history of ideas in an academic setting that was\nunreceptive to it, and advocating a moderate liberalism in a time\ndominated by ideological extremism. And yet this plea for moderation\nand advocacy of liberalism was shared and taken up by many others at\nthe\n time.[29]\n His interest in political philosophy and his dedication to the\ndefence of liberalism anticipated the work of John Rawls (who had been\ninfluenced by Berlin during a stay at Oxford while a young academic);\nyet the resurgence of normative political theory initiated by\nRawls’s work coincided with a period of eclipse in\nBerlin’s reputation. Berlin’s concern with the nature of\nculture anticipated the centrality in political theory of questions of\nidentity and membership that began in the 1990s; his sympathy for the\nsentiments and needs underlying nationalism, which set him apart from\nmany liberal theorists of his own time, presaged the revival of\n‘liberal nationalism’ in the works of younger thinkers\nsuch as Michael Walzer, David Miller, Yael Tamir and Michael\nIgnatieff. His attack on monism, on the quest for certainty and the\nproject of systematic knowledge, has led him to be embraced by some\ncritics of foundationalism such as Richard Rorty and John Gray. Yet\nBerlin’s work remains difficult to assimilate to intellectual\nmovements or projects such as postmodernism or multiculturalism, the\nexcesses and obscurities of which provoked quizzical scepticism in him\ntowards the end of his life. \nNor is Berlin easy to identify seamlessly with those intellectual\npositions that he explicitly propounded – liberalism and\npluralism. Although he appears as an important, and indeed emblematic,\nexponent of liberalism – along with Rawls, the most important\nliberal theorist of his century – his ideas may nevertheless in\nthe end help to undermine, or at least challenge, conventional, often\nmonistic, liberalism. This question has come to preoccupy many readers\nof Berlin’s work, and predominate in discussions of his legacy,\nto the extent of threatening to overshadow other aspects of his\nthought. \nThe debate over pluralism and liberalism raises important conceptual\nissues; yet it becomes somewhat misleading, both in itself and\nparticularly as a guide to Berlin’s thought, if pluralism and\nliberalism are taken to be comprehensive doctrines, or if they are\nreified into independently existing, systematic entities.\n‘Pluralism’ and ‘liberalism’ as general terms\nare abstractions which can help to group, analyse and compare the\npositions of different thinkers, or to characterise different facets\nof the thought of a single thinker. Neither, however, is likely to\ncapture the whole of an individual position; and neither in itself\nencompasses or sums up Berlin’s own outlook.  \nBerlin himself insisted that political and ethical theories arise from\na thinker’s basic conception of human nature, which in turn is\nfounded on an entire philosophical outlook, a conception of the nature\nof the universe, reality, knowledge etc. The vision underlying\nBerlin’s political and ethical theory, while it may have been\ncoherent (this is itself arguable), was not systematic, and, again, it\ncannot be accurately characterised simply as pluralistic or liberal.\n‘Pluralism’ can be used, more narrowly, to describe\nBerlin’s theory of values. It can also be employed more broadly,\nto capture something of his vision of reality, the universe and human\nnature – that is, the view that all of these things are\ncomplexes made up of separate and conflicting parts: that the self is\nprotean and open-ended, that the universe is not a harmonious cosmos,\nthat reality presents many separate aspects, which can and should be\nviewed from different perspectives. But ‘pluralism’, as\nexplicitly defined by Berlin and others, does not cover Berlin’s\nempiricism, or his historicism, or his awareness of the fallibility of\nhuman knowledge, or his belief in the primary importance of\nindividuals as opposed to generalisations and abstractions, or his\nemphasis on the importance of free choice (which, while he sought to\nfound it on pluralism, in fact appears to be partly independent of\nit). Nor does pluralism, with its emphasis on the place of tragic\nconflict and loss in human life, capture the affirmative zest for life\nand delighted enthusiasm for human beings that was central to\nBerlin’s persona as a man and thinker. Berlin’s thought,\nlike his writing, is made up both of swathes of sharp colour and of\nminutely variegated and subtle shades of light and darkness; it thus\nresists summary and simple conclusions, and repays persistent and\nopen-ended study.","contact.mail":"jlc306@georgetown.edu","contact.domain":"georgetown.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-10-26","date.changed":"2020-07-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berlin/","author1":"Joshua Cherniss","author2":"Henry Hardy","entry":"berlin","body.text":"\n\n\nIsaiah Berlin (1909–97) was a naturalised British philosopher,\nhistorian of ideas, political theorist, educator, public intellectual\nand moralist, and essayist. He was renowned for his conversational\nbrilliance, his defence of liberalism and pluralism, his opposition to\npolitical extremism and intellectual fanaticism, and his accessible,\ncoruscating writings on people and ideas. His essay Two Concepts\nof Liberty (1958) contributed to a revival of interest in\npolitical theory in the English-speaking world, and remains one of the\nmost influential and widely discussed texts in that field: admirers\nand critics agree that Berlin’s distinction between positive and\nnegative liberty remains, for better or worse, a basic starting point\nfor discussions of the meaning and value of political freedom. Later\nin his life, the greater availability of his numerous essays began to\nprovoke increasing interest in his work, particularly in the idea of\nvalue pluralism; that Berlin’s articulation of value pluralism\ncontains many ambiguities and even obscurities has only encouraged\nfurther work on this rich and important topic by other\nphilosophers.\n\nIsaiah Berlin was born in 1909 in Riga (then capital of the Govenorate\nof Livonia in the Russian Empire, now capital of Latvia), the only\nsurviving child (after a stillborn daughter) of Mendel Berlin, a\nprosperous Russian Jewish timber merchant, and his wife Marie,\nnée Volshonok. In 1915 the family moved to the forestry town of\nAndreapol’ (then in Russia’s Pskov Govenorate),\nand in 1916 to Petrograd (now St Petersburg), where they remained\nthrough both the Russian Revolutions of 1917, which Isaiah would\nremember witnessing. Despite early harassment by the Bolsheviks, the\nfamily was permitted to return to Riga with Latvian citizenship in\n1920; from there they emigrated, in 1921, to Britain. They lived in\nand around London; Isaiah attended St Paul’s School and Corpus\nChristi College, Oxford, where he studied Greats (classical languages,\nancient history, and philosophy) and PPE (philosophy, politics and\neconomics), taking Firsts in both. In 1932 he was appointed to a\nlectureship at New College; the same year he became the first Jew to\nbe elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls, considered one of the\nhighest accolades in British academic life. \nThroughout the 1930s Berlin was deeply involved in the development of\nwhat became known as Oxford philosophy, or ordinary language\nphilosophy; his friends and colleagues included J. L. Austin, A. J.\nAyer and Stuart Hampshire, all of whom met regularly (with others) in\nBerlin’s rooms to discuss philosophy. However, he also evinced\nan early interest in a more historical approach to philosophy, and in\nsocial and political theory, reflected in his lectures and reviews of\nthe 1930s, as well as in his intellectual biography of Karl Marx\n(1939), still in print, in its fifth edition (2013), over eighty years\nlater. \nDuring the Second World War Berlin served in British Information\nServices in New York City (1940–2) and at the British Embassy in\nWashington, DC (1942–6), where he was responsible for drafting\nweekly reports on the American political scene. For four months in\n1945–6 he visited the Soviet Union: his meetings there with\nsurviving but persecuted members of the Russian intelligentsia,\nparticularly the poets Anna Akhmatova and Boris Pasternak, reinforced\nhis staunch opposition to Communism, and had a formative influence on\nhis future intellectual agenda. After the war he returned to Oxford.\nAlthough he continued to teach and write on philosophy throughout the\nlater 1940s and into the early 1950s, his interests had shifted to the\nhistory of ideas, particularly Russian ideas, Marxist and other\nsocialist theories, and the Enlightenment and its critics. He also\nbegan to publish widely-read articles on contemporary political and\ncultural trends, political ideology, and the internal workings of the\nSoviet Union. In 1950, election to a research fellowship at All Souls\nallowed him to devote himself more fully to his historical, political\nand literary interests, which lay well outside the mainstream of\nphilosophy as it was then practised and taught at Oxford. He was,\nhowever, one of the first of the founding generation of Oxford\nphilosophers to make regular visits to American universities, and\nplayed an important part in spreading ‘Oxford philosophy’\nto the USA. \nIn 1957, a year after he had married Aline Halban (née de\nGunzbourg), Berlin was elected Chichele Professor of Social and\nPolitical Theory at Oxford (his inaugural lecture, delivered in 1958,\nwas Two Concepts of Liberty). Later in 1957 he was knighted.\nHe resigned his chair in 1967, the year after becoming founding\nPresident of Wolfson College, Oxford (which he essentially created),\nretiring in 1975. In his later years he hoped to write a major work on\nthe history of European Romanticism, but this hope was unfulfilled.\nFrom 1966 to 1971 he was also a visiting Professor of Humanities at\nthe City University of New York, and he served as President of the\nBritish Academy from 1974 to 1978. Collections of his writings, edited\nby Henry Hardy (sometimes with a co-editor), began appearing in 1978:\nthere are, to date, fourteen such volumes (plus new editions of four\nworks published previously by Berlin), as well as an anthology,\nThe Proper Study of Mankind, and a four-volume edition of his\nletters. Berlin received the Agnelli, Erasmus and Lippincott Prizes\nfor his work on the history of ideas, and the Jerusalem Prize for his\nlifelong defence of civil liberties, as well as numerous honorary\ndegrees. He died in 1997. \nAn early influence on Berlin was a waning British Idealism, as\nexpounded by T. H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet and F. H. Bradley. While\nan undergraduate, Berlin was converted to the Realism of G. E. Moore\nand John Cook Wilson. By the time he began teaching philosophy he had\njoined a new generation of rebellious empiricists, some of whom (most\nnotably A. J. Ayer) embraced the logical positivist doctrines of the\nVienna Circle and Wittgenstein’s earlier writings. Although\nBerlin was always sceptical towards logical positivism, its suspicion\nof metaphysical claims and its preoccupation with the nature and\nauthority of knowledge strongly influenced his early philosophical\nenquiries. These, combined with his historical bent, led him back to\nthe study of earlier British empiricists, particularly Berkeley and\nHume, on whom he lectured in the 1930s and late 1940s, and about whom\nhe contemplated writing books (which never materialised). \nBerlin was also influenced by Kant and his successors. His first\nphilosophical mentor was an obscure Russian Jewish Menshevik\némigré named Solomon Rachmilevich, who had studied\nphilosophy at several German universities, and who introduced Berlin\nto the great ideological quarrels of Russian history, as well as to\nthe history of German philosophy since Kant. Later, at Oxford, R. G.\nCollingwood fostered Berlin’s interest in the history of ideas,\nintroducing him in particular to such founders of historicism as\nGiambattista Vico and J. G. Herder. Collingwood also reinforced\nBerlin’s belief – heavily influenced by Kant – in\nthe importance to human life of the basic concepts and categories in\nterms of which human beings organise and analyse their experience (see\nfurther 2.1 and note 2). \nWhile working on his biography of Marx in the mid 1930s, Berlin came\nacross the works of two Russian thinkers who would be important\ninfluences on his political and historical outlook. One of these was\nAlexander Herzen, who became a hero, and to whom Berlin would\nsometimes attribute many of his own beliefs about history, politics\nand ethics. The other was the Russian Marxist publicist and historian\nof philosophy G. V. Plekhanov. Despite his opposition to Marxism,\nBerlin admired and praised Plekhanov both as a man and as a historian\nof ideas. It was initially by reading Plekhanov’s writings that\nBerlin became interested in the naturalistic, empiricist and\nmaterialist thinkers of the Enlightenment, as well as their Idealist\nand historicist critics. Both Herzen and Plekhanov fuelled\nBerlin’s absorption in the political debates of nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century Russian liberals and radicals of various\nstripes, which in turn informed his concern with both the philosophy\nof history and the ethics of political action. \nDuring the Second World War, separated from his Oxford philosophical\nbrethren, and exposed to political action, Berlin began to drift away\nfrom his early philosophical concerns. His doubts were encouraged by a\nmeeting with the Harvard logician H. M. Sheffer, who asserted that\ngenuine increase in knowledge was possible only in such hybrid\nsubfields of philosophy as logic and psychology. His meeting with\nSheffer led Berlin to realise that he lacked the passion and the\nbelief in his own ability to continue pursuing pure philosophy. He\nconcluded that as a professional philosopher (as he then understood\nthat role) he would make no original contributions, and would end his\nlife knowing no more than he did when he began. He therefore\ndetermined to switch to the history of ideas, in which (he believed)\noriginality was less essential, and which would allow him to learn\nmore than he already knew. Berlin’s approach to the history of\nideas would, however, remain deeply informed by his philosophical\npersona, as well as by his political beliefs. His historical work was,\nin effect, the practice of philosophy in a historical key. \nBy the early 1950s Berlin’s central beliefs had crystallised\nfrom the confluence of his philosophical preoccupations, historical\nstudies, and political and moral commitments and anxieties; and his\nmajor ideas were either already fully formed, or developing. Such\nessays of the late 1950s as Two Concepts of Liberty served as\nthe occasion for a synthesis and solidification of his thoughts.\nBerlin had always been a liberal; but from the early 1950s the defence\nof liberalism became central to his intellectual concerns. This\ndefence was, characteristically, closely related to his moral beliefs\nand to his preoccupation with the nature and role of values in human\nlife. In the early 1960s Berlin’s focus moved from the more\npolitical concerns that occupied him in the 1950s to an examination of\nthe nature of the humanities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s he was\nworking on the history of ideas, and from the mid 1960s nearly all of\nhis writings took the form of essays in this field, particularly on\nthe Romantic and reactionary critics of the Enlightenment. In the\nfinal decades of his life Berlin continued to refine and re-articulate\nhis ideas, and particularly his formulation of pluralism; but his\ncourse was set, and he appears to have been little affected by later\nintellectual developments. \nBerlin’s conception of philosophy was shaped by his early\nexposure to, and rejection of, both Idealism and logical \n positivism.[1]\nWith the former he associated an excessively exalted view of\nphilosophy as the ‘queen of the sciences’, capable of\nestablishing fundamental, necessary, absolute, universal truths. With\nthe latter he associated the reductionist and deflationary view of\nphilosophy as, at best, a handmaiden to the sciences, and at worst a\nsign of intellectual immaturity bred of scientistic confusion and\ncredulity. \nBerlin’s approach combined a sceptical empiricism with\nneo-Kantianism to offer a defence of philosophy. Like Vico and Wilhelm\nDilthey, as well as neo-Kantians such as Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, Berlin insisted on the fundamental difference between the\nsciences and the humanities. He classed philosophy among the\nhumanities, but even there its status was unique. Those working in\nother fields aimed to discover authoritative methods for acquiring\nknowledge of the subjects to which they were devoted. Philosophy,\nhowever, was for Berlin concerned with questions which not only could\nnot at present be answered, but for which no clearly proper method of\ndiscovering an answer was known (see e.g. ‘The Purpose of\nPhilosophy’ in 1978b and 2000a). \nIn the case of non-philosophical questions, even if the answer is\nunknown, the means for discovering the answer is known, or accepted,\nby most people. Thus questions of empirical fact can be answered by\nobservation. Other questions can be answered deductively, by referring\nto established rules: this is the case, for example, with mathematics,\ngrammar and formal logic. For example, even if we do not know the\nsolution to a difficult mathematical problem, we do know the rules and\ntechniques that should lead us to the answer.  \nAccording to Berlin, philosophy concerns itself with questions of a\nspecial, distinctive character. To such questions not only are the\nanswers not known, but neither are the means for arriving at answers,\nor the standards of judgement by which to evaluate a suggested answer.\nThus the questions ‘How long does it take to drive from\nx to y?’ or ‘What is the cube root of\n729?’ are not philosophical; while ‘What is time?’\nor ‘What is a number?’ are. ‘What is the purpose of\nhuman life?’ or ‘Are all men brothers?’ are\nphilosophical questions, while ‘Do most of such-and-such a group\nof men think of one another as brothers?’ or ‘What did\nLuther believe was the purpose of life?’ are not.  \nBerlin related this view to Kant’s distinction between matters\nof fact and those conceptual structures and categories that we use to\nmake sense of facts. Philosophy, being concerned with questions that\narise from our attempts to make sense of our experiences, involves\nconsideration of the concepts and categories through which experience\nis perceived, organised and explained.  \nWhile Kant saw these organising categories as fixed and universal,\nBerlin believed that they are, to different degrees, varying,\ntransient or malleable. ‘All our categories are, in theory,\nsubject to change’ (2002b, 144, note 1). No categories are\nwholly prior to, or independent of, experience, even though in\npractice some of them are pragmatically fixed, whether by the world or\nby our minds or both. Rather, the ideas in terms of which we make\nsense of the world are closely tied up with our experiences: they\nshape those experiences, and are shaped by them, and as experience\nvaries from one time and place to another, so do basic\n concepts.[2]\n Recognition of the basic concepts and categories of human experience\ndiffers both from the acquisition of empirical information and from\ndeductive reasoning, for the categories are logically prior to,\npresupposed by, both. \nPhilosophy, then, is the study of the ‘thought-spectacles’\nthrough which we view the world; and since at least some of these\nchange over time, at least some philosophy is necessarily historical.\nBecause these categories are so important to every aspect of our\nexperience, philosophy – even if it is always tentative and\noften seems abstract and esoteric – is a crucially important\nactivity, which responds to the vital, ineradicable human need to\ndescribe and explain the world of experience.  \nBerlin insisted on philosophy’s social usefulness, however\nindirect and\n unobtrusive.[3]\n By bringing to light often subconscious presuppositions and models,\nand scrutinising their validity, philosophy identifies errors and\nconfusions that lead to misunderstanding, distort experience, and thus\ndo real harm. Because philosophy calls commonly accepted assumptions\ninto question, it is inherently subversive, opposed to all orthodoxy,\nand often troubling; but this is inseparable from what makes\nphilosophy valuable, and indeed indispensable, as well as liberating.\nPhilosophy’s goal, Berlin concluded, was ‘to assist men to\nunderstand themselves and thus operate in the open, and not wildly, in\nthe dark’ (1978b, 14). \nPerhaps the most important work Berlin did in ‘pure’\nphilosophy, in the light of his later ideas, concerned ‘logical\n translation.’[4]\n In his essay of that title (reprinted in 1978b), Berlin criticised\nthe assumption that all statements, to be genuine and meaningful, or\nto claim correctness, must be capable of being translated into a\nsingle, ‘good’ type of proposition, and asserted that the\nideal of a single proper type of proposition was illusory and\nmisleading. He identified two different, opposed approaches based on\nthis erroneous assumption. One was the ‘deflationary’\napproach, which sought to assimilate all propositions to one true\ntype. Thus, phenomenalism sought to translate all statements into\nassertions about immediately perceived sense data. The other was the\n‘inflationary’ approach, which posited entities\ncorresponding to all statements, thus ‘creating’ or\nasserting the existence of things that didn’t exist at all. Both\nof these errors stemmed from a demand for a ‘forcible\nassimilation’ of all propositions to a single type. Berlin\nsuggested that such a demand was based, not on a true perception of\nreality, but rather on a psychological need for certainty, uniformity\nand simplicity, as well as what he termed the ‘Ionian\nFallacy’, the assumption that everything is made out of, or can\nbe reduced to or understood in terms of, one and the same substance or\n type.[5] \nBerlin insisted that there is no single criterion of meaningfulness,\nno absolutely incorrigible type of knowledge. The quest for certainty\nwas self-defeating: to restrict oneself to saying only that which\ncould be said without any doubt or fear of being mistaken was to\nsentence oneself to silence. To say anything about the world requires\nbringing in something other than immediate experience: \nAt the heart of Berlin’s philosophy was an awareness of the\nenormous variety and complexity of reality, which we can only begin to\ncomprehend: the many strands that make up human experience are\n‘too many, too minute, too fleeting, too blurred at the edges\n[to be integrated into a total picture of experience]. They\ncriss-cross and penetrate each other at many levels simultaneously,\nand the attempt to prise them apart […] and pin them down, and\nclassify them, and fit them into their specific compartments, turns\nout to be impracticable’ (1978b, 156). \nThese two closely related propositions – that absolute certainty\nis an impossible ideal (Berlin once wrote that, if his work displayed\nany ‘single tendency’, it was a ‘distrust of all\nclaims to the possession of incorrigible knowledge about issues of\nfact or principle in any sphere of human behaviour’: 1978a, x),\nand that not everything can or should be reduced or related to a\nsingle ideal, model, theory or standard – might be considered\nthe centrepieces of Berlin’s philosophy. They are central to his\nview of language and knowledge; they are equally important to his\nethics and his philosophy of the humanities. Also central to these\ndifferent facets of his thought was Berlin’s emphasis on the\nimportance, and indeed priority, of particular things as objects of\nknowledge and of individual people as moral subjects. \nBerlin’s individualism, the influence on him of neo-Kantianism,\nand what one scholar (Allen 1998) has called his anti-Procrusteanism\n– his opposition to attempts dogmatically and inappropriately to\nimpose standards or models on aspects of human experience which they\ndon’t fit – shaped his view of what he usually referred to\nas the ‘humanities’ (sometimes as ‘humane\nstudies’) and their relationship to the (natural) sciences. By\n‘humanities’ he meant all disciplines concerned with the\nstudy of human conduct and experience – thus encompassing many\nso-called ‘social sciences’ as well as the fields of study\ntraditionally classed as ‘humanities’ (see note 1).  \nBerlin criticised the positivist view of the sciences as the\nparadigmatic form of knowledge, which the humanities should measure\nthemselves by and seek to emulate. He argued that the humanities\ndiffered fundamentally from the sciences both in the nature of their\nsubject matter (as Vico and Dilthey had maintained), and in the sort\nof knowledge that they sought (as Rickert insisted). As a result,\ndifferent methods, standards and goals were appropriate to each. \nMost obviously, the humanities study the world that human beings\ncreate for themselves and inhabit, while the sciences study the\nphysical world of nature. Why should this make a difference to the way\nthey are studied? One answer is that the two worlds are fundamentally\ndifferent in themselves. But Berlin preferred the argument that the\nhuman and natural worlds must be studied differently because of the\ndiffering relationship between the observer or thinker and the object\nof study. We study nature from without, culture from within. In the\nhumanities the scholar’s own ways of thinking, the fabric of his\nor her life, every facet of his or her experience is part of the\nobject of study. The sciences, on the other hand, aim to understand\nnature objectively and dispassionately. The scientist must take as\nlittle for granted as possible, preferring hard evidence to\n‘common sense’ when they diverge. But in the humanities\none cannot act in this manner: to study human life, it is necessary to\nbegin from our understanding of other human beings, of what it is to\nhave motives and feelings. Such understanding is based on our own\nexperience, which in turn necessarily involves certain\n‘common-sense’ assumptions, which we use to fit our\nexperience into patterns that make it explicable and comprehensible.\nThese patterns may be more or less accurate; and we can judge their\naccuracy by seeing how well they fit experience as we know it. But we\ncannot divest ourselves entirely of the assumptions that underlie\nthem. (The human world can also itself be a legitimate subject of\nscientific study, of course, but only incompletely, by bracketing off\nwhat makes it distinctive. Cf. note 7.) \nBerlin asserted that the humanities also differed from the sciences in\nthat the former were concerned with understanding the particulars of\nhuman life in and of themselves, while the sciences sought to\nestablish general laws which could explain whole classes of phenomena.\nThe sciences are concerned with types, the humanities with\nindividuals. Scientists concentrate on similarities and look for\nregularities; at least some practitioners of the humanities –\nhistorians, in particular – are interested in differences. To be\na good historian requires a ‘concentrated interest in particular\nevents or persons or situations as such, and not as instances of a\ngeneralisation’ (1978b, 180). The humanities should not aim to\nemulate the sciences by seeking laws to explain or predict human\nactions, but should concern themselves with understanding every\nparticular human phenomenon in its uniqueness. In the case of a\nscience we think it more rational to put our trust in general laws\nthan in specific phenomena; in the case of the humanities, the\nopposite is true. If someone claims to have witnessed a phenomenon\nthat contradicts well-established laws of science, we seek an\nexplanation that will reconcile that perception with science; if none\nis possible, we may conclude that the witness is deceived. In the case\nof history we do not usually do this: we look at particular phenomena\nand seek to explain them in\n themselves.[6]\n There are, Berlin claimed, ‘more ways than one to defy\nreality’. It is unscientific to ‘defy, for no good logical\nor empirical reason, established hypotheses and laws’. But it is\nunhistorical, on the other hand, to ‘ignore or twist one’s\nview of particular events, persons, predicaments in the name of laws,\ntheories, principles derived from other fields, logical, ethical,\nmetaphysical, scientific, which the nature of the medium renders\ninapplicable’ (1978b, 185).  \nBerlin emphasised the importance to a sense of history of the idea of\nits ‘one-directional’ flow (ibid., 144). This sense of\nhistorical reality makes it seem not merely inaccurate, but\nimplausible, and indeed ridiculous, to suggest, for example, that\nHamlet was written in the court of Genghis Khan (ibid., 142,\n175). The historical sense involves, not knowledge of what happened\n– this is acquired by empirical means – but a sense of\nwhat is plausible and implausible, coherent and incoherent, in\naccounting for human action (1978b, 183). There is no a priori\nshortcut to such knowledge. Historical thinking is much more like the\noperation of common sense, involving the weaving together of various\nlogically independent concepts and propositions, and bringing them to\nbear on a particular situation as best we can, than like the\napplication of laws or formulae. The ability to do this is a knack\n– judgement, or a sense of reality (1978b, 152).  \nUnderstanding of history is based on knowledge of humanity, which is\nderived from direct experience, consisting not merely of\nintrospection, but of interaction with others. This is the basis for\nVerstehen, or imaginative understanding: the\n‘recognition of a given piece of behaviour as being part and\nparcel of a pattern of activity which we can follow, […] and\nwhich we describe in terms of the general laws which cannot possibly\nall be rendered explicit (still less organised into a system), but\nwithout which the texture of normal human life – social or\npersonal – is not conceivable’ (1978b, 168). The challenge\nof history is the need for the individual to go beyond his or her own\nexperience, which is the basis of his or her ability to conceive of\nhuman behaviour. We must reconstruct the past not only in terms of our\nown concepts and categories, but in terms of how past events must have\nlooked to those who participated in them. The practice of history thus\nrequires gaining knowledge of what consciousness was like for other\npersons, in situations other than our own, through an\n‘imaginative projection of ourselves into the past’ in\norder to ‘capture concepts and categories that differ from those\nof the investigator by means of concepts and categories that cannot\nbut be his own. […] Without a capacity for empathy and\nimagination beyond any required by a physicist, there is no vision of\neither past or present, neither of others nor of ourselves’\n(1978b, 177–8). Historical reconstruction and explanation\ninvolves ‘entering into’ the motives, principles, thoughts\nand feelings of others; it is based on a capacity for knowing like\nthat of knowing someone’s character or face (1978b,\n173–5). \nThe sort of historical understanding that Berlin sought to depict was\n‘related to moral and aesthetic analysis’. It conceives of\nhuman beings not merely as organisms in space, but as ‘active\nbeings, pursuing ends, shaping their own and others’ lives,\nfeeling, reflecting, imagining, creating, in constant interaction and\nintercommunication with other human beings; in short, engaged in all\nthe forms of experience that we understand because we share in them,\nand do not view them purely as external observers’ (1978b,\n173–4). For Berlin, the philosophy of history was tied not only\nto epistemology, but to ethics. The best-known and most controversial\nfacet of his writings on the relationship of history to the sciences\nwas his discussion of the problem of free will and determinism, which\nin his hands took on a distinctly moral\n cast.[7]\n In Historical Inevitability Berlin radically questioned\ndeterminism (the view that human beings do not possess free will, that\ntheir actions and indeed thoughts are predetermined by forces beyond\ntheir control) and historical inevitability (the view that all that\noccurs in the course of history does so because it must, that history\npursues a particular course which cannot be altered, and which can be\ndiscovered, understood and described through laws of historical\ndevelopment). In particular he mounted a critique of the belief that\nhistory is controlled by impersonal forces beyond human control. \nBerlin did not assert that determinism was untrue, but rather that to\naccept it required a radical transformation of the language and\nconcepts we use to think about human life – especially a\nrejection of the idea of individual moral responsibility. To praise or\nblame individuals, to hold them responsible, is to assume that they\nhave some control over their actions, and could have chosen\ndifferently. If individuals are wholly determined by unalterable\nforces, it makes no more sense to praise or blame them for their\nactions than it would to blame someone for being ill, or praise\nsomeone for obeying the laws of gravity. Indeed, Berlin further\nsuggested that acceptance of determinism – that is, the complete\nabandonment of the concept of human free will – would lead to\nthe collapse of all meaningful rational activity as we know it. \nThis is an extension into the realm of the understanding of human\nbeings of Kant’s ‘Copernican’ revolution (to use\nKant’s own epithet). Kant gave full recognition, for the first\ntime, to the inescapable contribution made by our minds to grasping\nthe non-human world; Berlin mirrors this move with a scarcely less\nfundamental claim of his own, that there are equally inescapable ways\nin which, at any given time or at all times known to us, we cannot but\nthink of and understand the behaviour and experience of our own\nkind. \nHere ‘freedom’ means the centrally important concept of\nfree will. We cannot help experiencing human behaviour as causally\nundetermined and freely chosen. That we have free will is not a\nscientific hypothesis, but a precondition of our experience of\nhumanity, to abandon which would leave our world-view in ruins.\n(Whether this entails that determinism is false is a further question,\nwhich Berlin does not fully confront; nor do we pursue it here.) \nBerlin also insisted that belief in historical inevitability was\ninspired by psychological needs, and not required by known facts; and\nthat it had dangerous moral and political consequences, justifying\nsuffering and undermining respect for the ‘losers’ of\nhistory. A belief in historical inevitability served as an\n‘alibi’ for evading responsibility and blame, and for\ncommitting enormities in the name of necessity or reason. It provided\nan excuse both for acting badly and for not acting at\n all.[8] \nBerlin’s insistence on the importance of the idea of free will,\nand the incompatibility of consistent and thoroughgoing determinism\nwith our basic sense of ourselves and our experience as human beings,\nwas closely tied to his liberalism and pluralism, with their emphasis\non the importance, necessity and dignity of individual choice. This\ninsistence involved him in a number of debates with other philosophers\nand historians in the 1950s and early 1960s, and helped to provoke a\nspate of writing in the English-speaking world on the philosophy of\nhistory, which might otherwise have languished. \nAlso controversial was Berlin’s claim that the writing and\ncontemplation of history necessarily involves moral evaluation. He did\nnot, as some of his critics charged (e.g. Carr 1961), mean this as a\ncall for moralising on the part of historians. Berlin’s argument\nwas that, first, our normal way of regarding human beings as agents\nwho make choices necessarily involves moral evaluation; to eliminate\nmoral evaluation from our thinking completely would be to alter\nradically the way that we view the world. Nor would such an alteration\ntruly move beyond moral evaluation; for strenuous attempts to be\nmorally neutral are themselves motivated by a moral commitment to the\nideal of impartiality. Furthermore, given the place of moral\nevaluation in ordinary human thought and speech, an account couched in\nmorally neutral terms will fail accurately to reflect the experience\nor self-perception of the historical actors in question. This last\nargument was particularly important to Berlin, who believed that\nhistorical writing should reflect and convey past actors’\nunderstanding of their situation, so as to provide explanations of\nwhy, thinking as they did, they acted as they did. He therefore\ninsisted that the historian must attend to the moral claims and\nperceptions underlying historical events. \nBerlin’s emphasis on the subversive, liberating, anti-orthodox\nnature of philosophy was accompanied by a particular interest in\nmoments of radical change in the history of ideas, and in original and\noften marginal thinkers, while his emphasis on the practical\nconsequences of ideas led him to focus on those transformations and\nchallenges which, in his view, had wrought particularly decisive\nchanges in people’s moral and political consciousness, and in\ntheir behaviour. Finally, his concern with the conflicts of his own\nday led him to concentrate mainly on modern intellectual history, and\nto trace the emergence of certain ideas that he regarded as\nparticularly important, for good or ill, in the contemporary\n world.[9] \nMany of Berlin’s writings on the history of ideas were connected\nto his philosophical work, and to one another, in their examination of\ncertain overarching themes. These included the relationship between\nthe sciences and the humanities; the philosophy of history; the\norigins of nationalism and socialism; the revolt against what Berlin\ncalled ‘monism’ in general, and scientism in particular,\nin the early nineteenth century and thereafter; and the vicissitudes\nof ideas of liberty. \nThe narrative of the history of ideas that Berlin developed and\nrefined over the course of his works began with the Enlightenment, and\nfocused on the initial rebellion against what he regarded as that\nepoch’s dominant\n assumptions.[10] \nIn Berlin’s account, the thinkers of the Enlightenment believed\nhuman beings to be naturally either benevolent or malleable. This\ncreated a tension within Enlightenment thought between the view that\nnature dictates human ends, and the view that nature provides more or\nless neutral material, to be moulded rationally and benevolently\n(ultimately the same thing) by conscious human interventions –\neducation, legislation, rewards and punishment, the whole apparatus of\n society.[11]\n Berlin also attributed to the Enlightenment the beliefs that all\nhuman problems, both of knowledge and ethics, can be resolved through\nthe discovery and application of the proper method (generally reason,\nthe conception of which was based on the methods of the sciences,\nparticularly Newtonian physics); and that genuine human goods and\ninterests were ultimately compatible, so that conflict, like\nwickedness, was the result of ignorance, misunderstanding, or\ndeception and oppression practiced by corrupt authorities\n(particularly the\n Church).[12] \nBerlin saw the school (or schools) of thought that began to emerge\nshortly before the French Revolution, and became ascendant during and\nafter it, as profoundly antagonistic towards the Enlightenment. He was\nmost interested in German Romanticism, but also looked at other\nmembers of the larger tendency he referred to as the\n ‘Counter-Enlightenment’.[13]\n Berlin’s account sometimes focused on a attack on the\nEnlightenment’s benevolent and optimistic liberalism by\nnationalists and reactionaries; sometimes on the rejection of moral\nand cultural universalism by champions of cultural particularism and\npluralism; and sometimes on the critique of naturalism and scientism\nby thinkers who advocated a historicist view of society as essentially\ndynamic, shaped not by the laws of nature, but by the unlawlike,\nsenseless contingencies of history.  \nBerlin has been viewed both as an adherent of the Enlightenment who\nshowed a fascination, whether eccentric or admirable, with its\ncritics; and as a critic and even opponent of the Enlightenment, who\nfrankly admired its enemies. There is some truth in both of these\npictures, neither of which does justice to the complexity of\nBerlin’s views. Berlin admired many of the thinkers of the\nEnlightenment, and explicitly regarded himself as ‘on their\nside’ (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70); he believed that much of what they\nhad accomplished had been for the good; and, as an empiricist, he\nrecognised them as part of the same philosophical tradition to which\nhe belonged. But he also believed that they were wrong, and sometimes\ndangerously so, about some of the most important questions of society,\nmorality and politics. He regarded their psychological and historical\nvision as shallow, excessively uniform, and naive; and he traced to\nthe Enlightenment a technocratic, managerial view of human beings and\npolitical problems to which he was profoundly opposed, and which, in\nthe late 1940s and early 1950s, he regarded as one of the gravest\ndangers facing the world. \nBerlin regarded the Enlightenment’s critics as in many ways\ndangerous and deluded. He attacked or dismissed their metaphysical\nbeliefs, particularly the philosophies of history of Hegel and his\nsuccessors. He was also wary of the aesthetic approach to politics\nthat many Romantics had practised and fostered. And, while\nappreciative of some elements in the Romantic conception of liberty,\nhe saw Romanticism’s influence on the development of the idea of\nliberty as largely perverting. But at the same time he thought the\nEnlightenment’s opponents had pointed to many important truths\nthat the Enlightenment had neglected or denied, both negative (the\npower of unreason, and particularly the darker passions, in human\naffairs) and positive (the inherent value of variety and of personal\nvirtues such as integrity and sincerity, and the centrality to human\nnature and dignity of the capacity for choice). Romanticism rebelled\nin particular against the constricting order imposed by reason, and\nchampioned the human will. Berlin was sympathetic to this stance, but\nalso believed that the Romantics had gone too far both in their\nprotests and in their celebrations. He remained committed to the goal\nof understanding the world so as to be able to ‘act rationally\nin it and on it’ (1990, 2). His interest in critics of the\nEnlightenment reflected both curiosity about the views of those with\nwhom he often disagreed, and a desire to learn from the most acute\nchallenges to a progressive, ‘liberal\n rationalist’[14]\n (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70) or ‘rational-liberal’ (Berlin\n2006a, 104) position, so as to appreciate, and repair, its\nshortcomings and vulnerabilities. Berlin’s own articulation of\nliberalism and pluralism attempted to integrate a defence of the\nEnlightenment’s legacy with the insights of its critics.  \nThe republication of Berlin’s numerous essays in thematic\ncollections, beginning with Four Essays on Liberty (1969) and\nVico and Herder (1976), and continuing at an increased pace\nfrom 1978 under the general (and mostly specific) editorship of Henry\nHardy, served to highlight as a central dimension of Berlin’s\nthought his advocacy of the doctrine of value pluralism (which he\nhimself called pluralism). Increasingly from the early 1990s value\npluralism has come to be seen by many as Berlin’s ‘master\nidea’, and has become the most discussed, most admired and most\ncontroversial of his ideas. \nValue pluralism was indeed at the centre of Berlin’s ethical\nthought; but there is more to that thought than value pluralism alone.\nBerlin defined ethical thought as ‘the systematic examination of\nthe relations of human beings to one another, the conceptions,\ninterests and ideals from which human ways of treating one another\nspring, and the systems of value on which such ends of life are\nbased’. These systems of value are ‘beliefs about how life\nshould be lived, what men and women should be and do’ (1990,\n1–2). Just as Berlin’s conception of philosophy was based\non a belief about the important role of concepts and categories in\npeople’s lives, his conception of ethics was founded on his\nbelief in the importance of normative or ethical concepts and\ncategories – especially\n values.[15] \nBerlin did not set out a systematic theory about the nature of values,\nand so his view must be gleaned from his writings on the history of\nideas. His remarks on the status and origins of values are ambiguous,\nthough not necessarily irreconcilable with one another. He seems,\nfirst, to endorse the Romantic view – which he traces to Kant\n(although he also sometimes attributes it to Hume) – that values\nare not discovered ‘out there’, as\n‘ingredients’ in the universe, not deduced or derived from\nnature. Rather, they are human creations, and derive their authority\nfrom this fact. From this followed a theory of ethics according to\nwhich individual human beings are the most morally valuable things, so\nthat the worth of ideals and actions should be judged in relation to\nthe meanings and impact they have for and on such individuals. This\nview underlay Berlin’s passionate conviction of the error of\nlooking to theories rather than human realities, of the evil of\nsacrificing living human beings to abstractions (which he found\nemphasised in Herzen); it also related to Berlin’s theory of\nliberty, and his belief in liberty’s special importance. \nAt other times Berlin seems to advance what amounts almost to a theory\nof natural law, albeit in minimalist, empirical dress. In such cases\nhe suggests that there are certain unvarying features of human beings,\nas they have been constituted throughout recorded history, that make\ncertain values important, or even necessary, to them. Values, then,\nwould be beliefs about what it is good to be and do – about what\nsort of life, what sort of character, what sort of actions, what state\nof being it is desirable, given human nature, for us to aspire to.\nThis view of the origin of values also comes into play in\nBerlin’s defence of the value of liberty, when he suggests that\nthe freedom to think, to enquire, to imagine and above all to choose,\nwithout constraint or fear, is valuable because human beings need such\nmental freedom; to deny it to them is a denial of their nature,\nimposes an intolerable burden, and at the extreme entirely dehumanises\nthem. \nIn an attempt to reconcile these two strands, one might say that, for\nBerlin, the values that humans create are rooted in the nature of the\nbeings who pursue them. But this is simply to move the question back a\nstep, for the question then immediately arises: Is this human nature\nnatural and fixed, or created and altered over time through conscious\nor unconscious human action? Berlin’s answer (see e.g. 1990,\n319–23) comes in two parts. He rejects the idea of a fixed,\nfully specified human nature, regarding natural essences with\nsuspicion. Yet he does believe (however under-theorised, unsystematic\nand undogmatic this belief may be) in boundaries to, and requirements\nmade by, human nature as we know it. This common human nature may not\nbe fully specifiable in terms of a list of unvarying characteristics;\nbut, while many characteristics may vary from individual to individual\nor culture to culture, there is a limit on the variation – just\nas the human face may vary greatly from person to person in many of\nits properties, while remaining recognisably human, but at the same\ntime it is possible to distinguish between a human and a non-human\nface, even if the difference between them cannot be reduced to a\nformula. Indeed, at the core of Berlin’s thought was his\ninsistence on the importance of humanity, or the distinctively human,\nboth as a quasi-Kantian category and as a moral reality, which does\nnot need to be reduced to an unvarying essence in order to have\ndescriptive and normative force. \nThere is a related ambiguity about whether values are objective or\nsubjective. One might conclude from Berlin’s view of values as\nhuman inventions that he would regard them as subjective. Yet he\ninsisted, on the contrary, that values are objective, even going so\nfar as to label his position ‘objective pluralism’ (2015,\n210; 2000b, 245, note 1). Yet it is unclear what exactly he meant by\nthis, or how this belief relates to his view of values as human\ncreations. There are at least two accounts of the objectivity of\nvalues that can be plausibly attributed to Berlin. The first is that\nvalues are ‘objective’ in that they are simply facts about\nthe people who hold them – so that, for instance, liberty is an\n‘objective’ value because I value it, and would feel\nfrustrated and miserable without at any rate a minimal amount of it.\nThe second is that the belief in or pursuit of certain values is the\nresult of objective realities of human nature – so that, for\ninstance, liberty is an ‘objective’ value because certain\nfacts about human nature make liberty good and desirable for human\nbeings. These views are not incompatible with one another, but they\nare distinct; and the latter provides a firmer basis for the minimal\nmoral universalism that Berlin espoused. \nFinally, Berlin insisted that each value is binding on human beings by\nvirtue of its own claims, in its own terms, and not in terms of some\nother value or goal, let alone the same value in all cases. This view\nwas one of the central tenets of Berlin’s pluralism. \nBerlin’s development and definition of pluralism both began\nnegatively, with the identification of the opposing position, which he\nusually referred to as ‘monism’, and sometimes as\n‘the Ionian fallacy’ or ‘the Platonic ideal’.\nHis definition of monism may be summarised as follows: \nWe have seen that Berlin denied that the first two of these\nassumptions are true. In his ethical pluralism he pushed these denials\nfurther, and added a forceful denial of the third assumption.\nAccording to Berlin’s pluralism, genuine values are many. They\nmay – and often do – come into conflict with one another.\nWhen two or more values clash, it is not because one or another has\nbeen misunderstood; nor can it be said, a priori, that any one value\nis always more important than another. Liberty can conflict with\nequality or with public order; mercy with justice; love with\nimpartiality and fairness; social and moral commitment with the\ndisinterested pursuit of truth or beauty (the latter two values,\ncontra Keats, may themselves be incompatible); knowledge with\nhappiness; spontaneity and free-spiritedness with dependability and\nresponsibility. Conflicts of values are ‘an intrinsic,\nirremovable element in human life’; ‘the notion of total\nhuman fulfilment is a […] chimera’. ‘These\ncollisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we\nare’; a world in which such conflicts are resolved is not the\nworld we know or understand (2002b, 213; 1990, 13). \nBerlin further asserted that values may be not only incompatible, but\nincommensurable. There has been considerable controversy over what he\nmeant by this, and whether his understanding of incommensurability was\neither correct or coherent. In speaking of the incommensurability of\nvalues, Berlin seems to have meant that there is no common measure, no\n‘common currency’ in terms of which the relative\nimportance of any two values can be established in the abstract. Thus\none basic implication of pluralism for ethics is the view that a\nquantitative approach to ethical questions (such as that envisaged by\nUtilitarianism) is impossible. In addition to denying the existence of\na common currency for comparison, or a governing principle (such as\nthe utility principle), value incommensurability holds that there is\nno general procedure for resolving value conflicts – there is\nnot, for example, a lexical priority rule (that is, no value always\nhas priority over another). \nBerlin based these assertions on empirical grounds – on\n‘the world that we encounter in ordinary experience’, in\nwhich ‘we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate,\nand claims equally absolute, the realisation of some of which must\ninevitably involve the sacrifice of others’ (2002b,\n213–14). Yet he also held that the doctrine of pluralism\nreflected logically necessary rather than contingent truths about the\nnature of human moral life and the values that are its ingredients.\nThe idea of a perfect whole or ultimate solution is not only\nunattainable in practice, but also conceptually incoherent. To avert\nor overcome conflicts between values once and for all would require\nthe transformation, which amounted to the abandonment, of those values\nthemselves. It is not clear that this logical point adds anything\nsignificant to the empirical point about human ends recorded in the\nlast quotation, but we do not pursue this doubt here. \nBerlin’s pluralism was not free-standing: it was modified and\nguided by other beliefs and commitments. One of these, discussed\nbelow, was liberalism. Another was humanism – the view that\nhuman beings are of primary importance, and that avoiding harm to\nhuman beings is the first moral priority (Aarsbergen-Ligtvoet 2006;\nCherniss and Hardy 2018). Berlin therefore held that, in navigating\nbetween conflicting values, ‘The first public obligation is to\navoid extremes of suffering.’ He insisted that moral collisions,\neven if unavoidable, can be softened, claims balanced, compromises\nreached. The goal should be the maintenance of a ‘precarious\nequilibrium’ that avoids, as far as possible, ‘desperate\nsituations’ and ‘intolerable choices’. Philosophy\nitself cannot tell us how to do this, though it can help by bringing\nto light the problem of moral conflict and all of its implications,\nand by weeding out false solutions. But in dealing with conflicts of\nvalues, ‘The concrete situation is almost everything’\n(1990, 18–19). \nOne of the main features of Berlin’s account of pluralism is the\nemphasis placed on the act of choosing between values. Pluralism holds\nthat, in many cases, there is no single right answer. Berlin used this\nas an argument for the importance of liberty (see note 25) – or,\nperhaps more precisely, an argument against the restriction of liberty\nin order to impose the ‘right’ solution by force. Berlin\nalso made a larger argument about making choices. Pluralism involves\nconflicts, and thus choices, not only between particular values in\nindividual cases, but between ways of life. While Berlin seems to\nsuggest that individuals have certain inherent traits – an\nindividual nature, or character, which cannot be wholly altered or\nobscured – he also insisted that they make decisions about who\nthey will be and what they will do. Choice is thus both an expression\nof an individual personality, and part of what makes that personality;\nit is essential to the human self. \nBerlin provided his own (inconsistent and somewhat peculiar)\ngenealogies of pluralism. He found the first rebellion against monism\neither in Machiavelli (1990, 7–9) or in Vico and Herder (2000a,\n8–11), who were also decisive figures in the first account. Yet\nhe acknowledged that Machiavelli wasn’t really a pluralist, but\na dualist; and other scholars have questioned his identification of\nVico and Herder as pluralists, when both avowed belief in a higher,\ndivine or mystical, unity behind variety. Other scholars have credited\nother figures in the history of philosophy, such as Aristotle, with\npluralism (Nussbaum 1986, Evans 1996). James Fitzjames Stephen\nadvanced something that looks very much like Berlin’s pluralism\n(Stephen 1873), though he allied it to a conservative critique of\nMill’s liberalism. \nIn Germany, Dilthey came close to pluralism, and Max Weber presented a\ndramatic, forceful picture of the tragic conflict between\nincommensurable values, belief systems and ways of life (Weber 1918,\nesp. 117, 126, 147–8, 151–3; cf. Weber 1904, esp.\n17–18). \nEthical pluralism first emerged under that name, however, in America,\ninspired by William James’s pluralistic view of the universe, as\nwell as his occasional gestures towards value pluralism (James 1891).\nJohn Dewey and the British theologian Hastings Rashdall both\napproximated pluralism in certain writings (Dewey 1908, Rashdall\n1907); but pluralism was apparently first proposed, under that name,\nand as a specifically ethical doctrine,\n in language strikingly similar to Berlin’s,\n by Sterling Lamprecht, a naturalist philosopher and scholar of Hobbes\nand Locke, in two articles (1920, 1921), as well as, somewhat later,\nby A. P. Brogan (1931). The dramatic similarities between not only\nBerlin’s and Lamprecht’s ideas, but also their language,\nmake it difficult to believe that Lamprecht was not an influence on\nBerlin. However, there is no independent evidence that Berlin knew\nLamprecht’s work; and Berlin’s tendency was more often to\ncredit his own ideas to others than to claim the work of others as his\nown. \nVersions of pluralism were also advocated by Berlin’s\ncontemporaries Raymond Aron, Stuart Hampshire, Reinhold Niebuhr and\nMichael Oakeshott (although Oakeshott seems to have attributed\nconflicts of values to a mistakenly reflective approach to ethical\nissues, and suggested that they could be overcome through relying on a\nmore habitual, less self-conscious, ethical approach: see Oakeshott\n1962, 1–36). \nSome of the elements of value pluralism are detectable in\nBerlin’s early essay ‘Some Procrustations’ (1930),\npublished while he was still an undergraduate at Oxford. This essay,\ndrawing on Aristotle, and focusing on literary and cultural criticism\nrather than philosophy proper, made the case for epistemological and\nmethodological, rather than ethical, pluralism. Berlin criticised the\nbelief in, and search for, a single method or theory, which could\nserve as a master key for understanding all experience. He insisted\nthat, on the contrary, different standards, values and methods of\nenquiry are appropriate for different activities, disciplines and\nfacets of life. In this can be seen the seeds of his later work on the\ndifferences between the sciences and the humanities, of his attacks on\nsystematic explanatory schemes, and of his value pluralism; but all\nthese ideas had yet to be developed or applied. \nBerlin was further nudged towards pluralism by discovering what he saw\nas a suggestion by Nicolas Malebranche that simplicity and goodness\nare incompatible (1680, e.g. 116–17, 128–30); this struck\nhim at the time as an ‘odd interesting view!’, but it\nstuck, and he became convinced of its central and pregnant truth\n(2004,\n 72).[16]\n Berlin set out his basic account of what he would later label monism\nin his biography of Marx (1939, 37), but did not explicitly criticise\nit or set out a pluralistic alternative to it, although his lecture\n‘Utilitarianism’ (1937b), dating from the late 1930s, does\nset out an argument that anticipates his later claim that values are\nincommensurable. The basic crux of pluralism, and Berlin’s\nconnection of it to liberalism, is apparent in rough, telegraphic form\nin Berlin’s notes for his lecture ‘Democracy, Communism\nand the Individual’ (1949), and pluralism is also advanced in an\naside, though not under that name, in ‘Historical\nInevitability’ (1954: see 2000b, 151). Berlin referred to\npluralism and monism as basic, conflicting attitudes to life in 1955\n(Berlin et al. 1955, 504). But his use of the term and his explication\nof the concept did not fully come together, it appears, until Two\nConcepts of Liberty (1958; even then, his articulation of\npluralism is incomplete in the first draft of the essay). \nThereafter, variations on Berlin’s account of pluralism appear\nthroughout his writings on Romanticism. Late in his life, taking stock\nof his career, and trying to communicate what he felt to be his most\nimportant philosophical insights, Berlin increasingly devoted himself\nto the explicit articulation and refinement of pluralism as an ethical\ntheory. He had referred in a private letter of 1968 (Ignatieff 1998,\n246) to ‘the unavoidability of conflicting ends’ as his\none genuine discovery. He devoted the lecture he gave in accepting the\nAgnelli Prize in 1988, ‘The Pursuit of the Ideal’, to\nexplaining what pluralism meant, and this remains the most eloquent\nand concentrated summary of pluralism. Berlin also discussed pluralism\nin many interviews and printed exchanges with other scholars from the\n1970s onward, in an attempt to work through the conflicts,\ncontroversies and confusions to which his ideas gave rise; but many of\nthese resisted Berlin’s attempts at resolution, and continue to\nfigure in, and sometimes dominate, discussions of his work. \nSince the 1990s, pluralism has become the most widely and hotly\ndebated of Berlin’s ideas. This is due in part to Berlin’s\nwork, and in part to that of later philosophers who, as followers or\nallies of Berlin or independently, have also articulated and advanced\nvalue pluralism or similar\n positions.[17]\n Although pluralism achieved its current prominence in interpretations\nof Berlin’s work later in his life, it was identified earlier as\na key component in his thought by a few prescient readers. Two of\nthese readers advanced what remains one of the most common criticisms\nof Berlin’s pluralism: that it is indistinguishable from\nrelativism (Strauss 1961; Momigliano 1976; see MacCallum 1967a and\nKocis 1989 for other early\n critiques).[18] \nOne problem that has bedevilled the debate is a persistent failure to\ndefine the terms at issue with adequate clarity and precision.\nPluralism, of course, has been the subject of repeated definition by\nBerlin and others (the repetition not always serving a clarifying\npurpose). However, the term ‘relativism’ often remains\nunderanalysed in these discussions. Whether pluralism can be\ndistinguished from relativism depends largely on how relativism is\ndefined, as well as on how certain obscure or controversial components\nof pluralism are treated. It should also be noted that the question of\nwhether values are plural is logically distinct from the question of\nwhether they are objective, despite the frequent elision of the two\ntopics in the literature on this subject. \nOne way of defining relativism is as a form of subjectivism or moral\nirrationalism. This is how Berlin defined it in his attempts to refute\nthe charge of relativism brought against his pluralism. For Berlin,\nthe model of a relativist statement is ‘I like my coffee white,\nyou like yours black; that is simply the way it is; there is nothing\nto choose between us; I don’t understand how you can prefer\nblack coffee, and you cannot understand how I can prefer white; we\ncannot agree.’ Applied to ethics, this same relativist attitude\nmight lead its holder to say: ‘I like human sacrifice, and you\ndo not; our tastes, and traditions, simply differ.’ Pluralism,\non the other hand, as Berlin defines it, holds that understanding of\nmoral views is possible among all people (unless they are so alienated\nfrom normal human sentiments and beliefs as to be considered really\nderanged). Relativism, in Berlin’s definition, would make such\nmoral understanding impossible; while pluralism explains the\npossibility of (and acceptance of pluralism may facilitate) moral\ncommunication. \nAnother (related) way of differentiating pluralism and relativism,\nemployed by Berlin and others, holds that pluralism accepts a basic\n‘core’ of human values, and that these and other values\nadopted alongside them in a particular context fall within a\n‘common human horizon’. This ‘horizon’ sets\nlimits on what is morally permissible and desirable, while the\n‘core’ of shared or universal values allows us to reach\nagreement on at least some moral issues. This view rests on a belief\nin a basic, minimum, universal human nature beneath the widely diverse\nforms that human life and belief have taken across time and place. It\nmay also involve a belief in the existence of a specifically\n‘moral sense’ inherent in human beings. Berlin seems to\nhave believed in such a faculty, and linked it to empathy, but did not\ndevelop this view in his writings. \nYet another way of defining relativism is to view it as holding that\nthings have value only relative to particular situations or\noutlooks; nothing is intrinsically good – that is, valuable in\nand for itself. A slightly different way of putting this would be to\nmaintain that there are no such things as values that are always\nvalid; values are valid to different degrees in different\ncircumstances, but not others. For instance, liberty may be a leading\nvalue in one place at one time, but has a much lower status as a value\nat another. Here, again, Berlin’s pluralism seems opposed to\nrelativism, since it is committed to the belief that, for human\nbeings, at least some values are intrinsically rather than\ninstrumentally good, and that at least some values are universally\nvalid, even if others aren’t, and even if this universal\nvalidity isn’t recognised. Berlin admitted that liberty, for\ninstance, had historically been upheld as a pre-eminent ideal only by\na minority of human beings; yet he still held it to be a genuine value\nfor all human beings, everywhere, because of the way that human beings\nare constituted, and, so far as we know, will continue to be\nconstituted. Similarly, Steven Lukes has suggested that relativism\nseeks to avoid or dismiss moral conflict, to explain it away by\nholding that different values hold for different people\n(‘Liberalism for the liberals, cannibalism for the\ncannibals’: Lukes 2001b; cf. Hollis 1999, 36), and by denying\nthat the competing values may be, and often are, binding on all\npeople. Pluralism, on the other hand, sees conflicts of values as\noccurring both within, and across, cultures, and (at least in\nLukes’s formulation) maintains that custom or relatively valid\nbelief-systems or ways of life cannot be appealed to as ways of\novercoming value-conflict (Lukes 1989). This is not a position that\nBerlin explicitly advances; but his later writings suggest a sympathy\nfor it. \nBerlin’s own position seems to lie somewhere between this\nversion of relativism and Lukes’s proposal. He acknowledged that\ncultures are not monolithic or morally ‘rational’ (that\nis, conflicts of values are endemic within cultures), and denies that\ncultural traditions or norms can be invoked to dissipate or\nauthoritatively resolve conflicts between values (as Michael Oakeshott\nsuggested when he appealed to the ‘intimations’ of\ntradition as a way of resolving apparent conflicts generated by\nattempts at ‘rational’ action: see Oakeshott 1962,\n125–34; Oakeshott 1965). But Berlin did hold that, as an\nempirical matter, most individuals do make decisions about how to\nbalance, reconcile, or choose between competing values in light of\ntheir existing general commitments and visions of life, which are\nshaped (though not completely determined) by cultural tradition and\ncontext. Liberty may be a genuine, and important, good for human\nbeings in general; but how human beings decide to promote or actualise\nliberty in relation to a whole web of other values will differ between\ndifferent societies. \nYet the charge that pluralism is equivalent to relativism is not so\neasily refuted, given certain ambiguities in Berlin’s account.\nThese centre on the nature and origins of values, the related question\nof the role of cultural norms, and the meaning of\n‘incommensurability’.  \nAs stated above, Berlin held both that values are human creations, and\nthat they are ‘objective’. The foundation for this latter\nclaim is unclear in Berlin’s work. The claim that values are\nobjective in being founded on (or expressions of) and limited by\ncertain realities of human nature would seem to provide a defence\nagainst relativism, in holding that there is an underlying, shared\nhuman nature which makes at least some values non-relative. The\nargument that values are objective simply because they are pursued by\nhuman beings may seem to allow for relativism, if it makes the\nvalidity of values dependent on nothing but human preferences, and\nallows any values actually pursued by human beings (and, therefore,\nany practices adopted in pursuing those values) to claim\n validity.[19]\n But this is a reductio ad absurdum, to be deflected by\nadding two further considerations: how widespread aspirant universal\nvalues are; and whether they can be justified in terms of some\nrationally defensible conception of human welfare. \nOne of the knottiest dimensions of Berlin’s pluralism is the\nidea of incommensurability, which has led to diverging\ninterpretations. One can make a three-way distinction, between weak\nincommensurability, moderate incommensurability and radical\nincommensurability. Weak incommensurability is the view that values\ncannot be ranked quantitatively, but can be arranged in a qualitative\nhierarchy that applies consistently in all cases. Berlin goes further\nthan this, but it is not clear whether he presents a moderate or a\nradical version of incommensurability. The former holds that there is\nno single, ultimate scale or principle with which to measure values\n– no moral ‘slide-rule’ (2002b, 216) or universal\nunit of normative measurement. This view is certainly consistent with\nall that Berlin wrote from the 1930s onwards. Such a view does not\nnecessarily rule out making judgements between values on a\ncase-by-case basis: just because values can’t be compared or\nranked in terms of one master-value or formula, we can’t\nconclude that it is impossible to compare or deliberate between them\nat all, as we indeed do in actual cases. \nBerlin does sometimes offer more starkly dramatic accounts of\nincommensurability, which make it hard to rule out the more radical\ninterpretation of the concept, according to which incommensurability\nis more or less synonymous with incomparability. This interpretation\nstates that values cannot be compared at all, since there is no\n‘common currency’ in terms of which to compare them: each\nvalue, being sui generis, cannot be judged in relation to any\nother value, because there is nothing in relation to which both can be\njudged or measured. As a result, choices among values cannot be based\non (objectively valid) evaluative comparisons, but only on personal\npreference, or on an act of radical, arbitrary choice, which Berlin\nsometimes calls ‘plumping’. But plumping need not be a\ndisembodied, inexplicable act: it can draw, albeit subconsciously, on\na hinterland of moral understanding rooted in the moral experience of\nthe plumper and in his cultural tradition. \nA related question concerns the role of reason in moral deliberation.\nIf values are incommensurable, must all choices between conflicting\nvalues be ultimately subjective or irrational? If so, how does\npluralism differ from radical relativism and subjectivism? If not,\nhow, exactly, does moral reasoning work? How can we rationally make\nchoices between values when there is no system or unit of measurement\nthat can be used in making such deliberations? One possible answer to\nthe last question is to offer an account of practical, situational\nreasoning that is not quantitative or rule-based, but appeals to the\nmoral sense mentioned above. This is what Berlin suggests; but, once\nagain, he does not offer a systematic explanation of the nature of\nnon-systematic reason. (On incommensurability see Chang 1997 and\nCrowder 2002.)  \nIn the area of political philosophy, the most widespread controversy\nover pluralism concerns its relationship to liberalism. This debate\noverlaps with that regarding pluralism’s relationship to\nrelativism, to the extent that liberalism is regarded as resting on a\nbelief in certain universal values and fundamental human rights, a\nbelief which relativism undermines. However, there are some who\nmaintain that, while pluralism is distinct from, and preferable to,\nrelativism, it is nevertheless too radical, contested and subversive\nto be be depended on for a justification of liberalism (or,\nconversely, that liberalism is too universalistic or absolutist to be\nlinked to pluralism). The main proponent of this view, more\nresponsible than any other thinker for the emergence and wide\ndiscussion of this issue, is John Gray (see, especially, Gray 1995).\nGray asserts that pluralism is true, that pluralism undermines\nliberalism, and that therefore liberalism should be abandoned, at\nleast in its traditional role of a political philosophy claiming\nuniversal\n status.[20] \nGray’s case has spawned a vast literature, concerning both\nBerlin’s own treatment of the relationship between pluralism and\nliberalism in particular, and this issue in general. Some theorists\nhave agreed with Gray (Kekes, 1993, 1997); others have sought to show\nthat pluralism and liberalism are reconcilable, although this\nreconciliation may require modifications to both liberalism and\npluralism – modifications that are, however, justifiable, and\nindeed inherently desirable. The most extensive discussions to date\nare those by George Crowder and William Galston (Crowder 2002, 2004, 2019,\nGalston 2002,\n 2004).[21] \nBerlin himself was devoted both to pluralism and to liberalism, which\nhe saw not as related by logical entailment (though he sometimes comes\nclose to positing this: e.g. 2002b, 216; Jahanbegloo 1992, 44), but as\ninterconnected and harmonious. The version of pluralism he advanced\nwas distinctly liberal in its assumptions, aims and conclusions, just\nas his liberalism was distinctly pluralist. As Michael Walzer has\nremarked, Berlin’s pluralism is characterised by\n‘receptivity, generosity, and scepticism’, which are,\n‘if not liberal values, then qualities of mind that make it\n[…] likely that liberal values will be accepted’ (Galston\n2002, 60–1; Walzer 1995, 31).  \nBerlin’s best-known contribution to political theory is his\nessay on the distinction between positive and negative liberty. This\ndistinction is explained, and the vast literature on it summarised,\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia; the following therefore focuses only\non Berlin’s original argument, which has often been\nmisunderstood, in part because of his own ambiguities. It should be\nstressed that the essay in question is principally concerned with\npolitical liberty, not with what, late in life, he dubbed\n‘basic liberty’, which is freedom of choice (or free\nwill), without which any other kinds of liberty would be impossible:\nindeed, ‘which men cannot be without and remain men’ (A\n518; cf. UD 218, CTH2 309, and 2.4 above). \nIn Two Concepts of Liberty Berlin sought to explain the\ndifference between two (out of more than two hundred, he said)\ndifferent ways of thinking about political liberty. These, he said,\nhad run through modern thought, and were central to the ideological\nstruggles of his day. Berlin called these two conceptions of liberty\nnegative and\n positive.[22]\n Berlin’s treatment of these concepts was less than fully\neven-handed from the start: while he defined negative liberty fairly\nclearly and simply, he gave positive liberty two different basic\ndefinitions, from which still more distinct conceptions would branch\nout. Negative liberty Berlin initially defined as freedom\nfrom, that is, the absence of constraints on the agent imposed by\nother people. Positive liberty he defined both as freedom to,\nthat is, the ability (not just the opportunity) to pursue and achieve\nwilled goals; and also as autonomy or self-rule, as opposed to\ndependence on others. These are not the same. \nBerlin’s account was further complicated by combining conceptual\nanalysis with history. He associated negative liberty with the liberal\ntradition as it had emerged and developed in Britain and France from\nthe seventeenth century to the early nineteenth. He later regretted\nthat he had not made more of the evils that negative liberty had been\nused to justify, such as exploitation under laissez-faire capitalism;\nin Two Concepts, however, negative liberty is portrayed\nfavourably, and briefly. It is on positive liberty that Berlin\nfocused, since it was, he claimed, both a more ambiguous concept, and\none which had been subject to greater and more sinister\ntransformation, and ultimately perversion. \nBerlin traced positive liberty back to theories that focus on the\nautonomy, or capacity for self-rule, of the\n agent.[23]\n Of these, he found Rousseau’s theory of liberty particularly\ndangerous. For, in Berlin’s account, Rousseau had equated\nfreedom with self-rule, and self-rule with obedience to the so-called\n‘general will’. By this, Berlin alleged, Rousseau meant,\nessentially, the common or public interest – that is, what was\nbest for all citizens qua citizens. The general will was quite\nindependent of, and would often be at odds with, the selfish wills of\nindividuals, who, Rousseau charged, were often deluded as to their own\ngenuine interests.  \nThis view clashed with Berlin’s political and moral outlook in\ntwo ways. First, it posited the existence of a unique,\n‘true’ public interest, a single set of arrangements that\nwas best for all citizens, and was thus opposed to the main thrust of\npluralism. Second, it rested on a bogus transformation of the concept\nof the self. In his doctrine of the general will Rousseau moved from\nthe conventional and, Berlin insisted, correct view of the self as\nindividual to the self as citizen – which for Rousseau meant the\nindividual as member of a larger community, an individual whose\nidentity and well-being were exactly the same as those of the larger\ncommunity. Rousseau transformed the concept of the self’s will\nfrom what the empirical individual actually desires to what the\nindividual as citizen ought to desire, that is, what is in\nindividuals’ real best interest, whether they realise it or\nnot. \nFor Berlin, this transformation became more sinister still in the\nhands of Kant’s German disciples. Kant himself had identified\n‘positive’ freedom with autonomy, or self-determination,\nby the rational personality – the self freed from all that\nrenders it ‘heteronymous’ and irrational. Later German\nphilosophers influenced by Kant went further in identifying the\n‘self’ whose self-determination constitutes freedom with\nentities other than the individual. Freedom becomes a matter of\novercoming the poor, flawed, false, empirical self – what one\nappears to be and want – in order to realise one’s\n‘true’, ‘real’, ‘noumenal’ self.\nThis ‘true’ self may be identified with one’s best\nor true interests, either as an individual or as a member of a larger\ngroup or institution. Thus Fichte (who began as a radically\nindividualist liberal, only to become, later, an ardent, even\nhysterical, nationalist – an intellectual forefather of Fascism\nand even Nazism) came to equate freedom with the rule of the\n‘true’ self understood as the nation, or Volk. On\nthis view, the individual achieves freedom only through renunciation\nof his or her desires and beliefs as an individual and submersion in a\nlarger group. The ‘true’ self might also be identified\nwith a cause, an idea, or the dictates of rationality, as in the case\nof Hegel’s definition of liberty, which equated it with\nrecognition of, and obedience to, the laws of history as revealed by\nreason. Such theoretical shifts set the stage, for Berlin, for the\nideologies of the totalitarian movements of the twentieth century,\nboth Communist and Fascist–Nazi, which claimed to liberate\npeople by subjecting – and often sacrificing – them to\nlarger groups or principles. To do this was the greatest of political\nevils; and to do it in the name of freedom, a political principle that\nBerlin, as a genuine liberal, especially cherished, struck him as a\n‘strange […] reversal’ or ‘monstrous\nimpersonation’ (2002b, 198, 180). Against this, Berlin\nchampioned, as ‘truer and more humane’, negative liberty\nand an empirical view of the self. \nThis account is subject to serious and plausible objections, on both\nhistorical and conceptual grounds. But beyond the considerable debates\nconcerning the conceptual validity and historical accuracy of\nBerlin’s account (extensively documented in Harris 2002 and\nCrowder 2016), there is considerable misunderstanding of\nBerlin’s own attitudes to the concepts he discussed, and of the\ngoals of his lecture. Berlin has often been interpreted, not entirely\nunreasonably, as a staunch enemy of the concept of positive liberty.\nThis was simply false, and elides opposition to distortions of\npositive liberty with opposition to positive liberty itself. Berlin\nregarded both concepts of liberty as centring on valid claims about\nwhat is necessary and good for human beings; both negative and\npositive liberty were for him genuine values, which might in some\ncases clash, but in other cases could be combined and might even be\nmutually interdependent. Indeed, Berlin’s own earlier\narticulations of his political values included a notable component of\npositive liberty alongside negative liberty (see e.g. 2002b,\n336–44). What Berlin attacked were the many ways in which\npositive liberty had been used to justify the denial, betrayal or\nabandonment of both negative liberty and the undistorted forms of\npositive liberty itself. Berlin’s main targets were not positive\nliberty as such, but the metaphysical or psychological assumptions\nwhich, combined with the concept of positive liberty, had led to its\nperversion: monism, and a metaphysical or collective conception of the\nself. Two Concepts of Liberty, and Berlin’s liberalism,\nare therefore based not on championing negative liberty against\npositive liberty, but on advocating individualism, empiricism and\npluralism against collectivism, holism, metaphysical rationalism (cf.\nnote 14a) and monism. \nIn Berlin’s account, the main connection between pluralism and\nliberalism is the centrality of choice to both. His argument goes as\nfollows. The conflicts between values and ways of life that are the\nsubject matter of pluralism require people to make choices. These\nchoices are of the utmost importance, because they involve the most\nbasic and essential questions of human life – what one is to be\nand do. Those who have to make such choices are therefore likely to\ncare about them, and to want to be the ones to make them.\nFurthermore, the freedom and ability to make one’s own choices\nbetween conflicting values and possible lives is the crux of\none’s identity as a moral agent. (This step of the argument, it\nshould be noticed, does not strictly follow from pluralism itself; but\nit is an assumption central to Berlin’s moral individualism,\nwhich Berlin imports into his pluralism.) \nWhy might one deny individuals the opportunity to make choices for\nthemselves? One possible answer (though not the only one) is that\nindividuals may make the wrong choices, so that it is necessary to\ncoerce or manipulate them into choosing correctly. But pluralism holds\nthat, where there are conflicts between genuine values, there may be\nno single right choice – more than one choice may equally serve\ngenuine human values and interests, even if they also involve the\nsacrifice or violation of other values or interests that are neither\nmore nor less true and important. Similarly, there is no single ideal\nlife, no single model of how to think or behave or be, to which people\nshould attempt, or be brought, to conform. There are indeed chooseable\noptions that are beyond the pale from any humane viewpoint, and these\nmay reasonably be blocked off. But the limits of humanity should not\nbe confused with the limits of a particular perspective as against\nother reasonable possibilities that lie within the ‘human\nhorizon’. \nPluralism, then, for Berlin, both undermines one of the main\nrationales for violating freedom of choice, and corroborates the\nimportance and value of being able to make choices\n freely.[24]\n Some interpreters have argued that the high value that Berlin accords\nto the freedom to choose, while it rests in part on his pluralism,\nalso requires the addition of moral principles, ideals and assumptions\nexternal to pluralism (though this need not, contra John Gray, mean\nthat pluralism is incompatible with, or necessary undermines,\nliberalism). Others (such as George Crowder) have argued that\nBerlin’s liberalism can be deduced from his pluralism alone, though more recently Crowder has modified his view, now holding that pluralism justifies liberalism only under the historical conditions of modernity (2019, 105–12, 135–8, 221–2). \nAt the same time, while pluralism is a key ingredient in\nBerlin’s argument for the importance of liberty, it also\nmodifies and moderates his liberalism, and prevents Berlin from being\n(as many proponents of negative liberty in the twentieth century and\nafter have been) a dogmatic, unqualified classical liberal or\nlibertarian. Negative and positive liberty are both genuine values\nwhich must be balanced against each other; and political liberty of\nany sort is one value among many, with which it may conflict, and\nagainst which it needs to be weighed. Berlin was more sensitive than\nmany classical liberal or libertarian thinkers to the fact that\ngenuine liberty may conflict with genuine equality, or justice, or\npublic order, or security, or efficiency, or happiness, and therefore\nmust be balanced against, and sometimes sacrificed in favour of, other\nvalues. Berlin’s liberalism includes both a conservative or\npragmatic appreciation of the importance of maintaining a balance\nbetween different values, and a social-democratic appreciation of the\nneed to restrict liberty in some cases so as to promote equality and\njustice, and to protect the weak against victimisation by the strong\n(see 2002b, 214–15). Nevertheless Berlin remains a liberal in\nmaintaining that the preservation of a certain minimum of individual\nliberty is a political priority. He justifies this view by an appeal\nto an empiricist version of a natural law argument, writing of the\nexistence of ‘natural rights’ based on the way that human\nbeings are constituted, mentally or physically; to attempt to alter or\nlimit human life in certain ways is to block the desires, goals,\naspirations inherent in being human as we know it (1996, 90–2).\nTo deprive human beings of certain basic rights is to dehumanise them.\nWhile liberty should not be the only good pursued by society, and\nwhile it should not always trump other values, ethical pluralism lends\nit a special importance: for people must be free in order to allow for\nthe recognition and pursuit of all genuine human values. Society\nshould therefore make it a priority to provide the liberty necessary\nfor Millian ‘experiments in living’ and for the\nperpetuation of social and personal variety (see Berlin 2002b,\n218–51). \nSection VI of Two Concepts of Liberty is an ambivalent\ndiscussion of the ideals of national self-rule and ‘national\nliberation’, suggesting that these should not be identified with\nliberty, strictly speaking, but nevertheless reflect deep human needs\nfor belonging and recognition as members of a self-ruling group (see\nalso 2002a, 229). Berlin used the term ‘nationalism’\nsomewhat confusingly, to refer to two quite distinct, and morally very\ndifferent, phenomena. The first of these was what he also called\n‘national consciousness’, the sense of belonging, of\ncollective identity, of which Herder had written. The second was the\n‘inflamed’ form of this sentiment, which, feeding off of\nresentment, frustration and humiliation, became\n‘pathological’. Berlin was sympathetic to the former,\ncritical of the latter, but he recognised the relationship between the\ntwo, and was thus aware of the power and allure of nationalism. \nAlthough Berlin traced to Herder the insight that belonging, and the\nsense of self-expression that membership bestows, are basic human\nneeds, it seems unlikely that he would have had to learn this lesson\nfrom him. It is more probable that it was his own appreciation of\nthese needs that attracted him to that author in the first place. He\nwas sharply aware of the pain of humiliation and dependency, the\nhatefulness and hurtfulness of paternalistic rule. His individualism\nand emphasis on liberty were qualified not only by his awareness of\nthe extent to which we are social beings whose identities are partly\ndetermined by the way we are regarded by others (2002b, 201), but also\nby his understanding of the human need for a sense of belonging to a\ncommunity – an awareness sharpened, if not generated, by his own\nexperience of exile, as well as by the influence of his mother’s\npassionate\n Zionism.[25] \nApart from his better-known writings on liberty and pluralism,\nBerlin’s political thought centred on two interrelated topics:\nthe nature of political judgement, and the ethics of political action.\nBerlin addressed the former subject both directly and through his\nwritings on individual statesmen who exemplified different sorts of\nsuccessful political judgement (see the portraits collected in Berlin\n1980, and Hanley 2004).  \nBerlin disputed the idea that political judgement was a body of\nknowledge which could be reduced to rules. Political action should be\nbased on a ‘sense of reality’ founded on experience,\nempathetic understanding of others, sensitivity to the social and\npolitical environment, and personal judgement about what is true or\nuntrue, significant or trivial, alterable or unalterable, effective or\nuseless, etc. Such judgement necessarily involves personal instinct\nand flair, ‘strokes of unanalysable genius’. In the realm\nof political action, laws are few and skill is all (1996, 53).  \nLike the study of history, political judgement involves reaching an\nunderstanding of the unique set of characteristics that constitute a\nparticular individual, atmosphere, state of affairs or event (ibid.,\n56). This requires a capacity for integrating ‘a vast amalgam of\nconstantly changing, multicoloured, evanescent, perpetually\noverlapping data’, a ‘direct, almost sensuous contact with\nthe relevant data’, and ‘an acute sense of what fits with\nwhat, what springs from what, what leads to what; […] what the\nresult is likely to be in a concrete situation of the interplay of\nhuman beings and impersonal forces’ (ibid., 57–8). Such a\nsense is qualitative rather than quantitative, specific rather than\ngeneral, for all that it may be built on past experience. \nThe faculty that allows for such judgement is, Berlin insists, not\nmetaphysical, but ‘ordinary, empirical, and\nquasi-aesthetic’ (ibid., 57). This sense is distinct from any\nsort of ethical sense; it could be possessed or lacked by both\nvirtuous and villainous politicians. Recognition of the importance of\nthis sense of political reality should not discourage the spirit of\nscientific enquiry or serve as an excuse for obscurantism. But it\nshould discourage the attempt to transform political action into the\napplication of scientific principles, and government into technocratic\n administration.[26] \nBerlin intended his writings on political judgement as a warning to\npolitical theorists not to overreach themselves. Political theory can\ndo much good in helping us to make sense of politics. But political\naction is a practical matter, which should not, and cannot, be founded\non, or dictated by, general principles established through abstract\ntheorising.  \nBerlin’s writings on political judgement, activity and\nleadership are of a piece with his larger epistemological project: to\nbring to light the tension between abstract or a priori theory and\ndirect perception; and to warn against the dangers of the former and\nassert the importance of the latter. While he acknowledged that it was\nimpossible to think without the use of analogies and metaphors, that\nthought necessarily involves generalisation and comparison, he warned\nthat it was important to be cautious, self-conscious and critical in\nthe use of general models and analogies (see 1978b, 207–8).\nThese writings also reassert the message of the youthful essay\n‘Some Procrustations’ (1930, discussed in 4.3 above): that\nthe same rules should not be automatically applied to every facet of\nhuman life. Rationality consists of the application, not of a single\ntechnique or set of rules, but of those methods that have proven to\nwork best in each particular field or situation. This view of\npolitical judgement also relates to Berlin’s attempt to\nvindicate the importance of individual agency and personality, by\ninsisting that political judgement is a personal quality, and\neffective political activity a matter of personal consideration,\ndecision and action rather than (or at least in addition to)\nimpersonal administration or the deployment of institutional\nmachinery. \nWhile Berlin emphasised the place of questions about the proper ends\nof political action in the subject matter of political theory, he also\nrecognised the importance of discussions of the proper means to\nemploy, and the relationship between these and the ends at which they\naim. Berlin did not treat this question – the question of\npolitical ethics – directly in his work; nor did he offer simple\nor confident answers to the perennial questions of the morality of\npolitical action. Nevertheless, he did advance some theses about this\nbranch of morality; and these were among his most heartfelt\npronouncements. \nBerlin’s primary mouthpiece for these messages was Alexander\nHerzen, the nineteenth-century Russian radical\n publicist.[27]\n The words of Herzen that Berlin repeated most insistently were those\ncondemning the sacrifice of human beings on the altar of abstractions,\nthe subordination of the realities of individual happiness or\nunhappiness in the present to glorious but fantastical dreams of the\nfuture (Berlin 1990, 16–17; Berlin also quoted similar\nsentiments from Benjamin Constant: see Berlin 2002b, 3, as well as\n1978a, 93–129 and 212–39 passim). The first\nprinciple of Berlin’s political ethics was to oppose such\nsubordination, which Berlin viewed as the essence of fanaticism, and a\nrecipe for inhumanity that was as futile as it was horrible. \nBerlin, like Herzen, believed that ‘the goal of life is life\nitself’ (1978a, 221; Herzen 1842, 217), and that each life and\neach age should be regarded as its own end and not as a means to some\nfuture goal. To this he added a caution (evocative as much of Max\nWeber as of Herzen) about the unpredictability of the future.\nBerlin’s belief in the power of human agency was qualified by an\nawareness of how the consequences of any course of action are\nunknowable, and likely to be quite different from what was intended.\nThis led him, on the one hand, to stress the need for caution and\nmoderation; and, on the other, to insist that uncertainty is\ninescapable, so that all action, however carefully undertaken,\ninvolves the risk of error, and of disastrous, or at least unexpected\nand troubling, consequences. The result was an ethic of political\nhumility, similar to Weber’s ethic of responsibility, but\nlacking its tone of grim, stoic grandeur. \nBerlin often noted the dangers of utopianism, and stressed the need\nfor a measure of political pragmatism. He may therefore appear to have\nbeen staunchly in the tradition of ‘political realism’,\ntypically seen as running from Machiavelli (or Thucydides) through to\nrecent scholars, and practitioners, of realpolitik such as E. H. Carr,\nGeorge Kennan or Henry\n Kissinger.[28]\n Yet this was not quite so. Berlin did indeed seek to warn against the\ndangers of idealism, and to chasten it, in order to save it from\nitself and better defend it against cynicism. But in writing of\n‘realism in politics’ he distinguished between a correct\nperception of reality, free of emotional distortions, and another,\n‘more sinister’ sense of the term, deployed by people who\nadmitted to being ‘realists’, ‘usually to explain\naway some unusually mean or brutal decision’. In this sense,\n‘realistic’ had come to mean ‘harsh and brutal, not\nshrinking from what is usually considered immoral, not swayed by soft\nsentimental moral considerations’; it was also identified, in\nBerlin’s mind, with the ‘identification of what is good\nand what is successful’, and a tendency to celebrate ‘the\nbig battalions, marching down a broad avenue, with all the unfulfilled\npossibilities, all the martyrs and visionaries, wiped out’\n(2000a, 163; 2002a, 103–6). While he insisted on the importance\nof a ‘sense of reality’, Berlin was highly critical of the\nsecond form of ‘political realism’, which scornfully\ndisregarded moral ideals or scruples, and embraced dubious means to\nachieve desired ends. He also saw this sort of cynical, brutal realism\nas a powerful political force in the world (2002b, 343–4; see\nalso Cherniss 2013, 67–87, 112–21, and Cherniss 2018). \n‘Realism’ understood as a justification for cynical and\nbrutal conduct was, according to Berlin, not only morally repulsive,\nbut unrealistic, in so far as it rested on an assumption that one\ncould achieve truly desirable ends through the use of morally wicked\nmeans; against this, Berlin asserted that ‘evil means destroy\ngood ends’ (1978a, 345). Indeed, the problem of the relationship\nbetween ends and means runs through his writings. Characteristically,\nhe warned against both an insistence on total political purity –\nfor, when values conflict and consequences are often unexpected,\npurity is an impossible ideal – and a disregard for the ethical\nniceties of political means. He regarded the latter attitude as not\nonly morally ugly, but foolish: for good ends tend to be corrupted and\nundermined by unscrupulous means. Furthermore, since the consequences\nof actions are so uncertain, political actors often don’t\nachieve their goals, or they achieve them imperfectly; so it is best\nnot to make too many sacrifices in the course of accomplishing\none’s political goals, since that accomplishment is uncertain.\nTo the realist argument that ‘You cannot make an omelette\nwithout breaking eggs’, Berlin responded: ‘The one thing\nthat we may be sure of is the reality of the sacrifice, the dying and\nthe dead. But the ideal for the sake of which they die remains\nunrealised. The eggs are broken, and the habit of breaking them grows,\nbut the omelette remains invisible’ (1990, 17).  \nBerlin was thoroughly anti-absolutist; but he did insist that there\nwere certain actions that were, except in the most drastic of\nsituations, unacceptable. Foremost among these were the manipulation\nand humiliation of individuals by others, to the extent that those who\nare ‘got at’ or ‘tampered with’ by others are\ndeprived of their humanity (see 2002b, 184, 337, 339, 341–2).\nBerlin also warned particularly against the use of violence. He\nacknowledged that the use of force was sometimes necessary and\njustified; but he also reminded his readers that violence has\nparticularly volatile and unpredictable consequences, and tends to\nspiral out of control, leading to terrible destruction and suffering,\nand undermining the noble goals it seeks to achieve. He also stressed\nthe dangers of paternalistic, or otherwise humiliating and\ndisempowering, attempts to institute reform or achieve improvement,\nwhich had a tendency to inspire a backlash of hatred and\nresistance. \nBerlin’s political ethics are best summarised in his own\nwords: \nBerlin’s life and work continue to be the subject of\nconsiderable attention. This attention has yet to yield a settled\nconsensus about the merits or the meaning of Berlin’s work\n– and not only because Berlin evokes strong personal reactions,\nattracting admiration and affection, if not outright veneration as a\nliberal saint (see e.g. Annan 1980, 1990, 1999; Hausheer 1979 and\n2004), and inspiring hostility from critics on both the right and\nleft, who have detected in Berlin’s stance complacency,\nhypocrisy, a want of courage and an excess of tolerance (see e.g.\nScruton 1989, Hitchens 1998). This is to be expected, given\nBerlin’s fierce opposition to Communism, combined with his\nrefusal to ally himself to extreme anti-Communism, as well as his\nambivalence or reticence on many divisive political issues of his own\nday. \nHowever, even as the ideological battles of the Cold War recede into\nthe past (not everywhere: in post-Communist Europe, in China and\nelsewhere they are still very much alive), Berlin remains the object\nof varying interpretations and evaluations. This may appear odd in a\nthinker who wrote clearly, and without obfuscating jargon. But it is\nunsurprising, given the complexity of Berlin’s vision, his\naversion to systematic exposition or theorising, the multifaceted\nnature of his work, and the uniqueness of his position in the\nintellectual life of his times. These qualities make it difficult not\nonly to evaluate Berlin, but also to situate him in the history of\nideas; for he appears at once typical and atypical of the period in\nwhich he lived, and also both ahead of his time and somewhat\nold-fashioned. \nIn his youth, Berlin’s intellectual development followed that of\nEnglish-language philosophy; yet he drifted away from the analytic\nphilosophy in which he had once been deeply involved, and his later\nwritings are a world away from most Anglo-American philosophy of their\ntime. On the other hand, for all his range of historical and cultural\nreference, and his concern with moral and aesthetic questions, and\ndespite the influence of Kant and Kant’s successors on his\nthought, Berlin seems out of place in the world of Continental\nphilosophy. Yet it would be a mistake to accept Berlin’s own\njudgement that he had departed from the realm of philosophy\naltogether. For both the views he had formed while working as a\nprofessional philosopher, and his tendency to connect political,\nhistorical and cultural issues to deeper moral and epistemological\nquestions, set his work apart from that of other historians and\n‘public intellectuals’ of his day. \nBerlin was, for much of his life, an intellectually lonely figure,\npursuing the history of ideas in an academic setting that was\nunreceptive to it, and advocating a moderate liberalism in a time\ndominated by ideological extremism. And yet this plea for moderation\nand advocacy of liberalism was shared and taken up by many others at\nthe\n time.[29]\n His interest in political philosophy and his dedication to the\ndefence of liberalism anticipated the work of John Rawls (who had been\ninfluenced by Berlin during a stay at Oxford while a young academic);\nyet the resurgence of normative political theory initiated by\nRawls’s work coincided with a period of eclipse in\nBerlin’s reputation. Berlin’s concern with the nature of\nculture anticipated the centrality in political theory of questions of\nidentity and membership that began in the 1990s; his sympathy for the\nsentiments and needs underlying nationalism, which set him apart from\nmany liberal theorists of his own time, presaged the revival of\n‘liberal nationalism’ in the works of younger thinkers\nsuch as Michael Walzer, David Miller, Yael Tamir and Michael\nIgnatieff. His attack on monism, on the quest for certainty and the\nproject of systematic knowledge, has led him to be embraced by some\ncritics of foundationalism such as Richard Rorty and John Gray. Yet\nBerlin’s work remains difficult to assimilate to intellectual\nmovements or projects such as postmodernism or multiculturalism, the\nexcesses and obscurities of which provoked quizzical scepticism in him\ntowards the end of his life. \nNor is Berlin easy to identify seamlessly with those intellectual\npositions that he explicitly propounded – liberalism and\npluralism. Although he appears as an important, and indeed emblematic,\nexponent of liberalism – along with Rawls, the most important\nliberal theorist of his century – his ideas may nevertheless in\nthe end help to undermine, or at least challenge, conventional, often\nmonistic, liberalism. This question has come to preoccupy many readers\nof Berlin’s work, and predominate in discussions of his legacy,\nto the extent of threatening to overshadow other aspects of his\nthought. \nThe debate over pluralism and liberalism raises important conceptual\nissues; yet it becomes somewhat misleading, both in itself and\nparticularly as a guide to Berlin’s thought, if pluralism and\nliberalism are taken to be comprehensive doctrines, or if they are\nreified into independently existing, systematic entities.\n‘Pluralism’ and ‘liberalism’ as general terms\nare abstractions which can help to group, analyse and compare the\npositions of different thinkers, or to characterise different facets\nof the thought of a single thinker. Neither, however, is likely to\ncapture the whole of an individual position; and neither in itself\nencompasses or sums up Berlin’s own outlook.  \nBerlin himself insisted that political and ethical theories arise from\na thinker’s basic conception of human nature, which in turn is\nfounded on an entire philosophical outlook, a conception of the nature\nof the universe, reality, knowledge etc. The vision underlying\nBerlin’s political and ethical theory, while it may have been\ncoherent (this is itself arguable), was not systematic, and, again, it\ncannot be accurately characterised simply as pluralistic or liberal.\n‘Pluralism’ can be used, more narrowly, to describe\nBerlin’s theory of values. It can also be employed more broadly,\nto capture something of his vision of reality, the universe and human\nnature – that is, the view that all of these things are\ncomplexes made up of separate and conflicting parts: that the self is\nprotean and open-ended, that the universe is not a harmonious cosmos,\nthat reality presents many separate aspects, which can and should be\nviewed from different perspectives. But ‘pluralism’, as\nexplicitly defined by Berlin and others, does not cover Berlin’s\nempiricism, or his historicism, or his awareness of the fallibility of\nhuman knowledge, or his belief in the primary importance of\nindividuals as opposed to generalisations and abstractions, or his\nemphasis on the importance of free choice (which, while he sought to\nfound it on pluralism, in fact appears to be partly independent of\nit). Nor does pluralism, with its emphasis on the place of tragic\nconflict and loss in human life, capture the affirmative zest for life\nand delighted enthusiasm for human beings that was central to\nBerlin’s persona as a man and thinker. Berlin’s thought,\nlike his writing, is made up both of swathes of sharp colour and of\nminutely variegated and subtle shades of light and darkness; it thus\nresists summary and simple conclusions, and repays persistent and\nopen-ended study.","contact.mail":"henry.hardy@wolfson.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"wolfson.ox.ac.uk"}]
