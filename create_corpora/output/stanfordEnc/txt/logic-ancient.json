In Greek\nand Roman antiquity, discussions of some elements of logic and a focus\non methods of inference can be traced back to the late 5th\ncentury BCE.  The Sophists, and later Plato (early 4th c.)\ndisplayed an interest in sentence analysis, truth, and fallacies, and\nEubulides of Miletus (mid-4th c.) is on record as the\ninventor of both the Liar and the Sorites paradox. But logic as a\nfully systematic discipline begins with Aristotle, who systematized\nmuch of the logical inquiry of his predecessors. His main achievements\nwere his theory of the logical interrelation of affirmative and\nnegative existential and universal statements and, based on this\ntheory, his syllogistic, which can be interpreted as a system of\ndeductive inference.  Aristotle’s logic is known as term-logic, since\nit is concerned with the logical relations between terms, such as\n‘human being’, ‘animal’,\n‘white’. It shares elements with both set theory and\npredicate logic. Aristotle’s successors in his school, the Peripatos,\nnotably Theophrastus and Eudemus, widened the scope of deductive\ninference and improved some aspects of Aristotle’s logic.\n\n\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, and apparently independent of Aristotle’s\nachievements, the logician Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo (see\nthe entry\n Dialectical school)\n worked out the beginnings of a logic that took propositions, rather\nthan terms, as its basic elements. They influenced the second major\ntheorist of logic in antiquity, the Stoic Chrysippus\n(mid-3rd c.), whose main achievement is the development of\na propositional logic, crowned by a deductive system. Regarded by many\nin antiquity as the greatest logician, he was innovative in a large\nnumber of topics that are central to contemporary formal and\nphilosophical logic. The many close similarities between Chrysippus’\nphilosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially\nstriking. Chrysippus’ Stoic successors systematized his logic, and\nmade some additions.\n\n\n\nThe development of logic from c. 100 BCE to c. 250 CE remains mostly\nin the dark, but there can be no doubt that logic was one of the\ntopics regularly studied and researched. At some point Peripatetics\nand Stoics began taking notice of each other’s logical systems, and we\nwitness some conflation of both terminologies and theories.\nAristotelian syllogistic became known as ‘categorical\nsyllogistic’ and the Peripatetic adaptation of Stoic syllogistic\nas ‘hypothetical syllogistic’. In the 2nd\ncentury CE, Galen attempted to synthesize the two traditions; he also\nprofessed to have introduced a third kind of syllogism, the\n‘relational syllogism’, which apparently was meant to help\nformalize mathematical reasoning. The attempt of some Middle\nPlatonists (1st c. BCE–2nd c. CE) to claim\na specifically Platonic logic failed, and in its stead, the\nNeo-Platonists (3rd–6th c. CE) adopted a\nscholasticized version of Aristotelian logic as their own. In the\nmonumental—if rarely creative—volumes of the Greek\ncommentators on Aristotle’s logical works we find elements of Stoic\nand later Peripatetic logic as well as Platonism, and ancient\nmathematics and rhetoric. Much the same holds for the Latin logical\nwritings by Apuleius (2nd c. CE) and Boethius\n(6th c. CE), which pave the way for Aristotelian logic,\nthus supplemented, to enter the Medieval era.\n\n\n\nSome of the Sophists classified types of sentences (logoi)\naccording to their force. So Protagoras (485–415 BCE), who\nincluded wish, question, answer and command (Diels Kranz (DK) 80.A1,\nDiogenes Laertius (D. L.) 9.53–4), and Alcidamas (pupil of\nGorgias, fl. 4th BCE), who distinguished assertion\n(phasis), denial (apophasis), question and address\n(prosagoreusis) (D. L. 9.54). Antisthenes\n(mid-5th–mid-4th cent.) defined a sentence\nas ‘that which indicates what a thing was or is’\n(D. L. 6.3, DK 45) and stated that someone who says what is speaks\ntruly (DK49). Perhaps the earliest surviving passage on logic is found\nin the Dissoi Logoi or Double Arguments (DK 90.4,\nc. 400 BCE). It is evidence for a debate over truth and\nfalsehood. Opposed were the views (i) that truth is\na—temporal—property of sentences, and that a sentence is\ntrue (when it is said), if and only if things are as the sentence says\nthey are when it is said, and false if they aren’t; and (ii) that\ntruth is an atemporal property of what is said, and that what is said\nis true if and only if the things are the case, false if they aren’t\nthe case. These are rudimentary formulations of two alternative\ncorrespondence theories of truth. The same passage displays awareness\nof the fact that self-referential use of the truth-predicate can be\nproblematic—an insight also documented by the discovery of the\nLiar paradox by Eubulides of Miletus (mid-4th c. BCE)\nshortly thereafter. \n\nSome Platonic dialogues contain passages whose topic is indubitably\nlogic. In the Sophist, Plato analyzes simple statements as\ncontaining a verb (rhêma), which indicates action, and\na noun(onoma), which indicates the agent (Soph.\n261e–262a). Anticipating the modern distinction of logical\ntypes, he argues that neither a series of nouns nor a series of verbs\ncan combine into a statement (Soph. 262a–d). Plato also\ndivorces syntax (‘what is a statement?’) from semantics\n(‘when is it true?’). Something (e.g. ‘Theaetetus is\nsitting’) is a statement if it both succeeds in specifying a\nsubject and says something about this subject. Plato thus determines\nsubject and predicate as relational elements in a statement and\nexcludes as statements subject-predicate combinations containing empty\nsubject expressions. Something is a true statement if with reference\nto its subject (Theaetetus) it says of what is (e.g. sitting) that it\nis. Something is a false statement if with reference to its subject it\nsays of something other than what is (e.g. flying), that it is. Here\nPlato produces a sketch of a deflationist theory of truth\n(Soph. 262e–263d; cf. Crat. 385b). He also\ndistinguished negations from affirmations and took the negation\nparticle to have narrow scope: it negates the predicate, not the whole\nsentence (Soph. 257b–c). There are many passages in\nPlato where he struggles to explain certain logical relations:\nfor example his theory that things participate in Forms corresponds to\na rudimentary theory of predication; in the Sophist and\nelsewhere he grapples with the class relations of exclusion, union and\nco-extension; also with the difference between the ‘is’ of\npredication (being) and the ‘is’ of identity (sameness);\nand in Republic 4, 436bff., he anticipates the law of\nnon-contradiction. But his explications of these logical questions are\ncast in metaphysical terms, and so can at most be regarded as\nproto-logical. \n\nPre-Aristotelian evidence for reflection on argument forms and valid\ninference are harder to come by. Both Zeno of Elea (born c. 490 BCE)\nand Socrates (470–399) were famous for the ways in which they\nrefuted an opponent’s view. Their methods display similarities with\nreductio ad absurdum, but neither of them seems to have\ntheorized about their logical procedures. Zeno produced arguments\n(logoi) that manifest variations of the pattern ‘this\n(i.e. the opponent’s view) only if that. But that is impossible. So\nthis is impossible’. Socratic refutation was an exchange of\nquestions and answers in which the opponents would be led, on the\nbasis of their answers, to a conclusion incompatible with their\noriginal claim. Plato institutionalized such disputations into\nstructured, rule-governed verbal contests that became known as\ndialectical argument. The development of a basic logical vocabulary\nfor such contests indicates some reflection upon the patterns of\nargumentation. \n\nThe 5th and early to mid-4th centuries BCE also\nsee great interest in fallacies and logical paradoxes. Besides the\nLiar, Eubulides is said to have been the originator of several other\nlogical paradoxes, including the Sorites. Plato’s Euthydemus\ncontains a large collection of contemporary fallacies. In attempts to\nsolve such logical puzzles, a logical terminology develops here, too,\nand the focus on the difference between valid and invalid arguments\nsets the scene for the search for a criterion of valid\ninference. Finally, it is possible that the shaping of deduction and\nproof in Greek mathematics that begins in the later 5th\ncentury BCE served as an inspiration for Aristotle’s syllogistic. \n\n(For a more detailed account see the entry on\n Aristotle’s Logic\n in this encyclopedia.) Aristotle is the first great logician in the\nhistory of logic. His logic was taught by and large without rival from\nthe 4th to the 19th centuries CE.  Aristotle’s\nlogical works were collected and put in a systematic order by later\nPeripatetics, who entitled them the Organon or\n‘tool’, because they considered logic not a part but\nrather an instrument of philosophy. The Organon contains, in\ntraditional order, the Categories, De\nInterpretatione, Prior Analytics, Posterior\nAnalytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations.\nIn addition, Metaphysics Γ is a logical treatise that\ndiscusses the principle of non-contradiction, and some further logical\ninsights are found scattered throughout Aristotle’s other works, such\nas the Poetics, Rhetoric, De Anima,\nMetaphysics Δ and Θ, and some of the biological\nworks. Some parts of the Categories and Posterior\nAnalytics would today be regarded as metaphysics, epistemology or\nphilosophy of science rather than logic. The traditional arrangement\nof works in the Organon is neither chronological nor\nAristotle’s own. The original chronology cannot be fully recovered\nsince Aristotle seems often to have inserted supplements into earlier\nwritings at a later time. However, by using logical advances as a \ncriterion, we can conjecture that most of the Topics,\nSophistical Refutations, Categories and\nMetaphysics Γ predate the De Interpretatione,\nwhich in turn predates the Prior Analytics and parts of the\nPosterior Analytics. \n\nThe Topics provide a manual for participants in the contests\nof dialectical argument as instituted in the Academy by Plato. Books\n2–7 provide general procedures or rules (topoi) about\nhow to find an argument to establish or refute a given thesis. The\ndescriptions of these procedures—some of which are so general\nthat they resemble logical laws—clearly presuppose a notion of\nlogical form, and Aristotle’s Topics may thus count as the\nearliest surviving logical treatise. The Sophistical\nRefutations are the first systematic classification of fallacies,\nsorted by what logical flaw each type manifests (e.g. equivocation,\nbegging the question, affirming the consequent, secundum\nquid) and how to expose them. \n\nAristotle distinguishes things that have sentential unity through a\ncombination of expressions (‘a horse runs’) from those\nthat do not (‘horse’, ‘runs’); the latter are\ndealt with in the Categories (the title really means\n ‘predications’[1]).\n They have no truth-value and signify one of the following: substance\n(ousia), quantity (poson), quality (poion),\nrelation (pros ti), location (pou), time\n(pote), position (keisthai), possession\n(echein), doing (poiein) and undergoing\n(paschein). It is unclear whether Aristotle considers this\nclassification to be one of linguistic expressions that can be\npredicated of something else; or of kinds of predication; or of\nhighest genera. In Topics 1 Aristotle distinguishes four\nrelationships a predicate may have to the subject: it may give its\ndefinition, genus, unique property, or accidental property. These are\nknown as predicables. \n\nWhen writing the De Interpretatione, Aristotle had worked out\nthe following theory of simple sentences: a (declarative) sentence\n(apophantikos logos) or declaration (apophansis) is\ndelimited from other pieces of discourse like prayer, command and\nquestion by its having a truth-value. The truth-bearers that feature\nin Aristotle’s logic are thus linguistic items. They are spoken\nsentences that directly signify thoughts (shared by all humans) and\nthrough these, indirectly, things. Written sentences in turn signify\nspoken ones. (Simple) sentences are constructed from two signifying\nexpressions which stand in subject-predicate relation to each other: a\nname and a verb (‘Callias walks’) or two names connected\nby the copula ‘is’, which co-signifies the connection\n(‘Pleasure is good’) (Int. 3). Names are either\nsingular terms or common nouns (An. Pr. I 27). Both can be\nempty (Cat. 10, Int. 1). Singular terms can only\ntake subject position. Verbs co-signify time. A name-verb sentence can\nbe rephrased with the copula (‘Callias is (a) walking\n(thing)’) (Int. 12). As to their quality, a\n(declarative) sentence is either an affirmation or a negation,\ndepending on whether it affirms or negates its predicate of its\nsubject. The negation particle in a negation has wide scope\n(Cat. 10). Aristotle defined truth separately for\naffirmations and negations: An affirmation is true if it says of that\nwhich is that it is; a negation is true if it says of that which is\nnot that it is not (Met. Γ.7 1011b25ff). These\nformulations, or in any case their Greek counterparts, can be\ninterpreted as expressing either a correspondence or a deflationist\nconception of truth. Either way, truth is a property that belongs to a\nsentence at a given time. As to their quantity, sentences are\nsingular, universal, particular or indefinite. Thus Aristotle obtains\neight types of sentences, which are later dubbed ‘categorical\nsentences’. The following are examples, paired by quality: \n\nUniversal and particular sentences contain a quantifier and both\nuniversal and particular affirmatives were taken to have existential\nimport. (See entry \n The Traditional Square of Opposition). \n The logical\nstatus of the indefinites is ambiguous and controversial\n(Int. 6–7). \n\nAristotle distinguishes between two types of sentential opposition:\ncontraries and contradictories. A contradictory pair of sentences (an\nantiphasis) consists of an affirmation and its negation (i.e.\nthe negation that negates of the subject what the affirmation affirms\nof it). Aristotle assumes that—normally—one of these must\nbe true, the other false. Contrary sentences are such that they cannot\nboth be true. The contradictory of a universal affirmative is the\ncorresponding particular negative; that of the universal negative the\ncorresponding particular affirmative. A universal affirmative and its\ncorresponding universal negative are contraries. Aristotle thus has\ncaptured the basic logical relations between monadic quantifiers\n(Int. 7). \n\nSince Aristotle regards tense as part of the truth-bearer (as opposed\nto merely a grammatical feature), he detects a problem regarding\nfuture tense sentences about contingent matters: Does the principle\nthat of an affirmation and its negation one must be false, the other\ntrue, apply to these? What, for example, is the truth-value now of the\nsentence ‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’? Aristotle\nmay have suggested that the sentence has no truth-value now, and that\nbivalence thus does not hold—despite the fact that it is\nnecessary for there either to be or not to be a sea-battle tomorrow,\nso that the principle of excluded middle is preserved (Int.\n9). \n\nAristotle’s non-modal syllogistic (Prior Analytics A\n1–7) is the pinnacle of his logic. Aristotle defines a syllogism\nas ‘an argument (logos) in which, certain things having\nbeen laid down, something different from what has been laid down\nfollows of necessity because these things are so’. This\ndefinition appears to require (i) that a syllogism consists of at\nleast two premises and a conclusion, (ii) that the conclusion follows\nof necessity from the premises (so that all syllogisms are\nvalid arguments), and (iii) that the conclusion differs from\nthe premises. Aristotle’s syllogistic covers only a small part of all\narguments that satisfy these conditions. \n\nAristotle restricts and regiments the types of categorical sentence\nthat may feature in a syllogism. The admissible truth-bearers are now\ndefined as each containing two different terms (horoi)\nconjoined by the copula, of which one (the predicate term) is said of\nthe other (the subject term) either affirmatively or negatively.\nAristotle never comes clear on the question whether terms are things\n(e.g., non-empty classes) or linguistic expressions for these things.\nOnly universal and particular sentences are discussed. Singular\nsentences seem to be excluded and indefinite sentences are mostly\nignored. At An. Pr. A 7 Aristotle mentions that by substituting an\nindefinite premise for a particular, one obtains a syllogism of\nthe same kind. \n\nAnother innovation in the syllogistic is Aristotle’s use of letters in\nplace of terms. The letters may originally have served simply as\nabbreviations for terms (e.g. An. Post. A 13); but in the\nsyllogistic they seem mostly to have the function either of schematic\nterm letters or of term variables with universal quantifiers assumed\nbut not stated. Where he uses letters, Aristotle tends to express the\nfour types of categorical sentences in the following way (with common\nlater abbreviations in parentheses): \n\nInstead of ‘holds’ he also uses ‘is\npredicated’. \n\nAll basic syllogisms consist of three categorical sentences, in which\nthe two premises share exactly one term, called the middle term, and\nthe conclusion contains the other two terms, sometimes called the\nextremes. Based on the position of the middle term, Aristotle\nclassified all possible premise combinations into three figures\n(schêmata): the first figure has the middle term (B)\nas subject in the first premise and predicated in the second; the\nsecond figure has it predicated in both premises, the third has it as\nsubject in both premises: \n\nA is also called the major term, C the minor\nterm. Each figure can further be classified according to whether or\nnot both premises are universal. Aristotle went systematically through\nthe fifty-eight possible premise combinations and showed that fourteen\nhave a conclusion following of necessity from them, i.e. are\nsyllogisms. His procedure was this: He assumed that the syllogisms of\nthe first figure are complete and not in need of proof, since they are\nevident. By contrast, the syllogisms of the second and third figures\nare incomplete and in need of proof. He proves them by reducing them\nto syllogisms of the first figure and thereby ‘completing’\nthem. For this he makes use of three methods: \n\nFor each of the thirty-four premise combinations that allow no\nconclusion Aristotle proves by counterexample that they allow no\nconclusion. As his overall result, he acknowledges four first figure\nsyllogisms (later named Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio), four second\nfigure syllogisms (Camestres, Cesare, Festino, Baroco) and six third\nfigure syllogisms (Darapti, Felapton, Disamis, Datisi, Bocardo,\nFerison); these were later called the modes or moods of the figures.\n(The names are mnemonics: e.g. each vowel, or the first three in cases\nwhere the name has more than three, indicates in order whether the\nfirst and second premises and the conclusion were sentences of type\na, e, i or o.) Aristotle\nimplicitly recognized that by using the conversion rules on the\nconclusions we obtain eight further syllogisms (An. Pr.\n53a3–14), and that of the premise combinations rejected as\nnon-syllogistic, some (five, in fact) will yield a conclusion in which\nthe minor term is predicated of the major (An. Pr.\n29a19–27). Moreover, in the Topics Aristotle accepted\nthe rules ‘from AaB infer\nAiB’ and ‘from AeB\ninfer AoB’. By using these on the conclusions\nfive further syllogisms could be proved, though Aristotle did not\nmention this. \n\nGoing beyond his basic syllogistic, Aristotle reduced the\n3rd and 4th first figure syllogisms to second\nfigure syllogisms, thus de facto reducing all syllogisms to\nBarbara and Celarent; and later on in the Prior Analytics he\ninvokes a type of cut-rule by which a multi-premise syllogism can be\nreduced to two or more basic syllogisms. From a modern perspective,\nAristotle’s system can be understood as a sequent logic in the style\nof natural deduction and as a fragment of first-order logic. It has\nbeen shown to be sound and complete if one interprets the relations\nexpressed by the categorical sentences set-theoretically as a system\nof non-empty classes as follows: AaB is true if and\nonly if the class A contains the class\nB. AeB is true if and only if the classes\nA and B are disjoint. AiB is true\nif and only if the classes A and B are not\ndisjoint. AoB is true if and only if the class\nA does not contain the class B. It is generally\nagreed, though, that Aristotle’s syllogistic is a kind of relevance\nlogic rather than classical. The vexing textual question what exactly\nAristotle meant by ‘syllogisms’ has received several rival\ninterpretations, including one that they are a certain type of\nconditional propositional form. Most plausibly, perhaps, Aristotle’s\ncomplete and incomplete syllogisms taken together should be\nunderstood as formally valid premise-conclusion arguments; and his\ncomplete and completed syllogisms taken together as (sound)\ndeductions. \n\nAristotle is also the originator of modal logic. In addition to\nquality (as affirmation or negation) and quantity (as singular,\nuniversal, particular, or indefinite), he takes categorical sentences\nto have a mode; this consists of the fact that the predicate is said\nto hold of the subject either actually or necessarily or possibly or\ncontingently or impossibly. The latter four are expressed by modal\noperators that modify the predicate, e.g. ‘It is possible for\nA to hold of some B’; ‘A\nnecessarily holds of every B’. \n\nIn De Interpretatione 12–13, Aristotle (i) concludes\nthat modal operators modify the whole predicate (or the copula, as he\nputs it), not just the predicate term of a sentence. (ii) He states\nthe logical relations that hold between modal operators, such as that\n‘it is not possible for A not to hold of\nB’ implies ‘it is necessary for A to\nhold of B’. (iii) He investigates what the\ncontradictories of modalized sentences are, and decides that they are\nobtained by placing the negator in front of the modal operator. (iv)\nHe equates the expressions ‘possible’ and\n‘contingent’, but wavers between a one-sided\ninterpretation (where necessity implies possibility) and a two-sided\ninterpretation (where possibility implies non-necessity). \n\nAristotle develops his modal syllogistic in Prior Analytics\n1.8–22. He settles on two-sided possibility (contingency) and\ntests for syllogismhood all possible combinations of premise pairs of\nsentences with necessity (N), contingency (C) or no (U) modal\noperator: NN, CC, NU/UN, CU/UC and NC/CN. Syllogisms with the last\nthree types of premise combinations are called mixed modal\nsyllogisms. Apart from the NN category, which mirrors unmodalized\nsyllogisms, all categories contain dubious cases. For instance,\nAristotle accepts: \n\nThis and other problematic cases were already disputed in antiquity,\nand more recently have sparked a host of complex formalized\nreconstructions of Aristotle’s modal syllogistic. As Aristotle’s\ntheory is conceivably internally inconsistent, the formal models that\nhave been suggested may all be unsuccessful. \n\nAristotle’s pupil and successor Theophrastus of Eresus\n(c. 371–c. 287 BCE) wrote more logical treatises than his\nteacher, with a large overlap in topics. Eudemus of Rhodes (later\n4th cent. BCE) wrote books entitled Categories,\nAnalytics and On Speech. Of all these works only a\nnumber of fragments and later testimonies survive, mostly in \ncommentators on Aristotle. Theophrastus and Eudemus simplified some aspects of\nAristotle’s logic, and developed others where Aristotle left us only\nhints. \n\nThe two Peripatetics seem to have redefined Aristotle’s first figure,\nso that it includes every syllogism in which the middle term is\nsubject of one premise and predicate of the other. In this way, five\ntypes of non-modal syllogisms only intimated by Aristotle later in his\nPrior Analytics (Baralipton, Celantes, Dabitis, Fapesmo and\nFrisesomorum) are included, but Aristotle’s criterion that first\nfigure syllogisms are evident is given up (Theophrastus fr. 91,\nFortenbaugh). Theophrastus and Eudemus also improved Aristotle’s modal\ntheory. Theophrastus replaced Aristotle’s two-sided contingency with \none-sided possibility, so that possibility no longer entails\nnon-necessity. Both recognized that the problematic universal negative\n(‘A possibly holds of no B’) is simply\nconvertible (Theophrastus fr. 102A Fortenbaugh). Moreover, they\nintroduced the principle that in mixed modal syllogisms the conclusion\nalways has the same modal character as the weaker of the premises\n(Theophrastus frs. 106 and 107 Fortenbaugh), where possibility is\nweaker than actuality, and actuality than necessity. In this way\nAristotle’s modal syllogistic is notably simplified and many\nunsatisfactory theses, like the one mentioned above (that from\n‘Necessarily AaB’ and\n‘BaC’ one can infer ‘Necessarily\nAaC’) disappear. \n\nTheophrastus introduced the so-called prosleptic premises and\nsyllogisms (Theophrastus fr. 110 Fortenbaugh). A prosleptic premise is\nof the form: \n\nwhere Φ(X) and Ψ(X) stand for categorical\nsentences in which the variable X occurs in place of one of\nthe terms. For example: \n\nTheophrastus considered such premises to contain three terms, two of\nwhich are definite (A, B), one indefinite\n(‘that’, or the bound variable X). We can\nrepresent (1) and (2) as \n\nProsleptic syllogisms then come about as follows: They are composed of\na prosleptic premise and the categorical premise obtained by\ninstantiating a term (C) in the antecedent ‘open\ncategorical sentence’ as premises, and the categorical sentences\none obtains by putting in the same term (C) in the consequent\n‘open categorical sentence’ as conclusion. For\nexample: \n\nTheophrastus distinguished three figures of these syllogisms,\ndepending on the position of the indefinite term (also called\n‘middle term’) in the prosleptic premise; for example (1)\nproduces a third figure syllogism, (2) a first figure syllogism. The\nnumber of prosleptic syllogisms was presumably equal to that of types\nof prosleptic sentences: with Theophrastus’ concept of the first\nfigure these would be sixty-four (i.e. 32 + 16 + 16). Theophrastus\nheld that certain prosleptic premises were equivalent to certain\ncategorical sentences, e.g. (1) to ‘A is predicated of\nall B’. However, for many, including (2), no such\nequivalent can be found, and prosleptic syllogisms thus increased the\ninferential power of Peripatetic logic. \n\nTheophrastus and Eudemus considered complex premises which they called\n‘hypothetical premises’ and which had one of the following\ntwo (or similar) forms: \n If something is F, it is G\n \n Either something is F or it is G    (with\nexclusive ‘or’)\n \n\nThey developed arguments with them which they called ‘mixed from\na hypothetical premise and a probative premise’ (Theophrastus\nfr. 112A Fortenbaugh). These arguments were inspired by Aristotle’s\nsyllogisms ‘from a hypothesis’ (An. Pr. 1.44);\nthey were forerunners of modus ponens and modus\ntollens and had the following forms (Theophrastus frs. 111 and\n112 Fortenbaugh), employing the exclusive ‘or’: \n\nTheophrastus also recognized that the connective particle\n‘or’ can be inclusive (Theophrastus fr. 82A Fortenbaugh);\nand he considered relative quantified sentences such as those\ncontaining ‘more’, ‘fewer’, and ‘the\nsame’ (Theophrastus fr. 89 Fortenbaugh), and seems to have\ndiscussed syllogisms built from such sentences, again following up\nupon what Aristotle said about syllogisms from a hypothesis\n(Theophrastus fr. 111E Fortenbaugh). \n\nTheophrastus is further credited with the invention of a system of the\nlater so-called ‘wholly hypothetical syllogisms’\n(Theophrastus fr. 113 Fortenbaugh). These syllogisms were originally\nabbreviated term-logical arguments of the kind \n\nand at least some of them were regarded as reducible to Aristotle’s\ncategorical syllogisms, presumably by way of the equivalences to\n‘Every A is B’, etc. In parallel to\nAristotle’s syllogistic, Theophrastus distinguished three figures;\neach had sixteen modes. The first eight modes of the first figure are\nobtained by going through all permutations with ‘not\nX’ instead of ‘X’ (with X\nfor A, B, C); the second eight modes are\nobtained by using a rule of contraposition on the conclusion: \n\nThe sixteen modes of the second figure were obtained by using (CR) on\nthe schema of the first premise of the first figure arguments,\ne.g. \n\nThe sixteen modes of the third figure were obtained by using (CR) on\nthe schema of the second premise of the first figure arguments,\ne.g. \n\nTheophrastus claimed that all second and third figure syllogisms could\nbe reduced to first figure syllogisms. If Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(2nd c. CE Peripatetic) reports faithfully, any use of (CR)\nwhich transforms a syllogism into a first figure syllogism was such a\nreduction. The large number of modes and reductions can be explained\nby the fact that Theophrastus did not have the logical means for\nsubstituting negative for positive components in an argument. In later\nantiquity, after some intermediate stages, and possibly under Stoic\ninfluence, the wholly hypothetical syllogisms were interpreted as\npropositional-logical arguments of the kind \n\nIn the later 4th to mid 3rd centuries BCE,\ncontemporary with Theophrastus and Eudemus, a loosely connected group\nof philosophers, sometimes referred to as dialecticians (see entry\n‘Dialectical School’) and possibly influenced by\nEubulides, conceived of logic as a logic of propositions. Their best\nknown exponents were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo (sometimes\ncalled ‘Philo of Megara’). Although no writings of theirs\nare preserved, there are a number of later reports of their\ndoctrines. They each made groundbreaking contributions to the\ndevelopment of propositional logic, in particular to the theories of\nconditionals and modalities. \n\nA conditional (sunêmmenon) was considered a\nnon-simple proposition composed of two propositions and the connecting\nparticle ‘if’. Philo, who may be credited with introducing\ntruth-functionality into logic, provided the following criterion for\ntheir truth: A conditional is false when and only\nwhen its antecedent is true and its consequent is false, and\nit is true in the three remaining truth-value combinations. The\nPhilonian conditional resembles material implication, except\nthat—since propositions were conceived of as functions of time\nthat can have different truth-values at different times—it may\nchange its truth-value over time. For Diodorus, a conditional\nproposition is true if it neither was nor is possible that its\nantecedent is true and its consequent false. The temporal elements in\nthis account suggest that the possibility of a truth-value change in\nPhilo’s conditionals was meant to be improved on. With his own modal\nnotions (see below) applied, a conditional is Diodorean-true now if\nand only if it is Philonian-true at all times. Diodorus’ conditional\nis thus reminiscent of strict implication. Philo’s and Diodorus’\nconceptions of conditionals lead to variants of the\n‘paradoxes’ of material and strict implication—a\nfact the ancients were aware of (Sextus Empiricus [S. E.] M.\n8.109–117). \n\nPhilo and Diodorus each considered the four modalities possibility,\nimpossibility, necessity and non-necessity. These were conceived of as\nmodal properties or modal values of propositions, not as modal\noperators. Philo defined them as follows: ‘Possible is that\nwhich is capable of being true by the proposition’s own nature\n… necessary is that which is true, and which, as far as it is\nin itself, is not capable of being false. Non-necessary is that which\nas far as it is in itself, is capable of being false, and impossible\nis that which by its own nature is not capable of being true.’\nDiodorus’ definitions were these: ‘Possible is that which either\nis or will be [true]; impossible that which is false and will\nnot be true; necessary that which is true and will not be false;\nnon-necessary that which either is false already or will be\nfalse.’ Both sets of definitions satisfy the following standard\nrequirements of modal logic: (i) necessity entails truth and truth\nentails possibility; (ii) possibility and impossibility are\ncontradictories, and so are necessity and non-necessity; (iii)\nnecessity and possibility are interdefinable; (iv) every proposition\nis either necessary or impossible or both possible and\nnon-necessary. Philo’s definitions appear to introduce mere conceptual\nmodalities, whereas with Diodorus’ definitions, some propositions may\nchange their modal value (Boeth. In Arist. De Int., sec. ed.,\n234–235 Meiser). \n\nDiodorus’ definition of possibility rules out future contingents and\nimplies the counterintuitive thesis that only the actual is\npossible. Diodorus tried to prove this claim with his famous Master\nArgument, which sets out to show the incompatibility of (i)\n‘every past truth is necessary’, (ii) ‘the\nimpossible does not follow from the possible’, and (iii)\n‘something is possible which neither is nor will be true’\n(Epict. Diss. II.19). The argument has not survived, but\nvarious reconstructions have been suggested. Some affinity with the\narguments for logical determinism in Aristotle’s De\nInterpretatione 9 is likely. \n\nOn the topic of ambiguity, Diodorus held that no linguistic expression\nis ambiguous. He supported this dictum by a theory of meaning based on\nspeaker intention. Speakers generally intend to say only one thing\nwhen they speak. What is said when they speak is what they intend to\nsay. Any discrepancy between speaker intention and listener decoding\nhas its cause in the obscurity of what was said, not its ambiguity\n(Aulus Gellius 11.12.2–3). \n\nThe founder of the Stoa, Zeno of Citium (335–263 BCE), studied\nwith Diodorus. His successor Cleanthes (331–232) tried to solve\nthe Master Argument by denying that every past truth is necessary and\nwrote books—now lost—on paradoxes, dialectics, argument\nmodes and predicates. Both philosophers considered knowledge of logic\nas a virtue and held it in high esteem, but they seem not to have been\ncreative logicians. By contrast, Cleanthes’ successor Chrysippus of\nSoli (c. 280–207) is without doubt the second great logician in\nthe history of logic. It was said of him that if the gods used any\nlogic, it would be that of Chrysippus (D. L. 7.180), and his reputation\nas a brilliant logician is amply attested. Chrysippus wrote over 300\nbooks on logic, on virtually every topic logic today concerns itself\nwith, including speech act theory, sentence analysis, singular and\nplural expressions, types of predicates, indexicals, existential\npropositions, sentential connectives, negations, disjunctions,\nconditionals, logical consequence, valid argument forms, theory of\ndeduction, propositional logic, modal logic, tense logic, epistemic\nlogic, logic of suppositions, logic of imperatives, ambiguity and\nlogical paradoxes, in particular the Liar and the Sorites\n(D. L. 7.189–199). Of all these, only two badly damaged papyri\nhave survived, luckily supplemented by a considerable number of\nfragments and testimonies in later texts, in particular in Diogenes\nLaertius (D. L.) book 7, sections 55–83, and Sextus Empiricus\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism (S. E. PH) book 2 and\nAgainst the Mathematicians (S. E. M) book\n8. Chrysippus’ successors, including Diogenes of Babylon (c.\n240–152) and Antipater of Tarsus (2nd cent. BCE),\nappear to have systematized and simplified some of his ideas, but\ntheir original contributions to logic seem small. Many testimonies of\nStoic logic do not name any particular Stoic. Hence the following\nparagraphs simply talk about ‘the Stoics’ in general; but\nwe can be confident that a large part of what has survived goes back\nto Chrysippus. \n\nThe subject matter of Stoic logic is the so-called sayables\n(lekta): they are the underlying meanings in everything we\nsay and think, but—like Frege’s ‘senses’—also subsist \nindependently of us. They are distinguished from spoken and written\nlinguistic expressions: what we utter are those expressions,\nbut what we say are the sayables (D. L. 7.57). There are\ncomplete and deficient sayables. Deficient sayables, if said, make the\nhearer feel prompted to ask for a completion; e.g. when someone says\n‘writes’ we enquire ‘who?’. Complete sayables,\nif said, do not make the hearer ask for a completion (D. L.7.63). They\ninclude assertibles (the Stoic equivalent of propositions),\nimperativals, interrogatives, inquiries, exclamatives, hypotheses or\nsuppositions, stipulations, oaths, curses and more. The accounts of\nthe different complete sayables all had the general form ‘a\nso-and-so sayable is one in saying which we perform an act of\nsuch-and-such’. For instance: ‘an imperatival sayable is\none in saying which we issue a command’, ‘an interrogative\nsayable is one in saying which we ask a question’, ‘a\ndeclaratory sayable (i.e. an assertible) is one in saying which we\nmake an assertion’. Thus, according to the Stoics, each time we\nsay a complete sayable, we perform three different acts: we utter a\nlinguistic expression; we say the sayable; and we perform a\nspeech-act. Chrysippus was aware of the use-mention distinction\n(D. L. 7.187). He seems to have held that every denoting expression is\nambiguous in that it denotes both its denotation and itself (Galen,\nOn ling. soph. 4; Aulus Gellius 11.12.1).  Thus the\nexpression ‘a wagon’ would denote both a wagon and the\nexpression ‘a\n wagon’.[2] \n\nAssertibles (axiômata) differ from all other complete\nsayables in their having a truth-value: at any one time they are\neither true or false. Truth is temporal and assertibles may change\ntheir truth-value. The Stoic principle of bivalence is hence\ntemporalized, too. Truth is introduced by example: the assertible\n‘it is day’ is true when it is day, and at all\nother times false (D. L. 7.65). This suggests some kind of deflationist\nview of truth, as does the fact that the Stoics identify true\nassertibles with facts, but define false assertibles simply as the\ncontradictories of true ones (S. E. M 8.85). \n\nAssertibles are simple or non-simple. A simple predicative\nassertible like ‘Dion is walking’ is generated from the\npredicate ‘is walking’, which is a deficient assertible\nsince it elicits the question ‘who?’, together with a\nnominative case (Dion’s individual quality or the correlated sayable),\nwhich the assertible presents as falling under the predicate\n(D. L. 7.63 and 70). There is thus no interchangeability of predicate\nand subject terms as in Aristotle; rather, predicates—but not\nthe things that fall under them—are defined as deficient, and\nthus resemble propositional functions. It seems that whereas some\nStoics took the—Fregean—approach that singular terms had\ncorrelated sayables, others anticipated the notion of direct\nreference. Concerning indexicals, the Stoics took a simple\ndefinite assertible like ‘this one is walking’ to\nbe true when the person pointed at by the speaker is walking (S. E.\nM 100). When the thing pointed at ceases to be, so does the\nassertible, though the sentence used to express it remains\n(Alex. Aphr. An. Pr. 177–8). A simple\nindefinite assertible like ‘someone is walking’\nis said to be true when a corresponding definite assertible is true\n(S. E. M 98). Aristotelian universal affirmatives\n(‘Every A is B’) were to be rephrased as\nconditionals: ‘If something is A, it is\nB’ (S. E. M 9.8–11). Negations of simple\nassertibles are themselves simple assertibles. The Stoic negation of\n‘Dion is walking’ is ‘(It is) not (the case that)\nDion is walking’, and not ‘Dion is not walking’. The\nlatter is analyzed in a Russellian manner as ‘Both Dion exists\nand not: Dion is walking’ (Alex. Aphr. An. Pr.\n402). There are present tense, past tense and future tense\nassertibles.  The—temporalized—principle of bivalence\nholds for them all. The past tense assertible ‘Dion\nwalked’ is true when there is at least one past time at which\n‘Dion is walking’ was true. \n\nThus the Stoics concerned themselves with several issues we would\nplace under the heading of predicate logic; but their main achievement\nwas the development of a propositional logic, i.e. of a system of\ndeduction in which the smallest substantial unanalyzed expressions are\npropositions, or rather, assertibles. \n\nThe Stoics defined negations as assertibles that consist of a negative\nparticle and an assertible controlled by this particle (S. E.\nM8.103). Similarly, non-simple assertibles were defined as\nassertibles that either consist of more than one assertible or of one\nassertible taken more than once (D. L. 7.68–9) and that are\ncontrolled by a connective particle. Both definitions can be\nunderstood as being recursive and allow for assertibles of\nindeterminate complexity. Three types of non-simple assertibles\nfeature in Stoic syllogistic. Conjunctions are non-simple assertibles\nput together by the conjunctive connective ‘both … and\n…’. They have two\n conjuncts.[3]\n Disjunctions are non-simple assertibles put together by the\ndisjunctive connective ‘either … or … or\n…’. They have two or more disjuncts, all on a\npar. Conditionals are non-simple assertibles formed with the\nconnective ‘if …, …’; they consist of\nantecedent and consequent (D. L. 7.71–2). What type of assertible\nan assertible is, is determined by the connective or logical particle\nthat controls it, i.e. that has the largest scope. ‘Both not\np and q’ is a conjunction, ‘Not both\np and q’ a negation. Stoic language\nregimentation asks that sentences expressing assertibles always start\nwith the logical particle or expression characteristic for the\nassertible. Thus, the Stoics invented an implicit bracketing device\nsimilar to that used in Łukasiewicz’ Polish notation. \n\nStoic negations and conjunctions are truth-functional. Stoic (or at\nleast Chrysippean) conditionals are true when the contradictory of the\nconsequent is incompatible with its antecedent (D. L. 7.73). Two\nassertibles are contradictories of each other if one is the negation\nof the other (D. L. 7.73); that is, when one exceeds the other by\na—pre-fixed—negation particle (S. E. M 8.89). The\ntruth-functional Philonian conditional was expressed as a negation of\na conjunction: that is, not as ‘if p, q’\nbut as ‘not both p and not q’. Stoic\ndisjunction is exclusive and non-truth-functional. It is true when\nnecessarily precisely one of its disjuncts is true. Later Stoics\nintroduced a non-truth-functional inclusive disjunction (Aulus\nGellius, N. A. 16.8.13–14). \n\nLike Philo and Diodorus, Chrysippus distinguished four modalities and\nconsidered them modal values of propositions rather than modal\noperators; they satisfy the same standard requirements of modal logic.\nChrysippus’ definitions are (D. L. 7.75): An assertible is possible\nwhen it is both capable of being true and not hindered by external\nthings from being true. An assertible is impossible when it is\n[either] not capable of being true [or is capable of being\ntrue, but hindered by external things from being true]. An\nassertible is necessary when, being true, it either is not capable of\nbeing false or is capable of being false, but hindered by external\nthings from being false. An assertible is non-necessary when it is\nboth capable of being false and not hindered by external things\n[from being false]. Chrysippus’ modal notions differ from\nDiodorus’ in that they allow for future contingents and from Philo’s\nin that they go beyond mere conceptual possibility. \n\nArguments are—normally—compounds of assertibles. They are\ndefined as a system of at least two premises and a conclusion\n(D. L. 7.45). Syntactically, every premise but the first is introduced\nby ‘now’ or ‘but’, and the conclusion by\n‘therefore’. An argument is valid if the (Chrysippean)\nconditional formed with the conjunction of its premises as antecedent\nand its conclusion as consequent is correct (S. E. PH 2.137;\nD. L. 7.77). An argument is ‘sound’ (literally:\n‘true’), when in addition to being valid it has true\npremises. The Stoics defined so-called argument modes as a sort of\nschema of an argument (D. L. 7.76). The mode of an argument differs from\nthe argument itself by having ordinal numbers taking the place of\nassertibles. The mode of the argument \n\nis \n\nThe modes functioned first as abbreviations of arguments that brought\nout their logically relevant form; and second, it seems, as\nrepresentatives of the form of a class of arguments. \n\nIn terms of contemporary logic, Stoic syllogistic is best understood\nas a substructural backwards-working Gentzen-style natural-deduction\nsystem that consists of five kinds of axiomatic arguments (the\nindemonstrables) and four inference rules, called themata. An\nargument is a syllogism precisely if it either is an indemonstrable or\ncan be reduced to one by means of the themata\n(D. L. 7.78). Thus syllogisms are certain kinds of formally valid\narguments. The Stoics explicitly acknowledged that there are valid\narguments that are not syllogisms; but assumed that these could be\nsomehow transformed into syllogisms. \n\nAll basic indemonstrables consist of a non-simple assertible as\nleading premiss and a simple assertible as co-assumption, and have\nanother simple assertible as conclusion. They were defined by five\nstandardized meta-linguistic descriptions of the forms of the\narguments (S. E. M 8.224–5; D. L. 7.80–1): \n\nWhether an argument is an indemonstrable can be tested by comparing\nit with these meta-linguistic descriptions. For instance, \n\ncomes out as a second indemonstrable, and \n\nas a first indemonstrable. For testing, a suitable mode of an argument\ncan also be used as a stand-in. A mode is syllogistic, if a\ncorresponding argument with the same form is a syllogism (because of\nthat form). However in Stoic logic there are no five modes that can be\nused as inference schemata that represent the five types of\nindemonstrables. For example, the following are two of the many modes\nof fourth indemonstrables: Either the 1st or the 2nd.\nBut the 2nd.\nTherefore not the 1st. \nEither the 1st or not the 2nd.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 2nd. \n\nAlthough both are covered by the meta-linguistic description, neither\ncould be singled out as the mode of the fourth\nindemonstrables: If we disregard complex arguments, there are\nthirty-two modes corresponding to the five meta-linguistic\ndescriptions; the latter thus prove noticeably more economical. The\nalmost universal assumption among historians of logic that the Stoics\nrepresented their five (types of) indemonstrables by five modes is\nfalse and not supported by textual \nevidence.[4] \n\nOf the four themata, only the first and third are extant.\nThey, too, were meta-linguistically formulated. The first\nthema, in its basic form, was: \n\nThis is an inference rule of the kind today called antilogism. The\nthird thema, in one formulation, was: \n\nThis is an inference rule of the kind today called cut-rule. It is\nused to reduce chain-syllogisms. The second and fourth\nthemata were also cut-rules, and reconstructions of them can\nbe provided, since we know what arguments they together with the third\nthema were thought to reduce, and we have some of the\narguments said to be reducible by the second thema. A\npossible reconstruction of the second thema is: \n\nA possible reconstruction of the fourth thema is: \n\nA Stoic reduction shows the formal validity of an argument by applying\nto it the themata in one or more steps in such a way that all\nresultant arguments are indemonstrables. This can be done either with\nthe arguments or their modes (S. E. M\n8.230–8). For instance, the argument mode \n\ncan be reduced by the third thema to (the modes of) a second\nand a third indemonstrable as follows: \n\nWhen from two assertibles (‘If the 1st and the\n2nd, the 3rd’ and ‘But not the\n3rd’) a third follows (‘Not: both the\n1st and the 2nd’—this follows by a\nsecond indemonstrable) and from the third and an external one\n(‘The 1st’) another follows (‘Not: the\n2nd’—this follows by a third indemonstrable),\nthen this other (‘Not: the 2nd’) also follows\nfrom the two assertibles and the external one. \n\nThe second thema reduced, among others, arguments with the\nfollowing modes (Alex. Aphr. An. Pr. 164.27–31): \nEither the 1st or not the 1st.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 1st.\n \nIf the 1st, if the 1st, the 2nd.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 2nd. \n\nThe Peripatetics chided the Stoics for allowing such useless\narguments. In agreement with contemporary logic, the Stoics insisted\nthat, if the arguments can be reduced, they are valid. \n\nThe four themata can be used repeatedly and in any\ncombination in a reduction. Thus propositional arguments of\nindeterminate length and complexity can be reduced. Stoic syllogistic\nhas been formalized, and it has been shown that the Stoic deductive\nsystem shows strong similarities with relevance logical systems like\nthose by Storrs McCall. Like Aristotle, the Stoics aimed at proving\nnon-evident formally valid arguments by reducing them by\nmeans of accepted inference rules to evidently valid\narguments. Thus, although their logic is a propositional\nlogic, they did not intend to provide a system that allows for the\ndeduction of all propositional-logical truths, but rather a system of\nvalid propositional-logical arguments with at least two premises and a\nconclusion. Nonetheless, we have evidence that the Stoics expressly\nrecognized many simple logical truths. For example, they accepted the\nfollowing logical principles: the principle of double negation,\nstating that a double negation (‘not: not: p’) is\nequivalent to the assertible that is doubly negated (i.e. p)\n(D. L. 7.69); the principle that any conditional formed by using the\nsame assertible as antecedent and as consequent (‘if p,\np’) is true (S. E. M 8.281, 466); the principle\nthat any two-place disjunctions formed by using contradictory\ndisjuncts (‘either p or not: p’) is true\n(S. E. M 8.282, 467); and the principle of contraposition,\nthat if ‘if p, q’ then ‘if not:\nq, not: p’ (D. L. 7.194, Philodemus\nSign., PHerc. 1065, XI.26–XII.14). \n\nThe Stoics recognized the importance of both the Liar and the Sorites\nparadoxes (Cicero Acad. 2.95–8, Plut.\nComm.Not. 1059D–E, Chrys. Log. Zet. col.IX).\nChrysippus may have tried to solve the Liar as follows: there is an\nineliminable ambiguity in the Liar sentence (‘I am speaking\nfalsely’, uttered in isolation) between the assertibles (i)\n‘I falsely say I speak falsely’ and (ii) ‘I\nam speaking falsely’ (i.e. I am doing what I’m saying,\nviz. speaking falsely), of which, at any time the Liar sentence is\nuttered, precisely one is true, but it is arbitrary which one. (i)\nentails (iii) ‘I am speaking truly’ and is\nincompatible with (ii) and with (iv) ‘I truly say I speak\nfalsely’. (ii) entails (iv) and is incompatible with (i) and\n(iii). Thus bivalence is preserved (cf. Cavini 1993). Chrysippus’\nstand on the Sorites seems to have been that vague borderline\nsentences uttered in the context of a Sorites series have no\nassertibles corresponding to them, and that it is obscure to us where\nthe borderline cases start, so that it is rational for us to stop\nanswering while still on safe ground (i.e. before we might begin to\nmake utterances with no assertible corresponding to them). The latter\nremark suggests Chrysippus was aware of the problem of higher order\nvagueness. Again, bivalence of assertibles is preserved (cf. Bobzien\n2002). The Stoics also discussed various other well-known\nparadoxes. In particular, for the paradoxes of presupposition, known\nin antiquity as the Horned One, they produced a Russellian-type\nsolution based on a hidden scope ambiguity of negation (cf. Bobzien\n2012) \n\nEpicurus (late 4th–early 3rd c. BCE) and\nthe Epicureans are said to have rejected logic as an unnecessary\ndiscipline (D. L. 10.31, Usener 257). This notwithstanding, several\naspects of their philosophy forced or prompted them to take a stand on\nsome issues in philosophical logic. (1) Language meaning and\ndefinition: The Epicureans held that natural languages came into\nexistence not by stipulation of word meanings but as the result of the\ninnate capacities of humans for using signs and articulating sounds\nand of human social interaction (D. L. 10.75–6); that language is\nlearnt in context (Lucretius 5.1028ff); and that linguistic\nexpressions of natural languages are clearer and more conspicuous than\ntheir definitions; even that definitions would destroy their\nconspicuousness (Usener 258, 243); and that philosophers hence should\nuse ordinary language rather than introduce technical expressions\n(Epicurus On Nature 28). (2) Truth-bearers: the\nEpicureans deny the existence of incorporeal meanings, such as Stoic\nsayables. Their truth-bearers are linguistic items, more precisely,\nutterances (phônai) (S. E. M 8.13, 258; Usener\n259, 265). Truth consists in the correspondence of things and\nutterances, falsehood in a lack of such correspondence\n(S. E. M 8.9, Usener 244), although the details are obscure\nhere. (3) Excluded middle: with utterances as truth-bearers,\nthe Epicureans face the question what the truth-values of future\ncontingents are. Two views are recorded. One is the denial of the\nPrinciple of Excluded Middle (‘p or not\np’) for future contingents (Usener 376, Cicero\nAcad. 2.97, Cicero Fat. 37). The other, more\ninteresting, one leaves the Excluded Middle intact for all utterances,\nbut holds that, in the case of future contingents, the component\nutterances ‘p’ and ‘not p’\nare neither true nor false (Cicero Fat. 37), but, it seems,\nindefinite. This could be regarded as an anticipation of\nsupervaluationism. (4) Induction: Inductive logic was\ncomparatively little developed in antiquity. Aristotle discusses\narguments from the particular to the universal\n(epagôgê) in the Topics and\nPosterior Analytics but does not provide a theory of\nthem. Some later Epicureans developed a theory of inductive inference\nwhich bases the inference on empirical observation that certain\nproperties concur without exception (Philodemus De\nSignis). \n\nVery little is known about the development of logic from c. 100 BCE to\nc. 250 CE. It is unclear when Peripatetics and Stoics began taking\nnotice of each others’ logical achievements. At some point during that\nperiod, the terminological distinction between ‘categorical\nsyllogisms’, used for Aristotelian syllogisms, and\n‘hypothetical syllogisms’, used not only for those\nintroduced by Theophrastus and Eudemus, but also for the Stoic\npropositional-logical syllogisms, gained a foothold. In the first\ncentury BCE, the Peripatetics Ariston of Alexandria and Boethus of\nSidon wrote about syllogistic. Ariston is said to have introduced the\nso-called ‘subaltern’ syllogisms (Barbari, Celaront,\nCesaro, Camestrop and Camenop) into Aristotelian syllogistic (Apuleius\nInt. 213.5–10), i.e. the syllogisms one gains by\napplying the subalternation rules (that were acknowledged by Aristotle\nin his Topics) \n\nto the conclusions of the relevant syllogisms. Boethus suggested\nsubstantial modifications to Aristotle’s theories: he claimed that all\ncategorical syllogisms are complete, and that hypothetical syllogistic\nis prior to categorical (Galen Inst. Log. 7.2), although we\nare not told what this priority was thought to consist in.  The Stoic\nPosidonius (c. 135–c. 51 BCE) defended the possibility of\nlogical or mathematical deduction against the Epicureans and discussed\nsome syllogisms he called ‘conclusive by the force of an\naxiom’, which apparently included arguments of the type\n‘As the 1st is to the 2nd, so the\n3rd is to the 4th; the ratio of the\n1st to the 2nd is double; therefore the ratio of\nthe 3rd to the 4th is double’, which was\nconsidered conclusive by the force of the axiom ‘things which\nare in general of the same ratio, are also of the same particular\nratio’ (Galen Inst. Log. 18.8). At least two Stoics in\nthis period wrote a work on Aristotle’s Categories. From his\nwritings we know that Cicero (1st c. BCE) was knowledgeable\nabout both Peripatetic and Stoic logic; and Epictetus’ discourses\n(late 1st–early 2nd c. CE) prove that he\nwas acquainted with some of the more taxing parts of Chrysippus’\nlogic. In all likelihood, there existed at least a few creative\nlogicians in this period, but we do not know who they were or what\nthey created. \n\nThe next logician of rank, if of lower rank, of whom we have\nsufficient evidence to speak is Galen (129–199 or 216 CE), who\nachieved greater fame as a physician. He studied logic with both\nPeripatetic and Stoic teachers, and recommended availing oneself of\nparts of either doctrine, as long as it could be used for scientific\ndemonstration. He composed commentaries on logical works by Aristotle,\nTheophrastus, Eudemus and Chrysippus, as well as treatises on various\nlogical problems and a major work entitled On\nDemonstration. All these are lost, except for some information in\nlater texts, but his Introduction to Logic has come down to\nus almost in full. In On Demonstration, Galen developed,\namong other things, a theory of compound categorical syllogisms with\nfour terms, which fall into four figures, but we do not know the\ndetails. He also introduced the so-called relational syllogisms,\nexamples of which are ‘A is equal to B,\nB is equal to C; therefore A is equal to\nC’ and ‘Dio owns half as much as Theo; Theo owns\nhalf as much as Philo. Therefore Dio owns a quarter of what Philo\nowns’ (Galen Inst. Log, 17–18). All the relational\nsyllogisms Galen mentions have in common that they are not reducible\nin either Aristotle’s or the Stoic syllogistic, but it is difficult to\nfind further formal characteristics that unite them. In general, in\nhis Introduction to Logic Galen merges Aristotelian\nSyllogistic with a strongly Peripatetic reinterpretation of Stoic\npropositional logic. This becomes apparent in particular in Galen’s\nemphatic denial that truth-preservation is sufficient for the validity\nor syllogismhood of an argument, and his insistence that, instead,\nknowledge-introduction or knowledge-extension is a necessary condition\nfor something to count as a\n syllogism.[5] \n\nThe second ancient introduction to logic that has survived is\nApuleius’ (2nd cent. CE) De Interpretatione. This\nLatin text, too, displays knowledge of Stoic and Peripatetic logic; it\ncontains the first full presentation of the square of opposition,\nwhich illustrates the logical relations between categorical sentences\nby diagram. The Platonist Alcinous (2nd cent. CE), in his\nHandbook of Platonism chapter 5, is witness to the emergence\nof a specifically Platonist logic, constructed on the Platonic notions\nand procedures of division, definition, analysis and hypothesis, but\nthere is little that would make a logician’s heart beat\nfaster. At some time between the 3rd and 6th century\nCE Stoic logic faded into oblivion, to be resurrected only in the\n20th century, in the wake of the (re)-discovery of\npropositional logic. \n\nThe surviving, often voluminous, Greek commentaries on Aristotle’s\nlogical works by Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. c. 200 CE), Porphyry\n(234–c. 305), Ammonius Hermeiou (5th century),\nPhiloponus (c. 500) and Simplicius (6th century) and the\nLatin ones by Boethius (c. 480–524) are mainly important for\npreserving alternative interpretations of Aristotle’s logic and as\nsources for lost Peripatetic and Stoic works. They also allow us to\ntrace the gradual development from a Peripatetic exegesis of\nAristotle’s Organon to a more eclectic logic that resulted\nfrom the absorption and inclusion of elements not just from Stoic and\nPlatonist theories but also from mathematics and rhetoric. Two of the\ncommentators in particular deserve special mention in their own right:\nPorphyry, for writing the Isagoge or Introduction\n(i.e. to Aristotle’s Categories), in which he discusses the\nfive notions of genus, species, differentia, property and accident as\nbasic notions one needs to know to understand the\nCategories. For centuries, the Isagoge was the first\nlogic text a student would tackle, and Porphyry’s five predicables\n(which differ from Aristotle’s four) formed the basis for the medieval\ndoctrine of the quinque voces. The second is Boethius. In\naddition to commentaries, he wrote a number of logical treatises,\nmostly simple explications of Aristotelian logic, but also two very\ninteresting ones: (i) His On Topical Differentiae bears\nwitness to the elaborated system of topical arguments that logicians\nof later antiquity had developed from Aristotle’s Topics\nunder the influence of the needs of Roman lawyers. (ii) His On\nHypothetical Syllogisms systematically presents wholly\nhypothetical and mixed hypothetical syllogisms as they are known from\nthe early Peripatetics; it may be derived from Porphyry. Boethius’\ninsistence that the negation of ‘If it is A, it is\nB’ is ‘If it is A, it is not\nB’ suggests a suppositional understanding of the\nconditional, a view for which there is also some evidence in Ammonius,\nbut that is not attested for earlier logicians. Historically, Boethius\nis most important because he translated all of Aristotle’s\nOrganon into Latin, making these texts (except the\nPosterior Analytics) available to philosophers of the\nmedieval period.","contact.mail":"susanne.bobzien@all-souls.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"all-souls.ox.ac.uk"}]
