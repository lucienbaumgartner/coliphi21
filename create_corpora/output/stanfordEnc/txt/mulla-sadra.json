Ibrahim b. Yahya Qawami Shirazi (ca.\n1571–1636) is arguably the most significant Islamic philosopher\nafter Avicenna. Best known as Mulla Sadra, he was later given the\ntitle of Sadr al-Muta’allihin (Master of the theosists) for his\napproach to philosophy that combined an interest in theology and drew\nupon insights from mystical intuition. He considered philosophy to be\na set of spiritual exercises and a process of theosis, a pursuit of\nwisdom whose goal was to acquire wisdom and become a sage, and hence\nbecome godlike. He championed a radical philosophical method that\nattempted to transcend the simple dichotomy between a discursive,\nratiocinative mode of reasoning and knowing, and a more intuitive,\npoetic and non-propositional mode of knowledge. He became famous as\nthe thinker who revolutionized the doctrine of existence in Islamic\nmetaphysics. By critiquing an Aristotelian metaphysics which assumed\nthat the basic stuff of reality was constituted by substances, he\ninitiated a (Neoplatonic) process metaphysics of change, founded upon\nand moved by acts of being. A keen thinker who wrote works in\nphilosophy, theology, mysticism, and scriptural exegesis, he attempted\na wide-ranging synthesis of approaches to Islamic thought and argued\nfor the necessity of the method of understanding reality through a\nmixture of logical reasoning, spiritual inspiration, and a deep\nmeditation upon the key scriptural sources of the Twelver Shi‘i\ntradition in Islam. Having a holistic approach to philosophical\ninquiry, his understanding of the pursuit of wisdom included\nscriptural hermeneutics and exegesis as well as theological reasoning.\nA key figure of a group of thinkers whom Nasr and Corbin referred to\nas the “School of Isfahan”, he played a major role in\nintellectual life during the revitalization of philosophy under the\nSafavid Shah ‘Abbas I (r. 996–1038 AH/1588–1629 CE)\nand later on in life was the most important teacher at the\nphilosophical seminary known as Madrasa-yi Khan in his hometown of\nShiraz. Since the early 19th century, the thought of Mulla Sadra has\nbecome the dominant philosophical paradigm in the Shi‘i seminary\nin the Islamic East and was also widely influential in South Asia.\n\nMulla Sadra was the sole child born into a courtly family in Shiraz,\nsouthern Iran, in around 979 AH/1571–72. A bright young man, his\ninterest in intellectual pursuits was indulged by his father, and he\nmoved first to Qazvin in 1000 AH/1591 and then to Isfahan in 1006\nAH/1597, successive capitals of the Safavid empire, to pursue his\nstudy of philosophy, theology, the prophetic tradition, and\nQur’anic hermeneutics and exegesis. His teachers were the two\npre-eminent scholars of his age, Mir Muhammad Baqir Damad Astarabadi,\nthe grandson of the powerful jurist and statesman ‘Ali Karaki,\nand Shaykh Baha’ al-Din ‘Amili known as Shaykh\nBaha’i (d. 1030 AH/1620–21), who was the leading jurist in\nIsfahan during the reign of Shah Abbas I. With the former, he studied\nphilosophy and theology, in particular the Peripatetic works of\nAvicenna (d. 428 AH/1037) and his student Bahmanyar (d. 458 AH/1066),\nthe pseudo-Aristotelian Plotiniana Arabica (in particular the\nso-called Theology of Aristotle), and the Illuminationist\nworks of Suhrawardi (d. 586 AH/1191). With Shaykh Baha’i, as was\nthe case with a number of other students, he studied the scriptural\nsciences of Qur’anic exegesis and the traditions of the\nShi‘i Imams. Contrary to what Corbin and others have claimed\n(Corbin 1971: 58; Nasr 1977: 32), there seems to be no evidence that\nhe studied with another intriguing scholar from Astarabad and\nassociate of Mir Damad, Mir Findiriski (d. 1050 AH/1640–41), an\nitinerant scholar who spent much time studying Indian philosophies and\nreligions. Certainly the story recorded by some of the later\nbiographical dictionaries that claims that Mulla Sadra was advised by\nMir Findiriski to study with Mir Damad is apocryphal. We do not have a\nformal license (ijaza) from his teachers that has survived,\nwhich could attest to his study with them and to the content of the\ncurriculum; certainly, we know that both Mir Damad and Shaikh\nBaha’i granted a number of these licenses and attestations of\nstudy to their students as compiled by Majlisi II (Mulla Muhammad\nBaqir Majlisi, known as ‘Allama-yi Majlisi, 1036–1110\nAH/1627–99) in Bihar al-anwar [Seas of\nLights]. However, we have one very valuable source that records\nthe intimate relationship of his study and even spiritual discipleship\nin a literary-poetic collection of the early 17th century from Qazvin\nknown as the Jung-i Qazvin. This codex (which is in the National\nLibrary in Tehran) includes autograph notes of Mir Damad, Shaikh\nBaha’i, and Mulla Sadra. Among these notes are short ijaza-like\nstatements for Mulla Sadra. Shaikh Baha’i quoted some narrations\nof the Imams and wrote that he did so at the bequest of his\n“illustrious and most excellent, intelligent and witty and pure\nson Sadra” (Khaminihi 2000: 59). Similarly, in a note Mir Damad\nreferred to Sadra as his spiritual son (Khaminihi 2000: 56). The dual\ninfluence of his teachers can be gauged in his early notes that reveal\nan interest in Sufism, especially Sufi poetry and the law. These notes\nwere probably written in Shiraz in 1016 AH/1607–8. However,\ninterest in Sufism does not necessarily entail affiliation to a Sufi\norder, a practice which, in any case, was highly controversial in this\nperiod: the claim of the 19th-century Ni‘mat-Allahi Sufi\nMa‘sum-‘Ali-Shah that Mulla Sadra was a Nurbakhshi Sufi\ncannot be substantiated. \nCompleting his training and possibly prompted by the death of his\nfather in 1010 AH/1601–2, he returned to Shiraz to work and\nteach; but, failing to find an adequate patron and facing the\nopposition and criticism of a city that had forgotten the value of the\nstudy of philosophy, he retreated to Kahak, a small village outside\nthe holy city of Qom, to meditate upon his inquiries and initiate the\ncomposition of his main works, especially his philosophical and\ntheological summa, al-Hikma al-muta‘aliya fi-l-asfar\nal-‘aqliyya al-arba‘a (Transcendent wisdom of the\nfour journeys of the intellect), popularly known as al-Asfar\nal-arba‘a (The Four Journeys). His retreat\n(khalvat) lasted probably five years. He then began an\nitinerant life, teaching and writing in Qom, visiting and\ncorresponding with Mir Damad in Isfahan until the latter’s death\nin 1040 AH/1631, and spending time at his family estates in Shiraz.\nManuscript evidence attests to his itinerant life until 1040\nAH/1630–1. His relationship with Mir Damad was particularly\nimportant: he began espousing his teacher’s ideas until he\nchanged his views later in life, but Mir Damad remained his spiritual\nmaster. His devotion was expressed in the letters that they exchanged.\nIn a letter dated 1018 AH/1609–10 from Shiraz, Mulla Sadra\ndescribed Mir Damad as “the apportioner of grace to the hearts\nof the wise, the eleventh intellect, he who masters the theory and\npractice of the sciences, the lord (sayyid) of philosophers\nand the master of the jurists, the most noble of scholars, the\nciviliser of Islam” (Khamenehi 2000: 109). In another letter\ndated 1037 AH/1627–8 probably from Qom, he complained of their\nseparation and expressed concern for the health of Mir Damad\ndescribing him as “our master and lord (sayyid), may\nGod preserve his shadow over his separated disciples by preserving his\nnoble existence and his honour and the light of the illumination of\nhis light that enlightens the hearts of spiritual wayfarers”\n(Khaminihi 2000: 113). \nHe trained a number of significant philosophers in the period in Qom,\nthe most important of whom were Muhsin Fayz-i Kashani (d. 1090\nAH/1680–1), who studied with him between 1030 AH/1620–1\nand 1038 AH/1628–9, as attested in Fayz’s autobiographical\ntreatise Sharh-i Sadr, and ‘Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji (known\nas Fayyaz-i Lahiji, d. 1072 AH/1661–2), both of whom became his\nsons-in-law. Other students included the philosophers Husayn\nTunikabuni (d. 1105 AH/1693–4) and Muhammad Riza Aqajani (d.\n1071 AH/1660–1). After his retreat to Qom, Mulla Sadra probably\nmarried in Shiraz. One modern source suggests that his wife was the\ndaughter of Mirza Zia al-Din Muhammad Razi, which would mean that his\nwife and the mother of Fayz were sisters, suggesting a relationship\nthat predates the teacher and student one. As an affluent man, Mulla\nSadra had five children who survived and a large household, including\nretainers and students. His first-born Umm Kulsum was born in 1019\nAH/1610–1 and later married his student Fayyaz-i Lahiji in Qom.\nAnother daughter Zubayda was born in 1024 AH/1615 in Qom and later\nmarried Fayz-i Kashani. His third daughter Ma‘suma was born in\nQom in 1033 AH/1623–4 and later married another student, Qutb\nal-Din Muhammad Nayrizi, about whom nothing is recorded. Mulla Sadra\nalso had three sons who became scholars in their own right: Ibrahim,\nwho was born in Qom in 1021 AH/1612–3, became a prominent\ntheologian at court, and died in Isfahan in 1071 AH/1660–1:\nNizam al-Din Ahmad, who was born in Kashan in 1031 AH/1621–2 and\ndied in Shiraz in 1074 AH/1664; and his youngest son Muhammad Riza,\nwho was probably born in Qom but about whom we do not have any\nbiographical information. \nIn 1040 AH/1630–1, Mulla Sadra moved permanently to his hometown\nat the request of (possibly his former student) Imamquli Khan (d. 1042\nAH/1633), the extremely powerful governor-general\n(beglerbegi) of Sadra’s home province Fars and son of\nthe celebrated Georgian military commander Allahvirdi Khan. The\nMadrasa-yi Khan seminary, founded by Imamquli’s father and\ncompleted in 1024 AH/1615, had been established with an express\npurpose of teaching philosophy and science. Mulla Sadra was the clear\nchoice for teaching there, and it is possible that he had begun his\nassociation from the inception of the institution. He completed his\nmajor work, the Four Journeys (al-Asfar\nal-arba‘a) in Shiraz in 1038 AH/1628 and in the same year\nthe English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert described the Madrasa:\n“and [indeed] Shyraz has a colledge wherein is read Philosophy,\nAstrology, Physick, Chemistry and the Mathematicks; so as ‘tis\nthe more famoused through Persia” (Herbert, Some Years\nTravel, London, 1634, p. 129). This late period of his life was\nproductive, and he was much respected as a teacher in his hometown.\nAfter an illustrious and prolific career, he died in Basra on his way\nto his seventh pilgrimage to Mecca. The traditional date given for his\ndeath is 1050 AH/1640–1. However, there is no clear evidence in\nsupport of this date. His grandson Muhammad ‘Alam al-Huda, the\nson of Fayz-i Kashani, reported that his grandfather died in Basra in\n1045 AH/1635–6 and was buried in Najaf in the precinct of the\nshrine of the first Shi‘i Imam ‘Ali b. Abi Talib\n(Khaminihi 2000: 414). This is attested in two paratexts of his works,\nand seems to be corroborated by the fact that the date of completion\nfor his last works, including those left incomplete, is 1044\nAH/1635. \nMulla Sadra wrote over forty-five works. His magnum opus, al-Hikma\nal-muta‘aliya fi-l-asfar al-‘aqliyya al-arba‘a,\nknown as al-Asfar al-arba‘a (The Four\nJourneys), is a large compendium of philosophy and theology that,\ninstead of following the traditional divisions of logic, physics, and\nmetaphysics, maps intellectual inquiry upon a mystical metaphor of the\nsoul’s journey in this world. Hence it is popularly known as the\nFour Journeys. He began writing it in 1015 AH/1606 in Kahak\nand completed it in Shiraz in 1038 AH/1628. The first journey from\nthis world to God provides the seeker with the intellectual principles\nfor understanding philosophy such as the basic definition of\nphilosophy and metaphysics, the significance of metaphysics and the\nquestion of being for this study. In this journey, the seeker moves\naway from multiplicity and phenomenal deception towards unity and an\nawareness of the underlying nature of reality. The second journey in\nGod with God is a discourse on the nature of God, the divine\nattributes and significantly including his famous proof for the\nexistence of God. It is the stage of the mystic’s absorption in\nthe divine essence and his effacement of the self. The third journey\nfrom God to this world explains the God-world relationship, nature,\ntime and creation and ontological categories in this world. For the\nmystic, this is the return to sobriety and a realisation of the duties\nof moral agency in this world. The final journey in this world with\nGod is a description of human psychology focusing on soteriology and\neschatology and reveals most clearly the significance of Twelver\nShi‘ism to his thought. This is the final stage of the\nmystic’s journey, a recognition that everything as a unified\nwhole reflects the ontological unity of the divine and that the\nrealised human recognises a desire to return to the principle, the one\nwho is the source of being, God. \nThe Four Journeys is a major source for the history of\nIslamic philosophical traditions: it reveals the strong influence of\nan Avicennan structure with major contributions from the critiques of\nAvicennism by Suhrawardi and the Sufi metaphysical monism of Ibn\nal-‘Arabi (d. 1240). But it is not just the arguments of\nthinkers, well known in academic and scholarly circles, who are\nconsidered. He also addressed the positions of some major philosophers\nof Shiraz, who remain little known even to specialists studying\nIslamic philosophy, such as Mir Ghiyath al-Din Mansur Dashtaki (d. 948\nAH/1541) and Shams al-Din Muhammad Khafri (d. ca. 957 AH/1550). \nHis other works mainly deal with philosophical theology, such as\nal-Hikma al-‘arshiyya (Wisdom of the throne) and\nal-Shawahid al-rububiyya (Divine witnesses). One work,\nal-Masha‘ir (Inspired recognitions) stands out as a\ndense epitome of his doctrine of being as expressed in the first part\nof the Four Journeys on the semantics of existence. As a religious\nthinker, Mulla Sadra was also keen to come to terms with his\nscriptural heritage, and he wrote three works on the hermeneutics of\nthe Qur’an as a preparation for his own incomplete mystical and\nphilosophical commentary on the text: Mafatih al-ghayb (Keys\nto the unseen), Asrar al-ayat (Secrets of the verses/signs),\nand Mutashabihat al-Qur’an (Allegories of the\nQur’an). As a Shi‘i thinker, he also wrote an incomplete\ncommentary on the main doctrinal collection of tradition, Usul\nal-kafi of Kulayni (d. 329 AH/941), as an attempt to grapple with\nthe question of what it means to be an intuitive philosopher in the\nShi‘i tradition. He also wrote a number of other treatises on\nparticular issues, such as creatio ex nihilo (huduth\nal-‘alam), the resurrection, the nature of knowledge,\nlogic, and the relationship between existence and essence. But the\nFour Journeys remains his most important work and the key to\nunderstanding his philosophy as he repeatedly cited it in his other\nworks for a more extended discussion of an issue. \nCommon with other pre-modern traditions of philosophy, Mulla Sadra\nconceives of philosophy as more than a ratiocinative inquiry. It is a\nmode of being and a way of life whose goal is wisdom and the\ncultivation of a holy life in which the sage strikes a resemblance to\nthe divine (cf. Plato’s Theaetetus). His thought is\nclearly located within a Neoplatonic paradigm of understanding\nphilosophy as espoused by Pierre Hadot and others. Philosophy is the\npursuit of metaphysical truths that are not merely understood and\ngrasped through cognition, but are lived realities, in which\nphilosophers, again following the Platonic tradition, are integrated\nsouls who combine theoretical and practical knowledge and its\nimplementation to effect a holistic ethics of living. \nInquiry entails a two-fold discipline of the mind through logical\ntraining and the mental exercises of argumentation, analysis, division\nand refutation, and the disciplining of the soul through spiritual\nexercises that facilitate the inhering of divine qualities of\nknowledge, justice and piety. In the Four Journeys, Mulla\nSadra provides this critical definition of philosophy that in itself\ncombines a characteristically Neoplatonic vision of philosophy that\nreconciles Plato and Aristotle: \nA number of elements in this definition require some commentary. \nIn his exegetical works he also discusses the process of understanding\nthe scriptures in terms of self-transformation, in which the reading\nof the text activates switches in the soul that facilitates its\nchange. He says: \nPhilosophical reasoning and the ability to rely upon one’s\nintellectual faculties is what privileges the human over other animals\nand hence it is critical for the human to pursue the path of\nphilosophy to realise their humanity. In this sense we can see the\ncomplementarity in Mulla Sadra’s thought between the practice of\nphilosophy as an understanding and grasping of extra-mental reality\nand as an exegetical practice of making sense of revelation,\npredicated upon the notion that there is a homology between scripture\nas a book and the cosmos as another book that ought to be read by the\nseeker and whose inquiry requires a common hermeneutics for a sage to\narticulate. \nMulla Sadra’s method of philosophizing is predicated upon three\nkey modes of acting. First, as we discussed above philosophy is a way\nof life, a lived mode of being and a process that involves spiritual\nexercises. For Mulla Sadra, philosophy pursues the summum\nbonum of enlightened engagement (ma‘rifa) and\ngoodly action, worthy not only of the Aristotelian but also the pious\nMuslim scholar. To philosophise is to cultivate piety, since the end\nof philosophy is the higher pious life, a reflection of a Hermetic\nideal trope. The more truth one knows, the more pious one becomes. In\nfact, the more intense one’s being, the better one is and the\nmore felicitous. Philosophy is a religious commitment that obscures\nthe conceptual boundary between theory and doctrine. The very pursuit\nof intellectual inquiry and discourse is itself the greatest good and\nthe means through which one knows how to live a good life, and enables\none to ascend to the highest heavenly host. The disciplining of the\nmind cures the soul of incorrect doxa and the disease of\nirrationality. It cures the suffering of the soul insofar as it\nreduces the alienation of the soul from the truth and ultimately from\nGod through the journey of the intellect back to the One. The dynamic\nof this journey involves the performance of spiritual exercises. Mulla\nSadra urges the reader to practise philosophy as an art and a method\nof self-improvement and spiritual enlightenment (Mulla Sadra 1986:\n232–3). The act of meditation is not irrational detachment but\nrather the exercise of reason (Hadot 1995: 59). Asceticism is a\nprerequisite for philosophy following the famous saying of first\nShiʿi Imam ‘Ali b. Abi Talib: ‘the study of wisdom\nrequires spiritual exercise and forsaking the world.’ In the\nintroduction to the Four Journeys, he urges self-purification\nand the pursuit of perfection to obtain divine grace and knowledge.\nTrue pedagogy allied with divine grace leads man to perfection and\nself-realisation. In his commentary upon Qur’anic chapter\nentitled the Event (al-Waqi‘a), he writes, \nThis is the preliminary stage through which everyone must pass, but a\nphilosopher, and a divine philosopher (hakim\nmuta’allih) seeking theosis, must go beyond this stage in\npursuit of the quest for reality. It is this quest that leads the\nwayfarer to a higher philosophy, a hikma muta‘aliya as\nhe describes it in the title of his major work. \nSecond, he integrates philosophical and spiritual reasoning because,\nas was common among Islamic Neoplatonists and especially in the method\nof Suhrawardi, he insisted that philosophy was a mode of Prophetic\nknowledge inherited in an initiatic chain from Adam down through the\nBiblical prophets, Greek philosophers, Indian and Babylonian sages\nthrough to the Prophet Muhammad and then on through the Muslim\nphilosophers and Sufis. In his treatise on creation (Risala fi\nhuduth al-‘alam), Mulla Sadra summaries this genealogy of\nphilosophy from Adam and the East to the Greeks: \nKnow that philosophy first issued from Adam, the chosen one of God and\nfrom his progeny Seth and Hermes and from Noah because the world can\nnever be free of a person who establishes knowledge of the unity of\nGod and of the return [to God]. The great Hermes disseminated it\n[philosophy] in the climes and in the countries and explained it and\ngave benefit of it to the people. He is the father of philosophers and\nthe most learned of the knowledgeable… \nAs for Rome and Greece, philosophy is not ancient in those places as\ntheir original sciences were rhetoric, epistolatory and\npoetry…until Abraham became a prophet and he taught them the\nscience of divine unity. It is mentioned in history that the first to\nphilosophise from among them [the Greeks] was Thales of Miletus and he\nnamed it philosophy. He first philosophised in Egypt and then\nproceeded to Miletus when he was an old man and disseminated his\nphilosophy. After him came Anaxagoras and Anaximenes of Miletus. After\nthem emerged Empedocles, Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato. (Mulla Sadra\n1999a: 153–4) \nThird, in terms of method, one needs to integrate ratiocinative,\npropositional knowledge and a linear mode of reasoning with more\nintuitive and non-propositional modes of knowing, including in\nparticular what is termed ‘immediate’ or\n‘presential’ knowledge. The knowledge of higher\nmetaphysical realities, similar to the Platonic tradition, requires\nthe cultivation of character and surpassing ratiocination. Just as\nPorphyry and others before had delimited lists of virtues, for Mulla\nSadra, the sage possesses the qualities of generosity, good humour,\nfine judgement, and a pronounced taste and experience of spiritual\ndisclosure (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, VI: 6). Truth must derive its\nlegitimacy and foundation from grace and revelation, and can never\nfind fertile soil merely in the rehearsal of the doctrines of previous\nphilosophers. Phenomenological experience is the ground for\nphilosophy. In the Four Journeys, Mulla Sadra writes: \nBut he is no mystical obscurantist nor does he privilege spiritual\nintuition above demonstration; rather he argues for their\ncomplementarity since ‘demonstration does not conflict with\ninner disclosure.’ The study of texts moves the seeker to\nconstruct a world, to make an intelligible order of the propositions\nand aporiai that he encounters. \nMulla Sadra is often described as a metaphysical revolutionary because\nof his uniquely posited doctrine of existence. The analysis of\nexistence commences with the ontological distinction between the\nNecessary (the principle, God) and the contingent. God is pure\nexistence without essence, quality or property that undergoes change\nor motion. The origins of this doctrine lie in Avicenna’s\naccount of radical contingency that considers the distinction between\nNecessary and contingent to be predicated upon the simplicity of\nexistence of the Necessary producing the complexity of the existence\nand essence of the contingent, where the contingent is an existent to\nwhom accidents pertain bundled in what is known as their\n‘essence’. Contingents are conceptually dyads of existence\n(the fact that they are) and essence (bundles of properties that\ndefine what they are, Mulla Sadra 2001–5, I: 289–92).\nSince God bestows existence upon contingents, or rather because\ncausally contingents derive their existence from their principle,\nexistence is ontologically prior to essence. Analytically, it may seem\nto us that the reverse is true because our encounter with things and\nevents takes the phenomenal form of acquaintance with the form and\nessence of that thing first. But in fact, Mulla Sadra’s position\non existence is even more radical than the Aristotelian doctrine of\npros hen homonymy. Substances are not the primary sense of existence\nbut rather ‘acts of existence’ or processes. In this, and\nin his doctrine of substantial motion that is discussed below, one can\nsee a systematic rejection of Aristotelian category theory. \nBefore examining the twin doctrines of the fundamental reality of\nexistence and its modulated but singular character at the heart of his\nmetaphysics, it is worth mentioning some of the preliminary positions\nthat he holds on the nature of existence: \nExistence is a concept that is innately and immediately grasped in the\nmind; it requires neither definition (ta‘rif) nor\ndescription (rasm) of any sort (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, I:\n45–6). Existence is a simple concept that does not have\nanalytically distinct part and hence is not amenable to definition.\nThere was a consensus on this doctrine stemming back at least to\nAvicenna as it arose out of an Aristotelian conception of essence and\nthe nature of definition. One defines and knows things through their\nessences but existence has no essence that is singular across its\ndifferent referents and manifestations. Similarly Mulla Sadra has an\nextended argument on why existence is not the ultimate genus or class\nof things (within the context of Porphyry’s five predicables,\nMulla Sadra 2001–5, IV: 424ff). Nor is existence a type of a\nuniversal to which individual particulars in reality are attached\n(Mulla Sadra 2001–5, I: 140). He refutes these positions\nprecisely because they were broached by thinkers prior to him who\ndenied any reality corresponding to the concept of existence. \nAs a concept, it is a secondary intelligible. Primary intelligibles\nare names that refer to essences possessing concrete referents in the\nworld such as ‘humanity’. Secondary intelligibles,\nhowever, are logical concepts, abstract notions, concepts based on\nderivative essences, and concomitants of essences (Mulla Sadra\n2001–5, I: 387). As such, being as a secondary intelligible is a\nconcept that is attached to an essence that exists in extra-mental\nreality (cf. Fana’i Ashkivari 2008: 75). As secondary\nintelligibles are higher order predicates, they are also homonymous\nterms that exist in the soul. There is a critical difference between\nexistence as a secondary intelligible and existence as an extra-mental\nreality. \nIt is a term predicated homonymously (mahmul mushtarak) of\nits referents. Many things exist that are qualitatively and\nquantitatively distinct but all carry the term ‘existence’\n(Mulla Sadra 2001–5, I: 40). Of course, the real question is\nwhether existence is merely homonymous in the way in which\n‘pole’ is. Existence constitutes a special case of\nhomonymy that he calls tashkik, a term already used by\nAvicenna to render the tertium quid of the ancients. He\nargues that the key properties of tashkik are difference\nbetween existents ‘by precedence and priority’\n(al-awlawiyya wa-l-awwaliyya), and ‘by being more prior\nand more intense’ (al-aqdamiyya wa-l-ashaddiyya) (Mulla\nSadra 2001–5, I: 42–3). This is posed directly in response\nto Avicenna’s denial that substances can be more intense or that\nthey can be distinguished by a non-accidental property that they\npossess. It is, therefore, in this sense that existence is both the\nsource of commonality and of distinction between existing things\nbecause unlike the Peripatetic tradition, he is insistent that\nexistence is the principle of individuation (tashakhkhus) of\na thing other than its essence. \nExistence is a real predicate for Mulla Sadra since it is a property\nof an essence that is found in extra-mental reality (Mulla Sadra\n2001–5, I: 47–52). It is a real (and not merely a logical\nor grammatical) predicate because ‘x exists’ is\ntrue for Mulla Sadra if and only if ‘x’ refers.\nSimilarly, if existence were not a predicate, we could not speak\nmeaningfully of essences that have no direct reference in reality\n(Mulla Sadra 2001–5, II: 5). Existence must be a predicate, or\nelse when we say ‘black exists’, we would be saying\n‘black is black’ which is a basic tautology. But given the\nAvicennan consensus of the superadded nature of existence over essence\n(ziyadat al-wujud ‘ala l-mahiyya) and their\ndistinction, this is not the case. For Mulla Sadra, existential\npropositions are not analytic. He argues that existence is not an\nanalytic part of essence. If in the proposition ‘man\nexists’ we took ‘man’ and ‘exists’ to be\nsynonyms, then it would be equivalent to stating that ‘man is\nman’, a tautology that does not benefit us. In ‘man\nexists’, ‘man’ refers to a universal\n‘humanity’. But ‘exists’ does have reference\ncontrary to those who deny reference to existence, taking it to be a\npurely mental concept. The referent in the predication of the\nproposition ‘Zayd exists’ is the very ipseity\n(huwiyya) of Zayd, that is his being (wujud).\nTherefore, existence is not an empty term but has referents in\nextra-mental reality, that is, it is both a concept and a reality\n(haqiqa ‘ayniyya). According to Mulla Sadra, many of\nthe puzzles and even mistakes in metaphysics can be avoided as long as\none keeps to the distinction between existence as a concept and as a\nreality. \nExistence is pure goodness (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, I: 395–7).\nMulla Sadra reiterates this basic Neoplatonic maxim. Existence is the\nground for all value and its absence constitutes evil. Because\nexistence is a primary concept without which no other concept is\nmeaningful, it is rationally good. This goodness stems from its\nprinciple, God, who is pure goodness and pure existence and through\nhis sustaining providence wishes to spread that goodness throughout\nthe cosmos. \nFor Mulla Sadra, existence is ontologically prior, a unified reality\ngraded in degrees of intensity and an elusive reality that cannot be\nfully grasped. Any attempt to conceptualise existence falsifies it\nthrough reification that determines an essence grasped in the mind\n(Mulla Sadra 1964: 6). A reified, fixed and immutable concept cannot\ncapture the nature of existence, which is dynamic and in flux.\nUltimately, essences are privative and, citing Ibn al-‘Arabi,\nthey ‘have never smelt the fragrance of being’. They are\nmerely posited in the mind as modes of making sense and of determining\nreality as ‘beings of reason’. Unpacking this metaphysical\npackage, one can discern three distinct doctrines of existence that\ndraw upon his intellectual influences, which include Avicennan\nphilosophy, the intuitive philosophy of the ishraqi school\nassociated with Suhrawardi, and the Sufi metaphysics of being of Ibn\nal-‘Arabi. \nThe first doctrine is the ontological primacy of existence (asalat\nal-wujud), a doctrine that is located within the debate on the\nAvicennan distinction between existence and essence in contingent\nbeings as seen through the prism of the Sufi metaphysics of\nontological monism (wahdat al-wujud). If contingents are\ncomposites, then one element of the composition is active and\nontologically prior. Is it the case that there are essences in some of\nbeing, such as humanity, that wait for a divine agent to actualize and\nindividuate them through the bestowal of existence, an essentialist\ndoctrine that posits a rather paradoxical existence of an essence\nbefore it comes to exist? Or as Mulla Sadra suggests, the divine agent\nproduces existences in this world that take on the “garb”\nof some particular essence. Existence must be ontologically prior not\nonly because of the absurdity of an existence before existence, but\nalso because God is devoid of essence, and his causal link to the\nworld can only be existential if one wishes to avoid the contamination\nof the divine nature with essences that are composites of different\nand multiple properties and features. Mulla Sadra uses this doctrine\nas part of his own ontological proof for the existence of God known as\nthe Proof of the Veracious (burhan al-siddiqin). The monism\nof the doctrine is expressed in the phrase basit al-haqiqa kull\nal-ashya’ (‘The simple reality is all things’,\na doctrine predicated on the Neoplatonic notion of the simple One):\nGod, the One is simple and pure Being and thus as such is the totality\nof existence. \nThe second doctrine is the modulation and gradation of existence\n(tashkik al-wujud). The semantics of the term\n‘existence’ and its modulated singularity commits Mulla\nSadra to a reality that is equally modulated and singular. Existence\nis a singular reality, as the phenomenal experience of existence as\nmultiple is illusory. But multiplicity in this world still needs to be\nexplained. Different existents in this world are thus different,\nintense degrees of a single whole. Thus there is a horizontal and a\nvertical hierarchy of existence that is connected and involved in a\nwhole chain of existence. The particular degrees of existence are not\nstable substances in the Aristotelian sense, and thus neither is\nSadrian ontology concerned with a multiplicity of substances or the\nproblem that would be raised by the objection: how can all things be\none substance? Gradation addresses one of the key problematics of\nmetaphysics that arise from Aristotelianism: “being is\npredicated in many ways” (Aristotle, Met. 1028a10).\nBeing is a common term that is applied to a number of contexts and\nexpressions: the mental context (mental being, conceptual being), the\nspoken context (being in speech), the written context (inscribed\nbeing), and the real context (concrete, extra-mental being). In all\nthese contexts, being is a shared notion and reality expressed in\ndifferent ways. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the doctrine\nis the claim that, not only is being the source of commonality, the\nfocal meaning of the instances of being as the Aristotelian tradition\nwould have it, it is also the source of metaphysical variance or\ndistinction, because the hierarchy of being is differentiated through\ndegrees of intensification and debilitation of being (ishtidad wa\ntada‘‘uf). Thus the old metaphysical debate about the\nOne and the many is settled in favour of both: being or existence is\nboth singular and multiple. The doctrine of the gradation thus\nprovides an explanation for the nature of spiritual hierarchies and\nthe different abilities and dispositions of people but also insists\nupon the ultimate singularity of human existence. Thus the ethical\nimplications of the doctrine are a thorough social and ontological\nequality of existents (including humanity, animals, and so forth)\ncoupled with an intellectual and spiritual hierarchy, order, and\ninequality. Mulla Sadra summaries modulation in the following\nmanner: \nThis leads us to the third doctrine that all individuals in existence\nundergo motion and flux, namely, substantial motion (haraka\njawhariyya). The doctrine follows from his position on existence\nand his rejection of Aristotle’s category theory. It also\ndemonstrates how he privileges becoming over static, immutable being.\nSubstantial motion is not the same as substances being in motion,\nwhich is considered obvious (Rahman 1975: 95–108; Jambet 2006:\n191–223; ‘Ubudiyyat 2006: 309–85). Within an\nAristotelian framework, there are two types of change: instantaneous\nsuch as the move from potentiality to actuality, and gradual such as\nthe ageing process in things that undergo generation and corruption.\nThis raises two objections to substantial motion: first, if existents\nare constantly motive, how can there be a subject that we recognise as\nundergoing change? Second, substances are manifest in essences and\nthese cannot be identified in their species form since motion denies\nthe fixity of the species (and genus) boundaries that define the\nessence. For Mulla Sadra, the second point is easier to treat:\nessences are not fundamental to which existence is accidental so the\nboundaries of what we may conceive an essence to be should not limit\nexistence. On the former, existence is its own subject. Drawing upon\nAristotelian hylomorphism, he argues that it is the matter of\nexistence that acquires forms as it constantly changes. An existing\nentity is not a stable substance constant in time to which change\noccurs as an accident, such as a young Zayd becoming old and greying;\nrather, it is a structure of unfolding, dynamic events of existence.\nThe young Zayd is thus literally not the same existent as the old\nZayd, since the change in him is substantial and existential. One\nimplication of this doctrine is that at every instance each existent\nis renewed and thus provides a solution to the old problem of time and\ncreation by asserting that the world is created in time, because at\neach instant all existence is new in time. As such consistent with\nother Safavid philosophers and in distinction from the earlier\nAvicennan tradition, he upholds a philosophical account of the\ntheological doctrine of God’s creation of the world from nothing\nin time. Another implication is to consider time as a dimension of\nexistence, as an analytic property of substantial motion, having no\nexistence independently. \nThese doctrines establish the basic principles for Mulla Sadra’s\nargument for the existence of God. There are many proofs for the\nexistence of God because as Mulla Sadra says there are many signs that\nindicate Him and facets about Him (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, VI: 15).\nKalam cosmological proofs began with the intuition of\nphenomenal existence requiring a cause; there was a creation which\nneeded a cause to be. There had to be a reason why there was something\nrather than nothing. Avicenna’s famous proof for the Necessary\nBeing began with the concept of existence, proceeded with a modal\ndistinction between necessity and contingent, and arrived at the\nexigency of a Necessary Being. Avicenna himself called his argument\nthe ‘proof of the veracious’ (burhan al-siddiqin)\nand his commentator Tusi provided a typology of three proofs for the\nexistence of a Creator, which in turn are the kalam\ncosmological argument, the proof from motion that derives from\nAristotle’s Physics, and the Avicennan ontological\nargument: \nThe systematic theologians infer from the origination of bodies and\nproperties [pertaining to them] the existence of the Creator and from\nconsidering the states of the creation to his attributes one after\nanother. \nThe natural philosophers also infer from the existence of motion a\nMover and from the impossibility of linking motive beings in a chain\ninfinitely the existence of the First Mover who is unmoved. Then from\nthat they infer the existence of the First Principle. \nHowever, the metaphysicians infer from their reflection upon being\nthat it is either necessary or contingent to prove the Necessary. Then\nby reflecting upon what is entailed by necessity and contingency, they\ninfer his attributes and from his attributes they infer the nature of\nthe emanation of his acts from him one after another. \nThe master mentioned the preponderance of this method over the others\nbecause it is more reliable and nobler. That is because the more\nexcellent of demonstrations is one that yields certainty and it is the\ninference from the cause to the effect; however, its opposite which is\nthe inference from the effect to the cause may yield certainty and\nthat is if the thing sought has a cause that can only be discerned\nthrough it as has been explained in apodeixis. These two\nlevels are posed in his saying — exalted is He: ‘We shall\nshow them our signs in the horizons and in their souls until it is\nclear to them that He is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is\nwitness for everything?’ [Q. 41:52] (Avicenna, al-Isharat\nwa-l-tanbihat, Qum, 1996, III: 66-7). \nTusi mentions two types of argumentation that the tradition describes\nas assertoric proof or quia (burhan inni) and\ndemonstrative proof or propter quid (burhan limmi),\nthe former is an inference from effect to cause and the latter is from\ncause to effect. The demonstrative proof for Mulla Sadra is the one\nthat is ‘most reliable, most illuminating and most noble’\nand it involves an inference of reality by taking God, Existence, as a\nwitness to the totality of existence. This is what he calls the\n‘way of the veracious’ (sabil al-siddiqin). What\nhe means by siddiq is not the same as Avicenna and the gap in\nmeaning is a good illustration of the difference in their\nphilosophical method. For Mulla Sadra, the siddiq is one who\npossesses intuition and inner disclosure that is attained through\ngrace and spiritual exercise. In the exegesis of Q. 57:19 on the\nphrase ‘those who believe in God and His messengers are the\nveracious ones and witness before their Lord’, he argues that\nthe siddiq is characterised by witnessing the truth through\ninner revelation: \nThe Avicennan argument was insufficient because it provided an\nassertoric not a demonstrative proof and because it engaged with the\nconcept but not the concrete reality of being. The Sadrian proof of\nthe veracious is a natural corollary to his position on the\nfundamental reality and modulation of existence; in fact the latter is\nsignificant for its proof. \nThese degrees of existence are acts of the divine essence such that\neven cosmological proofs are ultimately ontological. Ontological\nproofs depend on the intelligibility of the concept of being, which\nmust be shared between our notion of our existence and God’s\nexistence. This is precisely the point made earlier about the\npossibility of theology depending upon the concept of modulation. \nJourney III of the Four Journeys begins with a discussion of\nthe ways of proving the existence of God. Having discussed previous\ncosmological and ontological proofs, Mulla Sadra expresses his own\n‘method of the veracious’ (manhaj al-siddiqin) in\nthe following manner as a ‘detailed thought\nexperiment’: \nThe reality of existence (haqiqat al-wujud), by virtue of its\nbeing a simple thing (amran basitan), not possessing an\nessence or a constituent property or a means of being defined, is\nidentical to the Necessary, requiring the most complete perfection\nthat is infinitely intense, because every other degree [of existence],\nwhich is weaker in intensity is not the pure reality of existence.\nRather, it is existence with deficiency since the deficiency of\neverything is other than that thing necessarily. The deficiency of\nexistence is not existence itself but rather its privation and this\nprivation is merely attached to existence concomitantly and not the\nfoundation of existence, due to its actuality in a subsequent degree\n[of existence] and what comes after that. Deficiencies and privations\ncomprise secondary [entities] insofar as they are secondary, but the\nFirst is its complete perfection, which has no definition and nothing\nmay be conceived that is more perfect than it. Deficiency and\nontological indigence issue from emanation and existentiation and are\nperfected by it [the Necessary]. The haeccity of these secondaries is\nattached to the First. So he treats their deficiencies with his\nperfection and their ontological indigence with his ontological\nrichness. \nThus through this demonstration is the existence of the Necessary\nproven (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, VI: 17–8). \nThe Sadrian argument may be summarised as follows (in effect combining\ntwo syllogisms): \nThus the proof begins with the concept and reality of existence and of\nGod and ends with it. It displays an apparent similarity with the\nargument for the existence of God by intensity or the limit case\nargument found in Aquinas and discussed in Miller 1996, and even more\nrecently in some forms of the modal ontological argument (Nagasawa\n2017, Speaks 2018). \nNevertheless, the Sadrian proof remains susceptible to the common\ncriticisms of ontological proofs. It actually seems to be\ntautological. Because he argues that the reality of being eludes human\nability to confine it to discourse, it is not perhaps surprising that\nthe manhaj al-siddiqin is not in strictu sensu an\napodeictic proof. In a perceptive gloss, Tabataba’i (d. 1981),\nthe eminent philosopher and commentator, argues that Mulla Sadra does\nnot provide a demonstration but rather an assertoric argument because\nin effect all proofs for the existence of God begin with his effects\nand deduce his existence as the cause of those effects. This is\nbecause existence is an a priori intuition that all sound\nintellects possess and within that intuition, the existence of a\nNecessary Being is logically necessary. Proofs for the existence of\nGod, therefore, are not attempts at producing demonstrations that\nconvince or even fulfil the scientific parameters within proof theory,\nbut are mere reminders to what we already know in our souls and hence\ncorroborate and support faith in the One. This perhaps why Mulla Sadra\nnever refers to his argument as a ‘demonstration’ but as a\nway (manhaj) of understanding and as a thought experiment\n(tadhkira). Thus the ‘argument’ may be a useful\nmeans for the exposition of a theistic viewpoint but does not fall\ninto the category of persuasion. \nThe argument for the existence of God is related to a key doctrine\nthat explains the relationship of the One and the many through the\nnotion of the ‘simple reality’. This is central to Sadrian\nphilosophy, drawing upon the simplicity of the prior One in\nEnneads V.4[7].1.5–15, \nIn his Treatise on the union of the intellecting subject and object,\nMulla Sadra draws on the Plotiniana and states that the\nActive Intellect is all things. This follows from his doctrine of the\nprimacy and logical priority of existence. In the Four\nJourneys, he quotes the following text from the tenth chapter of\nthe Theologia Aristotelis, an extract that exemplifies how\nthe doctrine of the simple reality reconciles monism and pluralism by\nadvocating neither. \nIn his commentary, Mulla Sadra espouses a form of Neoplatonic\nprocession and doctrine of the intellect-psuchē that is at odds\nwith most of his philosophical discourse in the Four\nJourneys. First, he accepts the standard account of the\nTheologia. Nous as the first existent flows\nimmediately from the One and from it, existents proceed through the\nmediation of the intelligible realm. Second, the One is itself above\nperfection and plenitude. The first existent and the first perfect\nbeing is nous. This Neoplatonic background is significant\nbecause it seems to cause a problem for modulation. Can this simple\nreality be modulated and if that is the case does it not entail\nmultiplicity in the godhead? The second part of the objection is\nanswered in the quoted objection in the passage above. But for the\nfirst, following Enneads VI.2.20 it is clear that being is a\nquasi-genus in which the whole is prior to its parts but, because of\nits ‘potency’, remains unaffected by any procession. This\nrefers to the One, nous and all beings. \nThe doctrine of the simple reality is difficult but central to Sadrian\nphilosophy. The argument presented in the Wisdom of the\nThrone concerns the nature of God as that simple being and\nillustrates His knowledge of things through it (Morris 1981:\n98–99). The concept is central to resolving many theological\nproblems relating to the nature of God. Indeed, it is an important\nontological proof for the existence of God through an analysis of\nsimplicity. \nGod is simple being because He is described by being, and being is a\nunique, simple reality. It is simplicity devoid of essence (Mulla\nSadra 2001–5, VI: 45–51). That simplicity is\nuncontaminated by multiplicity, privation, imperfection or any such\nnegative property. God’s existence is pure and unencumbered by\ncomplexity such as an essence that might raise questions of genera,\ndivision, composition and definition. \nThis is God without multiplicity, at the level of singularity that\nencompasses the attributes considered intrinsically and not manifested\ntowards and manifesting the cosmos. The concept of a thing does not\nentail or include either its privation or its imperfection as there is\n‘no alterity in being since alterity is privation’. Thus\nthe simple reality that is God does not include or entail\nimperfections or privations. An objection to this could be that\nnegative attributes are affirmed in theology, especially in the\nShiʿi tradition in which one emphasises those concepts and\nproperties that cannot be predicated of Him such as ‘He is not a\nbody’, nor ‘confined in a space’ and so on. The\nanswer is that since these properties are negative, privative and\nimperfect, one can affirm them because ‘the negation of negation\nis being and the negation of imperfection is perfection in\nbeing’. \nMulla Sadra then proceeds to an analysis of language and\nsignification: \nThe point being made concerns the existence-essence distinction.\nEverything that is not simple but complex is a composite pair of\nexistence and essence. But it also illustrates how the simple reality\nis an existence and encompasses things qua their existence\nand not their essence. Even more so, the simple existence has\nnothing to be negated because simplicity cannot be analysed into parts\nor components. \nA simple reality cannot be predicated of anything since it is simple\nand unconditioned. This affirms diversity-in-unity since if nothing\ncan be predicated of God, then it follows that the cosmos cannot be\npredicated of Him. Thus, it denies existential monism. \nThe final part of the argument then relates this to the nature of\nGod’s knowledge and His immediate presence to things such that\nthe ‘claim of the unjust’ that He does not know\nparticulars cannot arise. This is, of course, a reference to the\ndispute between Avicenna and al-Ghazali on God’s knowledge of\nparticulars. \nThus simplicity defines the nature of God’s knowledge. \nThe doctrine of the simple reality has two further roles. First, it\nprovides a proof for the existence of God by perfection, as the most\nintense limit case, given that simplicity is an attribute of\nperfection. Second, it affirms his necessity in every sense thus\nnegating the famous doubt of Ibn Kammūna [d. 1284] of the\npostulation of two necessary existences. Simplicity denies any\ncontingent facet to God, who is necessary in every sense. God is\nsimple existence as He is uniquely necessary in and by Himself. \nMulla Sadra applies his metaphysics to problems in psychology and\neschatology as well. Just as the totality of existence is singular\nwith degrees of intensity, similarly intellect and the soul are\nsingular realities with grades of intensity, since there is an\nintimate connection among existence, the intellect, and the soul as\nthe concrete, intellectual, and psychic aspects of being. This entails\na thoroughgoing pan-psychism in which for Mulla Sadra all existents\nare sentient beings that aspire to be “more intense” than\nthey are, to a higher ontological level. Everything that exists thus\npossesses consciousness. Since all levels of intellect are connected,\nknowledge is an existential relationship of identity and the cognition\nof certainty in which the intellecting subject becomes identified with\nthe intellected object (ittihad al-‘aqil\nwa-l-ma‘qul). Further, he uses his doctrine of modulation\nto explain physical resurrection, a theological doctrine that\ntraditionally could not be philosophically demonstrated. He\ndistinguishes two levels of resurrection that involve two\n“types” of body, a purely physical one and an\n“imaginal” body that is as real as the physical. The\nimaginal body is at first resurrected and can be demonstrated. This is\npredicated upon the existence of an ontological state of being known\nas the imaginal (mithali) that mediates between an\nintelligible world of concepts and the sensible world of things. It is\nused to explain those traditions that discuss abstract concepts such\nas fear and desire as having physical or corporeal features in\nresurrection. Concepts from the intelligible world can mimic the\nphysicality of this world through the mediation of the imaginary realm\nof being. \nThe soul is an eternal and independent immaterial substance for Mulla\nSadra. It is separate from (but attached to) the body and is the true\nbearer of identity (Mulla Sadra 2004: 467). As we saw above in the\ndoctrine of substantial motion, the soul is on the path of perfection\ntowards simplicity and unity and its reversion to its origins in the\nOne. In itself the soul is eternal and incorruptible and does not die\nwith the body but reverts to its origins with the One (Mulla Sadra\n2004: 515). Where does the soul come from? Given the Neoplatonic\ninfluence on Mulla Sadra, one would expect him to insist upon the\npre-existence of the soul and various texts are adduced in favour of\nsuch a position. However, he makes a distinction between the species\n‘soul’ which he calls the ‘Adamic soul’ and\nthe individual human soul. The basic problem with allowing for the\npre-existence of the individual soul is that it potentially opens the\nway for a belief in metempsychosis which he rejects, as we shall see.\nIn the Wisdom of the Throne, he argues for the pre-existence\nof the human soul as a category: \nThe individual soul is the bearer of its body, its vehicle (Mulla\nSadra 2001–5, IX: 63–4). It comes into existence with the\nbody and still retains the sense of being the entelechy of the body\nwhich is why the two cannot be detached (Mulla Sadra 2004: 240). Just\nas existence is not an accident of essence but is the principle to\nwhich an essence is attached, similarly the soul is not an accident of\nthe body (Mulla Sadra 1981: 139). He cannot admit the pre-existence of\nparticular human souls because that might open the way towards\nmetempsychosis which is a doctrine that he vehemently rejects in his\neschatology. \nThe central feature of the soul-body relationship in Mulla Sadra is\nexpressed in the phrase that the soul is ‘corporeal in its\norigination and spiritual [or incorporeal] in its survival’\n(jismaniyyat al-huduth wa-ruhaniyyat al-baqa’). In the\nWisdom of the Throne, he describes the birth of the soul and\nits relationship to the body through its progression to the\nafterlife: \nIt is corporeal in its origination but incorporeal in its survival.\nThe first thing to be generated in its state of attachment is a\ncorporeal faculty, then a natural form, then a sensing soul in its\nlevels, then the reflective and recollective, and finally the rational\nsoul. It acquires the practical and then the theoretical intellect to\nthe limit of being an actualised intellect and finally the Active\nIntellect (Mulla Sadra 1981: 131–2). \nThe progress of the soul in this world is through the perfection of\nintellect that is the life and prime faculty of the soul. Its\nembodiment facilitates its acquisition of knowledge and the perfection\nof its intellect but also acts as a cage of restraint. What we see in\nthis passage above is the progression of the soul-intellect through\nthe five stages of the perfection of the intellect described in\nAvicenna. The soul begins as receptive potentially, then acquires the\nhabit of learning and intellecting until this is perfected; then it is\nan acquired intellect properly trained. The next stage is the ability\nof the soul to produce knowledge actively, by being an active\nintellect; finally it acquires certainty through union with the Active\nIntellect, a transcendent principle of perfect knowledge which we\ndiscuss below. The distinction between the sphere of the intellect and\nthat of the body constitutes a type of dualism that is reflected in\nMulla Sadra’s distinction between mental and extra-mental\nexistence.  \nFor Mulla Sadra, the mind possesses an ontological realm that one\ncalls mental existence, a concept that is equivalent to\nexistence-knowledge (Rahman 1975: 215-20). He is a realist in the\nsense that every thought must correspond to a real object even if it\nis a Meinong object, that is, an unreal object of cognition. By\npositing a realm of mental reality, he is a dualist. But the existence\nof the mind and mental existence are not the same since the existence\nof the mind is itself an extra-mental reality, while mental existence\nis what refers to extra-mental existence. This is a subtle but\nsignificant distinction. He clarifies this in response to an objection\nthat the existence of a thing cannot be analytically dissolved into\nthe mental and extra-mental (i.e. concrete) being of a thing.\nConsequently, for Mulla Sadra, the ‘hard problem’ of\nmind-body does not occur since the existence of the mind is\nextra-mental existence. There are two primary modes of existence each\ndistinct and radically non-interchangeable: being in re and\nmental existence. \nMental existence shares the same qualities, features and description\nas extra-mental existence because it is merely another mode of\nexistence, a certain sense of the term. Just as extra-mental existence\nis not ambiguous, neither is mental existence. It is homonymous and\nmodulated. Similarly mental existence is not a universal; we have seen\nabove the argument denying that the concept of existence is a\nuniversal. The distinction between mental and extra-mental is rooted\nin the Platonic distinction between sensible and intelligible being,\nand in the Avicennan distinction between existence and essence in\ncontingents. It is precisely because of mental existence that humans\ncan conceive of entities that do not have any reference in\nextra-mental reality.  \nMulla Sadra inherited a variety of theories ranging from Platonic\nrecollection (anamnesis) and division to Peripatetic\nsyllogistics, definitions and axiomatic science. Broadly speaking, our\nauthor recognises three different epistemological methods. The first\nis a co-relational model of knowledge (Mulla Sadra 2001-5, III: 317).\nIn this model, knowledge is a relation between a subject and an object\nthat is devoid of cognitive content in itself and is not intrinsically\nintelligible. It is a property of the knower and devoid of actual\nprocess. Knowledge is dispositional. As such, this theory is marked by\nradical internalism. This is a view associated with later mediaeval\ntheologians (especially Fakhr al-Din Razi) and rejected. It is\nunacceptable to Mulla Sadra precisely because it is predicated upon a\ndenial of mental being. According to this model, knowledge is negative\ninsofar as it is solipsistic (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, III: 318). \nThe second model is the correspondence or representation theory of\nknowledge by apprehension (al-‘ilm al-husuli\nal-irtisami). ‘I know that P’ means that\nthere is an external object P that corresponds to an internal\nconcept P. The mind is thus the ‘mirror of\nnature’. It judges a relationship between the extra-mental\nobject and the mental picture of it as described in\nWittgenstein’s picture theory. The inadequacies of this model\nare clear. It fails to account for conceivables that do not exist.\nKnowledge is the correspondence between the object and the subject,\nand mediated. It presupposes the existence of independent extra-mental\nentities ‘out there’ and is strongly dualistic. The mind\nabstracts the form from the matter of the thing and represents it. As\nsuch it is a negative fact. One can only grasp the form in the mind\nsince the essences of things are not available to us. But Mulla Sadra\nargues that the consequent is clearly false, so the antecedent is as\nwell (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, III: 316). They are available to us\ninsofar as they exist and are present to us. Knowledge is not an\nabstraction. The accidental material forms of intelligibles thus\ngrasped are not the true objects of knowledge; those are the pure\nintelligibles experienced directly (Ha’iri Yazdi 1992: 35). This\nPeripatetic doctrine is rejected. It is quite wrong to assume in this\nmodel that perception is so mediated that it requires an interface\nbetween the mind and external objects (often called qualia).\nThis model does not actually yield the reality of the thing, though it\ndoes seek the essence of things. Mulla Sadra quotes Avicenna (from\nal-Ta‘liqat, Avicenna 1973: 34). \nIt remains the case that Mulla Sadra accepts a correspondence theory\nof knowledge though it is not his preferred option for arriving at\nindubitable knowledge. \nHowever, these models are insufficient and do not yield certainty,\nwhich is only available through the third model of knowledge by\npresence. \nThis formulation draws heavily upon Suhrawardi’s earlier\nexposition of presential knowledge (e.g. Suhrawardi 1998: 79–81)\nbut with the distinction that Mulla Sadra explicitly refers to reality\nin terms of existence whereas for Suhrawardi existence is an empty\nconcept. Knowledge by presence extends the identity thesis posited in\nthe ancient tradition to entities beyond the divine and the pure\nintellects and in effect reverses the process of making sense of human\nknowledge that one finds in knowledge by representation. That latter\nprojects this model of human knowledge onto the divine and hence\ncannot fathom how God might know particulars in their particularity.\nWhereas knowledge by presence extends the nature of divine knowledge\nto the human and resolves the problem of God’s knowledge of\nparticulars by insisting upon the unitive nature of that\nknowledge. \nCritical to presential knowledge is the Porphyrian doctrine of the\nunity of the intellect, the intellecting subject and its intelligible\nobject. Pure self-knowledge for Plotinus depends on union with the\ndivine intellect that self-intellects. Such a noetic experience is\nnon-discursive. \nAvicenna strongly criticises this doctrine (Avicenna 1996, III:\n292–93; Avicenna 1959: 239–40). One thing cannot become\nanother substantially, nor can a rational soul unite with the Active\nIntellect which is indivisible. The human intellect cannot be united\nwith intelligibilia. Rather one knows things by conjunction\n(ittisal) not union (ittihad) with the Active\nIntellect from whence one grasps the universals of things immanent in\nit. The soul receives the forms from the Active intellect but remains\nunchanged itself. The forms inhere in the soul-intellect through the\nmaterial intellect. Avicenna criticises Porphyry for popularising the\nfallacy of union and change. But in doing so Avicenna marks a sharp\ndistinction between God’s knowledge and human knowledge.\nAccording to Mulla Sadra, one cannot hold such a view about\nGod’s knowledge because it violates both His unity and the fact\nof His knowledge of particulars. \nMulla Sadra’s criticism of Avicenna is predicated upon two\ncentral doctrines of his that are intimately linked to the hermeneutic\nof modulation. First, the primacy (and modulation) of existence proves\nthis union. \nSecond, the doctrine of (trans-)substantial motion defends union. The\nsoul is in motion as ‘pure act’ (fi‘liyya).\nFurther, union is not a substantial or even conceptual one but an\nepistemic and referential union in which the components ‘become\none existent insofar as a single intelligible notion refers to\nit.’ The ultimate nature of knowledge, like existence, does not\ndistinguish strictly between the divine and human. Multiplicity in the\nintellect does not entail multiplicity in God because these\nintelligibilia are correlated as ‘illuminative\nrelations’. Being-intellecting and being-intellected are\ncorrelatives that cannot exist independently. \nThe simple intellect (that is God) knows all things since all things\nare present in it and it is the ultimate referent for all concepts.\nThis is the ‘internality thesis’, that all intelligibilia\nare internal to intellect and the objects of sense perception are\nexternal. Our philosopher strongly criticises Avicenna for holding the\nconcept of the simple intellect (which for Avicenna is simple\ncognition that is non-discursive and without recourse to forms) whilst\ndenying the union of the intellecting subject and its object.\nFurthermore, for the Peripatetic tradition, the human intellect in\nthis life cannot attain the level of the pure simple intellect. Mulla\nSadra refutes this: \nThe mode of the existence of things in this simple intellect is known\nas ‘the thing (or fact) itself’ (nafs al-amr) or\nthe immanent object. This simple and higher intellect is not\nabstracted but contains all lower and complex forms and degrees of\nexistence. It is in this sense that this nous is a\n‘unity-in-plurality’. It is also the Aristotelian active\nintellect of De Anima III.5. \nBut how does one safeguard individuality and the ontological\ndistinction of man and God? The solution is through the concept of\nintelligibility and forms. All intelligibilia and forms exist\nin the simple/active intellect in potentia, but their\nactualisations are individual existents extrinsic to the intellect.\nThe Active intellect is thus the referent for the predication of\nintelligibilia. This union does not dissolve the individual\nexistence of intellects. \nTrue knowledge resides therefore in uniting with the Active Intellect.\nDistinction within this realm is by modulation, by varying motion and\nlights upon lights in order of nobility. In this model of knowledge,\nthere is pure self-reflexivity, no doxa about forms and no\nepistēmē about sensibilia. It is a form of\ninfallibilism. One cannot mistake state A for state\nB since one must first cognise state A. But is this\nform of knowledge useful and does it communicate? Or it is merely\nineffable like so many beliefs and feelings that are important to the\nway we live our lives. In the simple intellect one knows things at\nonce. Thus for a proposition A, we do not know S\nfirst and then P but both simultaneously. But the content of\nthe simple intellect unlike Avicenna’s account is not different\nto the discursive dianoic intellect. S and P are\ncontents of A whether one knows A simply or\ndiscursively. This deals with one of the famous objections to\nnon-propositional thought in Plotinus, that of entailing\nnon-complexity. What is required is an adequate metalanguage of such\nexperience since one can and does talk about such knowledge. One can\nforge a linguistic discipline to discuss it but the presential\nknowledge involved is not informational and cannot be grounds for\npublic knowledge but indicators for initiates. The immediacy,\ninfallibility and successful cognition of presential knowledge\nprivileges it over other epistemological models. \nFor Mulla Sadra, the eschaton is merely a new mode or renewal of\nexistence in a different level of manifestation and as such remains\nvery much within the remit of metaphysics. The very discussion of\neschatology within philosophy is significant. In the famous attack by\nal-Ghazali (d. 1111) in his Incoherence of the Philosophers,\nthinkers such as Avicenna were condemned for heresy for their failure\nto demonstrate the supposed Qur’anic account of physical\nresurrection and the reality of the afterlife. One of the features of\nMulla Sadra’s philosophy is to extend the remit of philosophy to\ncover issues on which the likes of Avicenna felt one needed to be\nsilent. Therefore, Mulla Sadra set himself the tasks of proving\nphysical resurrection, spending much time discussing what was meant by\nthe resurrection body (and indeed the body of the afterlife), the\nrefutation of metempsychosis and affirming the reality of the\nafterlife. His notion of existence as a constantly dynamic process of\nbecoming and unfolding that remains a singular reality and process\nallows him to incorporate this world of generation and corruption and\nannex it to the higher plane of resurrection and finally the existence\nof the afterlife. \nThe holism of Mulla Sadra’s approach may be seen in his\nexamination of eschatology. One of the key points of contention in\nmediaeval Islamic thought concerned the possibility of metempsychosis,\nan idea that had permeated through the Neo-pythagoreanising\nNeoplatonism of Late Antiquity into Islam. Previous Islamic\nphilosophers had even demonstrated some sympathy with the idea. But\nMulla Sadra, consistent with the tradition of Avicenna, rejected the\nnotion as inimical to his vision of the nature of the soul, its\npre-existence, its faculties and its afterlife. Before criticising\nmetempsychosis, Mulla Sadra argued that a proper understanding of the\nprinciples of his philosophical method will make clear his objection\nto the idea. In a number of works, he sets out eleven principles of\nhis method that show the relevance of metaphysics to psychology and\neschatology. In the relevant section of the Four Journeys,\nMulla Sadra (2001–5, IX: 261–72) describes these eleven\nprinciples: \nFirst, existence is a foundational principle and essence is an\naccidental property that pertains specifically to an existent.\nSignificantly, this also means that existence is not merely a concept\nthat one ascribes to a property that pertains to essences that we\nanalyse in extra-mental reality. \nSecond, and concomitantly, existence is the principle of\nindividuation, not essence. This amounts to saying the existence is\nthe prime determinant of identity and the bundled structure for\nvarious properties that pertain to an identity over time. \nThird, it is in the nature of existence that it is singular but graded\nand modulated. It undergoes intensification and debilitation. The\ndifferent essences that attach to existence in the mind are\ndifferentiated by species, genus and accident. \nFourth, and concomitantly, because existence undergoes\nintensification, substances that are manifestations of existence are\nconstantly in flux and undergo motion. \nFifth, and related point, every composite essence is defined and\nidentified by its form and not by its matter, because hylomorphism\naffirms that form is the active principle and matter the passive. \nSixth, following from the earlier point about identity, the identity\nof every single person is defined by its existence and this applies to\nheavenly bodies as well. \nSeventh, the identity of the body is determined by its soul and not by\nits materiality. Human identity remains constant through the\neternality of the soul from its form in the womb to childhood through\nto old age and into the grave and beyond into the world of the\nafterlife. \nEighth, the imaginative faculty (which in Mulla Sadra’s\nepistemology following Avicenna is critical for the production of new\nknowledge) is an immaterial property that does not inhere in a\nparticular part of the brain but rather transcends the body and hence\n(in Platonic terms) can unite with like immaterial intelligible in the\nhigher noetic world. \nNinth, imaginative forms are produced by the soul and are not merely\nstates in which the soul finds itself, that is, they are not passively\nreceived. \nTenth, corporeal and other physical forms became actualised through\nmatter receiving dispositions and states. \nEleventh and final point, existence is graded and has three primary\nplanes (defined again in Platonic terms): the world of material and\nsensible forms, the world of immaterial forms, and the world of\nintelligible forms. Humans, for example, retain the same existence and\nidentity across these three planes of being hence denying the need for\nmetempsychosis. Metaphysics therefore determines one’s view of\neschatology and the afterlife and provides the principles for\nunderstanding one’s origins, present states and the future. \nThe future is also the culmination and the perfection of the present.\nExistence is in motion towards perfection. The existence of a thing is\nassociated with its perfected form in the future. In this sense, the\nafterlife is merely a relative concept. As we have seen, it is the\nintellect and the faculty of imagination that are the distinguishing\nfeatures that constitute individual survival. Contrary to most\nphilosophers before him, matter is not the principle of individuation\nand therefore individual identity and personhood can exist divorced\nfrom matter, and the soul is immaterial, as are the bodies of the\nafterlife (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, IX: 311). \nOne’s existence is a process of reversion to the One, an\nunfolding of becoming that progresses from our corporeal incipience\nwith the body through the perfection of the soul that gradually\njettisons the physical body of this world in search of the beatitude\nand ecstasy of the intelligible world and of the afterlife (Mulla\nSadra 2001–5, IX: 164). The existence of the afterlife is more\nsubtle, more perfect and closer to the One. The pleasures and pains of\nthe afterlife that are scripturally discussed are primarily spiritual\nand intelligible although they retain an attachment to a body, unlike\nthe body of this world, one which is devoid of matter (Mulla Sadra\n2001–5, IX: 165–6). \nMatter is inert and pure potentiality and, since the existence of the\nafterlife is free from potentiality and baseness, the body of the\nafterlife cannot be material. It is an image of the body that a\nparticular identity possessed. Mulla Sadra was keen to insist upon the\nQur’anic account of bodily resurrection but he recognised that\nit was difficult to provide a philosophical account of the\nresurrection of this world’s physical body. Hence his solution\nis to argue that humans have different bodies corresponding to\ndifferent levels of existence, in itself an application of substantial\nmotion. Corporeal existence is not eternal but mortal (Mulla Sadra\n2001–5, IX: 167). Bodies in this world exist through sensible\nforms; but the existence of the afterlife involves spiritual bodies\nattached to intelligible forms (Jambet 2006: 394–6). A corollary\nof his position on the survival of the soul-intellect in the afterlife\nthrough its perfection is the recognition that some intellects that\nremain potential and un-actualised have no afterlife. They are\nprevented from sharing in the happiness of the afterlife because the\nexistence of the afterlife has no place for the absence of active\nintellect and potentiality (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, IX:\n183–8). The account that he gives of the afterlife for the body\nis simple. The soul has creative power that stems from its direct\nrelationship with the creative power of God and after the death of the\nbody, it does not lose that power, nor does it lose its memory.\nRather, it produces a body of sorts from the memory of its prior\nembodiment and its mutual growth from its corporeal inception. The key\nissue was whether that body which the soul provides in the afterlife,\nanimated by the creative power of the divine, constitutes the bodily\nresurrection of scripture. \nMulla Sadra, wishing to save the appearance of the Qur’anic\naccount, asserts that scripture does not define the nature of the body\nthat is resurrected. The body of this world has physicality,\ncorporeality, volume and so forth and significantly is finite. The\nbody of the afterlife is ‘born of the (perfected) soul’\nand still retains the property of being a body but unlike one with\nwhich we are familiar (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, IX, 279–80).\nThe second birth of the human is this new body and soul of the\nafterlife: he tries to settle his argument with a quotation from\nJesus: ‘One who is not born twice will never reach the heavens\nof the afterlife’ (Mulla Sadra 2001–5, IX: 302). \nMulla Sadra has become the dominant philosopher of the Islamic East\nand his approach to the nature of philosophy has been exceptionally\ninfluential. His real achievement apart from his doctrinal\npropositions was to effect a culmination of a tendency within the\nphilosophical schools of the post-Avicennan period, namely to\nsynthesize and reconcile reason and intuition, faith and rational\ninquiry, philosophy and mysticism within a largely late Neoplatonic\nparadigm of doing philosophy. Philosophy is thus a practice and a way\nof life in which reflection, reading, and learning are always\ncomplemented by spiritual practices and exercises. One cannot become a\nsage purely on the basis on one’s own intellectual efforts, nor\ncan one truly understand the nature of reality as an illiterate\nascetic reliant solely on mystical intuition. In this way, Mulla\nSadra, in a manner representative of a number of Muslim thinkers\ninsistent upon the median way of their faith, represents a mean\nbetween ‘excessive’ ratiocination and the unfettered\nclaims of pure experience made by mystics. \nHis influence on philosophical practice and learning is evident. His\ncommentary on the peripatetic work al-Hidaya (The Guidance)\nof Athir al-Din Abhari (d. 662 AH/1264) became the cornerstone of the\nrationalist curriculum of the Indian madrasa from the 18th century. In\nIran, the study of Islamic philosophy takes its cue from the study and\ncommentary on his major works at least from the nineteenth century.\nThe revival of Islamic philosophy in Isfahan ushered in by ‘Ali\nNuri (d. 1251 AH/1836) and later Hadi Sabzavari (d. 1289 AH/1873),\ndescribed as the ‘last great Islamic philosopher,’\nestablished Mulla Sadra as the ultimate philosopher, whose thought and\narguments ‘transcended’ discursive Peripatetic philosophy\nand also intuitive and allusive mystical arguments and discourse, in\nfavour of a higher synthesis that combined ratiocinative arguments\nwith mystical insight, complete syllogistic demonstrations with\nnarrative, allusion, and allegory. In more recent times, some of the\nkey thinkers involved in the Islamic Revolution of 1979, such as\nAyatollah Khomeini and Mortaza Motahhari, were profoundly influenced\nby the thought of Mulla Sadra, and some have even attempted to\nappropriate Mulla Sadra as the ‘philosopher of the\nRevolution’ despite the distinct lack of an engagement with\npolitical philosophy in his work. The contemporary generation of\nseminary trained philosophers in Iran including the prayer leader of\nQum, Ayatullah ‘Abdullah Javadi Amuli (who has a useful twenty\nvolume commentary on the Four Journeys), are all students of\nthe late ‘Allama Tabataba’i (d. 1981) who wrote an\ninfluential set of glosses on the work of Mulla Sadra. His school\ndominates the Shi‘i seminary in Iran. \nHowever, there are other philosophical trends in the contemporary\nperiod that are quite critical of Mulla Sadra’s approach and\nmetaphysics. It took some time for Mulla Sadra to become dominant. The\nAvicennan tradition remained strong throughout the Safavid period and\nbeyond with his own student and son-in-law ʿAbd al-Razzaq Lahiji\ndefending Avicennan forms of essentialism, and later father and son\nphilosophers Husayn (d. 1098/1687) and Jamal Khwansari (d. 1125/1714)\ncriticising Mulla Sadra’s concept of mental existence and the\nmodulation of being, explicitly rejecting his positions in their\ncommentaries on the Cure of Avicenna. This Avicennan critique\nof Mulla Sadra remained into the 18th and 19th centuries. Mahdi Naraqi\n(d. 1794) was a prolific glossator on Avicenna and critiqued the\n‘mysticising’ approach of Mulla Sadra to metaphysics.  \nOthers such as Mirza Abu-l-Hasan Jilveh (d. 1896) and his students\ncontinued to defend an ontology of substances and metaphysical\npluralism, while monists such as Muhammad Riza Qumshihi (d. 1888) were\nequally dissatisfied with Mulla Sadra’s attempt to reconcile\nmonism and pluralism. The Shaykhi school established by Shaykh Ahmad\nal-Ahsa’i (d. 1826) took issue with the ontological commitments\nof Mulla Sadra’s semantics of being. A more recent tendency, the\nso-called school of the separation of the religious and secular\nsciences (maktab-i tafkik), accuse Mulla Sadra of conflating\nthe faith and the study of scripture with ‘Greek science’\nand of violating the literal sense of scriptural verses in pursuit of\nhis philosophical agenda; they argue that Mulla Sadra does not\nrepresent an ‘authentic’, scripturalist philosophy. \nThe modern reception of Mulla Sadra is similar to other great thinkers\nof the past and one can discern at least four types of scholars who\nengage in his thought. First, there are the traditional Shi‘i\nseminarians who consider themselves to be disciples of Mulla Sadra and\nhence continuing a scholastic tradition that goes back to the 17th\ncentury. They do not engage his thought critically, nor do they take\nlater critiques of him seriously. We might call them the\ntraditionalists. Second, we find thinkers influenced by analytic\nphilosophy who wish to champion his thought and who attempt to\nreformulate his ideas in terms that would be comprehensible to\nphilosophers from the Anglo-American analytic tradition. In that\nsense, they treat Mulla Sadra similarly to Kant or Locke or Aristotle.\nWe might call them the analyticisers. Third, we have those who insist\nthat Mulla Sadra’s true inclinations were mystical and that\ninstead of attempting to open a dialogue with analytic philosophy, one\nmight find some common ground with continental philosophers but more\nfruitfully with those interested in mysticism and the occult. We might\ncall them the theosophers. Finally, we have scholars engaged with\nMulla Sadra in order to develop their own pride in the achievements of\ntheir Iranian heritage and consider him to be the greatest\nintellectual contribution of Iran. We might call them the nativists.\nThese types are not mutually exclusive. But what is clear is the many\nways in which the legacy of Mulla Sadra is contested and used in the\ncontemporary world. It would be a greater achievement if they took his\nrejection of adhering to authority more seriously and embraced his\nidea of the need to rethink and reanalyse philosophical problems\nfreshly for themselves. That would be a fitting legacy for Mulla Sadra\nin a critical, contemporary age. ","contact.mail":"s.h.rizvi@exeter.ac.uk","contact.domain":"exeter.ac.uk"}]
