In the most basic sense of the term,\nself-consciousness is not something that comes about the moment one\nattentively inspects or reflectively introspects one’s\nexperiences, or recognizes one’s specular image in the mirror,\nor refers to oneself with the use of the first-person pronoun, or\nconstructs a self-narrative. Rather, these different kinds of\nself-consciousness are to be distinguished from the pre-reflective\nself-consciousness which is present whenever I am living through or\nundergoing an experience, e.g., whenever I am consciously perceiving\nthe world, remembering a past event, imagining a future event,\nthinking an occurrent thought, or feeling sad or happy, thirsty or in\npain, and so forth.\n\nOne can get a bearing on the notion of pre-reflective\nself-consciousness by contrasting it with reflective\nself-consciousness. If you ask me to give you a description of the\npain I feel in my right foot, or of what I was just thinking about, I\nwould reflect on it and thereby take up a certain perspective that was\none order removed from the pain or the thought. Thus, reflective\nself-consciousness is at least a second-order cognition. It may be the\nbasis for a report on one’s experience, although not all reports\ninvolve a significant amount of reflection. \nIn contrast, pre-reflective self-consciousness is pre-reflective in\nthe sense that (1) it is an awareness we have before we do any\nreflecting on our experience; (2) it is an implicit and first-order\nawareness rather than an explicit or higher-order form of\nself-consciousness. Indeed, an explicit reflective self-consciousness\nis possible only because there is a pre-reflective self-awareness that\nis an on-going and more primary kind of self-consciousness. Although\nphenomenologists do not always agree on important questions about\nmethod, focus, or even whether there is an ego or self, they are in\nclose to unanimous agreement about the idea that the experiential\ndimension always involves such an implicit pre-reflective\n self-awareness.[1]\n In line with Edmund Husserl (1959, 189, 412), who maintains that\nconsciousness always involves a self-appearance\n(Für-sich-selbst-erscheinens), and in agreement with\nMichel Henry (1963, 1965), who notes that experience is always\nself-manifesting, and with Maurice Merleau-Ponty who states that\nconsciousness is always given to itself and that the word\n‘consciousness’ has no meaning independently of this\nself-givenness (Merleau-Ponty 1945, 488), Jean-Paul Sartre writes that\npre-reflective self-consciousness is not simply a quality added to the\nexperience, an accessory; rather, it constitutes the very mode of\nbeing of the experience: \nIn short, unless a mental process is pre-reflectively self-conscious\nthere will be nothing it is like to undergo the process, and it\ntherefore cannot be a phenomenally conscious process (Zahavi 1999,\n2005, 2014). An implication of this is obviously that the\nself-consciousness in question is so fundamental and basic that it can\nbe ascribed to all creatures that are phenomenally conscious,\nincluding various non-human animals. \nThe notion of pre-reflective self-awareness is related to the idea\nthat experiences have a subjective ‘feel’ to them, a\ncertain (phenomenal) quality of ‘what it is like’ or what\nit ‘feels’ like to have them. As it is usually expressed\noutside of phenomenological texts, to undergo a conscious experience\nnecessarily means that there is something it is like for the subject\nto have that experience (Nagel 1974; Searle 1992). This is obviously\ntrue of bodily sensations like pain. But it is also the case for\nperceptual experiences, experiences of desiring, feeling, and\nthinking. There is something it is like to taste chocolate, and this\nis different from what it is like to remember or imagine what it is\nlike to taste chocolate, or to smell vanilla, to run, to stand still,\nto feel envious, nervous, depressed or happy, or to entertain an\nabstract belief. \nAll of these different experiences are, however, also characterized by\ntheir distinct first-personal character. The what-it-is-likeness of\nphenomenal episodes is properly speaking a\nwhat-it-is-like-for-me-ness. This for-me-ness doesn’t refer\nto a specific experiential quality like sour or soft, rather it refers\nto the distinct first-personal givenness of experience. It refers to\nthe fact that the experiences I am living through are given\ndifferently (but not necessarily better) to me than to anybody else. I\nmay see that you are sad, but my seeing your sadness is qualitatively\ndifferent from my living through my sadness. It could consequently be\nclaimed that anybody who denies the for-me-ness of experience simply\nfails to recognize an essential constitutive aspect of experience.\nSuch a denial would be tantamount to a denial of the first-person\nperspective. It would entail the view that my own mind is either not\ngiven to me at all—I would be mind- or self-blind—or is presented\nto me in exactly the same way as the minds of others. \nOne sometimes distinguishes two uses of the term\n‘conscious’, a transitive and an intransitive use. On the\none hand, we can speak of our being conscious of something, be\nit x, y, or z. On the other, we can speak of our\nbeing conscious simpliciter (rather than non-conscious). For\nsome time a widespread way to account for intransitive consciousness\nin cognitive science and analytic philosophy of mind has been by means\nof some kind of higher-order theory. The distinction between conscious\nand non-conscious mental states has been taken to rest upon the\npresence or absence of a relevant meta-mental state (e.g., Armstrong\n1968; Carruthers 1996, 2000; Lycan 1987, 1996; Rosenthal 1997). Thus,\nintransitive consciousness has been taken to depend upon the mind\ndirecting its intentional aim at its own states and operations. As\nCarruthers puts it, the subjective feel of experience presupposes a\ncapacity for higher-order awareness: “such self-awareness is a\nconceptually necessary condition for an organism to be a subject of\nphenomenal feelings, or for there to be anything that its experiences\nare like” (1996, 152). But for Carruthers, the self-awareness in\nquestion is a type of reflection. In his view, a creature must be\ncapable of reflecting upon, thinking about, and hence conceptualizing\nits own mental states if those mental states are to be states of which\nthe creature is aware (1996, 155, 157). \nOne might share the view that there is a close link between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness and still disagree about the\nnature of the link. And although the phenomenological view might\nsuperficially resemble the view of the higher-order theories, we are\nultimately confronted with two quite different accounts. The\nphenomenologists explicitly deny that the self-consciousness that is\npresent the moment I consciously experience something is to be\nunderstood in terms of some kind of higher-order monitoring. It does\nnot involve an additional mental state, but is rather to be understood\nas an intrinsic feature of the primary experience. That is, in\ncontrast to higher-order accounts of consciousness that claim that\nconsciousness is an extrinsic or relational property of those mental\nstates that have it, a property bestowed upon them from without by\nsome further state, the phenomenologists would typically argue that\nthe feature in virtue of which a mental state is conscious is an\nintrinsic property of those mental states that have it. Moreover, the\nphenomenologists also reject the attempt to construe intransitive\nconsciousness in terms of transitive consciousness, that is, they\nreject the view that a conscious state is a state we are conscious of\nas object. To put it differently, not only do they reject the view\nthat a mental state becomes conscious by being taken as an object by a\nhigher-order state, they also reject the view (generally associated\nwith Brentano) according to which a mental state becomes conscious by\ntaking itself as an object (cf. Zahavi 2004; 2014). \nWhat arguments support the phenomenological claims, however?\nPhenomenologists don’t simply appeal to a correct phenomenological\ndescription but provide additional, more theoretical, arguments. One\nline of reasoning found in virtually all of the phenomenologists is\nthe view that the attempt to let (intransitive) consciousness be a\nresult of a higher-order monitoring will generate an infinite regress.\nOn the face of it, this is a rather old idea. Typically, the regress\nargument has been understood in the following manner. If all occurrent\nmental states are conscious in the sense of being taken as objects by\noccurrent second-order mental states, then these second-order mental\nstates must themselves be taken as objects by occurrent third-order\nmental states, and so forth ad infinitum. The standard\nresponse to this objection is that the regress can easily be avoided\nby accepting the existence of non-conscious mental states. This is\nprecisely the position adopted by the defenders of higher-order\ntheory. For them a second-order perception or thought does not have to\nbe conscious. It would be conscious only if accompanied by a\n(non-conscious) third-order thought or perception (Rosenthal 1997,\n745). The phenomenological reply to this solution is rather\nstraightforward, however. The phenomenologists would concede that it\nis possible to halt the regress by postulating the existence of\nnon-conscious mental states, but they would maintain that such an\nappeal to the non-conscious leaves us with a case of explanatory\nvacuity. That is, they would find it quite unclear why the relation\nbetween two otherwise non-conscious processes should make one of them\nconscious. Or to put it differently, they would be quite unconvinced\nby the claim that a state without subjective or phenomenal qualities\ncan be transformed into one with such qualities, i.e., into an\nexperience with first-personal character, by the mere addition of a\nnon-conscious meta-state having the first-state as its intentional\nobject. \nThe phenomenological alternative avoids the regress. As Sartre writes:\n“[T]here is no infinite regress here, since a consciousness has no\nneed at all of a reflecting [higher-order] consciousness in order to\nbe conscious of itself. It simply does not posit itself as an\nobject” (1936, 29 [1957, 45]). That is, pre-reflective\nself-consciousness is not transitive in relation to the state (of)\nwhich it is aware. It is, as Sartre puts it, the mode of existence of\nconsciousness itself. This does not mean that a higher-order\nmeta-consciousness is impossible, but merely that it always\npresupposes the existence of a prior non-objectifying, pre-reflective\nself-consciousness as its condition of possibility. To quote Sartre\nagain, “it is the non-reflective consciousness which renders the\nreflection [and any higher-order representation of it] possible”\n(1943, 20 [1956, liii]).  \nThere are also lines of argumentation in contemporary analytical\nphilosophy of mind that are close to and consistent with the\nphenomenological conception of pre-reflective self-awareness. Alvin\nGoldman provides an example: \nA similar view has been defended by Owen Flanagan, who not only argues\nthat consciousness involves self-consciousness in the weak sense that\nthere is something it is like for the subject to have the experience,\nbut also speaks of the low-level self-consciousness involved in\nexperiencing my experiences as mine (Flanagan 1992, 194). As Flanagan\nquite correctly points out, this primary type of self-consciousness\nshould not be confused with the much stronger notion of\nself-consciousness that is in play when we are thinking about our own\nnarrative self. The latter form of reflective self-consciousness\npresupposes both conceptual knowledge and narrative competence. It\nrequires maturation and socialization, and the ability to access and\nissue reports about the states, traits, dispositions that make one the\nperson one is. Other philosophers who have defended comparable views,\ninclude José Luis Bermúdez (1998), who has argued that that\nthere are a variety of nonconceptual forms of self-consciousness that\nare “logically and ontogenetically more primitive than the higher\nforms of self-consciousness that are usually the focus of\nphilosophical debate” (1998, 274; also see Poellner 2003), and Uriah\nKriegel (2009) who has defended the existence of a type of\nself-consciousness that is intrinsic to and inherent in phenomenal\nconsciousness. Across a variety of philosophical studies, then, one\nfinds support for the phenomenological conception of pre-reflective\nself-awareness. \nThat pre-reflective self-awareness is implicit, then, means that I am\nnot confronted with a thematic or explicit awareness of the experience\nas belonging to myself. Rather we are dealing with a non-observational\nself-acquaintance. Here is how Heidegger and Sartre put the point: \nIn other words, every positional consciousness of an object is at the\nsame time a non-positional consciousness of itself. If I count the\ncigarettes which are in that case, I have the impression of disclosing\nan objective property of this collection of cigarettes: they are a\ndozen. This property appears to my consciousness as a property\nexisting in the world. It is very possible that I have no positional\nconsciousness of counting them. Then I do not know myself as counting.\nYet at the moment when these cigarettes are revealed to me as a dozen,\nI have a non-thetic consciousness of my adding activity. If anyone\nquestioned me, indeed, if anyone should ask, “What are you doing\nthere?” I should reply at once, “I am counting.”\n(Sartre 1943, 19–20 [1956, liii]). \nIt might be clarifying to compare the phenomenological notion of\npre-reflective self-consciousness with the one defended by Brentano.\nAccording to Brentano as I listen to a melody I am aware that I am\nlistening to the melody. He acknowledges that I do not have two\ndifferent mental states: my consciousness of the melody is one and the\nsame as my awareness of perceiving it; they constitute one single\npsychical phenomenon. On this point, and in opposition to higher-order\nrepresentation theories, Brentano and the phenomenologists are in\ngeneral agreement. But for Brentano, by means of this unified mental\nstate, I have an awareness of two objects: the melody and my\nperceptual experience.  \nHusserl disagrees on just this point, as do Sartre and Heidegger: my\nawareness of my experience is not an awareness of it as an\n object.[2]\n My awareness is non-objectifying in the sense that I do not occupy\nthe position or perspective of a spectator or in(tro)spector who\nattends to this experience in a thematic way. That a psychological\nstate is experienced, “and is in this sense conscious, does not\nand cannot mean that this is the object of an act of consciousness, in\nthe sense that a perception, a presentation or a judgment is directed\nupon it” (Husserl 1984a, 165 [2001, I, 273]). In pre-reflective\nself-awareness, experience is given, not as an object, but precisely\nas subjective experience. For phenomenologists, intentional experience\nis lived through (erlebt), but does not appear in an\nobjectified manner. Experience is conscious of itself without being\nthe intentional object of consciousness (Husserl 1984b, 399; Sartre\n1936, 28–29). That we are aware of our lived experiences even if\nwe do not direct our attention towards them is not to deny that we can\ndirect our attention towards our experiences, and thereby take them as\nobjects of reflection (Husserl 1984b, 424). \nTo be self-aware is not to capture a pure self or self-object that\nexists separately from the stream of experience, rather it is to be\nconscious of one’s experience in its intrinsic first-person mode\nof givenness. When Hume, in a famous passage in A Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739), declares that he cannot find a self when he\nsearches his experiences, but finds only particular perceptions or\nfeelings, it could be argued that he overlooks something in his\nanalysis, namely the specific givenness of his own experiences.\nIndeed, he was looking only among his own experiences, and\nseemingly recognized them as his own, and could do so only on the\nbasis of that immediate self-awareness that he seemed to miss. As C.O.\nEvans puts it: “[F]rom the fact that the self is not an object\nof experience it does not follow that it is non-experiential”\n(Evans 1970, 145). Accordingly, we should not think of the self, in\nthis most basic sense, as a substance, or as some kind of ineffable\ntranscendental precondition, or as a social construct that gets\ngenerated through time; rather it is an integral aspect of conscious\nlife, and involves this immediate experiential character. \nOne advantage of the phenomenological view is that it is capable of\naccounting for some degree of diachronic unity, without actually\nhaving to posit the self as a separate entity over and above the\nstream of consciousness (see the discussion of time-consciousness in\nSection 3 below). Although we live through a number of different\nexperiences, the experiencing itself remains a constant in regard to\nwhose experience it is. This is not accounted for by a substantial\nself or a mental theater. On this point Hume was right. There is no\npure or empty field of consciousness upon which the concrete\nexperiences subsequently make their entry. The field of experiencing\nis nothing apart from the specific experiences. Yet we are naturally\ninclined to distinguish the strict singularity of an experience from\nthe continuous stream of changing experiences. What remains constant\nand consistent across these changes is the sense of for-me-ness (or\nperspectival ownership) constituted by pre-reflective self-awareness.\nOnly a being with this sense of ownership could go on to form concepts\nabout herself, consider her own aims, ideals, and aspirations as her\nown, construct stories about herself, and plan and execute actions for\nwhich she will take responsibility.  \nThe concept of pre-reflective self-awareness is related to a variety\nof philosophical issues, including epistemic asymmetry, immunity to\nerror through misidentification and self-reference. We will examine\nthese issues each in turn. \nIt seems clear that the objects of my visual perception are\nintersubjectively accessible in the sense that they can in principle\nbe the objects of another’s perception. A subject’s\nperceptual experience itself, however, is given in a unique way to the\nsubject herself. Although two people, A and B, can\nperceive a numerically identical object, they each have their own\ndistinct perceptual experience of it; just as they cannot share each\nother’s pain, they cannot literally share these perceptual\nexperiences. Their experiences are epistemically asymmetrical in this\nregard. B might realize that A is in pain; he might\nsympathize with A, he might even have the same kind of pain\n(same qualitative aspects, same intensity, same proprioceptive\nlocation), but he cannot literally feel A’s pain the\nsame way A does. The subject’s epistemic access to her\nown experience, whether it is a pain or a perceptual experience, is\nprimarily a matter of pre-reflective self-awareness. If secondarily,\nin an act of introspective reflection I begin to examine my perceptual\nexperience, I will recognize it as my perceptual experience only\nbecause I have been pre-reflectively aware of it, as I have been\nliving through it. Thus, phenomenology maintains, the access that\nreflective self-consciousness has to first-order phenomenal experience\nis routed through pre-reflective consciousness, for if we were not\npre-reflectively aware of our experience, our reflection on it would\nnever be motivated. When I do reflect, I reflect on something with\nwhich I am already experientially familiar. \nThe ease with which we self-ascribe experiences is partially to be\nexplained by appeal to pre-reflective self-awareness. It is important\nto emphasize, however, that pre-reflective self-awareness is only a\nnecessary and not a sufficient condition for reflective\nself-ascription and first-person knowledge. Many animals who possess\npre-reflective self-consciousness obviously lack the cognitive\nresources needed for reflective self-ascriptions.  \nWhen I experience an occurrent pain, perception, or thought, the\nexperience in question is given immediately and noninferentially. I do\nnot have to judge or appeal to some criteria in order to identify it\nas my experience. There are no free-floating experiences;\neven the experience of freely-floating belongs to someone. As William\nJames (1890) put it, all experience is “personal.” Even in\npathological cases, as in depersonalization or schizophrenic symptoms\nof delusions of control or thought insertion, a feeling or experience\nthat the subject claims not to be his is nonetheless experienced by\nhim as being part of his stream of consciousness. The complaint of\nthought insertion, for example, necessarily acknowledges that the\ninserted thoughts are thoughts that belong to the subject’s\nexperience, even as the agency for such thoughts are attributed to\nothers. This first-person character entails an implicit experiential\nself-reference. If I feel hungry or see my friend, I cannot be\nmistaken about who the subject of that experience is, even if I can be\nmistaken about it being hunger (perhaps it’s really thirst), or\nabout it being my friend (perhaps it’s his twin), or even about\nwhether I am actually seeing him (I may be hallucinating). As\nWittgenstein (1958), Shoemaker (1968), and others have pointed out, it\nis nonsensical to ask whether I am sure that I am the one who\nfeels hungry. This is the phenomenon known as “immunity to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun.”\nTo this idea of immunity to error through misidentification, the\nphenomenologist adds that whether a certain experience is experienced\nas mine, or not, does not depend upon something apart from the\nexperience, but depends precisely upon the pre-reflective givenness\nthat belongs to the structure of the experience (Husserl 1959, 175;\nHusserl 1973a, 28, 56, 307, 443; see Zahavi 1999, 6ff.). \nSome philosophers who are inclined to take self-consciousness to be\nintrinsically linked to the issue of self-reference would argue that\nthe latter depends on a first-person concept. One attains\nself-consciousness only when one can conceive of oneself\nas oneself, and has the linguistic ability to use the\nfirst-person pronoun to refer to oneself (Baker 2000, 68; cf. Lowe\n2000, 264). On this view, self-consciousness is something that emerges\nin the course of a developmental process, and depends on the\nacquisition of concepts and language. Accordingly, some philosophers\ndeny that young children are capable of self-consciousness (Carruthers\n1996; Dennett 1976; Wilkes 1988; also see Flavell 1993). Evidence from\ndevelopmental psychology and ecological psychology, however, suggests\nthat there is a primitive, proprioceptive form of self-consciousness\nalready in place from\n birth.[3]\n This primitive self-awareness precedes the mastery of language and\nthe ability to form conceptually informed judgments, and it may serve\nas a basis for more advanced types of self-consciousness (see, e.g.,\nButterworth 1995, 1999; Gibson 1986; Meltzoff 1990a, 1990b; Neisser\n1988; and Stern 1985). The phenomenological view is consistent with\nsuch findings. \nThe notion of pre-reflective self-awareness is much\nmore accepted today than it was 20 years ago and has become part of\nthe standard repertoire in philosophy of mind. The notion’s\nincreasing popularity not surprisingly has also led to an increasing\namount of criticism. One line of attack has focused on what might be\ncalled the universality question. Is it truly the case that all\nconscious mental states involve pre-reflective self-awareness,\nfor-me-ness, and a sense of ownership? Does the link hold by necessity\nsuch that it characterizes all experiences, however primitive or\ndisordered they might be, or might it, for instance, be something that\nonly holds true for a more limited group of experiences, say, normal,\nadult, experiences (Lane 2012; Dainton 2016; Guillot 2017; Howell\n& Thompson 2017). Whether infantile or pathological or\nhallucinogenic experiences constitute relevant exceptions, i.e.,\nexperiences that lack pre-reflective self-awareness, for-me-ness and\nsense of ownership, is to a large extent dependent upon how robustly\none interprets these notions. If pre-reflective self-awareness is\ninterpreted simply as a non-inferential awareness of the experience\none is having rather than as an awareness of some self-object, and if\nfor-me-ness and sense of ownership are interpreted not as involving an\nawareness of the possessive relation between oneself and the\nexperience, but rather as the distinct perspectival givenness or\nfirst-personal presence of experience, it is far from obvious that\nthere really are exceptions to be found (Zahavi 2014, 2018, 2019).\nSome critics have also claimed that the sense of ownership is a\nby-product of reflective or introspective processes (e.g., Bermúdez\n2011; 2018; Dainton 2007). They insist that there is nothing like a\npre-reflective sense of ownership that is “something over and above\nthe changing stream of thought, perception, volition, emotion, memory,\nbodily sensation, and so on” (Dainton 2007, 240; emphasis added).\nBut as should already be clear, phenomenologists do not claim that\npre-reflective self-awareness or the sense of ownership is something\n“over and above” experience, something extra that is added as a\nsecond experience. Rather, the claim is that it is an intrinsic\nfeature of experience itself. In this respect, the phenomenological\nclaim is as deflationary as the critics would want (Gallagher 2017a). \nAlthough, as pre-reflectively self-aware of my experience I am not\nunconscious of it, I do not attend to it; rather I tend to overlook it\nin favor of the object that I am perceiving, the thing I am\nremembering, etc. In my everyday life, I am absorbed by and\npreoccupied with projects and objects in the world, and as such I do\nnot attend to my experiential life. Therefore, this pervasive\npre-reflective self-consciousness is not to be understood as complete\nself-comprehension. One can accept the notion of a pervasive\nself-consciousness and still accept the existence of the unconscious\nin the sense of subjective components which remain ambiguous, obscure,\nand resistant to comprehension. Thus, one should distinguish between\nthe claim that consciousness is characterized by an immediate\nfirst-person character and the claim that consciousness is\ncharacterized by total self-transparency. One can easily accept the\nfirst and reject the latter (Ricoeur 1950, 354–355).  \nIn contrast to pre-reflective self-consciousness, which delivers an\nimplicit sense of self at an experiential or phenomenal level,\nreflective self-consciousness is an explicit, conceptual, and\nobjectifying awareness that takes a lower-order consciousness as its\nattentional theme. I am able at any time to attend directly to the\ncognitive experience itself, turning my experience itself into the\nobject of my consideration. \nPhenomenologists do not claim the infallible authority of reflection\nover subjective experience. There are no epistemic guarantees\nconnected with self-consciousness other than immunity to error through\nmisidentification. If I cannot be wrong about who is living through my\nexperiences, I can be wrong about all kinds of other things about my\nexperiences. A brief consideration of the phenomenology of temporality\nwill help to explain this, namely, why reflective self-consciousness\nis characterized by certain limitations. It will also help to clarify\nhow pre-reflective self-consciousness, as a mode of existence, is\npossible in the first place, as well as elucidate the phenomenological\naccount of diachronic unity, an account that does not posit something\ncalled the “self” as a separate entity over and above the\nstream of consciousness (cf. Zahavi 2014). \nAccording to Husserl’s analysis, experience of any sort\n(perception, memory, imagination, etc.) has a common temporal\nstructure such that any moment of experience contains a retentional\nreference to past moments of experience, a current openness (primal\nimpression) to what is present, and a protentional anticipation of the\nmoments of experience that are just about to happen (Husserl 1966; see\nGallagher 1998). The retentional structure of experience, that is, the\nfact that when I am experiencing something, each passing moment of\nconsciousness does not simply disappear at the next moment but is kept\nin intentional currency, constitutes a coherency that stretches over\nan experienced temporal duration. Husserl’s favorite example is\na melody. When I experience a melody, I don’t simply experience\na knife-edge presentation (primal impression) of one note, which is\nthen completely washed away and replaced with the next discrete\nknife-edge presentation of the next note. Rather, consciousness\nretains the sense of the first note as just past, as I hear the second\nnote, a hearing that is also enriched by an anticipation (protention)\nof the next note (or at least, in case I do not know the melody, a\nsense that there will be a next note, or some next auditory event).\nHusserl claims that we actually do perceive melodies—in\nopposition to an earlier view propounded by Brentano, viz., that with\nthe help of our imagination or recollection we construct or\nreconstruct such unities out of a synthesis of mental acts. That we\nactually perceive melodies (without first constructing them using\nmemory and imagination) is possible only because consciousness is so\nstructured to allow for this temporal presentation. \nImportantly, the temporal (retentional-impressional-protentional)\nstructure of consciousness not only allows for the experience of\ntemporally extended objects or intentional contents, but also entails\nthe self-manifestation of consciousness, that is, its pre-reflective\nself-awareness. The retention of past notes of the melody is\naccomplished, not by a “real” or literal re-presentation\nof the notes (as if I were hearing them a second time and\nsimultaneously with the current note), but by an intentional retaining\nof my just past experience of the melody as just past. This\nmeans that this retentional structure gives me an immediate awareness\nof my ongoing experience in the ongoing flow of experience, a\nself-awareness that is implicit in my experience of the object. At the\nsame time that I am aware of a melody, for example, I am co-aware of\nmy ongoing experience of the melody through the retentional structure\nof that very experience—and this just is the pre-reflective\nself-awareness of experience (see Zahavi 1999, 2003). \nThe temporal structure that accounts for pre-reflective self-awareness\nis also the structural feature that accounts for the limitations\nimposed on reflective self-consciousness. Reflective\nself-consciousness yields knowledge of pre-reflective subjectivity\nthat is always after the fact. Reflective self-consciousness, which\ntakes pre-reflective experience as its object, is itself (like any\nconscious experience) characterized by the same temporal structure. In\nprinciple, however, the retentional-impressional-protentional\nstructure of reflection cannot overlay the\nretentional-impressional-protentional structure of pre-reflective\nexperience in complete simultaneity. There is always a slight delay\nbetween reflection and the pre-reflective object of reflection. One\nmight say that the pre-reflective experience must first be there if I\nam to turn my reflective attention to it and make it an object of\nreflection. Husserl writes: “When I say I, I grasp\nmyself in a simple reflection. But this self-experience\n[Selbsterfahrung] is like every experience\n[Erfahrung], and in particular every perception, a mere\ndirecting myself towards something that was already there for me, that\nwas already conscious, but not thematically experienced, not\nnoticed” (Husserl 1973b, 492–493). This delay is one of\nthe reasons why there remains a difference or distance between the\nreflecting subject and the reflected object, even though the reflected\nobject is my own experience. As a reflecting subject, I never fully\ncoincide with myself. \nAs Merleau-Ponty puts it, our temporal existence is both a condition\nfor and an obstacle to our self-comprehension. Temporality contains an\ninternal fracture that permits us to return to our past experiences in\norder to investigate them reflectively, but this very fracture also\nprevents us from fully coinciding with ourselves. There will always\nremain a difference between the lived and the understood\n(Merleau-Ponty 1945, 76, 397, 399, 460). Self-consciousness provides\nus with the sense that we are always already in play. This leads some\nphenomenologists to note that we are born (or “thrown”\ninto the world) and not self-generated. We are caught up in a life\nthat is in excess of our full comprehension (Heidegger 1986). There is\nalways something about ourselves that we cannot fully capture in the\nmoment of self-conscious reflection. \nIf reflective self-consciousness is limited in this way, this should\nnot prevent us from exercising it. Indeed, reflective\nself-consciousness is a necessary condition for moral\nself-responsibility, as Husserl points out. Reflection is a\nprecondition for self-critical deliberation. If we are to subject our\ndifferent beliefs and desires to a critical, normative evaluation, it\nis not sufficient simply to have immediate first-personal access to\nthe states in question.  \nSelf-consciousness is, therefore, not epiphenomenal. Our ability to\nmake reflective judgments about our own beliefs and desires also\nallows us to modify them. \nOne might see the position of Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty as\nbeing situated between two extremes. On the one hand, we have the view\nthat reflection merely copies or mirrors pre-reflective experience\nfaithfully, and on the other hand we have the view that reflection\ndistorts lived experience. The middle course is to recognize that\nreflection involves a gain and a loss. For Husserl, Sartre, and\nMerleau-Ponty, reflection is constrained by what is pre-reflectively\nlived through. It is answerable to experiential facts and is not\nconstitutively self-fulfilling. At the same time, however, they\nrecognized that reflection qua thematic self-experience does not\nsimply reproduce the lived experiences unaltered and that this is\nprecisely what makes reflection cognitively valuable. The experiences\nreflected upon are transformed in the process, to various degrees and\nmanners depending upon the type of reflection at work. Subjectivity\nconsequently seems to be constituted in such a fashion that it can\nand, at times, must relate to itself in an “othering”\nmanner. This self-alteration is something inherent to reflection; it\nis not something that reflection can overcome. \nMuch of what we have said about self-consciousness may still seem\noverly mentalistic. It is important to note that for phenomenologists\nlike Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, pre-reflective self-awareness is both\nembodied and embedded in the world. The first-person point of view on\nthe world is never a view from nowhere; it is always defined by the\nsituation of the perceiver’s body, which concerns not simply\nlocation and posture, but action in pragmatic contexts and interaction\nwith other people. Pre-reflective self-awareness includes aspects that\nare both bodily and intersubjective. \nThe claim is not simply that the perceiver/actor is objectively\nembodied, but that the body is in some fashion experientially present\nin the perception or action. Phenomenologists distinguish the\npre-reflective body-awareness that accompanies and shapes every\nspatial experience, from a reflective consciousness of the body. To\ncapture this difference, Husserl introduced a terminological\ndistinction between Leib and Körper, that is,\nbetween the pre-reflectively lived body, i.e., the body as an embodied\nfirst-person perspective, and the subsequent thematic experience\nof the body as an object (Husserl 1973a, 57). Pre-reflective\nbody- (Leib-) awareness is not a type of object-perception,\nbut it is an essential element of every such perception. If I reach\nfor a tool, I know where to reach because I have a sense of where it\nis in relation to myself. I also sense that I will be able to reach\nit, or that I will have to take two steps towards it. My perception of\nthe tool must involve proprioceptive and kinaesthetic information\nabout my bodily situation and the position of my limbs, otherwise I\nwould not be able to reach for it or use it. If in such cases, we want\nto say that I have an awareness of my body, such bodily awareness is\nquite different from the perception that I have of the tool. I may\nhave to look or feel around in order to find where the tool is; but,\nunder normal circumstances, I never have to do that in regard to my\nbody. I am tacitly aware, not only of where my hands and feet are, but\nalso of what I can do with them. This tacit awareness of my body\nalways registers as an “I can” (or “I can’t,” as the\ncase may be). Primarily, my body is experienced, not as an object, but\nas a field of activity and affectivity, as a potentiality of mobility\nand volition, as an “I do” and “I can.”  \nThe body provides not only the egocentric spatial framework for\norientation towards the world, but also the constitutive contribution\nof its mobility. Perception does not involve a passive reception, but\nan active exploration of the environment. Husserl calls attention to\nthe importance of bodily movements (the movements of the eye,\nmanipulations by the hand, the locomotion of the body, etc.) for the\nexperience of space and spatial objects. He further claims that\nperception is correlated to and accompanied by\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic self-sensation or self-affection (Husserl\n1973c). Every visual or tactile appearance is given in correlation to\na kinaesthetic experience. When I touch a shaped surface, it is given\nin conjunction with a sensation of finger movements. When I watch the\nflight of a bird, the moving bird is given in conjunction with the\nkinaesthetic sensations of eye movement and perhaps neck movement.\nSuch kinaesthetic activation during perception produces an implicit\nand pervasive reference to one’s own body. The implicit\nself-awareness of the actual and possible movements of my body helps\nshape the experience that I have of the world. To be clear, however,\nbodily self-awareness is not an awareness of the body in isolation\nfrom the world; it is embedded in action and perception. We do not\nfirst become aware of the body and subsequently use it to engage with\nthe world. We experience the world bodily, and the body is revealed to\nus in our exploration of the world. Primarily, the body attains\nself-awareness in action (or in our dispositions to action, or in our\naction possibilities) when it relates to something, uses something, or\nmoves through the\n world.[4] \nBodily self-awareness, like self-consciousness more generally, has\nlimitations. I am never fully aware of everything that is going on\nwith my body. Indeed, my body tends to efface itself as I perceive and\nact in the world. When I jump to catch a ball that is thrown over my\nhead, I certainly have a sense of what I can do, but I am not aware of\nmy precise movements or postures—for example, that my right leg\nbends at a certain angle as I reach with my left hand. I can execute\nmovements without being explicitly conscious of them, and even what I\nam tacitly aware of is somewhat limited—for example, I am not\naware of the shape of my grasp as I reach to grab the ball. Although I\nmay not be aware of certain details about my bodily performance, this\ndoes not mean however that I am unconscious of my body. Rather it\nmeans that the way that I am aware of my body is fully integrated with\nthe intentional action that I am performing. I know that I am jumping\nto catch the ball, and implicit in that, as an immediate sense rather\nthan an inference, I experience my body jumping to catch the ball. \nFurthermore, experiential aspects of my embodiment permeate my\npre-reflective self-consciousness. There is something it is like to\njump to catch a ball, and part of what it is like is that I am in fact\njumping. There is something different about what it is like to sit and\nimagine (or remember) myself jumping to catch the ball, and at least\npart of that difference has to do with the fact that I am sitting\nrather than jumping, although none of this may be explicit in my\nexperience. \nAnother way to think of the self-awareness involved in action is to\nconsider the sense of agency that is normally an aspect of\npre-reflective self-awareness in action. If, as I am walking down the\nstreet, I am pushed from behind, I am instantly aware of my body\nmoving in a way that I did not intend. The fact that I feel a loss of\ncontrol over my actions suggests that there had been an implicit sense\nof agency or control in my walking prior to being pushed. In voluntary\naction, I experience the movements of my body as my own actions, and\nthis is replaced by a feeling of loss of bodily control in the case of\ninvoluntary movement. Voluntary actions feel different from\ninvoluntary actions, and this difference depends respectively, on the\nexperience of agency or the experience of a lack of agency—as\nthe case may be if my body is being moved by someone\n else.[5] \nHubert Dreyfus has famously argued that in the case of expert\nperformance we are not self-conscious, but rather “usually involved\nin coping in a mindless way” (Dreyfus 2007a, 356). On his account,\nour immersed bodily life is so completely and totally world-engaged\nthat it is entirely oblivious to itself. Indeed, in total absorption,\none ceases being a subject altogether (Dreyfus 2007b, 373). It is only\nwhen this bodily absorption is interrupted that something like\nself-consciousness emerges. Dreyfus consequently doesn’t deny the\nexistence of self-consciousness, but he definitely wants to see it as\na capacity that is only exercised or actualized on special occasions.\nMoreover, when this capacity is exercised it necessarily disrupts our\ncoping and radically transform the kind of affordances that are given\nto it (Dreyfus 2005, 61; 2007, 354). A number of theorists, however,\nhave taken issue with this characterization of expert performance and\nhave argued that in the performing arts (e.g., in dance, musical\nperformance) and in athletics (e.g., baseball, cricket) expert\nperformers may employ an enhanced but still pre-reflective awareness\n(Legrand 2007), a heedful consciousness of the situation (e.g., Sutton\net al. 2011), or even a skillful reflective monitoring (Montero 2010;\n2014), or some variable combination of these (Høffding 2018), and\nthat such consciousness does not impede performance but improves it.\n \nA focus on embodied self-experience inevitably leads to a decisive\nwidening of the discussion. The externality of embodiment puts me, and\nmy actions, in the public sphere. Self-consciousness, which involves\nan ability to make reflective judgments about our own beliefs and\ndesires, is always shaped by others and what we have learned from\nothers. This intersubjective or social influence can also affect\npre-reflective self-awareness, including my sense of embodied\nagency. \nI can become aware of myself through the eyes of other people, and\nthis can happen in a number of different ways. Thus, embodiment brings\nintersubjectivity and sociality into the picture, and draws attention\nto the question of how certain forms of self-consciousness are\nintersubjectively mediated, and may depend on one’s social\nrelations to others. My awareness of myself as one person among\nothers, an awareness that I may frame from the perspective of others,\nattempting to see myself as they see me, involves a change in the\nattitude of self-consciousness. Within this attitude, judgments that I\nmake about myself are constrained by social expectations and cultural\nvalues. This kind of social self-consciousness is always\ncontextualized, as I try to understand how I appear to others, both in\nthe way I look, and in the meaning of my actions. I find myself in\nparticular contexts, with specific capabilities and dispositions,\nhabits and convictions, and I express myself in a way that is\nreflected off of others, in relevant (socially defined) roles through\nmy language and my actions. \nThe role of the other in this mode of self-consciousness is not\nunessential. According to Husserl, I become aware of myself\nspecifically as a human person only in such intersubjective relations\n(Husserl 1973b, 175; 1952, 204–05; see Hart 1992, 71; Zahavi\n1999, 157ff. Also see Taylor 1989, 34–36 for a similar idea).\nThus Husserl distinguishes the subject taken in its bare formality\nfrom the personalized subject and claims that the origin and status of\nbeing a person must be located in the social dimension. I am a person,\nsocially contextualized, with abilities, dispositions, habits,\ninterests, character traits, and convictions, all of which have been\ndeveloped through my interactions with others. When considering the\nfullness of human selfhood, the idea of an isolated, pure and formal\nsubject of experience is an abstraction (Husserl 1968, 210). Given the\nright conditions and circumstances, the self acquires a personalizing\nself-apprehension, i.e., it develops into a person and as a person\n(cf. Husserl 1952, 265). And this development depends heavily upon\nsocial interaction (Husserl 1973b, 170–171).  \nThis kind of self-consciousness also opens up the possibility of\nself-alienation, famously explicated by Sartre in terms of the\nother’s gaze. For Sartre, because “our being, along with\nits being-for-itself, is also for-others; the being which is revealed\nto the reflective consciousness is for-itself-for-others” (1956,\n282). On this view, the primary experience of the other is not that I\nperceive her as some kind of object in which I must find a person, but\nI perceive the other as a subject who perceives me as an object. My\nexperience of the other is at the same time an experience that\ninvolves my own self-consciousness, a self-consciousness in which I am\npre-reflectively aware that I am an object for another. This\nexperience can further motivate a reflective self-consciousness, as I\nconsider how I must appear to the other. \nMerleau-Ponty (1945, 415) suggests that the other’s gaze can\nmotivate this kind of self-consciousness only if I already have a\nsense of my own visibility to the other. This sense of my own\nvisibility, however, is immediately linked with the pre-reflective,\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic sense of my body, an insight that goes\nback to Husserl’s analysis (mentioned above). Merleau-Ponty\nnotes its connection to the infant’s capability for imitation,\nand this is carried forward to more recent advances in developmental\npsychology (see Merleau-Ponty, 1945, 165, 404–405; 2010; Gallagher and\nZahavi 2012; Zahavi 1999, 171–72). Indeed, although much emphasis has\nfallen on vision and the gaze of the other in phenomenological\naccounts of self-consciousness, proprioceptive and tactile experiences\nhave a developmental primacy and emerge in the pre-natal environment\nin ways that allow for very basic relational experiences of\nself-movement versus movement of the mother’s body (Lymer 2010;\n2014; Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; Ciaunica & Fotopoulou\n2016), and continue to play a significant role in embodied\ninteractions with caregivers during early infancy. In this respect,\nintersubjective/intercorporeal experiences can affect pre-reflective\nbody self-awareness. This complicates any claim that the\npre-reflective experience of body ownership is primarily for\nself-preservation (Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; de Vignemont\n2018). \nThis is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of these\nrich and complex issues, issues that extend to analyses of phenomena\nsuch as empathy, shame, guilt, and so on (see Zahavi 2010, 2014). But\nit is important to realize that self-consciousness is a multifaceted\nconcept. It is not something that can be exhaustively analyzed simply\nby examining the inner workings of the mind.  \nThe notion of self-consciousness has been the subject of a rich and\ncomplex analysis in the phenomenological tradition. Aspects of the\nphenomenological analysis also show up in other areas of research,\nincluding feminism (Stawarska 2006; Young 2005; Heinämaa 2003),\necological psychology (Gibson 1966), and recent analyses of enactive\nperception (Gallagher 2017b; Noë 2004; Thompson 2008). The\nrecognition of the existence of a primitive form of pre-reflective\nself-consciousness is an important starting point for an understanding\nof more elaborate forms of self-consciousness that are concept- and\nlanguage-dependent. Phenomenological analyses show these processes to\nbe more than purely mental or cognitive events since they integrally\ninvolve embodiment and intersubjective dimensions.

In the most basic sense of the term,\nself-consciousness is not something that comes about the moment one\nattentively inspects or reflectively introspects one’s\nexperiences, or recognizes one’s specular image in the mirror,\nor refers to oneself with the use of the first-person pronoun, or\nconstructs a self-narrative. Rather, these different kinds of\nself-consciousness are to be distinguished from the pre-reflective\nself-consciousness which is present whenever I am living through or\nundergoing an experience, e.g., whenever I am consciously perceiving\nthe world, remembering a past event, imagining a future event,\nthinking an occurrent thought, or feeling sad or happy, thirsty or in\npain, and so forth.\n\nOne can get a bearing on the notion of pre-reflective\nself-consciousness by contrasting it with reflective\nself-consciousness. If you ask me to give you a description of the\npain I feel in my right foot, or of what I was just thinking about, I\nwould reflect on it and thereby take up a certain perspective that was\none order removed from the pain or the thought. Thus, reflective\nself-consciousness is at least a second-order cognition. It may be the\nbasis for a report on one’s experience, although not all reports\ninvolve a significant amount of reflection. \nIn contrast, pre-reflective self-consciousness is pre-reflective in\nthe sense that (1) it is an awareness we have before we do any\nreflecting on our experience; (2) it is an implicit and first-order\nawareness rather than an explicit or higher-order form of\nself-consciousness. Indeed, an explicit reflective self-consciousness\nis possible only because there is a pre-reflective self-awareness that\nis an on-going and more primary kind of self-consciousness. Although\nphenomenologists do not always agree on important questions about\nmethod, focus, or even whether there is an ego or self, they are in\nclose to unanimous agreement about the idea that the experiential\ndimension always involves such an implicit pre-reflective\n self-awareness.[1]\n In line with Edmund Husserl (1959, 189, 412), who maintains that\nconsciousness always involves a self-appearance\n(Für-sich-selbst-erscheinens), and in agreement with\nMichel Henry (1963, 1965), who notes that experience is always\nself-manifesting, and with Maurice Merleau-Ponty who states that\nconsciousness is always given to itself and that the word\n‘consciousness’ has no meaning independently of this\nself-givenness (Merleau-Ponty 1945, 488), Jean-Paul Sartre writes that\npre-reflective self-consciousness is not simply a quality added to the\nexperience, an accessory; rather, it constitutes the very mode of\nbeing of the experience: \nIn short, unless a mental process is pre-reflectively self-conscious\nthere will be nothing it is like to undergo the process, and it\ntherefore cannot be a phenomenally conscious process (Zahavi 1999,\n2005, 2014). An implication of this is obviously that the\nself-consciousness in question is so fundamental and basic that it can\nbe ascribed to all creatures that are phenomenally conscious,\nincluding various non-human animals. \nThe notion of pre-reflective self-awareness is related to the idea\nthat experiences have a subjective ‘feel’ to them, a\ncertain (phenomenal) quality of ‘what it is like’ or what\nit ‘feels’ like to have them. As it is usually expressed\noutside of phenomenological texts, to undergo a conscious experience\nnecessarily means that there is something it is like for the subject\nto have that experience (Nagel 1974; Searle 1992). This is obviously\ntrue of bodily sensations like pain. But it is also the case for\nperceptual experiences, experiences of desiring, feeling, and\nthinking. There is something it is like to taste chocolate, and this\nis different from what it is like to remember or imagine what it is\nlike to taste chocolate, or to smell vanilla, to run, to stand still,\nto feel envious, nervous, depressed or happy, or to entertain an\nabstract belief. \nAll of these different experiences are, however, also characterized by\ntheir distinct first-personal character. The what-it-is-likeness of\nphenomenal episodes is properly speaking a\nwhat-it-is-like-for-me-ness. This for-me-ness doesn’t refer\nto a specific experiential quality like sour or soft, rather it refers\nto the distinct first-personal givenness of experience. It refers to\nthe fact that the experiences I am living through are given\ndifferently (but not necessarily better) to me than to anybody else. I\nmay see that you are sad, but my seeing your sadness is qualitatively\ndifferent from my living through my sadness. It could consequently be\nclaimed that anybody who denies the for-me-ness of experience simply\nfails to recognize an essential constitutive aspect of experience.\nSuch a denial would be tantamount to a denial of the first-person\nperspective. It would entail the view that my own mind is either not\ngiven to me at all—I would be mind- or self-blind—or is presented\nto me in exactly the same way as the minds of others. \nOne sometimes distinguishes two uses of the term\n‘conscious’, a transitive and an intransitive use. On the\none hand, we can speak of our being conscious of something, be\nit x, y, or z. On the other, we can speak of our\nbeing conscious simpliciter (rather than non-conscious). For\nsome time a widespread way to account for intransitive consciousness\nin cognitive science and analytic philosophy of mind has been by means\nof some kind of higher-order theory. The distinction between conscious\nand non-conscious mental states has been taken to rest upon the\npresence or absence of a relevant meta-mental state (e.g., Armstrong\n1968; Carruthers 1996, 2000; Lycan 1987, 1996; Rosenthal 1997). Thus,\nintransitive consciousness has been taken to depend upon the mind\ndirecting its intentional aim at its own states and operations. As\nCarruthers puts it, the subjective feel of experience presupposes a\ncapacity for higher-order awareness: “such self-awareness is a\nconceptually necessary condition for an organism to be a subject of\nphenomenal feelings, or for there to be anything that its experiences\nare like” (1996, 152). But for Carruthers, the self-awareness in\nquestion is a type of reflection. In his view, a creature must be\ncapable of reflecting upon, thinking about, and hence conceptualizing\nits own mental states if those mental states are to be states of which\nthe creature is aware (1996, 155, 157). \nOne might share the view that there is a close link between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness and still disagree about the\nnature of the link. And although the phenomenological view might\nsuperficially resemble the view of the higher-order theories, we are\nultimately confronted with two quite different accounts. The\nphenomenologists explicitly deny that the self-consciousness that is\npresent the moment I consciously experience something is to be\nunderstood in terms of some kind of higher-order monitoring. It does\nnot involve an additional mental state, but is rather to be understood\nas an intrinsic feature of the primary experience. That is, in\ncontrast to higher-order accounts of consciousness that claim that\nconsciousness is an extrinsic or relational property of those mental\nstates that have it, a property bestowed upon them from without by\nsome further state, the phenomenologists would typically argue that\nthe feature in virtue of which a mental state is conscious is an\nintrinsic property of those mental states that have it. Moreover, the\nphenomenologists also reject the attempt to construe intransitive\nconsciousness in terms of transitive consciousness, that is, they\nreject the view that a conscious state is a state we are conscious of\nas object. To put it differently, not only do they reject the view\nthat a mental state becomes conscious by being taken as an object by a\nhigher-order state, they also reject the view (generally associated\nwith Brentano) according to which a mental state becomes conscious by\ntaking itself as an object (cf. Zahavi 2004; 2014). \nWhat arguments support the phenomenological claims, however?\nPhenomenologists don’t simply appeal to a correct phenomenological\ndescription but provide additional, more theoretical, arguments. One\nline of reasoning found in virtually all of the phenomenologists is\nthe view that the attempt to let (intransitive) consciousness be a\nresult of a higher-order monitoring will generate an infinite regress.\nOn the face of it, this is a rather old idea. Typically, the regress\nargument has been understood in the following manner. If all occurrent\nmental states are conscious in the sense of being taken as objects by\noccurrent second-order mental states, then these second-order mental\nstates must themselves be taken as objects by occurrent third-order\nmental states, and so forth ad infinitum. The standard\nresponse to this objection is that the regress can easily be avoided\nby accepting the existence of non-conscious mental states. This is\nprecisely the position adopted by the defenders of higher-order\ntheory. For them a second-order perception or thought does not have to\nbe conscious. It would be conscious only if accompanied by a\n(non-conscious) third-order thought or perception (Rosenthal 1997,\n745). The phenomenological reply to this solution is rather\nstraightforward, however. The phenomenologists would concede that it\nis possible to halt the regress by postulating the existence of\nnon-conscious mental states, but they would maintain that such an\nappeal to the non-conscious leaves us with a case of explanatory\nvacuity. That is, they would find it quite unclear why the relation\nbetween two otherwise non-conscious processes should make one of them\nconscious. Or to put it differently, they would be quite unconvinced\nby the claim that a state without subjective or phenomenal qualities\ncan be transformed into one with such qualities, i.e., into an\nexperience with first-personal character, by the mere addition of a\nnon-conscious meta-state having the first-state as its intentional\nobject. \nThe phenomenological alternative avoids the regress. As Sartre writes:\n“[T]here is no infinite regress here, since a consciousness has no\nneed at all of a reflecting [higher-order] consciousness in order to\nbe conscious of itself. It simply does not posit itself as an\nobject” (1936, 29 [1957, 45]). That is, pre-reflective\nself-consciousness is not transitive in relation to the state (of)\nwhich it is aware. It is, as Sartre puts it, the mode of existence of\nconsciousness itself. This does not mean that a higher-order\nmeta-consciousness is impossible, but merely that it always\npresupposes the existence of a prior non-objectifying, pre-reflective\nself-consciousness as its condition of possibility. To quote Sartre\nagain, “it is the non-reflective consciousness which renders the\nreflection [and any higher-order representation of it] possible”\n(1943, 20 [1956, liii]).  \nThere are also lines of argumentation in contemporary analytical\nphilosophy of mind that are close to and consistent with the\nphenomenological conception of pre-reflective self-awareness. Alvin\nGoldman provides an example: \nA similar view has been defended by Owen Flanagan, who not only argues\nthat consciousness involves self-consciousness in the weak sense that\nthere is something it is like for the subject to have the experience,\nbut also speaks of the low-level self-consciousness involved in\nexperiencing my experiences as mine (Flanagan 1992, 194). As Flanagan\nquite correctly points out, this primary type of self-consciousness\nshould not be confused with the much stronger notion of\nself-consciousness that is in play when we are thinking about our own\nnarrative self. The latter form of reflective self-consciousness\npresupposes both conceptual knowledge and narrative competence. It\nrequires maturation and socialization, and the ability to access and\nissue reports about the states, traits, dispositions that make one the\nperson one is. Other philosophers who have defended comparable views,\ninclude José Luis Bermúdez (1998), who has argued that that\nthere are a variety of nonconceptual forms of self-consciousness that\nare “logically and ontogenetically more primitive than the higher\nforms of self-consciousness that are usually the focus of\nphilosophical debate” (1998, 274; also see Poellner 2003), and Uriah\nKriegel (2009) who has defended the existence of a type of\nself-consciousness that is intrinsic to and inherent in phenomenal\nconsciousness. Across a variety of philosophical studies, then, one\nfinds support for the phenomenological conception of pre-reflective\nself-awareness. \nThat pre-reflective self-awareness is implicit, then, means that I am\nnot confronted with a thematic or explicit awareness of the experience\nas belonging to myself. Rather we are dealing with a non-observational\nself-acquaintance. Here is how Heidegger and Sartre put the point: \nIn other words, every positional consciousness of an object is at the\nsame time a non-positional consciousness of itself. If I count the\ncigarettes which are in that case, I have the impression of disclosing\nan objective property of this collection of cigarettes: they are a\ndozen. This property appears to my consciousness as a property\nexisting in the world. It is very possible that I have no positional\nconsciousness of counting them. Then I do not know myself as counting.\nYet at the moment when these cigarettes are revealed to me as a dozen,\nI have a non-thetic consciousness of my adding activity. If anyone\nquestioned me, indeed, if anyone should ask, “What are you doing\nthere?” I should reply at once, “I am counting.”\n(Sartre 1943, 19–20 [1956, liii]). \nIt might be clarifying to compare the phenomenological notion of\npre-reflective self-consciousness with the one defended by Brentano.\nAccording to Brentano as I listen to a melody I am aware that I am\nlistening to the melody. He acknowledges that I do not have two\ndifferent mental states: my consciousness of the melody is one and the\nsame as my awareness of perceiving it; they constitute one single\npsychical phenomenon. On this point, and in opposition to higher-order\nrepresentation theories, Brentano and the phenomenologists are in\ngeneral agreement. But for Brentano, by means of this unified mental\nstate, I have an awareness of two objects: the melody and my\nperceptual experience.  \nHusserl disagrees on just this point, as do Sartre and Heidegger: my\nawareness of my experience is not an awareness of it as an\n object.[2]\n My awareness is non-objectifying in the sense that I do not occupy\nthe position or perspective of a spectator or in(tro)spector who\nattends to this experience in a thematic way. That a psychological\nstate is experienced, “and is in this sense conscious, does not\nand cannot mean that this is the object of an act of consciousness, in\nthe sense that a perception, a presentation or a judgment is directed\nupon it” (Husserl 1984a, 165 [2001, I, 273]). In pre-reflective\nself-awareness, experience is given, not as an object, but precisely\nas subjective experience. For phenomenologists, intentional experience\nis lived through (erlebt), but does not appear in an\nobjectified manner. Experience is conscious of itself without being\nthe intentional object of consciousness (Husserl 1984b, 399; Sartre\n1936, 28–29). That we are aware of our lived experiences even if\nwe do not direct our attention towards them is not to deny that we can\ndirect our attention towards our experiences, and thereby take them as\nobjects of reflection (Husserl 1984b, 424). \nTo be self-aware is not to capture a pure self or self-object that\nexists separately from the stream of experience, rather it is to be\nconscious of one’s experience in its intrinsic first-person mode\nof givenness. When Hume, in a famous passage in A Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739), declares that he cannot find a self when he\nsearches his experiences, but finds only particular perceptions or\nfeelings, it could be argued that he overlooks something in his\nanalysis, namely the specific givenness of his own experiences.\nIndeed, he was looking only among his own experiences, and\nseemingly recognized them as his own, and could do so only on the\nbasis of that immediate self-awareness that he seemed to miss. As C.O.\nEvans puts it: “[F]rom the fact that the self is not an object\nof experience it does not follow that it is non-experiential”\n(Evans 1970, 145). Accordingly, we should not think of the self, in\nthis most basic sense, as a substance, or as some kind of ineffable\ntranscendental precondition, or as a social construct that gets\ngenerated through time; rather it is an integral aspect of conscious\nlife, and involves this immediate experiential character. \nOne advantage of the phenomenological view is that it is capable of\naccounting for some degree of diachronic unity, without actually\nhaving to posit the self as a separate entity over and above the\nstream of consciousness (see the discussion of time-consciousness in\nSection 3 below). Although we live through a number of different\nexperiences, the experiencing itself remains a constant in regard to\nwhose experience it is. This is not accounted for by a substantial\nself or a mental theater. On this point Hume was right. There is no\npure or empty field of consciousness upon which the concrete\nexperiences subsequently make their entry. The field of experiencing\nis nothing apart from the specific experiences. Yet we are naturally\ninclined to distinguish the strict singularity of an experience from\nthe continuous stream of changing experiences. What remains constant\nand consistent across these changes is the sense of for-me-ness (or\nperspectival ownership) constituted by pre-reflective self-awareness.\nOnly a being with this sense of ownership could go on to form concepts\nabout herself, consider her own aims, ideals, and aspirations as her\nown, construct stories about herself, and plan and execute actions for\nwhich she will take responsibility.  \nThe concept of pre-reflective self-awareness is related to a variety\nof philosophical issues, including epistemic asymmetry, immunity to\nerror through misidentification and self-reference. We will examine\nthese issues each in turn. \nIt seems clear that the objects of my visual perception are\nintersubjectively accessible in the sense that they can in principle\nbe the objects of another’s perception. A subject’s\nperceptual experience itself, however, is given in a unique way to the\nsubject herself. Although two people, A and B, can\nperceive a numerically identical object, they each have their own\ndistinct perceptual experience of it; just as they cannot share each\nother’s pain, they cannot literally share these perceptual\nexperiences. Their experiences are epistemically asymmetrical in this\nregard. B might realize that A is in pain; he might\nsympathize with A, he might even have the same kind of pain\n(same qualitative aspects, same intensity, same proprioceptive\nlocation), but he cannot literally feel A’s pain the\nsame way A does. The subject’s epistemic access to her\nown experience, whether it is a pain or a perceptual experience, is\nprimarily a matter of pre-reflective self-awareness. If secondarily,\nin an act of introspective reflection I begin to examine my perceptual\nexperience, I will recognize it as my perceptual experience only\nbecause I have been pre-reflectively aware of it, as I have been\nliving through it. Thus, phenomenology maintains, the access that\nreflective self-consciousness has to first-order phenomenal experience\nis routed through pre-reflective consciousness, for if we were not\npre-reflectively aware of our experience, our reflection on it would\nnever be motivated. When I do reflect, I reflect on something with\nwhich I am already experientially familiar. \nThe ease with which we self-ascribe experiences is partially to be\nexplained by appeal to pre-reflective self-awareness. It is important\nto emphasize, however, that pre-reflective self-awareness is only a\nnecessary and not a sufficient condition for reflective\nself-ascription and first-person knowledge. Many animals who possess\npre-reflective self-consciousness obviously lack the cognitive\nresources needed for reflective self-ascriptions.  \nWhen I experience an occurrent pain, perception, or thought, the\nexperience in question is given immediately and noninferentially. I do\nnot have to judge or appeal to some criteria in order to identify it\nas my experience. There are no free-floating experiences;\neven the experience of freely-floating belongs to someone. As William\nJames (1890) put it, all experience is “personal.” Even in\npathological cases, as in depersonalization or schizophrenic symptoms\nof delusions of control or thought insertion, a feeling or experience\nthat the subject claims not to be his is nonetheless experienced by\nhim as being part of his stream of consciousness. The complaint of\nthought insertion, for example, necessarily acknowledges that the\ninserted thoughts are thoughts that belong to the subject’s\nexperience, even as the agency for such thoughts are attributed to\nothers. This first-person character entails an implicit experiential\nself-reference. If I feel hungry or see my friend, I cannot be\nmistaken about who the subject of that experience is, even if I can be\nmistaken about it being hunger (perhaps it’s really thirst), or\nabout it being my friend (perhaps it’s his twin), or even about\nwhether I am actually seeing him (I may be hallucinating). As\nWittgenstein (1958), Shoemaker (1968), and others have pointed out, it\nis nonsensical to ask whether I am sure that I am the one who\nfeels hungry. This is the phenomenon known as “immunity to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun.”\nTo this idea of immunity to error through misidentification, the\nphenomenologist adds that whether a certain experience is experienced\nas mine, or not, does not depend upon something apart from the\nexperience, but depends precisely upon the pre-reflective givenness\nthat belongs to the structure of the experience (Husserl 1959, 175;\nHusserl 1973a, 28, 56, 307, 443; see Zahavi 1999, 6ff.). \nSome philosophers who are inclined to take self-consciousness to be\nintrinsically linked to the issue of self-reference would argue that\nthe latter depends on a first-person concept. One attains\nself-consciousness only when one can conceive of oneself\nas oneself, and has the linguistic ability to use the\nfirst-person pronoun to refer to oneself (Baker 2000, 68; cf. Lowe\n2000, 264). On this view, self-consciousness is something that emerges\nin the course of a developmental process, and depends on the\nacquisition of concepts and language. Accordingly, some philosophers\ndeny that young children are capable of self-consciousness (Carruthers\n1996; Dennett 1976; Wilkes 1988; also see Flavell 1993). Evidence from\ndevelopmental psychology and ecological psychology, however, suggests\nthat there is a primitive, proprioceptive form of self-consciousness\nalready in place from\n birth.[3]\n This primitive self-awareness precedes the mastery of language and\nthe ability to form conceptually informed judgments, and it may serve\nas a basis for more advanced types of self-consciousness (see, e.g.,\nButterworth 1995, 1999; Gibson 1986; Meltzoff 1990a, 1990b; Neisser\n1988; and Stern 1985). The phenomenological view is consistent with\nsuch findings. \nThe notion of pre-reflective self-awareness is much\nmore accepted today than it was 20 years ago and has become part of\nthe standard repertoire in philosophy of mind. The notion’s\nincreasing popularity not surprisingly has also led to an increasing\namount of criticism. One line of attack has focused on what might be\ncalled the universality question. Is it truly the case that all\nconscious mental states involve pre-reflective self-awareness,\nfor-me-ness, and a sense of ownership? Does the link hold by necessity\nsuch that it characterizes all experiences, however primitive or\ndisordered they might be, or might it, for instance, be something that\nonly holds true for a more limited group of experiences, say, normal,\nadult, experiences (Lane 2012; Dainton 2016; Guillot 2017; Howell\n& Thompson 2017). Whether infantile or pathological or\nhallucinogenic experiences constitute relevant exceptions, i.e.,\nexperiences that lack pre-reflective self-awareness, for-me-ness and\nsense of ownership, is to a large extent dependent upon how robustly\none interprets these notions. If pre-reflective self-awareness is\ninterpreted simply as a non-inferential awareness of the experience\none is having rather than as an awareness of some self-object, and if\nfor-me-ness and sense of ownership are interpreted not as involving an\nawareness of the possessive relation between oneself and the\nexperience, but rather as the distinct perspectival givenness or\nfirst-personal presence of experience, it is far from obvious that\nthere really are exceptions to be found (Zahavi 2014, 2018, 2019).\nSome critics have also claimed that the sense of ownership is a\nby-product of reflective or introspective processes (e.g., Bermúdez\n2011; 2018; Dainton 2007). They insist that there is nothing like a\npre-reflective sense of ownership that is “something over and above\nthe changing stream of thought, perception, volition, emotion, memory,\nbodily sensation, and so on” (Dainton 2007, 240; emphasis added).\nBut as should already be clear, phenomenologists do not claim that\npre-reflective self-awareness or the sense of ownership is something\n“over and above” experience, something extra that is added as a\nsecond experience. Rather, the claim is that it is an intrinsic\nfeature of experience itself. In this respect, the phenomenological\nclaim is as deflationary as the critics would want (Gallagher 2017a). \nAlthough, as pre-reflectively self-aware of my experience I am not\nunconscious of it, I do not attend to it; rather I tend to overlook it\nin favor of the object that I am perceiving, the thing I am\nremembering, etc. In my everyday life, I am absorbed by and\npreoccupied with projects and objects in the world, and as such I do\nnot attend to my experiential life. Therefore, this pervasive\npre-reflective self-consciousness is not to be understood as complete\nself-comprehension. One can accept the notion of a pervasive\nself-consciousness and still accept the existence of the unconscious\nin the sense of subjective components which remain ambiguous, obscure,\nand resistant to comprehension. Thus, one should distinguish between\nthe claim that consciousness is characterized by an immediate\nfirst-person character and the claim that consciousness is\ncharacterized by total self-transparency. One can easily accept the\nfirst and reject the latter (Ricoeur 1950, 354–355).  \nIn contrast to pre-reflective self-consciousness, which delivers an\nimplicit sense of self at an experiential or phenomenal level,\nreflective self-consciousness is an explicit, conceptual, and\nobjectifying awareness that takes a lower-order consciousness as its\nattentional theme. I am able at any time to attend directly to the\ncognitive experience itself, turning my experience itself into the\nobject of my consideration. \nPhenomenologists do not claim the infallible authority of reflection\nover subjective experience. There are no epistemic guarantees\nconnected with self-consciousness other than immunity to error through\nmisidentification. If I cannot be wrong about who is living through my\nexperiences, I can be wrong about all kinds of other things about my\nexperiences. A brief consideration of the phenomenology of temporality\nwill help to explain this, namely, why reflective self-consciousness\nis characterized by certain limitations. It will also help to clarify\nhow pre-reflective self-consciousness, as a mode of existence, is\npossible in the first place, as well as elucidate the phenomenological\naccount of diachronic unity, an account that does not posit something\ncalled the “self” as a separate entity over and above the\nstream of consciousness (cf. Zahavi 2014). \nAccording to Husserl’s analysis, experience of any sort\n(perception, memory, imagination, etc.) has a common temporal\nstructure such that any moment of experience contains a retentional\nreference to past moments of experience, a current openness (primal\nimpression) to what is present, and a protentional anticipation of the\nmoments of experience that are just about to happen (Husserl 1966; see\nGallagher 1998). The retentional structure of experience, that is, the\nfact that when I am experiencing something, each passing moment of\nconsciousness does not simply disappear at the next moment but is kept\nin intentional currency, constitutes a coherency that stretches over\nan experienced temporal duration. Husserl’s favorite example is\na melody. When I experience a melody, I don’t simply experience\na knife-edge presentation (primal impression) of one note, which is\nthen completely washed away and replaced with the next discrete\nknife-edge presentation of the next note. Rather, consciousness\nretains the sense of the first note as just past, as I hear the second\nnote, a hearing that is also enriched by an anticipation (protention)\nof the next note (or at least, in case I do not know the melody, a\nsense that there will be a next note, or some next auditory event).\nHusserl claims that we actually do perceive melodies—in\nopposition to an earlier view propounded by Brentano, viz., that with\nthe help of our imagination or recollection we construct or\nreconstruct such unities out of a synthesis of mental acts. That we\nactually perceive melodies (without first constructing them using\nmemory and imagination) is possible only because consciousness is so\nstructured to allow for this temporal presentation. \nImportantly, the temporal (retentional-impressional-protentional)\nstructure of consciousness not only allows for the experience of\ntemporally extended objects or intentional contents, but also entails\nthe self-manifestation of consciousness, that is, its pre-reflective\nself-awareness. The retention of past notes of the melody is\naccomplished, not by a “real” or literal re-presentation\nof the notes (as if I were hearing them a second time and\nsimultaneously with the current note), but by an intentional retaining\nof my just past experience of the melody as just past. This\nmeans that this retentional structure gives me an immediate awareness\nof my ongoing experience in the ongoing flow of experience, a\nself-awareness that is implicit in my experience of the object. At the\nsame time that I am aware of a melody, for example, I am co-aware of\nmy ongoing experience of the melody through the retentional structure\nof that very experience—and this just is the pre-reflective\nself-awareness of experience (see Zahavi 1999, 2003). \nThe temporal structure that accounts for pre-reflective self-awareness\nis also the structural feature that accounts for the limitations\nimposed on reflective self-consciousness. Reflective\nself-consciousness yields knowledge of pre-reflective subjectivity\nthat is always after the fact. Reflective self-consciousness, which\ntakes pre-reflective experience as its object, is itself (like any\nconscious experience) characterized by the same temporal structure. In\nprinciple, however, the retentional-impressional-protentional\nstructure of reflection cannot overlay the\nretentional-impressional-protentional structure of pre-reflective\nexperience in complete simultaneity. There is always a slight delay\nbetween reflection and the pre-reflective object of reflection. One\nmight say that the pre-reflective experience must first be there if I\nam to turn my reflective attention to it and make it an object of\nreflection. Husserl writes: “When I say I, I grasp\nmyself in a simple reflection. But this self-experience\n[Selbsterfahrung] is like every experience\n[Erfahrung], and in particular every perception, a mere\ndirecting myself towards something that was already there for me, that\nwas already conscious, but not thematically experienced, not\nnoticed” (Husserl 1973b, 492–493). This delay is one of\nthe reasons why there remains a difference or distance between the\nreflecting subject and the reflected object, even though the reflected\nobject is my own experience. As a reflecting subject, I never fully\ncoincide with myself. \nAs Merleau-Ponty puts it, our temporal existence is both a condition\nfor and an obstacle to our self-comprehension. Temporality contains an\ninternal fracture that permits us to return to our past experiences in\norder to investigate them reflectively, but this very fracture also\nprevents us from fully coinciding with ourselves. There will always\nremain a difference between the lived and the understood\n(Merleau-Ponty 1945, 76, 397, 399, 460). Self-consciousness provides\nus with the sense that we are always already in play. This leads some\nphenomenologists to note that we are born (or “thrown”\ninto the world) and not self-generated. We are caught up in a life\nthat is in excess of our full comprehension (Heidegger 1986). There is\nalways something about ourselves that we cannot fully capture in the\nmoment of self-conscious reflection. \nIf reflective self-consciousness is limited in this way, this should\nnot prevent us from exercising it. Indeed, reflective\nself-consciousness is a necessary condition for moral\nself-responsibility, as Husserl points out. Reflection is a\nprecondition for self-critical deliberation. If we are to subject our\ndifferent beliefs and desires to a critical, normative evaluation, it\nis not sufficient simply to have immediate first-personal access to\nthe states in question.  \nSelf-consciousness is, therefore, not epiphenomenal. Our ability to\nmake reflective judgments about our own beliefs and desires also\nallows us to modify them. \nOne might see the position of Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty as\nbeing situated between two extremes. On the one hand, we have the view\nthat reflection merely copies or mirrors pre-reflective experience\nfaithfully, and on the other hand we have the view that reflection\ndistorts lived experience. The middle course is to recognize that\nreflection involves a gain and a loss. For Husserl, Sartre, and\nMerleau-Ponty, reflection is constrained by what is pre-reflectively\nlived through. It is answerable to experiential facts and is not\nconstitutively self-fulfilling. At the same time, however, they\nrecognized that reflection qua thematic self-experience does not\nsimply reproduce the lived experiences unaltered and that this is\nprecisely what makes reflection cognitively valuable. The experiences\nreflected upon are transformed in the process, to various degrees and\nmanners depending upon the type of reflection at work. Subjectivity\nconsequently seems to be constituted in such a fashion that it can\nand, at times, must relate to itself in an “othering”\nmanner. This self-alteration is something inherent to reflection; it\nis not something that reflection can overcome. \nMuch of what we have said about self-consciousness may still seem\noverly mentalistic. It is important to note that for phenomenologists\nlike Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, pre-reflective self-awareness is both\nembodied and embedded in the world. The first-person point of view on\nthe world is never a view from nowhere; it is always defined by the\nsituation of the perceiver’s body, which concerns not simply\nlocation and posture, but action in pragmatic contexts and interaction\nwith other people. Pre-reflective self-awareness includes aspects that\nare both bodily and intersubjective. \nThe claim is not simply that the perceiver/actor is objectively\nembodied, but that the body is in some fashion experientially present\nin the perception or action. Phenomenologists distinguish the\npre-reflective body-awareness that accompanies and shapes every\nspatial experience, from a reflective consciousness of the body. To\ncapture this difference, Husserl introduced a terminological\ndistinction between Leib and Körper, that is,\nbetween the pre-reflectively lived body, i.e., the body as an embodied\nfirst-person perspective, and the subsequent thematic experience\nof the body as an object (Husserl 1973a, 57). Pre-reflective\nbody- (Leib-) awareness is not a type of object-perception,\nbut it is an essential element of every such perception. If I reach\nfor a tool, I know where to reach because I have a sense of where it\nis in relation to myself. I also sense that I will be able to reach\nit, or that I will have to take two steps towards it. My perception of\nthe tool must involve proprioceptive and kinaesthetic information\nabout my bodily situation and the position of my limbs, otherwise I\nwould not be able to reach for it or use it. If in such cases, we want\nto say that I have an awareness of my body, such bodily awareness is\nquite different from the perception that I have of the tool. I may\nhave to look or feel around in order to find where the tool is; but,\nunder normal circumstances, I never have to do that in regard to my\nbody. I am tacitly aware, not only of where my hands and feet are, but\nalso of what I can do with them. This tacit awareness of my body\nalways registers as an “I can” (or “I can’t,” as the\ncase may be). Primarily, my body is experienced, not as an object, but\nas a field of activity and affectivity, as a potentiality of mobility\nand volition, as an “I do” and “I can.”  \nThe body provides not only the egocentric spatial framework for\norientation towards the world, but also the constitutive contribution\nof its mobility. Perception does not involve a passive reception, but\nan active exploration of the environment. Husserl calls attention to\nthe importance of bodily movements (the movements of the eye,\nmanipulations by the hand, the locomotion of the body, etc.) for the\nexperience of space and spatial objects. He further claims that\nperception is correlated to and accompanied by\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic self-sensation or self-affection (Husserl\n1973c). Every visual or tactile appearance is given in correlation to\na kinaesthetic experience. When I touch a shaped surface, it is given\nin conjunction with a sensation of finger movements. When I watch the\nflight of a bird, the moving bird is given in conjunction with the\nkinaesthetic sensations of eye movement and perhaps neck movement.\nSuch kinaesthetic activation during perception produces an implicit\nand pervasive reference to one’s own body. The implicit\nself-awareness of the actual and possible movements of my body helps\nshape the experience that I have of the world. To be clear, however,\nbodily self-awareness is not an awareness of the body in isolation\nfrom the world; it is embedded in action and perception. We do not\nfirst become aware of the body and subsequently use it to engage with\nthe world. We experience the world bodily, and the body is revealed to\nus in our exploration of the world. Primarily, the body attains\nself-awareness in action (or in our dispositions to action, or in our\naction possibilities) when it relates to something, uses something, or\nmoves through the\n world.[4] \nBodily self-awareness, like self-consciousness more generally, has\nlimitations. I am never fully aware of everything that is going on\nwith my body. Indeed, my body tends to efface itself as I perceive and\nact in the world. When I jump to catch a ball that is thrown over my\nhead, I certainly have a sense of what I can do, but I am not aware of\nmy precise movements or postures—for example, that my right leg\nbends at a certain angle as I reach with my left hand. I can execute\nmovements without being explicitly conscious of them, and even what I\nam tacitly aware of is somewhat limited—for example, I am not\naware of the shape of my grasp as I reach to grab the ball. Although I\nmay not be aware of certain details about my bodily performance, this\ndoes not mean however that I am unconscious of my body. Rather it\nmeans that the way that I am aware of my body is fully integrated with\nthe intentional action that I am performing. I know that I am jumping\nto catch the ball, and implicit in that, as an immediate sense rather\nthan an inference, I experience my body jumping to catch the ball. \nFurthermore, experiential aspects of my embodiment permeate my\npre-reflective self-consciousness. There is something it is like to\njump to catch a ball, and part of what it is like is that I am in fact\njumping. There is something different about what it is like to sit and\nimagine (or remember) myself jumping to catch the ball, and at least\npart of that difference has to do with the fact that I am sitting\nrather than jumping, although none of this may be explicit in my\nexperience. \nAnother way to think of the self-awareness involved in action is to\nconsider the sense of agency that is normally an aspect of\npre-reflective self-awareness in action. If, as I am walking down the\nstreet, I am pushed from behind, I am instantly aware of my body\nmoving in a way that I did not intend. The fact that I feel a loss of\ncontrol over my actions suggests that there had been an implicit sense\nof agency or control in my walking prior to being pushed. In voluntary\naction, I experience the movements of my body as my own actions, and\nthis is replaced by a feeling of loss of bodily control in the case of\ninvoluntary movement. Voluntary actions feel different from\ninvoluntary actions, and this difference depends respectively, on the\nexperience of agency or the experience of a lack of agency—as\nthe case may be if my body is being moved by someone\n else.[5] \nHubert Dreyfus has famously argued that in the case of expert\nperformance we are not self-conscious, but rather “usually involved\nin coping in a mindless way” (Dreyfus 2007a, 356). On his account,\nour immersed bodily life is so completely and totally world-engaged\nthat it is entirely oblivious to itself. Indeed, in total absorption,\none ceases being a subject altogether (Dreyfus 2007b, 373). It is only\nwhen this bodily absorption is interrupted that something like\nself-consciousness emerges. Dreyfus consequently doesn’t deny the\nexistence of self-consciousness, but he definitely wants to see it as\na capacity that is only exercised or actualized on special occasions.\nMoreover, when this capacity is exercised it necessarily disrupts our\ncoping and radically transform the kind of affordances that are given\nto it (Dreyfus 2005, 61; 2007, 354). A number of theorists, however,\nhave taken issue with this characterization of expert performance and\nhave argued that in the performing arts (e.g., in dance, musical\nperformance) and in athletics (e.g., baseball, cricket) expert\nperformers may employ an enhanced but still pre-reflective awareness\n(Legrand 2007), a heedful consciousness of the situation (e.g., Sutton\net al. 2011), or even a skillful reflective monitoring (Montero 2010;\n2014), or some variable combination of these (Høffding 2018), and\nthat such consciousness does not impede performance but improves it.\n \nA focus on embodied self-experience inevitably leads to a decisive\nwidening of the discussion. The externality of embodiment puts me, and\nmy actions, in the public sphere. Self-consciousness, which involves\nan ability to make reflective judgments about our own beliefs and\ndesires, is always shaped by others and what we have learned from\nothers. This intersubjective or social influence can also affect\npre-reflective self-awareness, including my sense of embodied\nagency. \nI can become aware of myself through the eyes of other people, and\nthis can happen in a number of different ways. Thus, embodiment brings\nintersubjectivity and sociality into the picture, and draws attention\nto the question of how certain forms of self-consciousness are\nintersubjectively mediated, and may depend on one’s social\nrelations to others. My awareness of myself as one person among\nothers, an awareness that I may frame from the perspective of others,\nattempting to see myself as they see me, involves a change in the\nattitude of self-consciousness. Within this attitude, judgments that I\nmake about myself are constrained by social expectations and cultural\nvalues. This kind of social self-consciousness is always\ncontextualized, as I try to understand how I appear to others, both in\nthe way I look, and in the meaning of my actions. I find myself in\nparticular contexts, with specific capabilities and dispositions,\nhabits and convictions, and I express myself in a way that is\nreflected off of others, in relevant (socially defined) roles through\nmy language and my actions. \nThe role of the other in this mode of self-consciousness is not\nunessential. According to Husserl, I become aware of myself\nspecifically as a human person only in such intersubjective relations\n(Husserl 1973b, 175; 1952, 204–05; see Hart 1992, 71; Zahavi\n1999, 157ff. Also see Taylor 1989, 34–36 for a similar idea).\nThus Husserl distinguishes the subject taken in its bare formality\nfrom the personalized subject and claims that the origin and status of\nbeing a person must be located in the social dimension. I am a person,\nsocially contextualized, with abilities, dispositions, habits,\ninterests, character traits, and convictions, all of which have been\ndeveloped through my interactions with others. When considering the\nfullness of human selfhood, the idea of an isolated, pure and formal\nsubject of experience is an abstraction (Husserl 1968, 210). Given the\nright conditions and circumstances, the self acquires a personalizing\nself-apprehension, i.e., it develops into a person and as a person\n(cf. Husserl 1952, 265). And this development depends heavily upon\nsocial interaction (Husserl 1973b, 170–171).  \nThis kind of self-consciousness also opens up the possibility of\nself-alienation, famously explicated by Sartre in terms of the\nother’s gaze. For Sartre, because “our being, along with\nits being-for-itself, is also for-others; the being which is revealed\nto the reflective consciousness is for-itself-for-others” (1956,\n282). On this view, the primary experience of the other is not that I\nperceive her as some kind of object in which I must find a person, but\nI perceive the other as a subject who perceives me as an object. My\nexperience of the other is at the same time an experience that\ninvolves my own self-consciousness, a self-consciousness in which I am\npre-reflectively aware that I am an object for another. This\nexperience can further motivate a reflective self-consciousness, as I\nconsider how I must appear to the other. \nMerleau-Ponty (1945, 415) suggests that the other’s gaze can\nmotivate this kind of self-consciousness only if I already have a\nsense of my own visibility to the other. This sense of my own\nvisibility, however, is immediately linked with the pre-reflective,\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic sense of my body, an insight that goes\nback to Husserl’s analysis (mentioned above). Merleau-Ponty\nnotes its connection to the infant’s capability for imitation,\nand this is carried forward to more recent advances in developmental\npsychology (see Merleau-Ponty, 1945, 165, 404–405; 2010; Gallagher and\nZahavi 2012; Zahavi 1999, 171–72). Indeed, although much emphasis has\nfallen on vision and the gaze of the other in phenomenological\naccounts of self-consciousness, proprioceptive and tactile experiences\nhave a developmental primacy and emerge in the pre-natal environment\nin ways that allow for very basic relational experiences of\nself-movement versus movement of the mother’s body (Lymer 2010;\n2014; Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; Ciaunica & Fotopoulou\n2016), and continue to play a significant role in embodied\ninteractions with caregivers during early infancy. In this respect,\nintersubjective/intercorporeal experiences can affect pre-reflective\nbody self-awareness. This complicates any claim that the\npre-reflective experience of body ownership is primarily for\nself-preservation (Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; de Vignemont\n2018). \nThis is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of these\nrich and complex issues, issues that extend to analyses of phenomena\nsuch as empathy, shame, guilt, and so on (see Zahavi 2010, 2014). But\nit is important to realize that self-consciousness is a multifaceted\nconcept. It is not something that can be exhaustively analyzed simply\nby examining the inner workings of the mind.  \nThe notion of self-consciousness has been the subject of a rich and\ncomplex analysis in the phenomenological tradition. Aspects of the\nphenomenological analysis also show up in other areas of research,\nincluding feminism (Stawarska 2006; Young 2005; Heinämaa 2003),\necological psychology (Gibson 1966), and recent analyses of enactive\nperception (Gallagher 2017b; Noë 2004; Thompson 2008). The\nrecognition of the existence of a primitive form of pre-reflective\nself-consciousness is an important starting point for an understanding\nof more elaborate forms of self-consciousness that are concept- and\nlanguage-dependent. Phenomenological analyses show these processes to\nbe more than purely mental or cognitive events since they integrally\ninvolve embodiment and intersubjective dimensions.
