It can be\nroughly defined as the seeing and/or treating a person, usually a\nwoman, as an object. In this entry, the focus is primarily on\nsexual objectification, objectification occurring in the sexual realm.\nMartha Nussbaum (1995, 257) has identified seven features that are\ninvolved in the idea of treating a person as an object:\n\ninstrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for\nthe objectifier’s purposes;\n\ndenial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking\nin autonomy and self-determination;\n\ninertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in\nagency, and perhaps also in activity;\n\nfungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable\nwith other objects;\n\nviolability: the treatment of a person as lacking in\nboundary-integrity;\n\nownership: the treatment of a person as something that is\nowned by another (can be bought or sold);\n\ndenial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as\nsomething whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken\ninto account.\n\n\n\nRae Langton (2009, 228–229) has added three more features to\nNussbaum’s list:\n\nreduction to body: the treatment of a person as\nidentified with their body, or body parts;\n\nreduction to appearance: the treatment of a\nperson primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the\nsenses;\n\nsilencing: the treatment of a person as if they are\nsilent, lacking the capacity to speak.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the thinkers discussing objectification have taken it\nto be a morally problematic phenomenon. This is particularly the case\nin feminist discussions of pornography. Anti-pornography feminists\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, influenced by Immanuel Kant’s\nconception of objectification, have famously argued that, due to men’s\nconsumption of pornography, women as a group are reduced to the status\nof mere tools for men’s purposes. Moreover, feminists like Sandra\nBartky and Susan Bordo have argued that women are objectified through\nbeing excessively preoccupied with their appearance. Important recent\nwork by feminists has also been devoted to exploring the connection\nbetween objectivity and objectification. More recently, some thinkers,\nsuch as Martha Nussbaum, have challenged the idea that objectification\nis a necessarily negative phenomenon, arguing for the possibility of\npositive objectification. While treating a person as an object (in one\nor more of the ways mentioned above) is often problematic, Nussbaum\nargues that objectification can in some contexts take benign or even\npositive forms, and can constitute a valuable and enjoyable part of\nour lives. In her forthcoming work, Nancy Bauer questions the very\nidea that it makes sense to specify the marks and features of the term\n‘objectification’. Such an attempt, she argues, will only\ndistort the phenomenon in question (2015).\n\n\n\nImmanuel Kant’s views on sexual objectification have been particularly\ninfluential for contemporary feminist discussions on this topic. Kant\nthought that sexuality is extremely problematic when exercised outside\nthe context of monogamous marriage, arguing that in such instances it\nleads to objectification. He characteristically writes in\nthe Lectures on Ethics that “sexual love makes of the\nloved person an Object of appetite; as soon as that appetite has been\nstilled, the person is cast aside as one casts away a lemon which has\nbeen sucked dry. … as soon as a person becomes an Object of\nappetite for another, all motives of moral relationship cease to\nfunction, because as an Object of appetite for another a person\nbecomes a thing and can be treated and used as such by every\none” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 163). \n\nObjectification, for Kant, involves the lowering of a person, a being\nwith humanity, to the status of an object. Humanity, for\nKant, is an individual’s rational nature and capacity for rational\nchoice. The characteristic feature of humanity is an individual’s\ncapacity for rationally setting and pursuing her own ends. A being\nwith humanity is capable of deciding what is valuable, and of finding\nways to realise and promote this value. Humanity is what is special\nabout human beings. It distinguishes them from animals and inanimate\nobjects. Because human beings are special in this sense they,\nunlike animals and objects, have a dignity (an ‘inner\nworth’, as opposed to a ‘relative worth’) (Kant\n1785, 42). It is crucial, for Kant, that each person respects humanity\nin others, as well as humanity in their own person. Humanity must\nnever be treated merely as a means, but always at the same time as an\nend (Kant 1797, 209). \n\nKant is worried that when people exercise their sexuality outside the\ncontext of monogamous marriage, they treat humanity merely as a means\nfor their sexual purposes. In the Lectures on Ethics Kant\noften speaks about ‘degradation’,\n‘subordination’, and ‘dishonouring’ of\nhumanity when exercise of sexuality is involved. He goes so far as to\nsay that sexual activity can lead to the loss or\n‘sacrifice’ of humanity (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n163–4). The loved person loses what is special to her as a human\nbeing, her humanity, and is reduced to a thing, a mere sexual\ninstrument. Kant’s notion of objectification, therefore, focuses\nlargely on instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a mere tool\nfor the lover’s purposes. Objectification, for Kant, involves\nregarding someone “as an object, something for use”\n(Herman 1993, 57). According to Alan Soble, for Kant, “both the\nbody and the compliant actions of the other person are tools (a means)\nthat one uses for one’s sexual pleasure, and to that extent the other\nperson is a fungible, functional thing” (Soble 2002a, 226). The\nidea that within sexual relationships people are reduced to objects,\nthat they lose their rational nature, is an extreme one. Halwani\nrightly points out that this reduction to the status of an object\nrarely happens in sexual objectification. He explains that\n“Outside rape, it is rare to treat our sexual partners as\nobjects: not only are we aware of their humanity; we are also mindful\nof it.” (Halwani 2010, 193) Halwani offers a more sensible\nreading of Kant’s claim here, in admitting that there is truth to the\nidea that “Sexual desire is powerful enough to make reason its\nown tool; it can subvert our rational capacity to set ends”\n(Halwani 2010, 209). In this way, people can “endanger their\ndignity by undermining their reason” (Halwani 2010,\n209). Therefore, even though the view that humanity is completely\ndestroyed when people exercise their sexuality is an unappealing one,\nit is not unreasonable to think that, in some cases, sexual desire and\nexercise of sexuality can undermine our rationality. \n\nKant thought that in theory both men and women can be objectified,\nbut he was well aware that in practice women are the most common\nvictims of objectification. This is obvious in Kant’s discussions\nof prostitution and concubinage. Exercise of sexuality within these\nmorally problematic sexual contexts leads to the reduction of women\n(prostitutes and concubines) to men’s objects of appetite. \n\nKant defines prostitution as the offer for profit of one’s\nperson for another’s sexual gratification. A person, Kant holds,\ncannot allow others to use her body sexually in exchange for money\nwithout losing her humanity and becoming an object. He explains that\n“… a man is not at his own disposal. He is not entitled\nto sell a limb, not even one of his teeth. But to allow one’s person\nfor profit to be used for the satisfaction of sexual desire, to make\nof oneself an Object of demand, is to dispose over oneself as over a\nthing” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 165). The prostitute’s\ncommodification necessarily leads to her objectification; she is\nreduced to “a thing on which another satisfies his\nappetite” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 165). Kant states\nthat “human beings are … not entitled to offer\nthemselves, for profit, as things for the use of others in the\nsatisfaction of their sexual inclinations. In so doing, they would run\nthe risk of having their person used by all and sundry as an\ninstrument for the satisfaction of inclination”\n(Kant Lectures on Ethics, 165). Kant blames the prostitute\nfor her objectification. He takes her to be responsible for\nsacrificing her humanity, in offering herself as an object for the\nsatisfaction of the clients’ sexual desires. \n\nThe other relationship in which objectification is, for Kant, clearly\npresent is concubinage. According to Kant, concubinage is the\nnon-commodified sexual relationship between a man and more than one\nwoman (the concubines). Kant takes concubinage to be a purely sexual\nrelationship in which all parties aim at the satisfaction of their\nsexual desires (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 166). The inequality\nthat is involved in this relationship makes it problematic. Kant\nexplains that “the woman surrenders her sex completely to the\nman, but the man does not completely surrender his sex to the\nwoman” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 169). Since body and\nself are for Kant inseparable and together they constitute the person,\nin surrendering her body (her sex) exclusively to her male partner,\nthe woman surrenders her whole person to the man, allowing him to\npossess it. The man, by contrast, who has more than one sexual\npartner, does not exclusively surrender himself to the woman, and so\nhe does not allow her to possess his person. In allowing her male\npartner to possess her person, without herself being able to similarly\npossess his person, Kant believes that eventually the concubine (and\nthis also applies to the woman in any other polygamous relationship,\nincluding polygamous marriage) loses her person and is made\n‘into a thing’ (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n166). \n\nThe only relationship in which two people can exercise their\nsexuality without the fear of reducing themselves to objects is\nmonogamous marriage. Monogamy is required to ensure\nthat there is equality and reciprocity in the surrender and ownership\nof the two spouses’ persons. The spouses exclusively surrender their\npersons to one another, so neither of them is in danger of losing his\nor her person and becoming an object. This perfect equality and\nreciprocity between the spouses is described by Kant as follows:\n“… if I yield myself completely to another and obtain the\nperson of the other in return, I win myself back; I have given myself\nup as the property of another, but in turn I take that other as my\nproperty, and so win myself back again in winning the person whose\nproperty I have become. In this way, the two persons become a unity of\nwill” (Kant Lectures on Ethics, 167). Furthermore, this\nmutual exchange of the two spouses’ persons must, for Kant,\nbe legally enforced. Kant explains that marriage is\n“sexual union in accordance with law” (Kant 1797, 62). He\nwants something external, namely, the law, to guarantee this lifelong\nownership of the two parties’ persons in marriage. He argues that this\nlegal obligation to surrender one’s person to one’s spouses makes\nmarriage different from a monogamous relationship between two\nunmarried partners. \n\nLike Kant, anti-pornography feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea\nDworkin take inequality to be tightly linked to objectification. In\nthe eyes of both these feminists and Kant, there is the powerful\nobjectifier on the one hand, and on the other hand there exists his\npowerless victim. Due to their unequal power, the former objectifies\nthe latter. \n\nKant is concerned with inequality taking place within polygamous\nrelationships. MacKinnon and Dworkin, on the other hand, believe that\ninequality is a much more widespread and pervasive phenomenon. It\ncovers all aspects of our society. MacKinnon and Dworkin emphasise that\nwe live in a world of gender inequality. A person’s\ngender is, for MacKinnon, clearly distinguished from a\nperson’s sex. Gender, being a man or a woman, is socially\nconstructed, whereas sex, being male or female, is biologically\ndefined. Within our patriarchal societies, men and women have clearly\ndefined roles: women (all women, women as a group) are objectified,\nwhereas men (all men, men as a group) are their objectifiers\n(MacKinnon 1987, 6, 32–45, 50; MacKinnon 1989a, 113–4, 128,\n137–40; Haslanger 1993, 98–101) (For more on sex and\ngender, see also the entries\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender\n and\n  feminist perspectives on power.)\nEven though MacKinnon does acknowledge that a female (sex) individual can\nbe an objectifier and a male (sex) individual can be objectified, she\ntakes it that the former is a man and the latter is a woman, since in\nher view a man (gender) is by definition the objectifier and a woman\n(gender) is by definition the objectified. \n\nThis situation of gender inequality which troubles our societies and\nis so tightly linked to the objectification of women is, MacKinnon and\nDworkin believe, created and sustained by men’s consumption of\npornography. MacKinnon defines pornography as “the graphic\nsexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that\nalso includes women dehumanised as sexual objects, things, or\ncommodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape; being tied up, cut\nup, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in postures of sexual\nsubmission or servility or display; reduced to body parts, penetrated\nby objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation,\ninjury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding, bruised, or\nhurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual” (MacKinnon\n1987, 176). \n\nIn our society, MacKinnon holds, pornography defines women’s\nrole as sexual objects available for men’s consumption:\n“Pornography defines women by how we look according to how we can\nbe sexually used. … Pornography participates in its\naudience’s eroticism through creating an accessible sexual\nobject, the possession and consumption of which is male\nsexuality, as socially constructed; to be consumed and possessed as\nwhich, is female sexuality, as socially constructed”\n(MacKinnon 1987, 173). According to MacKinnon, pornography is\nresponsible for both men’s and women’s conception of women\nas objects available for men’s consumption. \n\nMacKinnon’s and Dworkin’s understanding of objectification is\nsimilar to Kant’s. For both of them, as for Kant,\nobjectification involves treating a person, someone with humanity, as\nan object of merely instrumental worth, and consequently reducing this\nperson to the status of an object for use. The objectified individual\nis made into a tool for others’ sexual purposes. Objectification,\ntherefore, constitutes a serious harm to a person’s humanity. \n\nDworkin uses Kantian language to describe the phenomenon of sexual\nobjectification: “Objectification occurs when a human being,\nthrough social means, is made less than human, turned into a thing or\ncommodity, bought and sold. When objectification occurs, a person is\ndepersonalised, so that no individuality or integrity is available\nsocially or in what is an extremely circumscribed privacy.\nObjectification is an injury right at the heart of discrimination:\nthose who can be used as if they are not fully human are no longer\nfully human in social terms; their humanity is hurt by being\ndiminished” (Dworkin 2000, 30–1). When a person is\ntreated as less than human, as merely an object for another’s use, she\nbecomes, according to Dworkin, less than human. In this way, her\nhumanity is harmed by being diminished. \n\nMacKinnon too describes objectification in similar terms. She writes:\n“… A sex object is defined on the basis of its looks, in\nterms of its usability for sexual pleasure, such that both the\nlooking—the quality of gaze, including its points of\nview—and the definition according to use become eroticised as\npart of the sex itself. This is what the feminist concept of\n‘sex object’ means” (MacKinnon 1987, 173). She\nfurthermore holds: “A person, in one Kantian view, is a free and\nrational agent whose existence is an end in itself, as opposed to\ninstrumental.  In pornography women exist to the end of male\npleasure” (MacKinnon 1987, 173). Insofar as an individual has\nonly instrumental value, she is clearly not regarded as an end in\nherself. \n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin have argued that, even if women consent to their\nbeing used as mere means for men’s sexual purposes, this is not\nsufficient to make such use permissible. For instance, these feminists\nclaim that women in the pornographic industry consent to be used as\nobjects simply out of lack of options available to them within our\npatriarchal society. Women’s consent, therefore, is not true\nconsent. MacKinnon writes: “The sex is not chosen for the sex.\nMoney is the medium of force and provides the cover of consent”\n(MacKinnon 1993, 28). This does not only hold for women in\npornography. For MacKinnon and Dworkin, all women’s consent to be\nsexually used by men cannot be true consent under the existing\nconditions of gender inequality. They hold that women are not truly\nblameworthy for their reduction to things of merely instrumental\nvalue.  Women’s objectification is demanded and inflicted by men in\nour societies. It is men who want, and also, Dworkin claims, need to\nuse women as objects, and demand them to be object-like (Dworkin 1997,\n142–3). \n\nKant compares the objectified individual to a lemon, used and\ndiscarded afterwards, and elsewhere to a steak consumed by people for\nthe satisfaction of their hunger (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n163 and 165). In a similar manner, MacKinnon blames pornography for\nteaching its consumers that women exist to be used by men. A woman,\naccording to MacKinnon, becomes comparable to a cup (a thing), and as\nsuch she is valued only for how she looks and how she can be used\n(MacKinnon 1987, 138). Similarly, Dworkin talks about men being the\nonly “human centre” of the world, surrounded by objects\nfor use, including women. A man experiences his power, according to\nDworkin, in using objects, both inanimate objects and “persons\nwho are not adult men” (Dworkin 1989, 104). \n\nKant took exercise of sexuality to be inherently problematic. For\nDworkin and MacKinnon, on the other hand, what is problematic is not\nsexuality per se, but rather sexuality as constructed through\npornography. These feminists believe that objectification is a\nconsequence of gender inequality and it is created and sustained by\npornography’s existence and consumption. Pornography, according to\nMacKinnon, makes women’s sexuality into “something any man who\nwants to can buy and hold in his hands… She becomes something\nto be used by him, specifically, an object of his sexual use”\n(MacKinnon 1987, 138). MacKinnon fears that use can easily be followed\nby violence and abuse. Since women are things (as opposed to human\nbeings), it seems to men that there is nothing problematic with\nabusing them. The object status of women, then, is the cause of men\nseeing nothing problematic with violent behaviour towards women. \n\nMoreover, MacKinnon notes, women in pornography are presented as\nenjoying how they are being used and violated by men: “In\npornography, women desire disposition and cruelty. Men … create\nscenes in which women desperately want to be bound, battered,\ntortured, humiliated, and killed. Or merely taken and used. Women are\nthere to be violated and possessed, men to violate and possess\nus…” (MacKinnon 1987, 148). Dworkin similarly writes:\n“Men do not believe that rape and battery are violations of\nfemale will in part because men … have consumed pornography in\nthe private world of men for centuries. … The most enduring\nsexual truth in pornography is that sexual violence is desired by the\nnormal female, needed by her, suggested or demanded by her”\n(Dworkin 1989, 166). Pornography, then, teaches its consumers that,\nnot only is it permissible to treat women in these ways, but also that\nwomen themselves enjoy being used, violated and abused by men. Watson\nfurthermore argues that use of pornography restricts the sexual\nautonomy of boys and men, due to pornography’s pervasiveness as\na tool of sex education. Pornography consumption powerfully shapes its\nusers’ beliefs, attitudes, preferences and desires. Pornography,\nshe argues, distorts these and in this way undermines people’s sexual\nautonomy and restricts the development of authentic sexuality for both\nwomen and men (Altman and Watson 284, 287–8). \n\nThe idea that pornography causes men to treat women as\nobjects to be used and abused has been defended by a number of\nfeminists. Alison Assiter argues that what is wrong with pornography\nis that it reinforces desires on the part of men to treat women as\nobjects (as mere means to achieve their purposes) (Assiter 1988,\n68). Rae Langton also discusses the possibility of such a causal\nconnection between men’s consumption of pornography and women’s\nobjectification. She writes: “As a matter of human psychology,\nwhen men sexually use objects, pornographic artifacts, as women, they\ntend to use real woman as objects. One weaker variant of this causal\nclaim might be restricted to a subset of pornography… As a\nmatter of human psychology, when men sexually use objects as women,\nand those objects are pornographic artifacts, whose content is\nviolent or misogynistic, then they will tend to use real women as\nobjects” (Langton 1995, 178).) \n\nMacKinnon, however, holds that the connection between men’s\nuse of pornography and women’s objectification is not simply a\ncausal one. She has famously claimed that pornography involves\n“sex between people and things, human beings and pieces of paper,\nreal men and unreal women”. And, as a result for MacKinnon,\n“the human [women, in particular] becomes a thing”\n(MacKinnon 1993, 109 and 25). Men’s consumption of pornography,\nthen, is (constitutes) women’s objectification.\n(This is admittedly a puzzling claim, but one which I will not delve\ninto further here. Detailed defenses of the claim have been\noffered by Melinda Vadas (Vadas 2005) and Rae Langton (Langton 1995),\nand a criticism has been put forward by Jennifer Saul (Saul 2006).) \n\nKant thought that the solution to sexual objectification is\nmarriage. This is because he conceived this relationship as one of\nperfect equality and reciprocity between the spouses. Each of them\nsurrenders his or her person to the other and receives the person of\nthe other in return. This way, Kant believed, neither of them is\nobjectified by losing his or her person. (For a detailed discussion of\nKantian marriage see Herman 1993 and Papadaki 2010b.) For Dworkin and\nMacKinnon, however, Kant’s suggested solution is\ninappropriate. Objectification, according to these feminists, is\npresent within all heterosexual relationships in our society and harms\nwomen’s humanity. Marriage, or any other heterosexual relationship for\nthat matter, is clearly not regarded as an exception by\nthem. According to MacKinnon and Dworkin, the way to fight\nobjectification is to fight gender inequality, which is created and\nsustained by men’s consumption of pornography. They take it that\npornography has power and authority over its audience (men and\nboys). This view is also defended by Langton, who argues that it does\nnot matter that the speech of pornographers is not generally held in\nhigh esteem. What matters, rather, is that men and boys learn about\nsex primarily through pornography. Pornography passes the message to\nits audience that women are objects readily available for men’s\nconsumption (Langton 1993, 312). \n\nThe view that pornography has this amount of influence over men and\nplays such a central role in women’s objectification has received\ncriticism. Deborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer question the idea that\nmen are conditioned to behave in certain ways as a consequence of\npornography consumption. What is problematic with this idea, according\nto them, is that men are presented as incapable of critically\ninterpreting pornographic materials, and as simply imitating what they\nsee in pornography (Cameron & Frazer 2000, 248–251). In a similar spirit, Altman argues that pornography consumption cannot alter a person’s preferences and desires, sexual or otherwise. He claims that men find women’s subordination arousing, not as a result of their having consumed pornography. Rather, they enjoy pornography, which includes the subordination of women, because they already find this subordination arousing. Thus, pornography does not make anything sexy but it deals with what its consumers already find sexy (Altman and Watson, 68–9).  \n\nEven assuming that pornography does indeed pass the message that\nwomen are object-like to its consumers, however, it has been suggested\nthat pornography is not special with respect to sustaining gender\ninequality and women’s objectification. Leslie Green explains\nthat the idea that women are mere objects/tools is reinforced through\nparental pressure, television, popular novels, music videos, and\nfashion. What we need to do, Green says, is change our society, in a\nway that women’s subjectivity will be acknowledged (Green 2000,\n43–52). Nussbaum too argues that we should not see pornography as the\nprimary cause of women’s objectification. Sexual objectification\nis, according to Nussbaum, often caused by social inequality, but there\nis no reason to believe that pornography is the core of such inequality\n(Nussbaum 1995, 286, 290). \n\nA similar view has been put forward by Ronald Dworkin, according to\nwhom: “It might be odd that feminists have devoted such energy\nto that campaign [the campaign for outlawing pornography]… No\ndoubt mass culture is in various ways an obstacle to sexual equality,\nbut the most popular forms of that culture—the view of women\npresented in soap operas and commercials, for example—are much\ngreater obstacles to that equality than the dirty films watched by a\nsmall minority” (R. Dworkin 1993, 36). (For further discussions\nabout pornography, see also the entries on\n feminist perspectives on sex markets\n and on \n pornography and censorship.) \n\nIt has been pointed out by some feminist thinkers that women in our\nsociety are more identified and associated with their bodies than are\nmen, and, to a greater extent than men, they are valued for how they\nlook (Bartky 1990; Bordo 1993, 143). In order to gain social\nacceptability, women are under constant pressure to\ncorrect their bodies and appearance more generally, and to\nmake them conform to the ideals of feminine appearance of their time,\nthe so-called ‘norms of feminine appearance’ (the standards\nof appearance women feel they should be living up to) (Saul\n2003, 144). Some feminists have argued that, in being preoccupied with\ntheir looks, women treat themselves as things to be decorated and gazed\nupon. \n\nIn her book Femininity and Domination, Sandra Bartky uses\nMarx’s theory of alienation to explain the objectification that\nresults from women’s preoccupation with their appearance. A\nfeature of Marx’s theory of alienation is the\nfragmentation of the human person, this “splintering of\nhuman nature into a number of misbegotten parts”. For Marx,\nlabour is the most distinctively human activity, and the product of\nlabour is the exteriorisation of the worker’s being. Under capitalism,\nhowever, workers are alienated from the products of their labour, and\nconsequently their person is fragmented (Bartky 1990,\n128–9). \n\nBartky believes that women in patriarchal societies also undergo a\nkind of fragmentation “by being too closely identified with\n[their body]… [their] entire being is identified with the body,\na thing which… has been regarded as less inherently human than\nthe mind or personality” (Bartky 1990, 130). All the focus is\nplaced on a woman’s body, in a way that her mind or personality are\nnot adequately acknowledged. A woman’s person, then, is\nfragmented. Bartky believes that through this fragmentation a woman is\nobjectified, since her body is separated from her person and is\nthought as representing the woman (Bartky 1990, 130). \n\nBartky explains that, typically, objectification involves two\npersons, one who objectifies and one who is objectified. (This is also\nthe idea of objectification put forward by Kant as well as by MacKinnon\nand Dworkin.) However, as Bartky points out, objectifier and\nobjectified can be one and the same person. Women in patriarchal\nsocieties feel constantly watched by men, much like the prisoners of\nthe Panopticon (model prison proposed by Bentham), and they feel the\nneed to look sensually pleasing to men (Bartky 1990, 65). According to\nBartky: “In the regime of institutionalised heterosexuality woman\nmust make herself ‘object and prey’ for the man. …\nWoman lives her body as seen by another, by an anonymous patriarchal\nOther” (Bartky 1990, 73). This leads women to objectify their\nown persons. Bartky argues that the woman “[takes] toward her own\nperson the attitude of the man. She will then take erotic satisfaction\nin her physical self, revelling in her body as a beautiful object to be\ngazed at and decorated”. Such an attitude is called\n‘narcissism’, which is defined by Bartky as the infatuation\nwith one’s bodily being (Bartky 1990, 131–2). \n\nIn being infatuated with their bodily beings, Bartky argues that\nwomen learn to see and treat themselves as objects to be gazed at and\ndecorated, they learn to see themselves as though from the outside.\nNarcissism, as Simone de Beauvoir also points out, “consists in\nthe setting up of the ego as a double ‘stranger’”\n(Beauvoir 1961, 375). The adolescent girl “becomes an object and\nshe sees herself as an object; she discovers this new aspect of her\nbeing with surprise: it seems to her that she has been doubled; instead\nof coinciding exactly with herself, she now begins to exist\noutside” (Beauvoir 1961, 316) (See the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir.) However, this\n‘stranger’ who inhabits women’s consciousness, Bartky\nwrites, is hardly a stranger; it is, rather, the woman’s own self\n(Bartky 1993, 134). \n\nAs Nancy Bauer holds, drawing on Beauvoir, women will always have\nreasons to succumb to the temptation of objectifying themselves. Bauer\nmentions the widespread recent phenomenon of female college students\nwho claim that they gain pleasure in performing unilateral oral sex on\nmale students. A woman who turns herself into an “object of the\nhelpless desire of a boy”in this way, Bauer explains,\nexperiences a sense of power and pleasure, which, however, are not\nunadulterated (Bauer 2011, 124). A great theme of The Second\nSex, Bauer concludes, is that, in order to achieve full\npersonhood, it is necessary not only that men stop objectifying women,\nbut also that “women care about abjuring the temptation to\nobjectify themselves” (Bauer 2011, 128). \n\nBartky talks about the disciplinary practices that produce a feminine\nbody and are the practices through which women learn to see themselves\nas objects. First of all, according to her, there are those practices\nthat aim to produce a body of a certain size and shape: women must\nconform to the body ideal of their time (i.e. a slim body with large\nbreasts), which, Bartky holds, requires women to subject their bodies\nto the ‘tyranny of slenderness’ (put themselves through\nconstant dieting and exercise) (Bartky 1990, 65–7). Susan Bordo\nalso emphasises the fact that women are more obsessed with dieting\nthan are men. This is linked to serious diseases such as anorexia and\nbulimia. Ninety percent of all anorexics, Bordo points out, are women (Bordo\n1993, 143, 154). Furthermore, a large number of women have plastic\nsurgery, most commonly liposuction and breast enlargement, in order to\nmake their bodies conform to what is considered to be the ideal\nbody. \n\nAccording to Bartky, the second category of these disciplinary\npractices that produce a feminine body are those that aim to control\nthe body’s gestures, postures, and movements. Women, she holds,\nare more restricted than men in the way they move, and they try to take\nup very little space as opposed to men, who tend to expand to the space\navailable. Women’s movements are also restrained by their\nuncomfortable clothes and shoes (Bartky 1990, 68–9). The final\ncategory of the disciplinary practices, Bartky holds, are those that are\ndirected towards the display of a woman’s body as an\n‘ornamented surface’: women must take care of their skin\nand make it soft, smooth, hairless and wrinkle-free, they must apply\nmake-up to disguise their skin’s imperfections. Our culture\ndemands the ‘infantilisation’ of women’s bodies and\nfaces (Bartky 1990, 71–2). \n\nAccording to Bartky: “… whatever else she [a\nwoman] may become, she is importantly a body designed to please or to\nexcite” (Bartky 1990, 80). Iris Marion Young adds that\nwomen’s preoccupation with their appearance suppresses the body\npotential of women: “Developing a sense of our bodies as\nbeautiful objects to be gazed at and decorated requires suppressing a\nsense of our bodies as strong, active subjects…” (Young,\n1979). \n\nWho is responsible for women’s situation? According to Bartky:\n“The disciplinary power that inscribes femininity in the female\nbody is everywhere and it is nowhere; the disciplinarian is everyone\nand yet no one in particular” (Bartky 1990, 74). The message\nthat women should look more feminine is everywhere: it is reinforced by\nparents, teachers, male partners, and it is expressed in various ways\nthroughout the media. Men, then, are not the only ones to blame for\nwomen’s situation. Because of the pervasiveness of this\ndisciplinary power that inscribes femininity,\nwomen’s constant preoccupation with appearance has come to be\nregarded as something natural and voluntary; it is something that women\nhave internalised. Therefore, it is far from easy for women, in\nBartky’s view, to free themselves from their objectification. \n\nNot all feminists, however, share the concern about the inevitability\nof objectification involved in women’s appearance-related\npursuits. Janet Richards takes women’s preoccupation with their looks\nto be a matter of personal preference, and not a feminist matter. She\nclaims that there is nothing inherently degrading or objectifying about\nwomen trying to be sensually pleasing (Richards 1980,\n184–204). Natasha Walter too takes it that women’s preoccupation\nwith their appearance is not necessarily objectifying. She also points\nto the fact that men in our society engage in self-decoration and\nseek to be admired by women (Walter 1998, 86–102). \n\nBordo herself acknowledges the fact that men have increasingly started\nto spend more time, money and effort on their appearance (Bordo\n1999). She emphasises the fact that men’s magazines today, like\nwomen’s, are full of articles and advice on how men should look: how\nto be more muscular, what clothes to wear, what creams and other\ncosmetics to use, etc. Men feel the need to make their looks conform\nto the prevailing ideals of masculinity. Bordo believes that it is\nconsumer capitalism that drives men to be increasingly concerned with\ntheir appearance: “Why should [the cosmetics, diet, exercise,\nand surgery industries] restrict themselves to female markets, if they\ncan convince men that their looks need constant improvement\ntoo?,” she asks (Bordo 1999, 220). \n\nThe fact that men too face pressure to look a certain way, and\nengage in constant efforts to improve their appearance, however, is not\non its own sufficient to show that women’s (and men’s)\npreoccupation with appearance is not objectifying. According to Saul,\n“The increasing pressure on men to conform to unattainable\nstandards of beauty is far from a sign of progress: it is, instead, a\nsign that the problem has grown” (Saul 2003, 168). \n\nMacKinnon introduces the idea that there are important connections\nbetween objectivity and objectification. MacKinnon writes: “The\nstance of the ‘knower’ … is … the neutral\nposture, which I will be calling objectivity—that is the\nnonsituated distanced standpoint… [This] is the male standpoint\nsocially … [The] relationship between objectivity as the stance\nfrom which the world is known and the world that is apprehended in\nthis way is the relationship of objectification. Objectivity is the\nepistemological stance of which objectification is the social process,\nof which male dominance is the politics, the acted out social\npractice. That is, to look at the world objectively is to objectify\nit” (MacKinnon 1987, 50). Her claim has become the focus of\nrecent feminist investigation. Drawing on MacKinnon’s work, Rae\nLangton and Sally Haslanger have explored the idea that\nobjectification is often hidden, and ‘masked’ as\nobjectivity. \n\nAccording to Haslanger, in trying to be objective about our world and\nfunction within it, we go about trying to discover things’ natures. An\nobject’s nature is essential to it, and any change to it will\ninevitably destroy it. An object cannot exist without those properties\nthat constitute its nature. Discovering an object’s nature enables us\nto explain the behaviour of that object under normal\ncircumstances. This means that in practical decision-making, we must\nbe attentive to objects’ natures (Haslanger 1993, 103, 105). She\nwrites: “It won’t do to try to fry an egg on a paper plate;\nthere is no point in trying to teach a rock how to read. Because the\nworld is not infinitely malleable to our wants or needs, reasonable\ndecision making will accommodate ‘how things are’, where\nthis is understood as accommodating the natures of things, the\nbackground conditions constraining our actions” (Haslanger 1993,\n105). \n\nA plausible strategy for discovering a thing’s nature is to look for\nobserved regularities. This is because natures are responsible for the\nregular behaviour of things under normal circumstances. For example, I\nobserve that my ferns die if deprived of water. I therefore come to\nbelieve that the nature of ferns is such that they cannot survive\nwithout water. I adjust my decision-making in accordance with this\nobserved regularity, and so water my ferns to prevent them from\ndying. In observing the regularity that ferns die when depraved of\nwater, I have concluded that this is due to ferns’ nature. Haslanger\npoints out that this procedure of drawing on observed regularities to\nset constraints on our practical decision making seems to be “a\nparadigm of ‘neutral,’ ‘objective,’ or\n‘reasonable’ procedure” (Haslanger 1993, 105). \n\nThe above procedure, however, can be problematic. This becomes\nobvious when moving to the social world. For example, aiming to\ndiscover women’s nature following the above procedure in\npatriarchal societies (like ours, according to MacKinnon) is highly\nproblematic. MacKinnon believes that it is an observed regularity in\nour societies that women are submissive and object-like (and men are\nwomen’s objectifiers). This means that one might be led to the\nbelief that women are by their nature submissive and\nobject-like. (It should be noted here that MacKinnon, and also\nHaslanger and Langton following her, use ‘men’ and\n‘women’ to refer to gender categories, which are socially\n(not biologically) defined: one is a woman or a man by virtue of\none’s social position; see the entry on \nfeminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n However, the\nbelief that women are naturally submissive and object-like is false,\nsince women have been made to be like that. \n\nWomen’s object-like status is not a natural fact, but rather a\nconsequence of gender inequality. In structuring our world in such a\nway as to accommodate this allegedly natural fact about women, we\nsustain the existing situation of gender inequality. As MacKinnon\nvividly puts it: “if [we] look neutrally on the reality of\ngender so produced, the harm that has been done will not be\nperceptible as harm. It becomes just the way things are”\n(MacKinnon 1987, 59). Haslanger adds: “Once we have cast women\nas submissive and deferential ‘by nature’, then efforts to\nchange this role appear unmotivated, even pointless. … These\nreflections suggest that what appeared to be a ‘neutral’\nor ‘objective’ ideal, namely, the procedure of drawing on\nobserved regularities to set constraints on practical decision\nmaking—is one which will, under conditions of gender hierarchy\nreinforce the social arrangements on which such hierarchy depends”\n(Haslanger 1993, 106). \n\nDrawing on MacKinnon, Haslanger suggests that there are four\nconditions that are necessary in order for person A to\nobjectify person B: \n\nWhen it comes to women’s sexual objectification by men, the\nabove conditions go as following: \n\nAccording to Haslanger, in order for an objectifier to\n‘mask’ his power and believe that the observed differences\nbetween men and women are consequences of their natures, he must resort\nto a norm of aperspectivity; he must believe that his\nobservations are not conditioned by his own social position, and that\nhe has no impact on the circumstances under observation. Haslanger\ndiscusses a norm, which is often used by objectifiers, the norm of\nAssumed Objectivity, which consists of the following four\nsub-norms: \n\nHaslanger argues that, under conditions of social hierarchy, the\nNorm of Assumed Objectivity would perpetuate the existing patterns of\nwomen’s objectification. Therefore, our efforts at social change\nwould become unmotivated. The norm in question should be rejected in\nthis case because it has bad practical consequences for women, while\nserving the interests of men (it is pragmatically bad).\nFurthermore, Haslanger argues that the norm of Assumed Objectivity\nshould be rejected because it yields false beliefs, like the belief\nthat women are submissive and object-like by their nature (it is\nepistemically bad) (Haslanger 1993, 108–115). \n\nLangton agrees with Haslanger that, under conditions of social\nhierarchy, the norm of Assumed Objectivity is problematic and therefore\nshould be rejected. Her reasons are twofold: First of all, (as\nHaslanger also noted) because it yields false beliefs; beliefs which do\nnot fit the world at all, like the belief that women are object-like by\nnature. Secondly, because it yields true but unjustified\nbeliefs, beliefs that are true “for the wrong reasons”\n(Langton 1993, 383); for example, the belief that women are actually\nsubmissive and object-like. The belief is unjustified, according to\nLangton, because of its direction of fit. In this case, Langton\nexplains, instead of men arranging their belief to fit the world, the\nworld arranges itself to fit the belief of men. Those people who occupy\na position of power and pursue the norm of Assumed Objectivity will\nmake the world conform to their belief (Langton 1993, 383). \n\nLangton explains that objectivity is about the ways in\nwhich the mind conforms to the world (the way in which our beliefs\narrange themselves to fit the world). When someone is objective, his or\nher beliefs have the right direction of fit: the beliefs are arranged\nin order to fit the way the world is. Objectification, on the\nother hand, is about the ways in which the world conforms to mind\n(conforms to our beliefs). An objectifier’s beliefs have the\nwrong direction of fit: the objectifier arranges the world in order to\nfit his or her beliefs, which are influenced by his or her desires,\ninstead of arranging his or her beliefs to fit the way the world\nactually is. Objectification, then, is a process in which the social\nworld comes to be shaped by desire and belief. An objectifier thinks\nthat her or his beliefs have come to fit the world, where in fact the\nworld has come to fit her or his beliefs. \n\nWhen it comes to the objectification of women, Langton explains that\nwomen become submissive and object-like because of men’s desires and\nbeliefs. Men desire women to be this way, and, if they have power,\nthey force women to become this way. Following the norm of Assumed\nObjectivity, then, men form the belief that women are in fact\nsubmissive and object-like, and also that women are like that due to\ntheir nature. So, when it comes to women’s objectification, the world\nconforms to men’s minds. Men’s beliefs, however, have the wrong\ndirection of fit because men arrange the world to fit their beliefs\nand desires about women being submissive and object-like. The norm of\nAssumed Objectivity, then, yields the belief that women are submissive\nand object-like, which is true but has the wrong direction of fit\n(Langton 2000, 138–142), along with the false belief that women\nare naturally this way. (For a further discussion about beliefs with\nan anomalous direction of fit, as well as a discussion of the\nmechanisms that are responsible for generating them, see also\nLangton’s work on ‘projection’ and its role in women’s\nobjectification in her 2004 article “Projection and\nObjectification”. For a criticism of Langton’s argument that the\nnorm of Assumed Objectivity is responsible for yielding beliefs that\nare true but have a wrong direction of fit, see Papadaki 2008.) \n\nSo far, we have looked at various concerns regarding the wrongness\ninvolved in objectification. A number of thinkers, however, have\nchallenged the idea that objectification is always morally\nproblematic. \n\nAlan Soble questions the widely held Kantian view according to which\nhuman dignity is something that people have. He argues that\nobjectification is not inappropriate. Everyone is already only an\nobject and being only an object is not necessarily a bad thing. In one\nsense, then, no one can be objectified because no one has the higher\nontological status that is required to be reduce-able by\nobjectification. In another sense, everyone is vulnerable to\nobjectification, and everyone can and may be objectified, because to\ndo so is to take them to their correct ontological level. He writes: In the case of pornography, then, there is nothing wrong, according\nto Soble, with treating pornographic actors and models as objects for\nsexual pleasure and deny their humanity. That is because there is no\nnegative objectification that needs to be taken into moral\naccount. Soble adds that pornography’s task is in fact a good one;\npornography takes these people (both men and women), who according to\nhim are good at sex, and makes sure that they do something with their\nlives (Soble 2002b). \n\nLeslie Green is another thinker who argues that it is permissible and\nalso required to treat people as objects. As Green explains, people\nare embodied, extended in space, they exist in time, and they are\nsubject to the laws of nature. People, however, are clearly more than\nobjects. What is problematic therefore, according to Green, is to\ntreat a person merely as an object, merely as a means to\none’s own ends. We can treat other people as means only if we at the\nsame time respect their integrity as agents with their own purposes\n(Green 2000, 44). \n\nGreen points to Kant’s Categorical Imperative, according to which the\nprohibition is against treating a person merely as\nmeans, and not at the same time as an end. As Green emphasises,\nthere is no prohibition against treating a person as a means\n(as an instrument) (Green 2000, 44). In fact, Green holds, “we\nmust treat others as instruments, for we need their skills, their\ncompany, and their bodies—in fact, there is little that we\nsocial creatures can do on our own, and so little that is\nfulfilling” (Green 2000, 45–6). According to Green, when\npeople are old, severely disabled, or chronically unemployed what they\nfear the most is that they no longer are of use to others. As Green\nputs it, “they miss not only their diminished agency, but also\ntheir diminished objectivity. … They become\n… subjectified” (Green 2000, 46). \n\nMartha Nussbaum too aims to challenge the widely-held idea that\nobjectification is inconsistent with respect for a person’s\nhumanity. She offers a systematic analysis of objectification, a\nconcept not at all easy to define and one that writers on the topic\nhave not sufficiently clarified, as she acknowledges (Nussbaum 1995,\n251). \n\nObjectification, for Nussbaum is the seeing and/or treating a person\nas an object; it involves treating one thing as another: one is\ntreating as an object what in fact is not an object, but a human being\n(Nussbaum 1995, 256–7). Nussbaum, then, disagrees with Green’s\nview that people are partly objects. According to Nussbaum, there are\nseven features involved in the idea of objectification:\ninstrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility,\nviolability, ownership, denial of subjectivity. A detailed exposition\nof these seven features is provided in the introduction of this\nentry. \n\nAccording to Nussbaum, a person is objectified when they are seen\nand/or treated in one or more of the above seven\nways. Instrumentality, then, Nussbaum points out, the core notion of\nKant’s, MacKinnon’s, Dworkin’s, as well as Green’s conceptions of\nobjectification, is only one of the ways a person can be treated as an\nobject. (Nussbaum does believe, however, that, among these seven\nnotions, instrumentality is especially problematic, and is often\nlinked to other forms of objectification (Nussbaum 1995,\n265)). Nussbaum’s conception of objectification, then, is broader than\nKant/MacKinnon/Dworkin’s because objectification for Nussbaum is not\nmerely defined in terms of instrumentalisation, and also because it\ncan take place when a person is only seen, but not treated,\nas an object (seen in one or more of the above seven ways that she\nmentions). \n\nAccording to Nussbaum, objectification need not have devastating\nconsequences to a person’s humanity. In fact, Nussbaum criticises\nMacKinnon and Dworkin for conceiving of objectification as a\nnecessarily negative phenomenon (Nussbaum 1995, 273). Nussbaum\nbelieves that it is possible that “some features of\nobjectification… may in fact in some circumstances… be\neven wonderful features of sexual life”, and so “the term\nobjectification can also be used… in a more positive\nspirit. Seeing this will require … seeing how the allegedly\nimpossible combination between (a form of) objectification and\nequality, respect, and consent might after all be\npossible” (Nussbaum 1995, 251). \n\nAccording to Nussbaum, then: “In the matter of objectification\ncontext is everything. … in many if not all cases, the\ndifference between an objectionable and a benign use of\nobjectification will be made by the overall context of the human\nrelationship” (Nussbaum 1995, 271); “… objectification has\nfeatures that may be either good or bad, depending upon the overall\ncontext” (Nussbaum 1995, 251). Objectification\nis negative, when it takes place in a context where equality,\nrespect and consent are absent. Among the negative objectification\ncases she discusses in her article are Hankinson’s Isabelle and\nVeronique, the magazine Playboy, and James’s The\nGolden Bowl. And it is benign/positive, when it is\ncompatible with equality, respect and consent. Nussbaum gives an\nexample of benign objectification: “If I am lying around with my\nlover on the bed, and use his stomach as a pillow there seems to be\nnothing at all baneful about this, provided that I do so with his\nconsent (or, if he is asleep, with a reasonable belief that he would\nnot mind), and without causing him pain, provided as well, that I do\nso in the context of a relationship in which he is generally treated\nas more than a pillow” (Nussbaum 1995, 265). \n\nNussbaum believes that ‘Lawrentian objectification’\n(objectification occurring between the lovers in D. H. Lawrence’s\nnovels) is a clear example of positive objectification. The passage\nfrom Lady Chatterley’s Lover that she quotes in her article\ndescribes a sex scene between two lovers. Connie and Mellors, in a\ncontext characterised by rough social equality and respect, identify\neach other with their body parts, they “… put aside their\nindividuality and become identified with their bodily organs. They see\none another in terms of those organs” (Nussbaum 1995,\n275). Consequently, the two lovers deny each other’s autonomy and\nsubjectivity, when engaging in the sex act. \n\nHowever, Nussbaum explains, “when there is loss of autonomy in\nsex, the context is… one in which on the whole, autonomy is\nrespected and promoted. … Again, when there is loss of\nsubjectivity in the moment of lovemaking, this can be and frequently\nis accompanied by an intense concern for the subjectivity of the\npartner at other moments…” (Nussbaum 1995,\n274–6). As Nussbaum also emphasises in her latest essay on\nobjectification, a person’s “chosen resignation of autonomous\nself-direction, or her willed passivity may be compatible with, and\neven a valued part of, a relationship in which the woman is treated as\nan end for her own sake… as a full fledged human being”\n(Nussbaum 2007, 51). Furthermore, Connie and Mellors do not treat each\nother merely as means for their purposes, according to Nussbaum. Even\nthough they treat each other as tools for sexual pleasure, they\ngenerally regard each other as more than that. The two lovers, then,\nare equal and they treat one another as objects in a way that is\nconsistent with respecting each other as human beings. \n\nNussbaum’s list of the seven features involved in objectification and\nthe relations that exist between them provides perhaps the most\nsystematic analysis of the concept of objectification to date. But\nPapadaki has argued that Nussbaum’s conception is too broad (Papadaki\n2010a). A person is objectified, according to Nussbaum, if they are\nseen and/or treated as an object (in one or more of the seven ways\nthat she mentions). If every time a person is treated (or merely seen)\nby another, say, as an instrument (not a mere instrument) for\nsome further purpose, we take it that the person in question is\nobjectified, then it seems that in our daily lives we objectify nearly\neveryone, including ourselves. Inevitably, we use each other and\nourselves instrumentally all the time (for instance, I use a taxi\ndriver as a means to get to my destination, I use myself as a means to\nprepare a meal, etc). Papadaki argues that if objectification is to be\na meaningful concept, we need to restrict it. Halwani is also in favor\nof a narrower conception of objectification. He argues that we are\nbetter off with a definition of objectification that includes\n“only treatment or behavior towards someone”. According to\nthis view, if someone merely sees or regards another in a sexual way,\nthere is no objectification. Such a definition, Halwani suggests,\n“…is less cluttered and more accurately reflects the\nproblem with objectification: its impact on the objectified (often\nthought as victims)” (Halwani 2008, 342 and Halwani\n2010, 187–8). He believes that we are better off arguing that,\nin Nussbaum’s positive objectification cases, there is no\nobjectification to begin with. This is better than “engaging in\nmental gymnastics to try to show that there is objectification but\nthat it is okay or good” (Halwani 2010, 197). Nussbaum herself\nseems to be concerned, at times, about her objectification category\nbeing too inclusive. For example, she states that sometimes we do not\ntreat the occurrence of only one of the seven notions on her list as\nsufficient for objectification (Nussbaum 1995, 258). However, Papadaki\nsuggests, she does not give us enough guidance as to how we can decide\nwhether objectification is present when a person is treated in one of\nthe seven ways she mentions. In addition, she suggests that once\nobjectification’s association with the morally problematic is\nweakened, there is the risk that the fight against (negative)\nobjectification might be undermined (Papadaki 2010a, 27–31). \n\nRecently, Nancy Bauer has expressed scepticism regarding the\npossibility of laying out a set of criteria for what counts as sexual\nobjectification. She argues that it is difficult to specify the marks\nand features of a term that plays a normative role in our mutually\nshared worldview. And if the term in question is important to my\noutlook, but not yours, she claims that it is impossible for me to\nspecify criteria for the term’s application that pick out the\nphenomenon from your point of view. She writes: “If the\nterm ‘sexual objectification’ is critical in helping you make\nsense of the world as you see it, then, more or less, you will know\nsexual objectification when you see it. … Insofar as the\nphilosophical literature sets out to delineate the marks and features\nof sexual objectification, it is bound not only to fail but to miss\nthe very phenomenon it seeks to illuminate” (Bauer 2015,\npart I). \n\nRegarding the feminist concept of sexual objectification, Bauer\nexplains that it was coined as part of a feminist shift in how to\nunderstand the world and one’s experience in it. According to the\nshift in question, in a context in which women experience widespread,\nsystematic, diachronic, and structural disadvantages, certain ways of\nperceiving and representing women tend to cause them material and\npsychological harm. Bauer argues that once someone participates in\nthis shift, the term ‘sexual objectification’ will\n‘light up’ the relevant phenomena, and the person in\nquestion will see objectification everywhere she looks in contemporary\nculture. This is the case even if she is not in a position to specify\nexactly its marks and features. Bauer explains that\n‘lighting up’ in certain cases may take the form of a\nconversion experience that consists in our seeing things that we did\nnot see before. For Bauer, the metaphor of ‘lighting up’\nis crucial in thinking about sexual objectification and other terms\nthat make sense only in a context of a systematic normative way of\nunderstanding the world (what she calls a ‘worldview’\n(Bauer, forthcoming, part II)).  Undoubtedly, objectification is a concept difficult to define, as\nNussbaum also acknowledges, since it turns out to be\n‘slippery’ and ‘multiple’ (Nussbaum 1995,\n251). How to best to define objectification, if we can\ndefine it at all, and whether this notion should be restricted to\ndescribe the morally objectionable, or expanded to cover benign and/or\npositive aspects of the way we see and treat each other in our daily\nlives is an ongoing debate. Much recent feminist work has been devoted\nto comprehensive philosophical analyses of objectification, which will\nhopefully lead to more complete and coherent understandings of this\nnotion.","contact.mail":"lina_papadaki@yahoo.com","contact.domain":"yahoo.com"}]
