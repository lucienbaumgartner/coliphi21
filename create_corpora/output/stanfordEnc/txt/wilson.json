Although trained as a\nclassicist and a mathematician, his most important contribution was to\nthe theory of knowledge, where he argued that knowledge is factive and\nnot definable in terms of belief, and he criticized ‘hybrid’ and\n‘externalist’ accounts. He also argued for direct realism\nin perception, criticizing both empiricism and idealism, and argued for\na moderate nominalist view of universals as being in rebus and\nonly ‘apprehended’ by their particulars. His influence\nhelped swaying Oxford away from idealism and, through figures such as\nH. A. Prichard, Gilbert Ryle, or J. L. Austin, his ideas were also to\nsome extent at the origin of ‘moral intuitionism’ and\n‘ordinary language philosophy’ which defined much of Oxford\nphilosophy until the second half of the twentieth-century.\nNevertheless, his name and legacy were all but forgotten for\ngenerations after World War II. Still, his views on knowledge are with\nus today, being in part at work in the writings of philosophers as\ndiverse as John McDowell, Charles Travis, and Timothy Williamson.\n\n\n\nDetails about the life of John Cook Wilson, or ‘Cook\nWilson’ as he is commonly called, may be found in a memoir\npublished in 1926 by his pupil A. S. L. Farquharson, in his edition of\nCook Wilson’s posthumous writings entitled Statement and Inference\nwith other Philosophical Papers, hereafter: SI (SI,\nxii–lxiv). He was born in Nottingham on June 6, 1849, the son of\na Methodist minister. Educated at Derby Grammar School, he went up to\nBalliol College in 1868, elected on an exhibition set up by Benjamin\nJowett for students from less privileged schools. At Balliol, Cook\nWilson read classics and mathematics but he also studied philosophy\nwith Jowett and T. H. Green, who steered him towards Kant and idealism\n(SI, 880), along with other students from his generation, such as\nBernard Bosanquet, F. H. Bradley, Richard Lewis Nettleship, and\nWilliam Wallace. Cook Wilson even went to Göttingen in\n1873–74 to attend lectures by H. R. Lotze (SI, xxvii), whose\nportrait he kept in his study. However, he was to write late in his\nlife that “from the first I would not commit myself even to the\nmost attractive form of idealism, tho’ greatly attracted by it”\n(SI, 815).  Nevertheless, according to Prichard, his move away from\nidealism did not fully take place until the early 1900s (Prichard\n1919, 307–310).  Friedrich Ueberweg’s System of Logic and\nHistory of Logical Doctrines (Ueberweg 1871) also figures in Cook\nWilson’s intellectual background, according to Farquharson, as an\nearly ‘realist’ influence (SI, 880). Although Cook\nWilson’s mature philosophy is arguably a continuation of sorts of the\nScottish School of Hutcheson and Reid, there are hardly any references\nto these authors in his writings (see sections 5 and 8, and (Marion\n2009) for an overview of the 19th-century background to Cook\nWilson). \n\nCook Wilson\nwas first elected fellow of Oriel College in 1873 and, in 1889, he\nsucceeded Thomas Fowler as Wykeham Professor of Logic, New College.\nBernard Bosanquet, Thomas Case, and John Venn had been among his\nrivals. He finally moved to New College in 1901, where he remained\nuntil his death from pernicious anemia, on 11 August 1915. He lived\nthe uneventful life of an Oxford don. A Liberal in his convictions (SI,\nxxix), he did not get involved into politics. His most cherished\nextra-curricular activity appears to have been the development of\ntactics for military bicycle units. In his lifetime, he received\nnumerous awards and honours, e.g., becoming fellow of the British\nAcademy in 1907. While in Germany, he had met Charlotte Schneider, who\nwas to become his wife in 1876. They had a son, who emigrated to South\nAfrica. \n\nCook Wilson published little. Setting apart publications on military\ncycling and other incidental writings, the bulk of his publications\nwere in his chosen fields of study, classics and mathematics. In the\nlatter field, he published a strange treatise that arose out of his\nfailed attempt at proving the four-colour theorem, On the\nTraversing of Geometrical Figures (TGF). It had virtually no\necho; Farquharson quoted the mathematician E. W. Hobson explaining\nthat Cook Wilson “hardly gave sufficient time and thought to the\nsubject to make himself really conversant with the modern aspects of\nthe underlying problems” (SI, xxxviii). Otherwise, his\nmathematical endeavours were largely wasted on trying to prove the\ninconsistency of non-Euclidean geometries, because of his claim that\nhe ‘knows’ or has ‘apprehended’ the truth of\nEuclid’s axiom of the parallels (see section 4). Cook Wilson’s work on\nprobability was more significant. He published two short papers on\nprobability (IP, PBT), where he gave what amounts, according to Ysidro\nEdgeworth (Edgeworth 1911, § 13, n.10), to a new proof of the\ndiscrete Bayes’ formula, and his philosophical views on probability\n(SI, §§322–6) were a fundamental influence on William\nKneale’s Probability and Induction (Kneale 1949). \n\nIn Ancient philosophy, Cook\nWilson contributed regularly to scholarly journals such as\nClassical Review, Classical Quarterly,\nTransactions of the Oxford Philological Society, and\nPhilologische Rundschau, and he published studies on the\nstructure of seventh book of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics\n(AS) and on Plato’s Timaeus (IPT). His main claim\nconcerning Nicomachean Ethics was that the seventh book\ncontained traces of three versions probably written by some\nPeripatetic later than Eudemus —but in a postscript to the\nrevised version (1912), he claimed that the variants were probably\ndifferent drafts written by Aristotle himself—, while his\npamphlet on the Timaeus was mainly polemical, painstakingly\ndetailing R. D. Archer-Hind’s ‘obligations’, in his 1888\nedition of the Timaeus, to earlier authors, J. G. Stallbaum more than any other. Cook\nWilson is mainly remembered today for two small contributions to Plato\nscholarship: first, for his interpretation, in ‘On the Platonist\nDoctrine of the assumbletoi arithmoi’ (OPD), of Plato’s\ndoctrine of ‘unaddible numbers’, presented\nin Nicomachean Ethics I, vi and Metaphysics M, vi\nwhich he interpreted as meaning that numbers are universals, e.g.,\nthat ‘3’ stands for ‘3-ness’ as apprehended in\nany particular group of 3, and therefore not magnitudes that could be\nadded, so that arithmetic is only about particulars (OPD, 249–250; SI,\n350). One should note Cook Wilson’s peculiar form of argument, as he\nclaims that the ordinary language locution ‘The number 3’\nconfirms his view. (See the next section for the role of ordinary\nlanguage in his philosophy.) This interpretation was, as was to be\nexpected, influential within Oxford. For example, see (Joseph 148, 33), but there was also a debate over his objections to\nthe intermediate entities of Metaphysics A, vi, 987b\n(OPD, 258) in Ross 1924 (liii–lvii) and Hardie 1936 (chap. vi). Cook Wilson’s view\nremains controversial, although it was praised more recently by\nReginald Allen as the ‘true view of Plato’s\narithmetic’(Allen 1983, 231-233). As will be discussed in\nsection 7, Cook Wilson also thought erroneously that he could use this\nview to criticize modern definitions of numbers. \n\nSecondly, Cook Wilson provided in ‘On the Geometrical Problem in\nPlato’s Meno, 86e sqq.’ (GPP) a key addition to\nS. H. Butcher’s clarification of the notoriously obscure geometrical\nillustration of Meno 86e-87b, showing that Plato did not\nintend to offer an actual solution to the problem of the inscription\nof an area as a triangle within a circle, but rather, alluding to the\nmethod of analysis, to determine the possibility of its solution. (See\n(Wolfsdorf 2008, 164–169); a similar explanation of that passage\nwas provided at the time in (Heath 1921, 298–303) and (Farquharson\n1923); the more recent and authoritative (Knorr 1986, 71–74) and\n(Menn 2002, 209–214) defend this interpretation without mention\nof Cook Wilson.) Finally, one can clearly discern Cook Wilson’s views\non knowledge (see section 4) in H. W. B. Joseph’s Knowledge and\nthe Good in Plato’s Republic (Joseph 1948) and R. C. Cross and\nA. D. Woozley, Plato’s Republic. A Philosophical Commentary\n(Cross & Woozley 1964, chap. 8). Apart from these, Cook Wilson’s\nimpact seems to have been limited to minor points of philology. (For\nexamples of these, see the references to his critical comments on\nApelt’s edition of De Melisso Xenophane Gorgia (APT) in\n(Kerferd 1955), the references to his pamphlet on the Timaeus\nin A. E. Taylor’s and F. M. Cornford’s own commentaries of that\ndialogue, or the critical discussion of Cook Wilson’s views in Sir\nDavid Ross’ edition of Aristotle’s Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics (Ross 1949, 496–497).) \n\nCook Wilson published very little else in philosophy: his inaugural\nlecture On an Evolutionist Theory of the Axioms (ETA) and a\nvery short piece in Mind as part of a debate with Lewis\nCarroll on the ‘Barber-Shop paradox’. This paradox, not to\nbe confused with the ‘Barber’s paradox’, is usually\nattributed to Carroll, who first published about it (Carroll 1894),\nbut it should really be attributed to Cook Wilson. (See CLP for his\nattempt at a solution, Moktefi 2007 for issues concerning\nattribution, and Marion & Moktefi 2014 for a discussion of their\nrespective views on symbolic logic.) See also section 7 for Cook\nWilson’s reaction to Carroll’s paradox of inference (Carroll\n1895).) \n\nCook Wilson’s\nreluctance to publish was partly caused by the fact that he constantly\nkept revising his views and reached a more or less stable viewpoint\nonly late in life. One of his better-known sayings is that “the\n(printed) letter killeth, and it is extraordinary how it will prevent\nthe acutest from exercising their wonted clearness of vision”\n(SI, 872)—see also Collingwood (2013, 19–20). His argument was\nthat authors that have committed to print their views on a given issue\nwould more often than not, should their views prove to be erroneous,\nfeel obliged to defend them and to engage in pointless rhetorical\nexchanges instead of seeing immediately the validity of arguments\nagainst them. As a result, Cook Wilson resorted throughout his career\nto the printing for private circulation of pamphlets, known as\nDictata, which he began revising for publication shortly\nbefore he died in 1915. Only 11 years later did the two volumes of\nStatement and Inference appear, put together by Farquharson\nfrom his lecture notes and Dictata along with some letters.\nThese volumes are subdivided in five parts and 582 sections. Their\nstructure betrays their origin in Cook Wilson’s lectures in logic and\nin the theory of knowledge; also interspersed are texts that originate\nfrom his study and lectures on Plato and Aristotle. \n\nAs the\nchronological table of the various sections shows (SI, 888–9), the\ntexts thus assembled were written at different dates and, in light of\nCook Wilson’s frequent change of mind (including his move away\nfrom idealism), they express views that are at times almost\ncontradictory. This makes any study of his philosophy particularly\ndifficult, and more often than not accounts of his views are influenced\nby those, equally important, of his pupil H. A. Prichard. \n\nSince he published\nso little, it is therefore mainly through teaching and personal contact that\nCook Wilson made a significant impact on Oxford philosophy. He might\nvery well have been at the origin of the peculiar tutorials style to\nwhich generations of Greats students were subjected. He also initiated\nmeetings that were to become the ‘Philosophers’ Teas’\nunder Prichard’s tutelage, the ‘Wee Teas’ under\nRyle’s, and the celebrated ‘Saturday Mornings’, under\nAustin’s ; ‘ordinary language philosophy’ is said to\nhave emerged from the latter. In his obituary, H. W. B. Joseph\ndescribed Cook Wilson as being “by far the most influential\nphilosophical teacher in Oxford”, adding that no one “had\nheld a place so important” since T. H. Green (Joseph 1916b, 555).\nR. G. Collingwood, who reverted to idealism later on, G.\nDawes Hicks, H. W. B. Joseph, H. A. Prichard, W. D. Ross and\nC. C. J. Webb are among his better-known pupils at the turn of the\ncentury. The volumes of Statement and Inference, which\nappeared in 1926, and the teaching of Joseph and Prichard were to\ninfluence further generations of philosophers in the 1920s and 1930s,\nfrom G. Ryle and H. H. Price to J. L. Austin and J. O. Urmson. \n\nCook Wilson’s philosophy being largely forgotten for most of the\n20th century, the secondary literature can be quickly\nreviewed. There exist only one, rather dated, book-length commentary\nof Statement and Inference, Richard Robinson’s The\nProvince of Logic (Robinson 1931), and, from the same period, a\nhandful of papers, not all of equal value, specifically discussing its\ncontent, e.g., Foster (1931), Furlong (1941), Lloyd Beck (1931),\nRobinson (1928a, 1928b). Of the more recent papers, Marion (2000)\ngives an overview of Oxford Realism, Marion (2011) provides a contrast\nwith Austin’s and Wittgenstein’s critique of ‘sense data’,\nand Kalderon & Travis (2013) provides a useful and thorough\ndiscussion of the Oxford Realists on knowledge and perception in\nrelation both to Frege and to further developments in the\n20th century (mainly with Austin, Hinton (1973) and\nMcDowell), while Beaney (2013) provides a critical review of\nCollingwood’s objections to Cook Wilson and Oxford Realism in\ngeneral. \n\nCook Wilson believed that in philosophy, one must above all\n“uncompromisingly […] to try to find out what a given\nactivity of thought presupposes as implicit or explicit in our\nconsciousness”, i.e., to “try to get at the facts of\nconsciousness and not let them be overlaid as is so commonly done with\npreconceived theories” (SI, 328). By ‘preconceived\ntheories’, Cook Wilson meant the sort of systematic\nphilosophizing or ‘reflective thought’, as he called it,\nwhich was prevalent in his days and that one finds in, say, the works\nof Bradley and the British idealists, but also, earlier, the\nempiricists. According to him, ‘reflective thought’ had two\nmajor defects: it is based on principles that, for all we know, might\nbe false and, concomitantly, it is too abstract, because it is hardly\nbased on the consideration of particular concrete examples. Indeed, in\na passage where he criticized Bradley’s infamous infinite regress\nargument against the reality of relations (Bradley 1897, \n28), Cook Wilson begins by pointing out that “throughout this\nchapter there is not a single illustration, though it is of the last\nimportance that there should be” (SI, 692)—on the critique\nof Bradley, see also Joseph (1916a, 37). As H. H. Price put it\nlater, for Cook Wilson and his epigones “to philosophize without\ninstances would be merely a waste of time” (Price 1947, 336).\nThis attitude was also found, on the Continent, in the\nBrentano School and was to become characteristic of ‘ordinary language philosophy’. \n\nFurthermore, Cook\nWilson thought that philosophers are most likely to introduce\ndistinctions of their own that do not correspond to the ‘facts of\nconsciousness’ and thus distort our understanding of them. He\ntherefore strove to uncover ‘facts of consciousness’\nthrough an analysis of concrete examples which would be free of\nphilosophical jargon. This is strongly reminiscent of descriptive\npsychology of the Brentano School. As a matter of fact, Gilbert Ryle,\nwho described himself as a “fidgetty Cook Wilsonian” (Ryle\n1993, 106), but who was also one rare Oxonian who knew something\nabout phenomenology in the 1920s, believed Cook Wilson’s\ndescriptive analyses to be as good as any from Husserl (Ryle 1971, vol.\nI, 176 & 203n.). \n\nIf philosophical\njargon is not to be trusted, ordinary language is a safer guide: \n\nIt is safer because distinctions found in ordinary language are\n“more likely to be right than wrong” (SI,\n874)—albeit not always, see, e.g., (SI, 35)—mainly because\n“they are not the issue of any system, they were not invented by\nany one” and they were developed “in what may be called\nthe natural course of thinking, under the influence of experience and\nin the apprehension of particular truths” (SI,\n874). Furthermore, “reflective thought tends to be too abstract,\nwhile experience which has developed the popular distinctions recorded\nin language is always in contact with the particular facts” (SI,\n875). Cook Wilson, therefore, considered it “repugnant to create\na technical term out of all relation to ordinary language” (SI,\n713), and he particularly disliked the tendency to unearth some\nconcept in Greek philosophy in order to introduce a new technical\nterm. \n\nThus, Cook Wilson\nappealed to ordinary language almost every other page in Statement\nand Inference. For example, he argued in support of his views on\nuniversals (see section 6) that “ordinary language reflects\nfaithfully a true metaphysics of universals” (SI, 208). But he\ndid not merely appeal to ordinary language in order to undermine\nphilosophical distinctions, he did it also in a constructive way. For\nexample, when distinguishing between the activity of thinking and\n‘what we think’, i.e., between ‘act’\nand ‘content’ (SI, 63–64), he argued that this is\n“likely to be right” because “it is the natural and\nuniversal mode of expression in ordinary untechnical language, ancient\nand modern” (SI, 67) and “it comes from the very way of\nspeaking which is natural and habitual with those who do not believe in\nany form of idealism” (SI, 64). \n\nThese views were to\nprove particularly influential in the case of J. L. Austin, who began\nhis studies at Oxford four years after the publication of Statement\nand Inference. It is a common mistake to think of Wittgenstein as\nhaving had some formative influence on Austin, as he was arguably the\nleast influenced by Wittgenstein of the Oxford philosophers (Hacker\n1996, 172). The philosophy of G. E. Moore notwithstanding, it is\nrather Cook Wilson and epigones such as Prichard that are the source of\nthe peculiar brand of ‘analytical philosophy’ that was to\ntake root in Oxford in the 1930s, known as ‘Oxford\nphilosophy’ or ‘ordinary language philosophy’. One\nmerely needs here to recall the following well-known passage from\nAustin’s ‘A Plea for Excuses’, which is almost a\nparaphrase of Cook Wilson: \n\nThe influence of Cook Wilson on Austin extends much further,\nincluding on the analysis of knowledge (see section 4). \n\nSince Cook Wilson’s philosophy was largely defined in\nopposition to British Idealism, it is worth beginning with some point\nof explicit disagreement. Roughly put, under the idealist view\nknowledge is constituted by a coherent set of mutually supporting\nbeliefs, none of which are basic, while others would be derivative.\nCook Wilson did not argue directly against the coherence theory, as\nRussell was famously to do (Russell 1910, 131–146), but took\ninstead the opposite, foundationalist stance. Surprisingly, when H. H.\nJoachim published The Nature of Truth (1906), one of\nCook Wilson’s criticisms was that he was relying on a discredited\n‘correspondence’ theory (SI, 809–810). His\nfoundationalism has this interesting particularity that he rejected the\nunderlying thesis that knowledge is to be defined in terms of belief,\ntogether with one or more additional properties such as\n‘justified’ and ‘true’ (see section 4). He\nreasoned that, if one believes on evidence, the latter may itself be\nbelief, but this chain of justification ought to come to an end, and\nthat this end point is some non-derivative knowledge, which he called\nafter 1906 ‘apprehension’ (SI, 816). As he put it:\n“it becomes evident that there must be apprehensions not got by\ninference or reasoning” (LL, § 18).\nUnfortunately, Cook Wilson did not define his key notion of\n‘apprehension’ (SL, 78 n.), which appears to be at the\nsame time close to Aristotle’s ‘noesis’ and to\nRussell’s ‘acquaintance’. Cook Wilson obviously took\nhis lead from Posterior Analytics but his comments are also\nreminiscent of Thomas Reid, who argues in his Essays on the\nIntellectual Powers of Man (Bk. II, chap. v) that perception\ninvolves some conception of the object and the conviction of its\nexistence, this conviction being immediate, non-inferential, and,\nfollowing Posterior Analytics (Book II, § 19), not open\nto doubt. Cook Wilson was not exactly faithful to Aristotle and Reid,\nhowever, since he argued that apprehensions can be both perceptual and\nnon-perceptual (SI, 79), and that some are obtained by inference\nwhile some are not, the latter being the material of inference (SI,\n84–85). Furthermore, he argued that perceptual apprehensions should not\nbe confused with sensations, as the mere having of a sensation is not\nyet to know what the sensation is. For this, one needs an\n“originative act of consciousness” that goes beyond mere\npassivity and compares it in order to apprehend its definite character.\nAs Cook Wilson put it: “we are really comparing but we do not\nrecognize that we are” (SI, 46). \n\nIn one of his\npolemics against idealism, Cook Wilson’s main target was the\ntraditional theory of judgement that one finds, for example, in\nBradley’s Principles of Logic (Bradley 1928), where the\ntopic is simply divided into ‘judgement’ and\n‘inference’. Cook Wilson thought it misleading to base\nlogic on judgement instead of proposition or statement (SI, 94), as\none is misled, he argues, by the common verbal form: there is no common\nform of thinking called ‘judgement’ which would include\nnon-inferred knowledge, opinion, and belief, but would exclude inferred\nknowledge. (Cook Wilson often talks in this context of\n‘activities of consciousness’, as opposed to ‘forms\nof consciousness’ or ‘frames of mind’, but the view is perhaps better stated in the\ncontemporary terminology of ‘mental states’. Cook\nWilson’s language will be retained here.) He thus argued first\nthat inferring is one of the forms of judgement: “if we take\njudging in its most natural sense, that is as decision on evidence\nafter deliberation, then inferring is just one of those form of\napprehending to which the words judging and judgement most properly\napply” (SI, 86). Some inferences are, however, immediately\napprehended, e.g., when one recognizes that it follows from ‘if\np, then q’ and ‘p’, that\n‘q’. \n\nStill working with\nthis ‘judicial’ definition of judgement, Cook Wilson\nfurther criticized the idealists for also thinking that judgement is a\ncommon form which includes knowledge, opinion, and belief (SI,\n86–7). The notion of judgement one finds in logic books being thus a\nfabricated one, Cook Wilson claimed instead to follow ‘ordinary\nusage’ in stating that \n\nTherefore, the presence of a prior indecision or doubt, as opposed\nto confidence, is deemed an essential ingredient of judgement. However,\njudgement does not fully put an end to doubt: as a judge may well be\nmistaken, our ordinary judgements “form fallible opinions\nonly” (Joseph 1916a, 160). Now, if indecision and doubt are\ninvolved prior to judgement, apprehension or knowledge (perceptual or\nnot) could not be not judgement, because, by definition, there is no\nroom for doubt. \n\nMoreover, it is an\nimportant characteristic of ‘believing’, setting it apart\nfrom other ‘activities of consciousness’, that it is\naccompanied with a feeling of confidence. For example, when I open the\ndoor of my office, I confidently expect to find my desk, books, etc.\nand not an empty room or just a whole in the floor, into which I plunge\naccidentally. This characteristic sets belief apart from judgement: \n\nStatements of opinion are said not to be the expression of a\ndecision, so they not judgement either, even though\n‘opining’ is here conceived of as a form of decision: \n\nCook Wilson held\nthe view that knowledge, in the form of\n‘apprehension’, was presupposed by other ‘activities\nof thinking’ such as judging and opining. For example, opinion\ninvolves knowledge, but goes beyond it: \n\nThe upshot of this set of remarks is that knowledge, belief, and\nopinion are not species of the same genre, judgement. There is in fact\nno highest common factor to these states of mind (see next section);\nthey are all sui generis and irreducible to each other. \n\nCook Wilson believed that “our experience of knowing then\nbeing the presupposition of any inquiry we can undertake, we cannot\nmake knowing itself a subject of inquiry in the sense of asking what\nknowing is” (SI, 39). This leads to his main thesis concerning\nknowledge, namely that it is not definable in terms of something else.\nIn particular, it is not to be defined in terms of belief augmented by some\nother property or properties, as in the traditional view of knowledge\nas ‘justified true belief’. In particular, the difference\nbetween, on the one hand, knowledge and, say, belief or opinion, on the\nother, is not a difference of degree of something such as the feeling\nof confidence, or the amount of supportive evidence: \n\nJ. L. Austin has a nice supporting example in Sense and\nSensibilia, using the fact that ‘seeing that’ is\nfactive: if no pig is in sight, I might accumulate evidence that one\nlives in a given place: buckets of pig food, pig-like marks on the\nground, the smell, etc. But if the pig suddenly appears, “there\nis no longer any question of collecting evidence; its coming into view\ndoesn’t provide me with more evidence that it’s a\npig, I can now just see that it is, the question is\nsettled” (Austin 1962, 115). \n\nBelief is also to be distinguished from knowledge, since one is likely\nto say ‘I believe p’ precisely when one\nrecognizes that one’s grounds for believing p—which may\nbe knowledge, in which case it is clear that knowing entails\nbelieving—are insufficient for one’s knowledge of\np (Prichard 1950, 86f.). So, when one knows, one does not\nbelieve: “Belief is not knowledge and the man who knows does not\nbelieve at all what he knows; he knows it” (SI, 100). It\nfollows immediately from this that a ‘theory’ of knowledge\nis impossible, a consequence first expressed in 1904 by Cook Wilson in\ncorrespondence with Prichard, who was to put forth an analogous\nargument in moral philosophy eight years later (see section 8): \n\nAt the turn of the last century, this view of the primacy of knowledge\nor ‘knowledge first’ was also held by the neo-Kantian\nphilosopher Leonard Nelson (Nelson 1908 & 1949), and by members of\nthe Brentano school, such as Adolf Reinach, Max Scheler, and Edmund\nHusserl. (See (Mulligan 2014) for a survey.) It was to become the\ncentral plank of ‘Oxford Realism’, the movement it\ninspired. For the Oxonians and the Brentanians one knows\nthat p only if one ‘apprehends’\nthat p. As Kevin Mulligan put it: “one knows\nthat p in the strict sense only if one has perceived\nthat p and such perceiving is not itself any sort of belief\nor judging” (Mulligan 2014, 382). The primacy of knowledge is\nstill defended in Oxford today by Timothy Williamson, according to\nwhom knowledge is a mental state “being in which is\nnecessary and sufficient for knowing p”\n(Williamson 2000, 21), and which “cannot be analysed into more\nbasic concepts” (Williamson 2000, 33). The only\ndifference—an important one—is that the concern now\nresides solely with ‘knowledge that p’, not with\n‘apprehending that p’. \n\nThe fact that there\nis no highest common factor to knowledge and belief entails that Cook\nWilson had to reject ‘hybrid’ and ‘externalist’\naccounts of knowledge. Any ‘hybrid’ account would factor\nknowledge into an internal part, possibly a copy of the object known,\nand a relation of that copy to the object itself (on the ‘copy\ntheory’, see section 5). A highest common factor would be a state\nof mind that would, depending on one or more given factors, count as\nknowing, but in absence of these factors, count as something else.\nSince there is no such highest common factor, this view, integral to\n‘externalist’ accounts of knowledge, must be rejected\n(Travis 2005, 287). \n\nInstead, Cook\nWilson argues that, given that knowledge is factive in the sense that\none knows p only if p, an externalist account would\nhave it that for someone to know or to be in error (while thinking that\none knows) would just be undistinguishable states, since it would\ndepend on some factors external to that person: \n\nTherefore, the possibility of undetectable error would, he claims,\nundermine the very possibility of “demonstrative knowledge”\n(SI, 107–108). In other words, if knowledge is factive, then there\nis no such thing as some condition under which one knows p\nerroneously; if not-p, one just does not know p. And\nthe condition under which it might be discovered that one does not know\np cannot be somehow cognitively inaccessible. To put it\nanother way, Cook Wilson is suggesting that knowledge contains its\nobject: “what we apprehend […] is included in the\napprehension as a part of the activity or reality of\napprehending” (SI, 70). \n\nA similar line of\nargument has been used recently by McDowell against the\n‘hybrid’ conception in ‘Criteria, Defeasibility and\nKnowledge’ (McDowell 1998, 374). But Cook Wilson added here a\nfurther thesis, an ‘accretion’ as Charles Travis puts it\n(Travis 2005, 289f.), namely that one is always in a position to\nknow if one knows or if one merely believes: \n\nThis accretion, which was given further emphasis by Prichard\n(Prichard 1950, 86, 88 & 96), amounts to an early statement of\nthe ‘knowing that one knows’ principle. It is related to\nthe problem of the equivalence between ‘i knows that\np’ and ‘i knows that i knows\nthat p’ or Kip and\nKiKip in epistemic logic, first\ndiscussed by Jaakko Hintikka in his seminal book, Knowledge and\nBelief (Hintikka 1962, chap. 5). Hintikka pointed out, however,\nthat Cook Wilson and Prichard merely restricted their remarks to the\ncase where i is taken to be the first-person pronoun\n‘I’ (Hintikka 1962, 110). The accretion is also related\nto Timothy Williamson’s notion of ‘luminosity’: a\ncondition C is said to be ‘luminous’ if and only if for\nevery case a, if in a C obtains then in a\none is in a position to know that C obtains (Williamson 2000, 95).\nHowever, for Williamson, one can know without being in a position to \nknow that one knows, so knowing is not luminous. For Williamson’s\nargument against luminosity, see (Williamson 2000, chap. 4). \n\nA broadly similar conception of knowledge is also at work behind\nrejoinders to the argument from illusion in J. L. Austin’s Sense\nand Sensibilia (Austin 1962) and John McDowell’s ‘Knowledge\nand the Internal’ (McDowell 1998, 395–413).  This is not\nto say that their positions are identical, as there are notable\ndifferences, e.g., when Austin rejects the accretion. (See Travis\n(2005) and Kalderon & Travis (2013) for further discussion.)  In\n‘Other Minds’ (Austin 1979, 76–116), Austin also\nargues anew for the thesis that ‘If I know, I can’t be\nwrong’ (Austin 1979, 79), by pointing out that the claim that\n‘I know that p’ provides a form of warrant for\none’s claim. (See Urmson (1988) for a discussion, in relation to\nPrichard.) \n\nCook Wilson still\nneeds to account from his internalist standpoint for ‘real\nerror’ as opposed to, say, ‘false opinion’. For that\npurpose, he distinguished in some of his most interesting descriptive\nanalyses a further ‘form of consciousness’ which he called\n‘being under the impression that’ (SI, 109–113). A\ntypical example would be when I see the back of Smith on the street and,\n‘being under the impression that’ it is my friend Jones,\nI tap him on the shoulder, only to realize my mistake when he turns\nhis head. As Cook Wilson argues, it won’t do to answer that I\nthought I knew but really did not, because it is not true that I\nthought I knew to begin with (SI, 109–110). This state\nsimulates knowledge because of the absence of doubt, while not being\nthe same as ‘being certain’. Prichard would later speak of\n‘thinking without question’ or ‘taking for\ngranted’ (Prichard 1950, 96–7): \n\nThis notion played a significant role in the writings of the\n‘Oxford Realists’, not just those of Prichard but also\nthose of William Kneale, H. H. Price and J. L. Austin—see, e.g.,\nKneale (1949, 5 & 18), Price (1935), and Austin (1962, 122). In\nhis book on Belief, H. H. Price presented this notion as an\nimportant addition to the traditional ‘occurrence’\nanalysis of belief, as opposed to the then fashionable\n‘dispositional’ analysis (Price 1966, 208–212). It\nwas not, however, without critics. For example, H. P.  Grice put forth\na common objection when he argued that Cook Wilson’s position leaves\n“no room for the possibility of thinking that we know p\nwhen in fact it is not the case that\np”, while the introduction of the state of ‘being\nunder the impression that’ does not solve the problem: “for\nwhat enables us to deny that all of our so-called knowledge is really\nonly ‘taking for granted’?” (Grice 1989,\n383–384). \n\nUnder Cook Wilson’s\nconception, instances of ‘knowledge’ will turn out harder\nto find, mathematics providing the only prima facie cases. As\nPrichard was to put it: “In mathematics we have, without\nreal possibility of question, an instance of knowledge; we are certain,\nwe know” (Prichard 1919, 302). Joseph used the view\nto argue against Mill’s empiricist account of mathematics, using\n‘intuition’ where Cook Wilson would use\n‘apprehension’ (Joseph 1916a, 543–553). Cook Wilson\noffered as an example of his concept of knowledge the axiom of\nparallels in Euclidean geometry. He held it to be “absolutely\nself-evident” (SI, 561), and he believed consequently that the idea of a\nnon-Euclidean space is a “chimera” (SI, 456) and that\nthe various non-Euclidean geometries are “the mere illusion of\nspecialists” (SI, xxxix). He even tried to find a\ncontradiction in them in order to “convince the rank and file of\nmathematicians” so that “they would at least not suppose\nthe philosophic criticism, by which I intended anyhow to attack,\nsomehow wrong” (SI, xcvi). This mistaken attitude greatly\nundermined the credibility of his views about knowledge. If, for any\np, such as the axiom of parallels, some fail to\n‘apprehend’ it, then Cook Wilson could only ask them to try\nand “remove […] whatever confusions or prejudices\n[…] prevent them from apprehending the truth of the disputed\nproposition” (Furlong 1941, 128). Of course, this is no proper\nanswer to, say, David Hilbert, the author of Grundlagen der\nGeometrie (Hilbert 1903). \n\nCook Wilson also argued against idealism that in apprehension it is\nneither the case that the object exists only within the apprehending\nconsciousness, nor that it is constituted by it: it is just independent\nof it. This independence he considered to be presupposed by the very\nidea of knowledge. Arguing from analogy with the case of two bodies\ncolliding, Cook Wilson reasoned that \n\nUnder this view, the object apprehended may or may not be\n‘mental’. This also means that the object apprehended must\nnot be some ‘copy’ of the real object: \n\nPart of Cook Wilson’s rejection of ‘hybrid’ accounts of\nknowledge (see previous section) precisely involved the rejection of\nepistemological ‘intermediaries’, so that knowledge is not\nof some representative or copy, but, in a sense, knowledge contains\nits object. He considered all such\nintermediaries—‘images’,\n‘copies’, tertium quid, or\n‘representatives’—as “not only useless in\nphilosophy but misleading as tending to obscure the solution of a\ndifficult problem” (SI, 772). (In this he stood in the tradition\nof Thomas Reid; his arguments were as a matter of fact developed at\nfirst against the Modern view of Locke and Berkeley, e.g., at (LL,\n§ 10).) Of particular importance here is a long letter (SI,\n764–800) to G. F. Stout, where Cook Wilson provided detailed\ncriticisms of the latter’s ‘Primary and Secondary\nQualities’ (Stout 1904), and in which he wrote: \n\n    You begin an important section of your argument by assuming the idea\n    of sensations being representative. \n\n    They { represent—express—stand for } something other\n    than themselves. \n\n    Now, I venture to think that the idea of such\n    representation in philosophy, or psychology rather, is very\n    loose and treacherous and, if used at all, should be preceded by a\n    ‘critique’ of such representative character, and\n    an explanation of the exact sense in which the word representative is\n    used. (SI, 769) \n\nAgainst views of this kind, Cook Wilson developed three arguments in\nhis letter: first, he pointed out that it is impossible to know\nanything about the relation between the representative and the object,\nsince one can never truly compare the former to the latter. \nSecondly, he claimed that representationalist theories are always in\ndanger of leading towards idealism, since one must then somehow\n‘prove’ the existence of the object which is, so to speak,\n‘behind’ its representatives—there might be none.\nFinally, he claimed that all such theories are begging the question,\nsince the representative has to be apprehended in turn by the mind, and\nnot only this further ‘apprehension’ remains unexplained,\nit would require that the mind be equipped with the very apparatus that\nthe representationalist theories were, to begin with, devised to\nexplain: \n\nCook Wilson also inveighed against Stout’s notion of\n‘sensible extension’ pointing out inter alia that\nit makes no sense to claim that these are extended without being in\nspace (SI, 783) and he tried to explain how a given object may\nappear to have different shapes from different perspectives, without\nmaking an appeal to any representative (SI, 790f.). \n\nAlthough, he never cites Cook Wilson, Stout felt compelled to answer\nhis critique in print. (For a discussion, where Cook Wilson is\nportrayed as an ‘old’ or ‘naïve’ realist,\nsee Nasim (2008, 30–40 & 94–98).) For example, Stout\nargued that he was not holding a view akin to Locke’s\nrepresentationalism, claiming that the ‘representative\nfunction’ of his ‘presentations’ is of a different\nnature, more like a memory-image would represent what is remembered\n(e.g., at (Stout 1911, 14f.)), but it is at first blush unclear what\nhe meant by this.  Against Cook Wilson’s first argument, he claimed\nthat in his conception presentations and presented objects form an\n“inseparable unity” (Stout 1911, 22), this being, once\nmore, unclear. At all events, both Stout and Russell, in his theory of\n‘sense-data’ as ‘objects of perception’\n(Russell 1912), insisted that the physical object and the\nrepresentative are ‘real’ but this\n‘objectification’ of ‘appearing’ as\n‘appearance’, to use Cook Wilson’s language (SI, 796),\ndoes not annul his diagnosis of the difficulties inherent in that\nposition. At least Russell was clearer about its implications,\nrequiring a ‘logical construction’ of physical objects as\nfunctions of ‘sense-data’. One way to counter Cook Wilson\non the absurdity of the locution ‘sensible extensions’ is\nto distinguish between ‘private’ and ‘public’\nspace, as Russell was to do in ‘The Relation of Sense-Data to\nPhysics’ (Russell 1917, 139–171); as it is well-known,\nthis postulation generates its own set of difficulties, e.g., the\ndiscovery that space must have 6 dimensions (Russell 1917, 154).\nRussell’s theory was to become a favourite target for Prichard’s\nacerbic wit in, e.g., Prichard (1915 & 1928). \n\nThere was no\ndoctrinal unity among Cook Wilson’s epigones on this issue. H. H.\nPrice, who was at first close to Cook Wilson (Price 1924), incorporated\na sense-data theory while rejecting phenomenalism in\nPerception (Price 1932); he became for that reason one of J.\nL. Austin’s targets in Sense and Sensibilia (Austin\n1962), which remains, for all its novelty (and the fact that it is\naimed at Moore’s peculiar brand of scepticism more than the\nstandard Cartesian variety), faithful to Cook Wilson’s orthodoxy\non knowledge. Prichard, who was probably the first to put Cook\nWilson’s views into print in ‘Appearances and\nReality’ (Prichard 1906), ended up arguing late in life that we\nreally see only colour expansions, which we systematically mistake for\nor ‘take for granted’ as objects (Prichard 1950,\n52–68). Nevertheless, a form of direct realism in the theory of\nperception remains one of the characteristic features of Oxford Realism\nand its heir, ‘ordinary language philosophy’. It is an\nancestor to contemporary variants such as the position argued for by\nJohn McDowell in Mind and World (McDowell 1994). \n\nCook Wilson also argued against the neo-Kantian (not neo-Hegelian)\nviews of idealists such as T. H. Green, that apprehension has\nno ‘synthetic’ character, i.e., he argued that any synthesis\napprehended is attributed to the object and not the result of an\nactivity of the ‘apprehending mind’. As he put it,\n“in the judgement of knowledge and the act of knowledge in\ngeneral we do not combine our apprehensions, but apprehend a\ncombination” (SI, 279), and it is “the nature of the\nelements themselves” which “determines which unity they\nhave or can have”; the ‘apprehending mind’ has\n“no power whatever to make a complex idea out of simple\nones” (SI, 524). This view implies that universals and\nconnections between them are in rebus and to be apprehended as\nsuch (Price 1947, 336). As was pointed out earlier (section 3),\n‘apprehension’ is, according to Cook Wilson, not mere\n‘sensation’, because in the former one recognizes the\ndefinite character of a sensation, through comparison. So apprehension\nis of the universal in the sensation, albeit not necessarily an\napprehension of it as universal. This conception implies that\nthe universal is “strictly objective” and “not a mere\nthought of ours” (SI, 335). This view, Cook Wilson held as\nbeing in accordance with ordinary language and common sense, if not\npopular among philosophers (SI, 344–345). \n\nThe universal may\nbe a “real unity in objects” (SI, 344), but Cook Wilson\nalso believed that the reality of the universal cannot be separated\nfrom its particulars—which he preferred to call\n‘particularization of the universal’ (SI, 336)—,\nbecause “the particular is not something that has the quality, it\nis the particularized quality” (SI, 713). The view is,\ntherefore, that there is no possible apprehension of the universal\nexcept as particularized: \n\nCook Wilson had already argued for a distinction between subject and\nattribute on the one hand, and subject and predicate on the other;\nthere is a unique ‘logical subject’ but possibly many\n‘subjects of attributes’ for a given statement (SI,\n158–159). His argument was that ‘That building is\nthe Bodleian’ may be the answer to ‘What building is\nthat?’ or ‘Which building is the Bodleian?’ (SI,\n117–120), and that in the statement ‘That building is\nthe Bodleian’, with the italics indicating that it is an answer\nto the second question, ‘that building’ is a subject of\nattributes but not the logical subject (SI, 158). He put this view\nto use to shed doubt on the traditional form, ‘S is\nP’ (SI, 114f.)—see also Joseph (1916a, 6 &\n185). And he proposed that one avoids the misleading term\n‘predicate’ by introducing ‘attributive’ (SI,\n193). He also argued in these passages that the attribution holds\nbetween particulars only, and inferred further that \n\n(For further elaboration on this point, see the beginning of next\nsection.) \n\nThus, one could say that Cook Wilson held a moderate form of nominalism\nabout universals, which is actually rather close to the better-known\nview of G. F. Stout (Stout 1930). Cook Wilson corresponded in\n1903–1904 with Stout, who published his theory of universals\nonly in 1921, and there are reasons to believe that Stout took some of\nhis key ideas from Cook Wilson, e.g., when he reported with approval\nCook Wilson stating that “square shape is not squareness plus\nshape; squareness itself is a special way of being a shape”\n(Stout 1930, 398). Even the term ‘character’, that stands\nfor what are also known in the literature as ‘moments’ or\n‘tropes’, was already Cook Wilson’s. The universal is not,\naccording to Cook Wilson, merely identical in all its particulars, but\nsomething definite, an ‘intrinsic character’ (SI,\n342n. & 351), for which Cook Wilson reluctantly introduced the\ntechnical term ‘characteristic being of the universal’\n(SI, 342). It is this ‘characteristic being’ which we are\nsaid to apprehend, but “neither as universal nor as\nparticularized” (SI, 343). That Cook Wilson’s view prefigured\nStout’s is not generally known, simply because Cook Wilson’s has been\nignored.  (There are but a few notable exceptions, e.g., when\nP. F. Strawson gives to non-relational ties between\nparticulars—e.g., between the particular Socrates and the\nparticular event of his death—the name ‘attributive\nties’ in memory of Cook Wilson (Strawson 1959, 168), or a\nmention of Cook Wilson among early 20th century proponents\nof tropes in the seminal paper ‘Truth-Makers’ by\nK. Mulligan, P. Simons & B.  Smith (Mulligan, Simons & Smith\n1984, 293n.).) \n\nThere are, however,\nsome notable differences with Stout. The ‘characteristic\nbeing’ of an universal is not to be captured in terms of\nsimilarity (SI, 344 & 347), but Cook Wilson did not go so far\nas to introduce here, as Stout was to do, a fundamentum\nrelationis, i.e., the ‘distributive unity of a class’\n(Stout 1930, 388). For he believed that this unity of the universal is\ninexplicable, because the relation between particular and universal,\nalthough fundamental and thus presupposed by any explanation (SI,\n335 & 345), is—again—sui generis,\ntherefore not explicable: “The nature of the universal therefore\nnecessarily and perpetually eludes any attempt to explain itself”\n(SI, 348). His argument was that one could not explain, say,\n‘triangularity’ except by treating it as a particular,\ni.e., putting it in the subject position of a phrase, therefore\nassuming that we could apprehend it in abstraction from any particular,\nwhich is, according to him, impossible. \n\nCook Wilson used his views on statements as attributing particulars\nto particulars as a basis for an attack on mathematical logic, aiming in\nparticular at Russell. His argument appears to be this: when one says\nthat ‘a is a triangle’, one can be construed as\npredicating of a substance a the universal\n‘triangularity’. If, however, one reasons analogously,\nstating that ‘triangularity is an universal’, one would\nthus put the universal ‘triangularity’ in the subject\nposition—the ‘nominative case to the verb’ as he\nquaintly puts it (SI, 349)—thereby treating it as if\nit were a substance, while one would put ‘universal’ in the\npredicate position, thereby implying that there is a ‘universal\nof universals’ or ‘universalness’, of which\nuniversals would be the particulars. But then\n‘universalness’ would be a particular of itself, which is,\nCook Wilson claims, “obviously absurd” (SI, 350).\nTherefore, one is bound to commit a fallacy with such locutions. Cook\nWilson thought that this line of reasoning shows that Russell’s\nparadox of the class of all classes that do not contain themselves\n(Russell 1903, chap. X) is a “mere fallacy of language”\n(SI, cx). He argued at length (SI, §§ 422–32, 477–500\n& 501–18) that there is no more ‘class of classes’ than\n‘universalness’ can be said to be the ‘universal of\nuniversals’ and that it is no more possible for a class to be a\nmember of itself than ‘universalness’ could be a particular\nof itself. Cook Wilson had but contempt for what he called “the\npuerilities of certain paradoxical authors” (SI, 348). He even\nwrote to Bosanquet: \n\nThe problem with Cook Wilson’s argument is that it is based on an\nelementary confusion between membership of a class and inclusion of\nclasses. Peter Geach called Cook Wilson “an execrably bad\nlogician” (Geach 1978, 123) for committing blunders such as\nthis. For a clear statement of this mistake, see SI (733–734).\nGeach also points out another elementary blunder in the exchange of\nletters with Lewis Carroll, when Cook Wilson claimed that it is not\npossible to ‘know’ that ‘Some S\nis P’ without knowing which S it is which\nis P (Carroll 1977, 376). \n\nCook Wilson’s main reason for opposing Russell was simply that logical\ninferences are exhausted by syllogistic, while “mathematical\ninference as such is not syllogistic” (SI, xcvi), but\nhe also believed that his views about universals confirm Plato’s\ndoctrine of ‘unaddible numbers’, which he interpreted as\nmeaning that numbers are universals that could not be added and\ncounted (see section 1) implied that the logicist definition of\nnatural numbers in terms of classes of classes would not be\npossible. As a matter fact, on this view… no account of numbers\nis possible (SI, 342). For the same reasons, Cook Wilson also\ncriticized Richard Dedekind’s definition of continuity\nin Stetigkeit und die irrationale Zahlen (Dedekind 1872),\nwhich he called “a mere fantastic chimera” (SI, 352). (See\nalso (OPD, 250 n 1).) \n\nCook Wilson made no contribution to logic, but some of his remarks\npertaining rather to the philosophy of logic had a life of their own.\nCook Wilson believed that all statements are\n‘categorical’, so he was obliged to explain away\n‘hypothetical judgements’. He did so in claiming that\n“in the hypothetical attitude”, we apprehend “a\nrelation between two problems” (SI, 542–543), in other\nwords that conditionals do not express judgements but connections\nbetween questions. This view was elaborated by Ryle into his\ncontroversial stance on indicative conditionals as\n‘inference-tickets’ in ‘‘If’,\n‘So’, and ‘Because’’ (Ryle 1971,\nvol. II, 234–249). Ryle compared conditionals of the form\n‘If\np, then q’, to “bills for statements\nthat statements could fill” (Ryle 1971, vol. II, 240) and he\nrejected the form ‘If p then q,\nbut p, therefore q’, claiming that in some way\nthe p in the major premise cannot for that reason be the same\nas p asserted by itself. This, of course, runs directly afoul\nof Geach’s celebrated ‘Frege Point’ (Geach 1972). Cook\nWilson also clearly anticipated (SI, 443–444) Ryle’s well-known\nresponse to Carroll’s paradox of inference, according to which a rule\nof inference cannot be implicated as a premise in an inference drawn\naccording to it, on pains of an infinite regress (Ryle 1971, vol. II,\n238). As a matter of fact, Cook Wilson essentially states the paradox\nin this passage; given that it cannot be dated, one cannot tell who\nhas priority, Carroll or Cook Wilson. (For a discussion, see Marion\n(forthcoming).) \n\nApart from these borrowings by Ryle, Cook Wilson might also be said to\nbe the source of P. F. Strawson’s distinctive use of\n‘statement’ in Introduction to Logical Theory\n(1952). Otherwise, only a few of Cook Wilson’s ideas were taken up :\nA. N. Prior appealed to Cook Wilson’s defence of the traditional view\nof the asymmetric nature of the relation between genus and differentia\n(SI, 356–361), against W. E. Johnson (Prior 1949), and the\ndistinction between subject/attribute and logical subject/predicate\n(see section 6) was put to use by Strawson against the possibility of\na strict ontological distinction between entities that can only be put\nin the ‘subject’ place and those that can only be put in\nthe ‘predicate’ place (Strawson 1959, 144). \n\nMore importantly, however, this last distinction contains an important\ninsight, given that it might be said to be at the root of Austin’s\ncentral idea that truth and falsity turn not only on what a sentence\nmeans but also on “the circumstances in which it is\nuttered” (Austin 1962, 111). (On this point, see the\nexplanations in section 1 of Kalderon & Travis (2013).) Cook\nWilson can also be taken here as implying that the meaning of a\nstatement is be determined by the question to which it is an answer,\nas did R. G. Collingwood (Collingwood 1938, 265n.), who used the idea\nas the basis for his ‘logic of questions and answers’\n(Collingwood 2013, chap. 5; 1998, chaps. 3–4), the idea being\nfurther developed since by the French linguist Oswald Ducrot (Ducrot\n1980, 42f.). Collingwood, however, would have been reluctant to\nrecognize Cook Wilson’s idea as an inspiration, since he thought ill\nof the idea of ‘apprehensions’ as a non-derivative basis\nfor knowledge, given that knowledge comes, according to him, from\nasking questions first (Collingwood 2013, 25). \n\nCook Wilson hardly wrote on topics outside the theory of knowledge\nand logic, but two remarks ought to be made concerning moral\nphilosophy. First, the last piece included in Statement and\nInference is composed of notes for an address to a discussion\nsociety in 1897, that was announced as ‘The Ontological Proof for\nGod’s Existence’. In this text, which opens with a\ndiscussion of Hutcheson and Butler, Cook Wilson argued that in the case\nof “emotions as are proper to the moral consciousness”,\nsuch as the feeling of gratitude: \n\nHe argued further, in what amounts to a form of moral realism, that\nthere must be a real experience, i.e., in the case of gratitude,\n“Goodwill of a person, then, must here be a real\nexperience” (SI, 861), and that the feeling of\n“reverence with its solemnity and awe” is in itself\n“not fear, love, admiration, respect, but something quite sui\ngeneris” (SI, 861). It is a feeling that, Cook Wilson\nargued, “seems directed to one spirit and one alone, and only\npossible for spirit conceived as God” (SI, 864). In other\nwords, the existence of the feeling of reverence presupposes that God\nexists. This may not be the most convincing argument for the existence\nof God, but Cook Wilson sketched within of a few pages a theory of\nemotions which is echoed today in the moral realism that has been\ndeveloped, seemingly without knowledge of this previous theory, in the wake of\nDavid Wiggins’ ‘Truth, Invention and the Meaning of\nLife’ (Wiggins 1976) and a series of influential papers by John\nMcDowell—now collected in McDowell (2001). \n\nSecondly, and more\nimportantly, Prichard is also responsible for an extension of Cook\nWilson’s philosophy to moral philosophy, with his paper\n‘Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?’ (Prichard 1912),\nwhose main argument is analogous to Cook Wilson’s argument for\nthe irreducibility of knowledge. In short, duty is sui generis\nand not definable in terms of something else. The parallel is\nmentioned at Prichard (1912, 21 & 35–36). That we ought to do\ncertain things, we are told, arises “in our unreflective\nconsciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the\nvarious situations in which we find ourselves”, and the demand\nthat it is proved that we ought to do these things is\n“illegitimate” (Prichard 1912, 36). In order to find out\nour duty, “the only remedy lies in actual getting into a\nsituation which occasions the obligation” and “then letting\nour moral capacities of thinking to do their work” (Prichard\n1912, 37). This paper became so influential that Prichard was\nelected in 1928 to the White’s Chair of Moral Philosophy at\nCorpus Christi, although his primary domain of competence had been the\ntheory of knowledge. His papers in moral philosophy were edited after\nhis death as Prichard (1949, now 2002). Prichard stands at\nthe origin of the school of ‘moral’ or ‘Oxford\nintuitionism’, of which another pupil of Cook Wilson, the\nAristotle scholar Sir David Ross remains the foremost representative\n(along with H. W. B. Joseph, E. F. Carritt, and J. Laird). Some of the\nviews expressed by Prichard and Ross (Ross 1930, 1939) have recently\ngained new currency with the advent of ‘moral\nparticularism’, e.g., in the writings of Jonathan Dancy (Dancy\n1993, 2004). \n\nThe legacy of Cook Wilson can be plotted through successive\ngenerations of Oxford philosophers, from his pupils H. A. Prichard and\nH. W. B. Joseph, to the post-World War I generation of the 1920s,\nincluding Frank Hardie, W. C. Kneale, J. D. Mabbott, H. H. Price, R.\nRobinson, and G. Ryle, and to the early analytic philosophers of the\n1930s, J. L. Austin, I. Berlin, J. O. Urmson, and H. L. A. Hart, in\nparticular.  For example, see Isaiah Berlin’s description of Hart as\n“an excellent solid Cook Wilsonian” in a letter to Price\n(Berlin 2004, 509) or his own admission that he was at first an Oxford\nRealist (Jahanbegloo 1992, 153). (See Marion (2000, 490–508) for\nfurther details.) So ‘Oxford Realism’ first dislodged\n‘British Idealism’ from its position of prominence at\nOxford and then morphed into ‘ordinary language\nphilosophy’. Through Prichard, Cook Wilson is also somehow\ngenetically related to the ‘moral intuitionism’ that\nflourished at Oxford in the 1930s. The only Oxford philosopher of note\nwho opposed the ‘realists’ before World War II was\nR. G. Collingwood, who felt increasingly alienated and ended up\nreduced to invective: he described their theory of knowledge as\n“based upon the grandest foundation a philosophy can have,\nnamely human stupidity” (Collingwood 1998, 34) and their\nattitude towards moral philosophy as a “mental kind of\ndecaudation” (Collingwood 2013, 50). Collingwood had another\nmore telling complaint, when he criticized the Oxford Realists for\nbeing only interested in assessing the truth or falsity of particular\nphilosophical theses, without paying attention to the fact that the\nmeaning of the concepts involved may evolve through history, as there\nmight simply be no ‘eternal problem’ (Collingwood 2013,\nchap. 7). This lack of historical sensitivity is indeed another\nfeature of analytic philosophy that arguably originates in Cook Wilson\nand Prichard. (For critical discussions of Collingwood’s critique of\nCook Wilson and Oxford Realism, see (Jacquette 2006) and (Beaney\n2013).) \n\nIn the post-World\nWar II years, Cook Wilson’s name gradually faded away (e.g.,\nthere is no mention of him in (Woozley 1949), which nevertheless argues\nfor some of his views), while ‘ordinary language\nphilosophy’, which owed a lot to his constant reliance on\nordinary language against philosophical jargon, blossomed. The historical\nimportance of Cook Wilson’s influence cannot, therefore, be\nunderestimated. The ‘realist’ reaction against British\nidealism at the turn of the 20th century was not confined to\nthe well-known rebellion of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell at\nCambridge. There were also ‘realisms’ sprouting in\nManchester (with Robert Adamson and Samuel Alexander), and in Oxford,\nwhere Thomas Case had already argued for realism in Physical\nRealism (Case 1888). (On Case, see Marion (2002b).) In Oxford, it\nis Cook Wilson who turned the tide and, as one of the originators of\nordinary language philosophy, which is but one of the many strands\ngoing under the name of ‘analytic philosophy’, he should be\ncounted among its ancestors. \n\nThere was, however,\na deleterious side to Cook Wilson’s influence, as his contempt\nfor mathematical logic explains why, although his criticisms of\nRussell’s theory of classes utterly fail to convince, one had to\nwait until after World War II for modern formal logic first to be\ntaught at Oxford, with the appointment of Hao Wang. In the 1930s, H. H.\nPrice was still teaching deductive logic from H. W. B. Joseph’s\nAn Introduction to Logic (Joseph 1916a) and inductive logic\nfrom Mill’s System of Logic. Cook Wilson’s\nreactionary attitude towards modern logic might also explain why he was\nforgotten after World War II, and why many hesitate today to mention\nhis name. \n\nAs the tide of\n‘ordinary language’ ebbed, however, Cook Wilson’s\nviews on knowledge showed more resilience, so to speak. In the\n1960’s, Phillips Griffiths’ anthology, Knowledge and\nBelief included excerpts from Cook Wilson (Phillips Griffiths\n1967, 16–27) and John Passmore was able to write that “Cook\nWilson’s logic may have had few imitators; but his soul goes on\nmarching on in Oxford theories of knowledge” (Passmore 1968,\n257). In the United States, Cook Wilson’s views on knowledge had\na formative influence on the thought of Wilfrid Sellars, who studied at\nOxford in the mid-1930s, and whose views are in turn of importance for\nMcDowell (McDowell 1994, 1998). In his ‘Autobiographical\nReflections’, Sellars wrote: \n\nCook Wilson himself had already spoken of an “insidious and\nscarcely ‘conscious’ dialectic” that “has done\nmuch mischief in modern metaphysics and theories of perception”\n(SI, 797), one according to which “empiricism ends in the\nSubjective Idealism it was intended to avoid” (LL, § 10). \n\nAs was shown in section 4, Cook Wilson’s views on knowledge remain\ninfluential to this day: not only the idea that knowledge is factive\nand indefinable was argued for anew by J. L. Austin, whose ideas have\nbeen further developed recently, along different paths, by Peter\nHacker (Hacker 1988) and Charles Travis (Travis 1989, 2005), it was\ntaken up recently by philosophers as significantly different as John\nMcDowell (McDowell 1994, 1998) and Timothy Williamson (Williamson\n2000, 2007), who is since 2000 Cook Wilson’s successor as Wykeham\nProfessor of Logic, New College. One has, therefore, what Charles\nTravis once described as “an Oxford tradition despite\nitself” (Travis 1989, xii)—on this last point, see also\nWilliamson (2007, 269–270n).","contact.mail":"marion.mathieu@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"}]
