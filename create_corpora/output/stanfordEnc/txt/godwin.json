In his An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\n(1793) he argued that government is a corrupting force in society,\nperpetuating dependence and ignorance, but that it will be rendered\nincreasingly unnecessary and powerless by the gradual spread of\nknowledge and the expansion of the human understanding. Politics will\nbe displaced by an enlarged personal morality as truth conquers error\nand mind subordinates matter. In this development the rigorous\nexercise of private judgment, and its candid expression in public\ndiscussion, plays a central role, motivating his rejection of a wide\nrange of co-operative and rule-governed practices which he regards as\ntending to mental enslavement, such as law, private property, marriage\nand concerts. Epitomising the optimism of events in France at the time\nhe began writing, Godwin looked forward to a period in which the\ndominance of mind over matter would be so complete that mental\nperfectibility would take a physical form, allowing us to control\nillness and ageing and become immortal.\n\n\nGodwin’s moral theory is often described as utilitarian. He\nclearly does play an important part in the history of utilitarianism,\nnot least for his invocation of both British and French writers in the\ntradition, such as Joseph Priestley and d’Holbach and Helvetius,\nand for the way that his ethical theory is underpinned by a\ndistinctive rationalist necessarianism on the basis of which he\ninsisted on a strong form of first order impartiality. One of\nGodwin’s lasting contributions to moral philosophy is “the\nfamous fire cause”, in which we are asked to consider whom I\nshould save from a burning room if I can only save one person and if\nthe choice is between Archbishop Fénelon and a common\nchambermaid. Fénelon is about to compose his immortal\nTélémaque and the chambermaid turns out to be\nmy mother. Godwin’s conclusion that we must save the former\nrelies on consequentialist grounds. However, since his account of the\ncontent of utility is inseparable from the development of truth and\nwisdom, and since we can best promote this through the full and free\nexercise of private judgment and public discussion, the resulting\nposition looks more like a form of perfectionism than\nutilitarianism.\n\n\nGodwin’s philosophical importance rests principally on his\nPolitical Justice. He wrote other philosophical works,\nThe Enquirer (1798) and Thoughts on Man (1831), but\nhe has become perhaps better known for his novels, the most famous of\nwhich is Things as They are, or The Adventures of Caleb\nWilliams (1794), and for the part he played in literary London\nfrom 1783–1836—from his heyday in the 1790s as the radical\nphilosopher who married Mary Wollstonecraft, through the next forty\nyears in which he was variously the butt of attacks by Thomas Malthus,\nSamuel Parr and a host of anti-jacobin scribes, friend of the romantic\npoets, publisher and author of children’s books, father-in-law\nand sponger off Percy Bysshe Shelley, and historian of the Civil War,\nto his final anomalous position as a government pensioner supported by\na Tory administration. His papers and especially his diary, which\nsparsely records what he read and wrote and whom he met, provide an\nimmense resource for scholars of the romantic period.\n\nGodwin was born on 3 March 1756 at Wisbeach [now Wisbech],\nCambridgeshire, the seventh of thirteen children of John Godwin\n(1723–1772) a dissenting minister, and his wife Anne\n(c1723–1809), the daughter of Richard Hull, a ship-owner engaged\nin the Baltic trade. As a minister Godwin’s father was involved\nin a number of conflicts with his congregations and the family moved\nfirst from Wisbeach to Debenham, Suffolk and, in 1760 to Guestwick,\nnear Norwich, Norfolk, where they lived until his father’s\ndeath. The village was small and the revenue poor; to supplement their\nincome they took in pupils to whom John Godwin taught the\nclassics. The family’s financial circumstances improved on the\ndeath of Edward Godwin (1695–1764), Godwin’s paternal\ngrandfather—also a dissenting minister and friend of Philip\nDoddridge, in whose Academy Godwin’s father and his uncle Edward\nhad been educated.  Godwin’s upbringing was rather gloomy. He\nwas not a robust child and his aunt “instructed me to compose\nmyself in sleep, with a temper as if I were never again to wake in\nthis sublunary world” (“Autobiography”\nin Collected Novels and Memoirs (CNM hereafter),\n1992, I, 12). At five he was reading The Pilgrim’s\nProgress with her, together with James\nJaneway’s Account of the Conversion, holy and exemplary\nlives and joyful deaths of several young children (1671–2),\nand hymns, catechisms and prayers written by Dr. Isaac Watts. One of\nGodwin’s earliest memories was of composing a poem entitled\n“I wish to be a minister” (CNM I, 15), and a\nfavourite childhood entertainment was to preach sermons in the kitchen\non Sunday afternoons. \nHe was first educated by a Mrs. Gedge, an elderly woman, “much\noccupied in the concerns of religion”, with whom he read the Old\nand New Testaments. After her death in 1764, he and his brother went\nto Mr. Akers’ school in Hilderston (now Hindolverston). Godwin\nremained a religious enthusiast and dissenter—preaching to his\nfellow schoolchildren, identifying some as “children of the\ndevil”, and refusing to answer questions on the Collect of the\nweek, taken from the Book of Common Prayer (CNM I,\n24). His success at Akers’ reinforced his commitment to\nintellectual activity and his aversion to physical toil, and\ncompounded his pride, for which he was frequently admonished by his\nfather. Despite his father’s opposition, his resolution to\nbecome a minister never wavered, and in 1767 he went to board with a\nMr. Samuel Newton, the minister of an independent congregation in\nNorwich. \nNewton was deeply influenced by the writings of Robert Sandeman\n(1718–1771), a hyper-Calvinist who, scorned faith and presented\nGod as saving or damning a person solely “according to the right\nor wrong judgment of the understanding” (CNM I, 30).\nGodwin compared Newton in his Autobiography to Caligula or Nero for\nhis spiteful and violent treatment, and he left him in the early\nsummer of 1770, having abandoned his calling and decided to become a\nbookseller. Six months at Hindolverston persuaded him to resume his\npupillage for a further, final year, after which he was pronounced fit\nfor entry into the Dissenting College at Homerton and discharged.\nHomerton turned him down “on suspicion of Sandemanianism”\n(CNM I, 41). The more tolerant Hoxton Academy, principally\nrun by Andrew Kippis and Abraham Rees admitted him. Hoxton was noted\nfor its Arminianism and Arianism (that is, for the belief that Divine\nsovereignty was compatible with free will in man and for the rejection\nof the divinity of Christ), but Godwin’s Sandemanianism remained\nstubbornly untouched, although he supplemented it with “a creed\nupon materialism and immaterialism, liberty and necessity, in which no\nsubsequent improvement of my understanding has been able to produce\nany variation” (CNM I, 42). In June 1778 he set out to\npractice his vocation. He had a brief appointment in Ware, followed by\na period in London, apparently without income, before obtaining a post\nin 1780 at Stowmarket, Suffolk. He held the post for two years, during\nwhich time his religious beliefs underwent a revolution, moving\ntowards deism after he followed the suggestion of one of his\nparishioners and read Holbach, Helvetius and Rousseau. Not\nsurprisingly, he fell into dispute with his congregation and moved to\nLondon in 1782 where friends encouraged him to write for his\nliving. \nLater that year he completed his first work, The history of the\nLife of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham (1783), and by the\nfollowing year was contributing to the English Review,\n“at two guineas a sheet”. At the end of 1782 he returned\nbriefly to his original profession, being employed at Beaconsfield in\nBuckinghamshire for seven months, during which he produced a volume of\nsermons, Sketches of History (1783). When this appointment\nbroke down he returned to London and resumed his career as an\nauthor. \nGodwin’s output between 1782 and 1784 included, in addition to\nhis Life of Chatham and his sermons, three novels, two\npolitical pamphlets, a work on education, and a spoof of the critical\nreviews. None made him much money and it was only when his former\ntutor, Andrew Kippis, invited him to write the British and Foreign\nHistory section for the New Annual Register, in July 1784,\nthat he was assured of an adequate income. He probably also made some\nmoney from the pieces he wrote in 1785 for the Political\nHerald, a Whig journal, edited by Dr. Gilbert Stuart. The\npamphlets, and his pieces for the Political Herald, reveal\nhim to be an extremely well informed commentator on contemporary\naffairs. Between 1785 and 1793 Godwin published little save his work\nfor the New Annual Register. Nonetheless, in the summer of\n1791, at the height of the debate on the French Revolution, sparked by\nEdmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France\n(1790), he persuaded his publisher, George Robinson, to support him\nwhile he wrote a work summarising recent developments in political\nphilosophy. The work grew from its original conception and was\neventually published in two volumes in February 1793 as An Enquiry\nConcerning Political Justice. It is was an immediate success and\nremains the founding work of philosophical anarchism. Although Godwin\ndrew on principles canvassed in the Revolution controversy, and on the\nwork of the philosophes, Political Justice was also\npowerfully influenced by Godwin’s Dissenting education and his\ninvolvement in Dissenting circles around Kippis and Timothy and Thomas\nBrand Hollis. His success soon made him a central figure in radical\npolitical and literary circles of London; he become friends with John\nThelwall, Thomas Holcroft, and John Horne Tooke (all of whom were\nindicted for Treason in 1794), he associated with a wide range of\nother established writers such as Elizabeth Inchbald, James\nMackintosh, and Joseph Ritson, and he was sought out by a younger\ngeneration of enthusiasts, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor\nColeridge and William Hazlitt. In May 1794 Godwin’s most\nsuccessful novel, Things as they are, or The adventures of Caleb\nWilliams was published, adding further to his literary\nreputation, and in the October of that year his shrewd political\npamphlet, Cursory Strictures on the Charge delivered by Lord Chief\nJustice Eyre to the Grand Jury, attacked the case for treason\nconstructed by Eyre against the leaders of the London Corresponding\nSociety and the Society for Constitutional Information, several of\nwhom were his close associates. \nA second edition of Godwin’s Political Justice, in\nwhich some of the more rationalist and utopian statements of the first\nedition were modified, was published at the end of 1795. Shortly\nthereafter he became reacquainted with Mary Wollstonecraft, whom he\nhad first met briefly in 1791 at a dinner in honour of Paine at which\nneither was much impressed by the other. Wollstonecraft had\nsubsequently lived in revolutionary France and had had a child in a\nfraught relationship with Captain Gilbert Imlay, an American merchant.\nTheir second introduction was more successful. As a young man Godwin\nhad been very much the philosopher—austere in dress, with an\nangular figure, an intense manner and piercing glance. While\napproachable he was not socially adept: he both took offence easily\nand gave it by his zealous commitment to the virtue of candour among\nfriends. Only with his increasing success did he come to meet a wide\nrange of clever women with political, literary and philosophical\ninterests—such as Helen Maria Williams, Elizabeth Inchbald,\nAmelia Alderson, Maria Reveley, Mary Hays and Mary Robinson. This\ncontact had its effect. He cut his hair short in 1791 and adopted a\nless ministerial style of dress; he also enjoyed an increasingly\nextensive social life (albeit without any indication of\nself-indulgence); and he even experimented in 1796 with holding a\ndinner party (which included Parr’s daughters, Wollstonecraft,\nand Inchbald). He also developed a basic competence in flirtation. In\nthe last months of 1795 and first half of 1796, Reveley, Samuel\nParr’s daughter Sarah, Alderson and Inchbald were all candidates\nfor his attention. Following their re-acquaintance in January 1796,\nWollstonecraft subsequently called on Godwin, unconventionally, in\nApril 1796; thereafter they met and corresponded regularly, and by\nJuly they were much closer, becoming lovers in August 1796. Their\nletters and notes provide a touching record of a philosophical\nrelationship gradually subverted by feelings which Godwin found hard\nto accommodate intellectually and Wollstonecraft found hard to trust.\nWollstonecraft became pregnant in December and after much deliberation\nover how to reconcile their actions to their principles, they married\nin March 1797. Wollstonecraft’s death following childbirth in\nSeptember 1797 left Godwin distraught and burdened with the care of\nboth the baby Mary (later Mary Shelley) and Fanny Imlay\n(Wollstonecraft’s illegitimate child )—and with a growing\nburden of debt. He threw himself into work: he revised Political\nJustice for a third, and final time, wrote a hurried memoir of\nWollstonecraft, prepared a collection of her works, and embarked on\nhis second major novel, St Leon (1799).\nWollstonecraft’s influence on Godwin’s thinking has been\ndetected by critics in his volume of essays, The Enquirer\n(1798), and in the revisions made for the third edition of\nPolitical Justice, published at the end of 1797. A rather\ndifferent sense of their relationship was recorded by him in his\nMemoirs of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of\nWomen (1798), and in his depiction of marriage in St.\nLeon (1799). The Memoirs provoked a storm of controversy\nby their revelations of Wollstonecraft’s unconventional sexual\nmores. Several of Godwin’s past acquaintances spurned him, he\nfound himself increasingly the subject of attack by loyalist\nnewspapers, and his philosophical opinions were parodied and ridiculed\nin novels, reviews and pamphlets. Godwin reacted with dignity. His\nThoughts Occasioned by the Perusal of Dr. Parr’s Spital\nSermon (1801), sought dispassionately to answer his critics and\nto confess errors which he now recognized—and which had already\nbeen acknowledged both in the revisions to the later editions of his\nEnquiry, and in his comments in St. Leon. But the reply did\nlittle to rescue him from the now overwhelming tide of reaction, and\nincautious remarks in his discussion of Malthus’ Essay on\nthe Principle of Population (1798) about exposing children and\nabortion, were seized upon with glee by the reviewers. Godwin’s\nPolitical Justice was a product of the enthusiasm connected\nwith the French Revolution but by the end of the decade the author and\nhis works were being exuberantly denounced by loyalism and the forces\nof reaction that increasingly dominated the British political and\nliterary scene. Hereafter, for most of the rest of his life, Godwinism\nbecame a term of opprobrium. In the new, intolerant political climate\nGodwin turned to literature and history. He tried his hand at drama\nwith two plays, Antonio (1800) and Faulkener (1807),\nbut with no success; in 1803 he wrote a two volume Life of\nChaucer; and two years later he produced a further novel,\nFleetwood: or The New Man of Feeling (1805). To cope with his\ndomestic responsibilities he looked for a new wife, approaching\nHarriet Lee who found him too pressing, Maria Reveley too soon after\nthe death of her husband, and Sarah Elwes, a woman separated from her\nhusband, who was unable to marry. When a widow with two children, Mary\nJane Clairmont, leaned over her balcony in 1801 and asked “Is it\npossible that I behold the immortal Godwin”, his fate was\nsealed. \nIn 1805, in an effort to establish his finances on a more secure\nfooting, his friends helped establish him as the proprietor of a\nchildren’s bookshop. Over the next ten years, writing mainly\nunder the pseudonym Edward Baldwin, Godwin produced a variety of books\nfor children: including collections of fables, myths, and bible\nstories, histories of England, Rome and Greece, and various\ndictionaries and grammars, but he wrote little of any real political\nor philosophical significance for ten years. \nIn 1814 Godwin’s domestic life was thrown into turmoil when\nPercy Bysshe Shelley eloped to France with Godwin’s\nseventeen-year-old daughter Mary, accompanied by Mary’s sixteen\nyear old stepsister, Clare Clairmont. The following decade was marked\nby repeated family and financial crises, by the suicides of\nShelley’s first wife, Godwin’s stepdaughter Fanny, and of\nhis young protégé Patrickson, and by the deaths of three\nof Mary Shelley’s children, followed hard by the death of\nShelley himself in 1822. Yet it was also a productive period for\nGodwin. His Lives of Edward and John Philips, nephews of\nMilton (1815), his chilling tale of madness, Mandeville\n(1817), and his four volume History of the Commonwealth\n(1824–8) each represent his fascination with the republicanism\nof the civil war period. He also returned to the subject of education\nin his Letters of Advice to a Young American (1818) and in\n1820 he produced a lengthy critique of Malthus’ Essay,\nwhich won him some respect in some previously hostile quarters,\nalongside the undisguised enmity of the Edinburgh Review. In\nthe last five years of his life he wrote two further novels, and he\nreturned to the philosophical and terrain of his earlier career in his\nThoughts on Man (1831), his most sustained piece of\nphilosophy since his Enquirer (1798). His final work,\nunpublished in his lifetime, was a series of essays on Christianity,\nin which he fulfilled an ambition, first noted in 1798, to  \nsweep away the whole fiction of an intelligent former world and a\nfuture state; to call men off from those incoherent and contradictory\ndreams, that so often occupy their thoughts, and vainly agitate their\nfears; and to lead them to apply their whole energy to practical\nobjects and genuine realities. (Political and Philosophical\nWritings (PPW hereafter) IV, 417)  \nIn 1833 Godwin finally received some recognition when he was given a\nsinecure post by the then Whig government. Peel’s subsequent\nadministration agreed to extend the post until Godwin died in April\n1836. \nHazlitt famously described Godwin’s reputation in the 1790s in\nan essay in his Spirit of the Age(1825):  \nNo work gave such a blow to the philosophical mind of the country as\nthe celebrated Enquiry … Tom Paine was considered for a time as\nTom Fool to him, Paley and old woman, Edmund Burke a flashy sophist.\nTruth, moral truth, it was supposed had here taken up its abode; and\nthese were the oracles of thought.  \nGodwin himself confirms the view. When travelling in the Midlands in\n1794 he found that  \nI was nowhere a stranger. The doctrines of that work, (his Enquiry\nConcerning Political Justice) coincided in a great degree with the\nsentiments then prevailing in English Society, and I was everywhere\nreceived with curiosity and kindness. (Marshall, William\nGodwin, 1984: 121)  \nOnly six years later, reflecting on his reputation, he wrote, \nPhilosophically Godwin’s greatest supporters were his\ncontemporaries, such as Thomas Holcroft and John Thelwall, and a\nyounger generation of men (and some literary women) who were attracted\nto Godwin’s intellectual rigour and his radical critique of the\nsocial and political order. Many later abandoned him, Coleridge,\nWordsworth and Southey as part of a rising tide of loyalist reaction,\nShelley and Byron, for more personal and domestic reasons. However,\nhis philosophical anarchism had a profound influence on Robert Owen,\nWilliam Thompson and other utopians in the nineteenth century, and\nthere is also evidence of influence on the Chartist movement and on\npopular labour movements for political reform in the 1840s (see\nMarshall 1984: 390). His impact in literary circles was long lasting,\nboth through his political writings, and through his novels.\nPolitical Justice was read and translated by Benjamin\nConstant in France, and an abridged edition was translated into German\nin 1803, along with the first three of Godwin’s mature novels.\nMarx and Engels knew of his work and cited him as having contributed\nto a theory of exploitation, and as being widely read by the\nproletariat. Later in the nineteenth century Anton Menger and Paul\nEltzbacher introduced Godwin’s work to German audiences, leading\nto further translation. Caleb Williams appeared in Russian in 1838,\nand Chernyshevski, Kroptkin and Tolstoy all read and referred to him.\nIn the late nineteenth century the last book of Political\nJustice, formally titled “Of Property”, but dealing\nwith the prospects for progress in the human race and including his\nattacks on marriage and co-operation, was reprinted as a socialist\ntract, and the whole work was reprinted again in the 1920s. A critical\nedition of the third edition with variants appeared in 1946, and an\nedition of the 1793 text with both later variants and material from\nthe original manuscripts appeared in 1993. Biographies of Godwin have\nalso appeared regularly since the first by C. Kegan-Paul in 1876,\nwhich drew heavily on the extensive manuscript sources. Philosophical\ninterest has been less pronounced, although since the 1940s a slow\ntrickle of books has emerged which have sought to do justice to\nGodwin’s essentially liberal political principles and to his\nmoral philosophy. That work has recognised the importance of thinkers\nof the French Enlightenment, and more recently the Dissenting\ninheritance which his education and early career provided. As a\nresult, the traditional view of Godwin as a strict utilitarian has\nbeen increasingly challenged. Recent work in political philosophy on\nthe appropriate form and scope of impartiality has looked to Godwin,\nmost commonly to define a position to resist, but not exclusively\nso. There has also been an upsurge of interest in Godwin amongst literary scholars and historians studying the romantic period, producing a range of work examining a much wider span of Godwin’s corpus than has hitherto been the case and especially exploring the contribution that his Diary can make to understaning the political culture of London in the period. \nGodwin’s major philosophical treatise is his Enquiry\nConcerning Political Justice. The work went through three\neditions within 5 years, each with substantial changes. No further\nedition was published in Godwin’s lifetime, although a fourth\nedition was certainly mooted and Godwin may have undertaken work\ntowards it. Although Godwin’s other works shed light on changes\nin Godwin’s position after 1798, Political Justice is\nthe most coherent expression of his political philosophy. \nThe work began as an attempt to review recent developments in\npolitical and moral philosophy, but it quickly became more ambitious\nin scope: \nThe discarded first draft centres on the work of Montesquieu and\nRaynal, while the published work abandons the expository mode and\ndevelops its own independent line of argument. Godwin begins by\ndefending the importance of political inquiry and refuting claims that\nmoral and political phenomena are a function of climate, national\ncharacter or luxury. He argues that character is a function of\nexperience and that the type of government under which people live has\nan overwhelming impact upon their experience—bad government\nproduces wretched men and women. Although he is initially prepared to\nendorse the philosophe and republican view that government\ncan have a positive impact on the development of virtue, this view is\nsoon set aside in favour of the argument that moral and political\nimprovement flows from progress in our understanding of moral and\npolitical truth—a process to which there is no limit. \nBook Two examines the basic principles of human society, equality,\nrights, justice, and private judgment. Godwin follows Paine’s\nview in Common Sense, that “society is in every state a\nblessing…government even in its best state is but a necessary\nevil” (PPW III, 48), by seeing society as antecedent to\ngovernment with its principles setting the bounds of its legitimacy.\nThe basic moral principle is that of justice: \nThis principle is filled out by two further principles. The first,\nequality, is used to establish that we are beings of the same nature,\nsusceptible of the same pleasures and pains, and equally endowed with\nthe capacity for reason. This is to endorse the philosophe\nprinciple that birth and rank must not affect the way people are\ntreated— \nBut he also believes (as in the Fénelon case) that some have a\nhigher moral value than others. This judgment seems rigorously\nconsequentialist, in that we value them more if and only if they\ncontribute more to the general good (a position in line with\nGodwin’s rejection in Book Seven of all desert-based accounts of\npunishment). Tensions are introduced into his account, however, by the\nemphasis he places on intention in assessing a person’s\naction— \nand by his characterisation of the ideal agent as someone devoted to a\nlife of benevolence and virtue. In both instances he appeals to an\nagent-centred account of virtue, more than to a consequentialist\naccount, and in doing so acknowledges a form of moral worth that is\nnot wholly reducible to consequentialist considerations. \nThe second principle to which he appeals, the doctrine of private\njudgment, is advanced as the logical complement to the principle of\njustice: \nHere again, although Godwin appeals in part to consequentialist\nconsiderations to ground a duty to private judgment, it also plays an\nintegral part on his conception of what it is to be a fully rational\nagent. When combined with the principle of equality, the principle of\nprivate judgment issues in a basic constraint on certain types of\nconsequentialist intervention—each person acts morally only in\nso far as each acts wholly on the dictates of his or her private\njudgment. To effect real improvement we must work by appealing to the\nrational capacities of each of our fellow citizens. \nBook Three and the first part of Book Four develop Godwin’s case\nagainst existing theories of government, in each case making his case\nby drawing on his opening argument that there is no intrinsic limit on\nthe development of human understanding and enlightenment. The\nphilosophical underpinning for this argument is given in the second\nhalf of Book Four where Godwin examines the character of truth and its\nrelationship to virtue and goes on to discuss arguments relating to\nfreedom of the will, the doctrine of philosophical necessity, and the\ncharacter of moral motivation. He shows that men are capable of\nrecognising truth, and that, because mind acts as a real cause, they\nwill act on it when they perceive it clearly. Nothing beyond the\nperception of truth is required to motivate our compliance with moral\nprinciples. It is this which justifies the description of\nGodwin’s position as “rationalist”, and it is on\nthis point—the motivating power of reason—that later\neditions show a degree of retraction. One possible source for the\nposition is Richard Price’s Review of the Principal\nQuestions of Morals (1756), but it is noteworthy that Godwin\nhimself later identified this “error” as a function of his\nSandemanianism. In Political Justice, however, Godwin builds\nhis argument on necessarian foundations laid by David Hartley and\nJoseph Priestley, albeit he develops their position by insisting that\nmind is the medium within which sensations, desires, passions and\nbeliefs contend—so that we should understand the conflict\nbetween passion and reason as one of contending opinions. Such\ncontention can be assessed impartially by the mind which will assess\nthe true value of each claim and act on the judgment. \nBooks Five to Eight apply the principles of justice, equality and\nprivate judgment in a critical examination of the institutions of\ngovernment, issues of toleration and freedom of speech, theories of\nlaw and punishment, and, finally, the institution of property. In each\ncase, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the\ndevelopment of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full\nand free exercise of private judgment. In the final book Godwin\nsketches his positive vision of the egalitarian society of the future,\none which, having dispensed with all forms of organised co-operation,\nincluding orchestras and marriage, so as to ensure the fullest\nindependence to each persons’ judgment, will gradually witness\nthe development of the powers of mind to the point that they gain\nascendancy over physiological process allowing life to be prolonged\nindefinitely. \nIn 1800 Godwin wrote: \nThis account is a fair characterisation of the changes which Godwin\nmade in the second and third editions. Sentiment and feeling are given\na much more powerful role, no longer to be expunged by the power of\ntruth; the private affections are allowed to play a part in moral\nreasoning; and a more consistently utilitarian language is deployed\nthroughout the work. As a consequence, the rationalism which marked\nthe first edition becomes muted and, while the belief in progress is\nmaintained, the more utopian flights of the first edition are\nomitted. \nOne of the most powerful attacks on Godwin was that made in Dr. Samuel\nParr’s “Spital Sermon” of 1800. It was\nGodwin’s advocacy of universal benevolence against which Parr\ndirected his energies, centring his attack on Godwin’s early\ndismissal of family feeling, gratitude and various natural sentiments.\nFor Godwin, these are passions unconstrained by judgment, and so\nshould not play a role in determining how we should act. He\nexemplifies his case in what has come to be known as the “Famous\nFire Cause”, in which the reader is asked to imagine being able\nto save only one of two people in a fire, one of whom is the\nArchbishop Fénelon, a benefactor to the whole human race, the\nother of whom is the reader’s parent (mother in the first\nedition, father thereafter!). Godwin’s view is that justice\ndemands that we act impartially for the greater good, which means\nsaving Fénelon. He never abandoned this case, nor the view that\nit is our duty to act to bring about the greatest good. Just as a\njudge should not be influenced by familial or private concerns in his\njudgment, so too is the moral agent bound to judge impartially. In\nreplying to Parr, Godwin expresses regret that he had not appealed to\nthe still more persuasive case of Brutus executing his two\nsons—a striking example, and a republican commonplace about\njustice trumping paternal duties. As Godwin says, saving someone just\nbecause they are a relation seems bizarre without some additional\njudgment about their moral worth: a parent who is foolish or evil\ncannot have an over-riding claim on us against the moral deserts of\nall other members of the human race. That position, Godwin retains.\nMoreover, in his Reply to Parr, he insists that these\nextraordinary cases are unlikely to shake the domestic affections in\nthe ordinary intercourse of life. However, from the later editions and\nother works, it becomes clear that he will admit, in the more normal\ncourse of events, a much more substantial role to be played by our\nnatural affections and attachments. They provide us both with\ninformation about how best we might benefit others, and a basic moral\nmotivation which can be relied on in normal cases and which can be\ngeneralised beyond the narrow domestic sphere (a position much\nindebted to Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments).\nThese changes are significant: it leaves us a less rationalist, more\nphilosophically robust, account of moral motivation and its\nrelationship to the principle of utility, and it does much to moderate\nthe utopianism of the first edition. \nThe impact of these changes on Godwin’s over-all position is\nmore difficult to assess. What we see in the changes is a consistent\nshift away from the rationalist account of moral motivation which\nmarked the first edition to a position which is much more sceptical\nabout the power of reason. This scepticism inevitably moderates\nGodwin’s belief in perfectibility, since it becomes more\ndifficult to argue for convergence on principles of morality and the\nprogressive development of knowledge. It also inevitably undermines\nGodwin’s faith in the triumph of mind over physiological\nprocesses. That said, neither the doctrine of private judgment nor the\nprinciple of utility depend on his earlier rationalism. The former is\ndefended by Godwin on the grounds that only free action has moral\nvalue, and that the fullest possible exercise of private judgment is\nrequired for one’s actions to be free—further evidence of\nGodwin’s attempt to provide an agent-centred account of virtue\nalongside his consequentialism. With this commitment private judgment\nremains defensible even if there is a low probability that its\nexercise will produce true beliefs, so long as no other better method\nof tracking truth is available (which also becomes proportionately\nless likely as one’s scepticism increases). The defence might\nrequire that cognitive status be attributed to moral judgments, but it\nmight also be possible to sustain the argument for private judgment\nindependent of the issue of ethical objectivity. The utility principle\nmight seem to call for an ability to make sound ethical judgments in\ncomplex situations but, again, if we are sceptical about\npeople’s ability to judge well, this does not entail (and seems\nto deny) that there is a better way of judging. On both counts then,\nGodwin’s central principles remain intact despite the changes he\nmakes to the account of moral motivation and judgment. Moreover,\nGodwin’s view of man’s progressive character might be\ndefended by placing greater weight on eliminating the baleful effects\nof the social and political institutions of the European aristocracies\nthan on the epistemological dimensions of the account. \nHowever, Godwin’s endorsement of both the principle of utility\nas the sole guide to moral duty and the principle of private judgment\nas a block on the interference of others, is not without tensions. His\nconsistent doctrine is a combination of these two principles: that it\nis each individual’s duty to produce as much happiness in the\nworld as he is able, and that each person must be guided in acting by\nthe exercise of his private judgment, albeit informed by public\ndiscussion. If the resulting doctrine is utilitarian it is a highly\ndistinctive form: it is act-utilitarian in that it discounts reliance\non rules (although see Barry’s suggestion that his act-\nutilitarianism gives way to motive utilitarianism, Justice as\nImpartiality 224; and see Godwin’s invocation of sincerity\nas a partial rule constraint in the first edition, PPW III,\n135–42); it is ideal, in that it acknowledges major qualitative\ndifferences in the pleasures; and it is indirect, in that we can only\npromote over-all utility by improving the understanding of our fellow\nhuman beings. More troubling to the view that this none the less\namounts to utilitarianism is Godwin’s insistence on private\njudgment as a basic constraint, and his associated characterisation of\nthe fully moral agent in terms of the fullest possible development of\nthe individual’s intellectual powers and potential. Indeed,\nGodwin’s account of pleasure, in terms of the development of\nintellect and the exercise of its powers, means that the position\nlooks more like perfectionism than it does a form of hedonistic\nutilitarianism (what is valued is the ideal as much as the pleasures\nwhich are integral to it). Furthermore, it suggests that no\ndistinction can be drawn between the means that we adopt to promote\nthe general good and the character of the general good itself. That\nis, what promotes the general good is the development of human\nintellect, but the general good just is the development of the human\nintellect. If that is true, Godwin’s account cannot be\nutilitarian because it cannot be consequentialist (because it cannot\nseparate the means to the end from the end which is sought). \nSuch issues of interpretation remain very much in dispute in studies\nof Godwin (compare Clarke 1977 with Philp 1986 and Lamb 2009a), being\ncomplicated by issues concerning the weight to be given to the\ndifferent editions of\nPolitical Justice and Godwin’s later writings. However,\neven if a utilitarian reading of Godwin is accepted, it remains the\ncase that the doctrine is strictly a precept of individual moral\njudgment. Because of his broader views as to the corrupting influence\nof government, there can be no extension of the principle to politics.\nEach of us must judge as best we can how to advance the good of all,\nbut every person is owed a respect for their private judgment which\nprecludes us from exercising authority over them. By invoking this\nconstraint, Godwin delivers utilitarianism from the more statist\napproaches of Bentham and later utilitarians. It also ensures that the\ndoctrine retains a fundamentally egalitarian form. The constraint also\nsupports the view that Godwin reached his philosophical position less\nthrough the philosophes, than by secularising Dissenting\narguments for the sanctity of private judgment and generalising their\napplication to every mode of human activity. This commitment also\nprovides support for a reading of Godwin’s position which sees\nit as concerned with individual moral perfectibility, couched in the\nlanguage of utility, rather than as strictly utilitarian. \nPolitical Justice condemns all government interference with\nindividual judgment. Godwin claims that over time history has seen\ngradual progress as knowledge has developed and has spread and as men\nand women have liberated themselves from their political chains and\ntheir subordination to the fraud and imposture of monarchical and\naristocratic government and established religion. His optimistic\nbelief in the impotence of government against advancing opinion (which\npartly glosses and extends Hume’s comment that all government is\nfounded on opinion) is balanced by some sociologically perceptive\ncomments on the baleful influence that certain types of political\npower have on those who exercise it or are subject to it. These\ninsights are also explored in The Enquirer, but it is in\nGodwin’s later novels, from Caleb Williams (1794)\nonward, that it is given its fullest rein. As Godwin indicates in his\nunpublished essay, “On History and Literature” (1798)\n(PPW V, 290–301), literature can be used to show how\nthe cultures and institutions into which we are born come inexorable\nto shape our lives, leading us to act in ways which destroy our\nchances of happiness. The six mature novels effectively follow through\nthe critical enterprise launched in Political Justice by\ntheir narrative histories of men who are brought to grief by the\naristocratic and inegalitarian principles of their societies.","contact.mail":"mark.philp@warwick.ac.uk","contact.domain":"warwick.ac.uk"}]
