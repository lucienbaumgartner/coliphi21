The nature of the relation between the abstract geometry\nand its practical expression has also to be considered.\n\n\n\nThis essay considers various theories of geometry, their grounds for\nintelligibility, for validity, and for physical interpretability in\nthe period largely before the advent of the theories of special and\ngeneral relativity in the 20th century. It turns out that a\ncomplicated interplay between shortest and straightest is at work in\nmany stages.\n\n\n\nBefore the 19th century only one geometry was studied in any depth\nor thought to be an accurate or correct description of physical space,\nand that was Euclidean geometry. The 19th century itself saw a\nprofusion of new geometries, of which the most important were\nprojective geometry and non-Euclidean or hyperbolic\ngeometry. Projective geometry can be thought of as a deepening of the\nnon-metrical and formal sides of Euclidean geometry; non-Euclidean\ngeometry as a challenge to its metrical aspects and implications. By\nthe opening years of the 20th century a variety of Riemannian\ndifferential geometries had been proposed, which made rigorous sense\nof non-Euclidean geometry. There were also significant advances in the\ndomain of abstract geometries, such as those proposed by David\nHilbert. It follows that the terms ‘geometry’ and\n‘physical space’ do not have simple meanings in the 19th\ncentury, and changing conceptions of these terms do not follow a\nsimple pattern of refinement. Their inter-relations therefore also\nhave a complicated history.\n\n\n\nA detailed examination of geometry as Euclid presented it reveals a\nnumber of problems. It is worth considering these in some detail\nbecause the epistemologically convincing status of Euclid’s Elements\nwas uncontested by almost everyone until the later decades of the 19th\ncentury. Chief among these problems are a lack of clarity in the\ndefinitions of straight line and plane, and a confusion between\nshortest and straightest as a, or the, fundamental geometrical\nproperty. (See the many comments collected in Heath’s edition of Euclid’s\nElements.) The implications for the parallel postulate will be\ntreated separately, see section on Non-Euclidean geometry.  \n\nThe first four Books of Euclid’s Elements are about straight lines\nand circles, but it is well known that the concept of a straight line\nreceives only a most unsatisfactory definition. A line is said to be\n“a breadthless length”, and a straight line to be a line\n“which lies evenly with the points on itself”. This may\nhelp convince readers that they share a common conception of the\nstraight line, but it is no use if unexpected difficulties arise in\nthe creation of a theory—as we shall see. \n\nTo those who decided to read the Elements carefully and see how the\ncrucial terms are used, it became apparent that the account is both\nremarkably scrupulous in some ways and flawed in others. Straight\nlines arise almost always as finite segments that can be indefinitely\nextended, but, as many commentators noted, although Euclid stated that\nthere is a segment joining any two points he did not explicitly say\nthat this segment is unique. This is a flaw in the proof of the first\ncongruence theorem (I.4) which says that if two triangles have two\npairs of sides equal and the included angle is equal then the\nremaining sides of the triangles are equal.  \n\nTheorem I.4 is interesting in another way. Theorem I.2 carries a\nscrupulous, and by no means obvious, proof that a given line segment\nin a plane may be copied exactly with one of its end points at any\nprescribed point in the plane. Theorem I.4 properly requires a proof\nthat an angle may likewise be copied exactly at an arbitrary point,\nbut this Euclid cannot provide at this stage (one is given in I.23,\nwhich, however, builds on these earlier results). He therefore gave a\nbald claim that one triangle may be copied exactly in an arbitrary\nposition, which makes one wonder why such care was expended on I.2. In fact, the whole concept of motion of figures was to become a prolonged topic of discussion in Arab/Islamic times. (on deduction in Euclid,\nsee Mueller 1981).  A plausible reading of Elements Book I is that a straight\nline can be understood as having a direction, so that there is a\nstraight line in every direction at every point and only one straight\nline at a given point in a given direction. The parallel postulate\nthen says that lines which cross a given line in equal angles point in\nthe same direction and do not meet. But this must be regarded as an\ninterpretation, and one that requires quite some work to make\nprecise.  Direction is, nonetheless, a more plausible candidate than\ndistance; Euclid did not start with the idea that the straight line\njoining two distinct points is the shortest curve joining them. The\nrelevant primitive concept in the Elements is that of\nequality of segments, such as all the radii of a given circle. Euclid\nstated as Common Notion 4 that if two segments can be made to coincide\nthen they are equal, and (in the troublesome I.4) he used the\nconverse, that if two segments are equal then they can be made to\ncoincide. Segments are such that either one is smaller than the other\nor they are equal, and in I.20 Euclid showed that “in any\ntriangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the\nremaining one.” This result has become known as the triangle\ninequality, and it goes a long way to proving that the line segment\njoining any two distinct points is the shortest curve through those\npoints. Once the parallel postulate is introduced Euclid showed that\nopposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, and so the distance\nbetween a pair of parallel lines is a constant.  But there is another weakness in the Elements that is also\nworth noting, although it drew less attention, and this is the nature\nof the plane. The plane has another sub-standard definition, evidently\nmodelled on that of the line: “a plane surface is a surface\nwhich lies evenly with the straight lines on itself” (and,\nunsurprisingly, “a surface is that which has length and breadth\nonly”). After that, the word ‘plane’ is not\nmentioned in the first four Books, although they are solely concerned\nwith plane geometry. When Euclid turned to solid geometry in Book IX,\nhe began with three theorems to show successively that a straight line\ncannot lie partly in a plane and partly not, that if two straight\nlines cut one another they lie in a plane and every triangle lies in a\nplane, and that if two planes meet then they do so in a line. However,\nhe can only be said to claim these results and make them plausible,\nbecause he cannot use his definition of a plane to prove any of\nthem. They do, however, form the basis for the next theorems: there is\na perpendicular to a plane at any point of the plane, and all the\nlines perpendicular to a given line at a given point form a\nplane.  Once again, I.4 is problematic. Consider, for the purpose of\na reduction ad absurdum, that one has two\ntriangles, \\(ABC\\) and \\(A'BC\\) on the same side of\ntheir common base \\(BC\\), and such that \\(BA = BA'\\) and \\(CA = CA'\\). It is intended to\nshow that therefore the vertices \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\)\ncoincide, and for this one must, as Gauss observed (in unpublished remarks, see Gauss Werke 8, 193), use the fact that the\ntriangles lie in the same plane. A good definition of a plane is\nrequired, one that allows this result to be proved.  Let us say that a purely synthetic geometry is one that deals with\nprimitive concepts such as straight lines and planes in something like\nthe above fashion. That is, it takes the straightness of the straight\nline and the flatness of the plane as fundamental, and appeals to the\nincidence properties just described. It is resistant to the idea of\ntaking distance as a fundamental concept, or to the idea of replacing\nstatements in geometry by statements about numbers (say, as\ncoordinates), although it is not hostile to coordinate geometry being\nerected upon it.  Let us also say for present purposes that a metrical geometry is\none in which distance is a primitive concept, so line segments can be\nsaid to have the same length, congruent figures have corresponding\nsides equal in length, and geometrical transformations preserve\nlengths. We can also allow that similarities are allowed: these are\ntransformations that produce scale copies of figures. (No theorem in\nEuclid’s Elements depends on the actual size of a figure: any\ntheorem that applies to one figure applies to all its scale\ncopies.)  Elementary geometry in the modern West moved in a confused way\ntowards making distance the primary primitive concept, while often\nmaintaining the Euclidean emphasis on straightness, thus frequently\nmuddling the implications of the different concepts. A notable example\nof this being nonetheless productive was John Wallis’s argument in\ndefence of the parallel postulate (given as a lecture in 1665 and\npublished in Wallis 1693). It rested, as he realised, on the ability\nto make arbitrary scale copies of a triangle, and this seems to be the\nfirst time that the equivalence was recognised between these two\nsystems:  In the Encylopédie Méthodique (1784: vol. 2,\n132), d’Alembert defined geometry as the science that teaches us\nto know the extent, position, and solidity of bodies. Its principles\nare founded, he went on, on truths so evident that it is not possible\nto contest them. A line (in the sense of a curve) is one-dimensional,\nand the shortest line joining two points is the straight\nline. Parallel lines are lines that, however far they are extended\nwill never meet because they are everywhere equidistant.  Joseph Fourier, in a discussion with Monge, also took the concept\nof distance as fundamental, but he began with three-dimensional\nspace. He then defined successively the sphere, the plane (as the\npoints equidistant from two given points) and the line (as the points\nequidistant from three given points). This did at least give him\ndefinitions of these previously troubling\nconcepts (see Bonola 1912, 54). Adrien-Marie Legendre was a mathematician sympathetic to the\ndidactic aims of the Elements but not to its original\nformulations. He wrote several different versions of his Éléments\nde géométrie (1794) with a view to restoring Euclidean rigour in\nthe teaching of geometry, which in his view had been corroded by\ntexts, such as one by Clairaut (1741), that relied on notions of\nself-evidence. They differ largely, as he had to admit, in their\nunsuccessful attempts to deduce the parallel postulate.  In all these editions Legendre took a firmly metrical point of\nview. His opening definition of the first edition proclaimed that\n“Geometry is a science that has as its object the measure of\nextent”. Extent, he explained, has three dimensions, length\nbreadth, and height; a line is a length without breadth, its\nextremities are called points and a point therefore has no extent. A\nstraight line is the shortest path from one point to another; surfaces\nhave length and breadth but no height or depth; and a plane is a\nsurface in which if two arbitrary points are joined by a straight line\nthis line lies entirely in the surface.  Legendre then set out to prove the theorems of\nthe Elements together with some results Euclid had preferred\nto assume, such as (Legendre’s first result): any two right angles are\nequal. His Theorem 3 proved that the line joining two distinct points\nis unique (its existence having been tacitly assumed to be a\nconsequence of the definition of a straight line). Familiar congruence\ntheorems follow in each edition until the parallel postulate could no\nlonger be ignored. Once the existence of parallel lines was assured\nLegendre showed that they were equidistant.  In fact, Legendre’s attempts to restore rigour to the treatment of\nelementary geometry was no better than Euclid’s, and in some ways\nworse, not only because his attempts to prove the parallel postulate\ninevitably failed, but because he smuggled more into his account than\nhe realised. But its chief significance for present purposes is that\nit exemplifies the attempt to ground elementary geometry on a concept\nof distance, or rather, and more precisely, on the idea that a\nstraight line is the curve of shortest distance between any of its\npoints. Distance itself is not defined.  To conclude: a reasonable view at the time would have been that\nmetrical geometry needed to put its house in order, and it probably\ncould not do so by grafting the concept of distance onto a structure\nmodelled on Euclid’s Elements. This is an awkward position\nfor traditional geometry to be in, and it may have opened people’s\nminds to the possibilities of alternatives. Certainly, two were to be\nproduced. One, projective geometry, amplified and improved the\nsynthetic side of geometry. The other, non-Euclidean geometry, was a\nnew and challenging metrical geometry. But before we look at them, we\nturn to contemporary philosophical discussions of geometry.  It is a useful over-simplification to say that around 1800 the view\nwas that there was one physical space (the universe), and that this\nspace was described by the geometry in Euclid’s Elements,\nwhich was the only candidate for such a task. Disputes concerned the\nrigorous presentation of this geometry and its precise application to\nthe physical world. The nature of the knowledge that geometry provided\nwas also a matter of some discussion.  Locke (see the entry on\n Locke) \n took from the Aristotelian tradition the\nidea that Euclidean geometry and rational theology are the exemplars\nof scientific knowledge, but sought to ground his philosophy in\nintuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive kinds of knowledge. Intuitive\nknowledge is what is grasped immediately; demonstrative knowledge\navails itself of the intermediate steps of a proof, as in\ngeometry. Both these forms of knowledge are certain. Sensitive\nknowledge is not certain: it is what we learn through our senses, it\npresents effects but not causes, it is at best partial and may be\ndeceptive. But because Locke grounded certain knowledge on knowledge\nof essences, which he felt were forever hidden from us, he was forced\nto defend this weaker form of knowledge as appropriate to human\nknowledge. Space can be thought of as composed of all (actual and\npossible) positions of objects; pure space is space with all solid\nbodies removed, and distance the primitive concept we use to discuss\nthe separation between bodies.  In his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)\nLocke asserted that  When we possess ourselves with the utmost security of\nthe demonstration, that the three angles of a triangle are equal to\ntwo right ones, what do we more but perceive, that equality to two\nright ones does necessarily agree to, and is inseparable from, the\nthree angles of a triangle? (Essay IV.i.2)  and later that  …the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily\ncarries with it an equality of its angles to two right ones. Nor can\nwe conceive this relation, this connexion of these two ideas, to be\npossibly mutable, or to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of choice\nmade it thus, or could make it otherwise. (Essay IV.iii.29,\npp. 559–560) Sensitive knowledge of the corresponding objects, however, could\nnever have this degree of certainty, and because our knowledge derives\nfrom our knowledge of objects it would seem that scientific knowledge\nof space is of a different kind from our knowledge of geometry. Thus,\nfor Locke, Euclidean geometry provided one kind of knowledge, and\nexperience and scientific experiment, another. Indeed, one might say\nthat an epistemological gap remains to this day in philosophy in the\nform of a distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge that is\nstill widely recognised.  The situation with Hume is more complicated, but also arguably\nclearer because the gap is addressed directly. In his A Treatise\nof Human Nature (1739–1740) he defended the certainty of\narithmetic and algebra, but withheld it from geometry on the grounds\nthat our knowledge of points and lines is inherently imprecise. The\ntruths of Euclidean geometry were not truths about the world but of an\nabstract system, and would remain true if there were no figures in the\nworld that correspond to their Euclidean equivalents. The isosceles\ntriangle theorem, which asserts the equality of two sides of a\ntriangle having two equal angles, is to be understood, Hume suggested,\nas the claim that in the given circumstances, two sides of a triangle\nare approximately equal—and interpreted this way the claim is\ncertain (see Badici 2011 and de Pierris 2012).  In Kant’s metaphysics (see his Critique of Pure Reason\n(1781/1787) and the entry\n Kant’s views on space and time) \n the situation is again more complicated or sophisticated. Kant\nintroduced the notion of a priori knowledge in contrast to a\nposteriori, and synthetic knowledge in contrast to analytical\nknowledge to allow for the existence of knowledge that did not rely on\nexperience (and was thus a priori) but was not tautological in\ncharacter (and therefore synthetic and not analytic). Analytic\nstatements are a priori, the contentious class of a priori\nnon-analytic statements contains those that could not be otherwise and\nso provide certain knowledge. Among them are the statements of\nEuclidean geometry; Kant ascribed synthetic a priori status to the\nknowledge of space. He also ascribed certainty to Euclidean\ngeometry. But, wrote Kant, it is not the philosopher who knows that\nthe angle sum of a triangle is two right angles, it is the\nmathematician, because the mathematician makes a particular\nconstruction that makes the truth of the claim demonstrable\n(see Critique, A 716, B 744).  Among the French philosophes, the dominant position in the 1770s\nwas the Cartesian one, which, as exemplified by\nClairaut’s Élémens de géométrie (1741) was perhaps unduly\nnaïve in its insistence on clear and immediate ideas. The position of\nd’Alembert, in his articles in the Encylopédie Méthodique\n(1784), was more sophisticated. The objects of geometry are to be\nunderstood by abstracting from bodies every quality except that of\nbeing penetrable, divisible, and figured extents. Among these objects\nare lines, that lack breadth, and surfaces, that lack depth. Truths\nestablished about the objects of geometry are purely abstract and\nhypothetical, because there is no such thing, for example, as a\nperfect circle. The demonstrated properties can hold of actual circles\nonly insofar as the actual object approaches the state of being a\nperfect circle,  They are, in some sense, a limit and, if one can put\nit this way, the asymptote of physical truths, the term for those\nobjects that approach as closely as one wishes without ever arriving\nat it exactly. (see Encylopédie Méthodique II, 132)\n However, if mathematical theorems do not exactly hold in nature,\nthese theorems at least serve with sufficient precision in\npractice. To be demonstrated with complete rigour they must be\nconsidered as holding of bodies in a state of abstract perfection that\nthey do not really have.  The curves studied in geometry are not perfectly\nstraight nor perfectly curved, the surfaces are not perfectly flat nor\nperfectly curved, but the more nearly they are so, the more they\napproach the state of having those properties that one proves about\nlines exactly straight or curved, and of surfaces exactly flat or\ncurved. These reflexions, d’Alembert continued, will be enough to refute\nthe sceptics, who complain that geometrical objects do not really\nexist, and others ignorant of mathematics who regard it as a useless\nand pointless game.  It would seem, therefore, that philosophers found no problems in\nEuclid’s Elements, but Hume, d’Alembert, and others of an\nempiricist persuasion disputed the applicability of the theorems on\nthe grounds that the objects of geometry might have no corresponding\nobjects in the world. Philosophers more open to the idea of a wide\nrange of certain knowledge (as, for example, Kant) could grant\ngeometrical theorems the status of a priori truths that could not be\nother than they are.  Physical space was the naïve, three-dimensional version of the\nspace of Euclid’s Elements and of Cartesian coordinatised\nthree-dimensional geometry, and this was how Newton had regarded it in\nhis Principia Mathematica (1687). It was conceived of as a\nneutral arena with no properties of its own, that was permeated by\nvarious kinds of forces that were created by, and in turn influenced,\nphysical bodies. Chief among these was the force of gravity, which\nmathematicians in the Cartesian tradition regarded as a mysterious,\neven unacceptable, concept when it was introduced, but which by the\nstart of the 19th century had been shown by Laplace to be\ncapable of dealing well with all the known motions of the solar\nsystem. As a consequence, gravity had become a natural, primitive\nconcept no longer in need of further explanation, and after 1800 it\nwas reasonable of people who worked on the new theories of magnetism\nand electricity to consider them as forces and to model them, where\nappropriate, on Newtonian gravity.  Physical space, as described by Newton in his Principia,\nis to be studied by passing from observations of bodies in motion\nrelative to one another and timed by an arbitrary clock to the\ncorresponding true motion in absolute space and time. As Newton put it\nat the end of his first Scholium, the purpose of his treatise was to\nshow \nhow to determine true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent\ndifferences, and, conversely, of how to determine from motions,\nwhether true or apparent, their causes and effects.\n \nThere was clearly no doubt in Newton’s mind about the Euclidean nature\nof physical space, and indeed there seems to have been no doubts among\nastronomers in the 17th century that space was describable\nin the terms used in Euclid’s Elements. It is also likely\nthat the growing recognition of the merits of Newton’s physics\ncemented a belief that space was three-dimensional, homogeneous,\nisotropic, and to be described as if it was an infinite coordinate\ngrid, thus exemplifying the theorems—if not precisely the\ndefinitions—of the Elements.  Among the geometrical aspects of physical space that Newton\nestablished is the statement of his first law:  Every body preserves in its state of being at rest or\nof moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is\ncompelled to change its state by forces impressed. \nThere is also the result that a homogeneous spherical solid exerts the\nsame gravitational effect on other bodies as would an equal mass\nconcentrated at the centre of the body. That is to say, such bodies\nbehave in a way that is provably, and not merely approximately, the\nsame as point masses. In this way points and lines acquire physical\nsignificance in his theory of dynamics.  It was Laplace who gave the strongest argument for saying that\nphysical space obeys Euclidean geometry. In his Exposition du\nsystème du monde of 1796 (see Book V, Ch. V, p. 472) he added an\ninteresting note (quoted in Bonola 1912: 54) to say that  The attempts of geometers to prove Euclid’s Postulate\non Parallels have been up till now futile. However, no one can doubt\nthis postulate and the theorems which Euclid deduced from it. Thus the\nnotion of space includes a special property, self-evident, without\nwhich the properties of parallels cannot be rigorously\nestablished. The idea of a bounded region, e.g., the circle, contains\nnothing which depends on its absolute magnitude. But if we imagine its\nradius to diminish, we are brought without fail to the diminution in\nthe same ratio of its circumference and the sides of all the inscribed\nfigures. This proportionality appears to me a more natural postulate\nthan that of Euclid, and it is worthy of note that it is discovered\nafresh in the results of the theory of universal gravitation. This is strikingly similar to the view of Wallis well over a\ncentury before, although Laplace did not mention Wallis and may not\nhave known of his discussion on the parallel postulate.  Around 1800, therefore, it was generally true that problems with\nthe truth claims of Euclidean geometry had been located among the\ngeneral problems about our knowledge of the external world. Confidence\nin philosophical and scientific circles in the validity of Euclidean\ngeometry per se was high.  In the opinion of many in the 19th century, Euclidean\ngeometry lost its fundamental status to a geometry that was regarded\nas more general: projective geometry. (For an introduction to geometry\nin the 19th century, see Gray 2011. Projective geometry is\ndescribed in the entry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry, see also\nthe essays by various authors in Bioesmat-Martagon 2011.) Projective\ngeometry has its own foundational problem, akin to that of distance in\nEuclidean geometry, which concerns the concept of cross-ratio, and we\nneed to follow the moves to create projective geometry as an\nindependent subject, to define cross-ratio in this setting, and to\nresolve the epistemological issues that are raised (an achievement\nassociated with Klein’s Erlangen Programme). We shall also see that\nthe growth of projective geometry creates the arena for Hilbert’s\naxiomatisation of geometry.  Plane projective geometry took a particular boost from Jean Victor\nPoncelet’s book of 1822 Traité des propriétés projectives des\nfigures where he showed the power of projective methods under the\nprovocative formulation of non-metrical geometry. The fundamental\ncharacter of the new geometry resides in the way it can be thought of\nas capturing the simplest properties of the straight line—two\ndistinct points define a unique line, two distinct lines meet in at\nmost one point—while discarding the metrical concepts of\ndistance and angle.  Poncelet’s claims for transformations of the plane that map lines\nto lines were rewritten by Chasles (1837) in a more rigorous way that\nhighlighted the invariance of cross-ratio. The cross-ratio of four\npoints \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on a line is defined to\nbe \\(AB{.}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{.}CB\\), and if the points are mapped\nto \\(A'\\), \\(B'\\), \\(C'\\), \\(D'\\) respectively by a\nprojective transformation, then  However, this left the subject in the uncomfortable position of\nseeming to be more general than Euclidean geometry, because Euclidean,\nmetrical, transformations are projective transformations but not\nconversely, while still seeming to rely on a metrical concept in the\ndefinition of its fundamental invariant.  This issue was tackled in the 1840s and 1850s by Georg Karl\nChristian von Staudt. His two books (1847, 1856–1860) attempted\nto give foundations for projective geometry that made it an autonomous\nsubject, independent of Euclidean geometry. They were hard to read,\nand imperfect in a number of ways, but the task of creating a rigorous\ntheory could be seen for the first time as a matter of completing a\ntask already begun. Von Staudt argued that the transformations of\nplane projective geometry could map any triple of collinear points to\nany other, and any quadruple of points (no three of which were\ncollinear) to any other, but not any quadruple of collinear points to\nany other. He then made a detailed study of collinear quadruples. He\nalso made brief remarks about how Euclidean geometry could be obtained\nfrom projective geometry, and from these it could be seen that his\ntheory of collinear quadruples reduced to the familiar theory of\ncross-ratio as soon as the concept of Euclidean distance was added to\nprojective geometry. This insight was made clear and explicit by Klein\nin a number of papers in the early 1870s. The first readable textbook\non projective geometry, and the one that gave it its name, was\nCremona’s Elementi di geometria projettiva of 1873, and after\nthat the subject swiftly rose to become the fundamental classical\ngeometry.  Its basic concepts were the points, lines, and planes of a space\nthat was \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) enriched with a what was often called\nplane at infinity, so that any two coplanar lines meet. Prior to\naxiomatisations of the theory at the end of the 19th\ncentury, point, line, and plane were undefined concepts, with an\nintuitive interpretation that allowed for a ready passage between\nprojective and Euclidean geometry. The allowed transformations of the\ngeometry map points to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes\nand preserve cross-ratio. They act transitively on the space, so no\npoint, line, or plane is special, and therefore lines that are\nparallel in any finite part of the space may be mapped to intersecting\nlines and vice versa.  In its synthetic form the successes of projective geometry were\nlargely confined to the simplification it brought to the study of\nconics—all non-degenerate conics (the circle, ellipse, parabola,\nand hyperbola) are projectively equivalent. In its algebraic form\nprojective geometry proved itself almost essential in the study of\nplane algebraic curves of any degree, and, extended to projective\nspaces of higher dimensions, to the study of algebraic surfaces. All\nthis contributed to the central importance attributed to a\nnon-metrical geometry based on little more than the concept of the\nstraight line and on the incidence properties of lines and\nplanes.  Projective geometry also possessed one startling feature, called\nduality and regarded by Cremona as a law of logic. In plane projective\ngeometry it is possible to exchange the terms ‘point’ and\n‘line’, ‘coincident’ and\n‘concurrent’ and in this way exchange valid statements. As\na result all definitions, theorems, and proofs in projective geometry\nhave a dual character. The dual of the statement of Desargues’ theorem\nand its proof, for example, is the converse of the theorem and its\nproof. In three dimensions, the terms ‘point’ and\n‘plane’ can be exchanged in the same way, and lines are\nexchanged with other lines. This raises an intriguing epistemological\nissue: it is easy to conceive of space as made up of points, but\nimpossible to regard it intuitively as made up of lines. To make\nmatters worse, space is three-dimensional when regarded as made up of\npoints, but four-dimensional when made up of lines.  Klein’s Erlangen Programme and what has become known as the\nKleinian view of geometry is described in the\nentry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry. \nIt has come to stand as the principal\nsource of the view that geometry can be defined as a group acting on a\nspace, and a geometrical property is any property invariant under all\nthe transformations of the appropriate group.  Klein advocated this view in a pamphlet published when he became a\nProfessor at the University of Erlangen in 1872 and other publications\nin journals in the 1870s in order to re-unify geometry. He presented a\nway of showing that metrical geometries, such as Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometry, and other geometries, such as inversive\ngeometry and birational geometry, can be regarded as special cases of\nprojective geometry (as can affine geometry, which he did not know\nabout in 1872).  The fundamental geometry was real projective geometry, say in two\ndimensions. In this geometry the space is real projective space, and\nthe group is the group of all projective transformations. This group\nmaps points to points, lines to lines, curves of degree \\(n\\) to\ncurves of degree \\(n\\), and, importantly, the cross-ratio of four\ncollinear points is left unaltered by any projective\ntransformation. In the Kleinian viewpoint, this establishes that\npoints, lines, curves of degree \\(n\\), and the cross-ratio of four\ncollinear points are properties of the geometry.  Projective geometry incorporated the other geometries in a variety\nof ways. Klein indicated that one may seek to add to the list of\nconfigurations, in which case the group that keeps them invariant will\ngenerally be smaller than the principal group, or one may seek to\nenlarge the group, in which case the class of invariant configurations\nwill generally shrink. Klein had only recently succeeded in showing\nthat non-Euclidean geometry arises as a sub-geometry by confining\nattention to the interior of a conic in projective space and to the\nsubgroup that maps the interior of that conic to itself (see Klein\n1871, 1873).  The epistemological character of Klein’s Erlangen Programme becomes\nclearer when one looks at how it resolved the well-known nagging doubt\nabout the definition of cross-ratio in projective geometry. Klein’s\nanswer proceeded by analogy with lengths in Euclidean or non-Euclidean\ngeometry. In those geometries, the corresponding group preserves\nstraight lines, and any point can be mapped to any other point, but\nthere is no transformation in the group that can map a line segment\nonto a proper sub-segment of itself. Any arbitrary but fixed line\nsegment can therefore be taken as unit of length and used to measure\nline segments, by constructing arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples\nof it and arranging them as one would a ruler. Now to measure the\nlength of a segment \\(AB\\), one simply lays the point \\(A\\) at\none end of the ruler and sees where the point \\(B\\) falls on the\nruler.  Klein’s insight, following von Staudt, was that an exactly similar\nargument involving quadruples of collinear points can be used to\ndefine cross-ratio in projective geometry. The projective group\npreserves straight lines, and any ordered triple of collinear points\ncan be mapped to any ordered triple of collinear points, and the map\nthat sends a given ordered triple of distinct points to another\nordered triple of distinct points is unique, but there is no\ntransformation in the group that can map a quadruple of four collinear\npoints onto an arbitrary such quadruple. Any arbitrary but fixed\ncollinear quadruple can therefore be taken as unit of\n‘size’, and a complicated but not difficult argument\nallows one to produce arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it that\ncan be used to measure cross-ratios, by arranging as one would a\nruler. Rather than give the details, it is better to give this\nsuggestive illustration of why this can be done. Let the cross-ratio\nof the four collinear points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), \\(S\\) be measured by mapping\nthe points onto the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on the real line,\nwhere \\(A\\) is at the origin, \\(C\\) at \\(\\infty\\), and \\(D\\) at\n1, so it is the position of \\(B\\) that determines the\ncross-ratio. This is uniquely determined, and if the length\nof \\(AB\\) is \\(x\\), we find\nthat \\(AB{.}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{.}CB = x\\).  In the language of the time, length is a two-point invariant of the\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean group, and cross-ratio is a four-point\ninvariant of the projective group.  Problems with some technical issues in projective geometry, and the\nrising standards of rigour at the end of the 19th century\nprovoked attempts to axiomatise the subject. The task was taken up\nmost energetically by Pieri, Peano, and a number of other Italian\ngeometers in the second half of the 19th century, and they\nsucceeded in giving a rigorous account of real and complex projective\ngeometry in two and three dimensions (see Marchisotto and Smith\n2007). But they managed at the same time to reduce the subject to a\nrigorous training for geometry teachers, and did not appreciate the\navenues for research that they had opened. It was left to David\nHilbert to revitalise the axiomatic approach to geometry (see Hallett\nand Majer 2004).  Hilbert had been introduced to a number of controversies about\nelementary projective geometry that concerned what results in what\nsettings implied what other results. The most notable concerned\nDesargues’s theorem. In 3-dimensional projective geometry, Desargues’s\ntheorem is a consequence of the incidence axioms alone, but it is a\ntheorem about points and lines in a projective plane (and so in\n2-dimensional geometry) yet no-one had been able to derive it from the\nincidence axioms of 2-dimensional projective geometry. It had come to\nbe suspected that it might not be deducible from those axioms alone,\nand Giuseppe Peano was able to show that indeed it could not be\ndeduced without some extra assumptions. Independently, Hilbert also\ngave an example of a geometry meeting all the incidence axioms of\n2-dimensional projective geometry but in which Desargues’s theorem was\nfalse. It was later replaced by the simpler example found by the\nAmerican mathematician and astronomer F.R. Moulton in all later\neditions of Hilbert’s Grundlagen der Geometrie (1899).  In the axiomatic geometries that Hilbert put forward, the\nfundamental objects (points, lines, planes) are not defined. Instead,\nHilbert specified how they can be used and what can be said about\nthem. He presented five families of axioms, sorted according to the\nconcepts they employed or codified. He then created a variety of\ngeometries obeying a variety of axioms systems, and established the\nconsistency of them by giving them coordinates over suitable rings and\nfields—often his geometries admit many interpretations or\nmodels. This gave these geometries all the consistency of arithmetic,\nand led to Hilbert’s interest in attempts to ground arithmetic in some\nform of set theory and logic.  Hilbert’s approach thrived because he had come to realise that\nthere was a mathematics of axioms, a study of different but\ninter-related axiom schemes and their implications. Poincaré, in his\nreview (1902) of Hilbert’s book, accepted the new geometries as valid,\nbut regretted that they were, as he put it, incomplete, because they\nlacked a psychological component. By this he meant that they could not\nbe accommodated in his explanation of how we have some knowledge of\nthe geometry of physical space, because they could not be innately\nacquired.  Investigations of the parallel postulate began in Greek times,\ncontinued in the Islamic world, and were undertaken in the early\nmodern West. But, for reasons which are still unclear, after around\n1800 it became easier for people to imagine that\nEuclid’s Elements might not be the only possible system of\nmetrical geometry. Among the factors that can help explain how the\nunthinkable became thinkable even outside the community of\nmathematicians was the accumulation of theorems based on assumptions\nother than the parallel postulate. It would seem that the production\nof novel, consistent consequences of such a radical assumption, and\nthe failure to find a contradiction, inclined some people to\ncontemplate that there might indeed be a whole geometry different from\nEuclid’s.  The signal example of this shift is the Law Professor\nF.K. Schweikart, who in 1818 sent Gauss via Gerling, a colleague of\nhis at the University of Marburg, an account of a geometry quite\ndifferent from Euclid’s. Schweikart’s geometry was accepted by Gauss,\nwho replied that all the properties of the new geometry could be\nderived once a value was given for a constant that appeared in\nSchweikart’s account. But what Gauss had accepted, and on what\ngrounds, is less clear. Gauss had already found fault with several\ndefences of Euclid’s Elements, and as the years went by he\ncame to be entirely confident that there was a new, two-dimensional\ngeometry different from Euclidean plane geometry. This geometry could\nbe described by formulae that he would have seen were akin to those of\nspherical geometry. But he did not describe a three-dimensional\ngeometry of this kind, leaving open the possibility that the\ntwo-dimensional geometry was some kind of formal, meaningless\noddity. On the other hand, in correspondence with Bessel he made it\nclear that he could not ascribe to Euclidean geometry the certainty he\ngave to arithmetic, which was a priori, and both he and Bessel kept\nopen the possibility that astronomical regions of space might fail to\nbe Euclidean.  Credit for the first fully mathematical descriptions of space in\nterms other than Euclid’s must therefore go to János Bolyai in Hungary\nand Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevskii in Russia independently. Bolyai in\nhis “Appendix scientiam spatii absolute veram\nexhibens” (1832) and Lobachevskii in his “Neue\nAnfangsgrunde der Geometrie” (1835) and again in\nhis Geometrische Untersuchungen (1840) replaced the parallel\npostulate with the assumption that given a line and a point not on\nthat line, there are many lines through the point that lie in the\nplane defined by the given point and the given line and that do not\nmeet the given line. Of these, as they then showed, one line in each\ndirection is asymptotic to the given line, and these asymptotic lines\ndivide the family of all the other lines in the given plane and\nthrough the given point into two families: those that meet the given\nline, and those that do not. Much work then followed, famously similar\nin each case, in particular to show that in the three-dimensional\nspace described by their assumptions there is a surface upon which\nEuclidean geometry holds, and to deduce the existence of\ntrigonometrical formulae describing triangles in the plane. These\nformulae resemble the corresponding formulae for triangles on the\nsphere.  All this convinced both Bolyai and Lobachevskii that the new\ngeometry could be a description of physical space and it would\nhenceforth be an empirical task to decide whether Euclidean geometry\nor non-Euclidean geometry was true. Lobachevskii even attempted to\ndetermine the matter by astronomical means, but his results were\nutterly inconclusive.  It is, of course, true, that no amount of consistent deductions in\nthe new geometry rules out the possibility that a contradiction does\nexist, but the intriguing relationship of the new geometry to\nspherical geometry, and the existence of trigonometric formulae for\ntriangles strongly suggested that the new geometry was at least\nconsistent. Those who did accept it, and they were very few before the\n1860s, nonetheless may well have welcomed a better account than the\none Bolyai and Lobachevskii provided. But before turning to what that\ninvolved, it is worth pausing to appreciate the formulae, because many\ngeometers were to find them convincing proofs of the validity of the\nnew geometry even after the reformulations of Riemann and Beltrami\n(for example, Enriques in his major essay (1907) on the principles of\ngeometry).  It is not just that there are formulae, but that they hint at an\nalternative formulation of geometry, one in which the geometry\ndescribed in Euclid’s Elements might prove to be but a\nspecial case. If there could be another way to define geometry, one\nthat would lead to these formulae in various cases, the way would be\nopen to rethink all of the questions about geometry that critical\nexamination had opened. The person best placed to do this in the 1830s\nand 1840s was Gauss. He knew very well what Bolyai and Lobachevskii\nhad done, and his differential geometry gave him the means to proceed,\nbut, curiously, he did not do so. In the early 1840s he wrote some\nnotes that show he could connect the new two-dimensional geometry with\ngeometry on a surface of constant negative curvature, but he did\nnothing with this observation.  On the other hand, the mere existence of formulae would not suffice\nto make them geometrical in character. This need to give them a\ngeometrical grounding was recognised by Lobachevskii in his earliest\npublications, but because they were in Russian they were not read\noutside Russia (nor were they appreciated by Russian\nmathematicians). He dropped his considerations of this kind in his\npamphlet of 1840, upon which much of his reputation depends to this\nday, but brought them back in his last presentation,\nthe Pangéométrie (1856), which, however, did no better than\nthe earlier versions.  Lobachevskii argued firstly that geometry was a science of bodies\nin space, and that space is three-dimensional. The most primitive\nconcept was that of contact, and its opposite, a cut separating two\nbodies. Two bodies not in contact are separated and a suitable third\nbody in contact with both of them measures the distance between them,\na concept that was otherwise undefined. He could therefore define a\nsphere with its centre at a given point as the collection of all\npoints equidistant from a given point. He then showed how to define a\nplane by capturing the intuition that given two distinct points a\nplane is the collection of points in space that are the same distance\nfrom each of the two given points. In his terms, given two points a\nplane is the set of points common to two spheres of equal radius, one\ncentred on one of the points and the other on the other. A line can be\ndefined similarly.  With the intuition that distance is the primitive concept comes a\ngreater appreciation of motion, or at least the results of being able\nto move objects around without altering them. One can imagine\ntransporting a rigid body around, say a cube with sides of unit\nlength, and using one of its sides to mark out lengths. We shall see\nlater that the possibilities inherent in this process occasioned a\nchicken-and-egg debate between Bertrand Russell and Henri Poincaré at\nthe end of the 19th century.  The new geometry posed a radical challenge to Euclidean geometry,\nbecause it denied traditional geometry its best claim to certainty, to\nwit, that it was the only logical system for discussing geometry at\nall. It also exploited the tension known to experts between the\nconcepts of straightest and shortest. But in other ways it was\nconventional. It offered no new definitions of familiar concepts such\nas straightness or distance, it agreed with Euclidean geometry over\nangles, it merely offered a different intuition about parallel lines\nbased on a different intuition about the distant behaviour of straight\nlines. Its proponents did not offer a sceptical conclusion. Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did not say: “See, there are two logical but\nincompatible geometries, so we can never know what is true.”\nInstead, they held out the hope that experiments and observations\nwould decide. The epistemological price people would have to pay if\nastronomical observations had come down in favour of the new geometry\nwould, in a sense, have been slight: it would have been necessary to\nsay that straight lines have an unexpected property after all, but one\nonly detectable at long distances or with remarkable microscopes. To\nbe sure, many of the theorems of Euclidean geometry would then have to\nbe reworked, and their familiar Euclidean counterparts would appear\nonly as very good approximations. But that is broadly comparable to\nthe situation Newtonian mechanics found itself in after the advent of\nspecial relativity.  The much more significant change came with the arrival of Bernhard\nRiemann’s great extension of Gaussian differential geometry. Many of\nthe epistemological issues are already raised with Gauss’s work\n(1828), so we turn to it first.  Gauss thought deeply about what it is to define a surface, and he\nfound that three definitions of successive generality are\npossible. One can assume that at least locally the surface can be\ngiven in the form, \\(z = f(x,y)\\) for some function \\(f\\) of \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\). This is true of regions of the sphere, but not of all of it at\nonce. More generally, one can assume that the surface is made up of\nthose points \\((x,y,z)\\) that satisfy an equation of the form\n\\(f(x,y,z) = 0\\), as the sphere is. More generally still, said Gauss,\nit might be that a surface was given locally by three functions each\nof two variables \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). These two variables are to be\nthought of as the coordinates of points in a plane, and the functions\n\\(x(u,v), y(u,v)\\), and \\(z(u,v)\\) together give the coordinates of\npoints on the surface in space. In this setting, every point of a\npiece of a surface has \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) coordinates in the plane. The\ndistance between two points on the surface corresponding to \\((u,v)\\)\nand \\((u + du,v + dv)\\) in the plane is given\nby a version of the Pythagorean theorem by a formula of the form  where \\(E, F\\), and \\(G\\) are determined by the\nfunctions \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) and satisfy \\(EG - F^2 \\gt 0\\).  Gauss was able to define a measure of the curvature of the surface\nat a point, and he found something remarkable about it: the measure of\ncurvature depends only on \\(E, F\\), and \\(G\\) and their\nderivatives with respect to \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), but not on the\nfunctions \\(x(u,v), y(u,v)\\),\nand \\(z(u,v)\\) directly. The precise expression is\nlong and complicated, but the implication is, as Gauss pointed out,\nthat his measure of the curvature of a surface at a point is\nintrinsic: it is entirely determined by measurements in the surface\nand does not involve any question of a third dimension at right angles\nto the surface. Given a metric, a formula (*) for distance, the\ncurvature can be found. If, for example, the formula for distance is\nthat for a map of the sphere on the plane, the curvature will be found\nto be the reciprocal of the square of the radius of the sphere.  Gauss also investigated when one surface can be mapped onto another\nin such a way that distances are not altered: if two points \\(P\\)\nand \\(Q\\) on the one surface are a distance \\(d\\) apart, then so\nare their images on the other surface. Gauss was able to show that a\nnecessary condition for this to happen is that the curvatures at\ncorresponding points are the same. For example, the cylinder and the\nplane are locally isometric; although curved, the cylinder has zero\ncurvature in Gauss’s sense, just as does the plane, which is why\nprinting from a rotating drum is possible.  This means that there are geometric properties one can infer from a\nmap of a surface that are independent of the details of the map and\nrefer to the surface itself. Its Gaussian curvature at each point is\nknown, and there are other properties that one can infer from\nknowing \\(ds^2\\), for example, the curve of shortest\nlength between two points (subject to certain conditions).  It was not immediately appreciated that Gauss’s approach allowed\nmathematicians to define surfaces as regions of the plane with a\nparticular metric that are not to be obtained from surfaces in\nEuclidean 3-dimensional space. Of course, if one defines a surface as\nthe image of a map from a piece of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) to\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), then of course it is in\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). But if one defines a surface as a region of\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) with a particular metric, then there may be no\nsurface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) to which it corresponds. The first\nperson to appreciate this seems to have been Riemann, who also\nextended this idea to any number of dimensions.  Riemann’s ideas were both profound and naïve, and for that reason\nthey proved difficult to make precise, but we can content ourselves\nwith being naïve initially. He supposed he was given a space (he\ncalled it a ‘manifoldness’) in which one can at any point\nimpose a coordinate system at least on all points near to an arbitrary\ninitial point, and if, when one does that, every point is related to\nthe initial point by a list of \\(n\\) numbers he said that the space\nis \\(n\\)-dimensional. We can think of this process as providing a\nmap of at least that part of the space near the initial point onto\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). So far, this differs from the surface\ncase only in that two dimensions have been replaced by \\(n\\).  He then supposed there was a means of saying what the distance was\ninfinitesimally, by generalising the formula for \\(ds^2\\)\nfrom 2 to \\(n\\) variables. (He even allowed that entirely different\nformulae be used, but we shall not describe that part of his theory,\nwhich lay fallow for many years).  Next, he checked that this intrinsic property of curvature\npersisted in higher dimensions, which it does. This is essentially\nbecause the \\(n\\)-dimensional object has lots of 2-dimensional\nsurfaces to which the Gaussian theory applies, so a notion of\ncurvature of a \\(n\\)-dimensional object at a point can be derived\nfrom a consideration of the 2-dimensional surfaces that pass through\nthe point.  Now he asked, what more do we want to be able to do geometry? There\nare properties of the space that are independent of the coordinate\nsystem. If two different coordinate systems give out different\ncoordinates, but do it in such a way that the distance between the\npoints is preserved, then either system allows us to do geometry, and\nwhen we do we find that the two coordinate systems agree on the\ncurvatures at each point, on the distances between points, and so\nforth.  Because the formula for \\(ds^2\\) was written down\nsubject to only a few restrictions, there is no reason to believe that\na Riemannian geometry is defined with respect to an antecedent\nEuclidean geometry. There is no claim that an \\(n\\)-dimensional\nRiemannian geometry is to be obtained by a map from\nan \\(n\\)-dimensional subset of some Euclidean \\(N\\)-dimensional\nEuclidean space. This means that geometry can be done without\nreference to any Euclidean geometry: Euclidean geometry is no longer\nepistemologically prior to any study of other geometries. The reign of\nEuclid was—theoretically—over.  Given a concept of distance on a manifold it is possible to talk\nabout geodesics—a geodesic joining two points is a curve of\nshortest length between those two points. Existence and uniqueness\nquestions can be raised, and often answered. A significant advance was\nmade independently by Tullio Levi-Civita in 1917 and Hermann Weyl in\n1918, inspired by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, when they\nshowed how to define parallelism on a curved manifold (on\nLevi-Civita’s contribution, see Bottazzini 1999 and on Weyl’s\ncontribution see Scholz 2001). Roughly speaking, in Weyl’s\npresentation (1918), two vectors at different points are parallel if\nthey belong to a family of vectors along a curve that do not vary\nalong the curve. It is an effect of curvature that this definition is\nindependent of the family of vectors but depends on the curve unless\nthe curvature is zero; vectors on a typical manifold can only be said\nto be parallel along a curve.  The concept of distant parallelism allows a vector to be moved\nalong an arbitrary curve in a way that keeps it parallel to itself at\nevery point. This became referred to as a way of establishing a\nconnection between different points, and the theory became called the\ntheory of connections on manifolds. In particular, it is possible to\nask if a family of tangent vectors to a curve is composed of vectors\nparallel to the tangent vector at the starting point. If so, the curve\nis a natural candidate to be considered the straightest curve between\nits end points, because the tangent vector never accelerates along the\ncurve.  Connections can be defined independently of the metric, but if the\nmetric and the connection are compatible it can be shown that any\nsmall piece of this curve is the shortest curve joining its end\npoints, so the straightest curves on a manifold are the geodesics. In\nmodern differential geometry, geodesics are defined via\nconnections.  Riemann’s “Ueber die Hypothesen …”\n(given as a lecture in 1854, published posthumously in 1867) and\nBeltrami’s “Saggio” (1868) gave different but\nequivalent accounts of 2-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry by\ndescribing it as the geometry on the interior of a disc with a novel\nmetric. Riemann’s account, which was stated in \\(n\\) dimensions,\nagrees with the one that Poincaré was to use in many short publications in 1880 and 1881 but only describe explicitly in his major paper (Poincaré 1882). In this metric,\ngeodesics are arcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary of the\ndisc and angles are represented correctly. In Beltrami’s version,\ngeodesics are represented by straight line segments that are chords of\nthe disc. The Riemann and Beltrami discs swiftly persuaded\nmathematicians that the non-Euclidean geometry of Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did, after all, make rigorous mathematical\nsense. Poincaré’s contribution a decade later was to make\nnon-Euclidean geometry the natural geometry for certain topics\nelsewhere in mathematics, chiefly the developing and important subject\nof Riemann surfaces.  The importance of a rigorous account of any part of mathematics\nshould not be ignored, but the acceptance of Riemannian geometry in\nthe setting of non-Euclidean geometry went beyond the presentation of\na consistent formalism. It marks the acceptance of the view that\ngeometry is whatever can be described in the Riemannian formalism. The\ndoor is opened to the view that there are many geometries, each of\nwhich must be consistent, and none of which need to refer to Euclidean\ngeometry. The number of dimensions of the ‘space’ under\ndiscussion, the topological character of that ‘space’, and\nthe precise metric are all matters of indifference. There is a\n2-dimensional geometry of such-and-such a kind because a suitable\nmetric can be found; because there is, as it were, a map of it, not\nbecause a surface has been found in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) with the\nright properties. Indeed, it was later shown (Hilbert 1901) that there\nis no surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) corresponding precisely to\nnon-Euclidean 2-dimensional space.  Riemann was clear that the epistemological implications of this way\nof doing geometry were immense. Mathematicians should no longer need\nto abstract some fundamental intuitions from what they believe about\nphysical space, such as the nature and properties of straight lines or\ncircles, and seek to build a true geometry on the basis of some\naxiomatic expression of those intuitions. Rather, the direction of\nthought should go in the opposite direction: mathematicians were free\nto construct infinitely many geometries and to see which applied to\nphysical space. In this connection, it was soon shown that it is\npossible to do theoretical mechanics in the setting of non-Euclidean\ngeometry.  The epistemological significance of projective geometry rests on\nits implications for the nature and rigour of classical geometry. The\nepistemological significance of non-Euclidean geometry rests more on\nthe possibility that it could be true in whatever way that Euclidean\ngeometry could be true. We therefore turn to 19th century\nexaminations of the intelligibility of geometry.  Johann Friedrich Herbart became Kant’s successor in Königsberg in\n1808, where he remained until going to Göttingen in 1833, where he\ndied in 1841, but he was no orthodox Kantian. His major work, the\ntwo-volume Psychologie als Wissenschaft neu gegrundet auf\nErfahrung, Metaphysik, und Mathematik of 1824–1825, sought\nto ground psychology in philosophy, and treated experience and\nmetaphysics equally. Using some rather fanciful mathematics he\nendeavoured to show how memory works and how repeated stimuli of\ncertain kinds cause the brain to learn to perceive, for example,\nlines, parallel lines, intersecting lines, and surfaces. There are no\ninnate ideas, in Herbart’s opinion; visual space is constructed from\nexperience, most significantly by means of the conceptual act of\ninferring continuity in spatial processes. And concepts are generated\nby clusters of memories, upon which logic then operates independently\nof their origins. This was Herbart’s way of avoiding grounding logic\nin psychology.  Herbart’s ideas influenced Riemann (see Scholz 1982). Riemann\nregarded natural science as the attempt to understand nature by the\nuse of precise concepts, which are to be modified in the light of our\nexperience with them. He expected the most successful concepts to be\nquite abstract, and agreed with Herbart that they could not be a\npriori in the Kantian fashion. Moreover, it was their origin in\nperception that gave these concepts their significance for science. In\nnotes he wrote for himself (see Riemann Werke 1990:\n539) Riemann said\nthat he agreed with Herbart in matters of psychology and epistemology,\nbut not ontology or with his ideas about the construction of the\nconcepts of space, time, and motion. The disagreement masks a deeper\nsympathy. Herbart had advocated a three-dimensional real world of\ncausally connected but discrete monads, which the mind treats via the\nconcept of a continuum, which it supplies, thereby turning its\ndiscrete experiences into spectra of possibilities. Riemann saw no\nreason to restrict attention to three dimensions, and moved the\ncontinuous spectra of possibilities into the very general geometrical\nconcepts he was creating.  This diminished, or perhaps left behind, the role of experience\nthat Herbart had emphasised. Riemann was making conscious what Herbart\nhad said occurred naturally: if experience generates concepts with\nwhich we frame the world, then, said Riemann, let mathematics generate\nmore precise and flexible concepts with which to conduct science.  Riemann’s ideas in turn influenced Hermann von Helmholtz, who\npublished several influential essays on how our knowledge of geometry\nis possible. In his “Über die thatsächlichen Grundlagen der\nGeometrie” (1868) he endeavoured to show how only a limited\nnumber of Riemannian geometries can be constructed in which there is a\nconcept of rigid body motion. He argued that it is our experience of\nrigid bodies that teaches us what space is like, and in particular\nwhat distance is. He further claimed that a 2-dimensional space that\nadmits rigid body motions would either be the Euclidean plane or the\nsphere. Beltrami wrote to him to point out that he had overlooked the\npossibility of non-Euclidean geometry, and Helmholtz not only agreed,\nbut wrote a further essay (1870) in which he explained how it would be\npossible for us to have knowledge of this geometry in the Kantian\nsense (synthetic a priori). Many Kantians refused to be convinced,\nmost likely from a sense that Kant had surely believed that we have\nimpeccable knowledge of that kind about Euclidean geometry, but one\nperson that these ideas very likely influenced was Henri Poincaré (see\nGray 2012).  As soon as Poincaré began to write his popular philosophical essays\nabout geometry, he made it clear that his chief concern was with how\nwe could rely on any geometry at all. He was well aware of the great\nrange of Riemannian geometries, and of the conclusion of Helmholtz’s\nspeculations, by then made rigorous in the work of Sophus Lie, that a\nvery limited number of geometries admitted rigid body motions. His\nconcern in his “On the foundations of geometry” (1898) was\nwith epistemology.  Poincaré argued that the mind quickly realises that it can\ncompensate for certain kinds of motions that it sees. If a glass comes\ntowards you, you can walk backwards in such a way that the glass seems\nunaltered. You can do the same if it tilts or rotates. The mind comes\nto contain a store of these compensating motions, and it realises that\nit can follow one with another and the result will be a third\ncompensating motion. These mental acts form a mathematical object\ncalled a group. However, the mind cannot generate compensating motions\nfor other motions it sees, such as the motion of the wine in the glass\nas it swirls around. In this way the mind comes to form the concept of\na rigid body motion, that being precisely the motion for which the\nmind can form a compensating motion.  Poincaré then considered what group the group of compensating\nmotions could be, and found that, as Helmholtz had suggested and Lie\nhad then proved, there was a strictly limited collection of such\ngroups. Chief among them were the groups that come from Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometry, and as abstract groups they are different. But\nwhich one was correct?  Poincaré’s controversial view was that one could never know. Human\nbeings, through evolution and through our experience as infants, pick\nthe Euclidean group and so say that space is Euclidean. But another\nspecies, drawing on different experiences, could pick the\nnon-Euclidean group and so say that space was non-Euclidean. If we met\nsuch a species, there would be no experiment that would decide the\nissue.  One could imagine, he said, making large triangles and measuring\nthe angles. The sides of the triangle are, shall we say, made by rays\nof light. Let us suppose that within the limits of experimental error\nthe result of the experiment is that the angle sum of the triangle is\nless that \\(\\pi\\), a result consistent with non-Euclidean geometry but\ninconsistent with Euclidean geometry. The only conclusion one can\ndraw, said Poincaré, is that either light rays travel along straight\nlines and space is non-Euclidean or that space is Euclidean and light\nrays travel along curves.  We can summarise his argument this way. Our knowledge of the\ngeometry of the external world is founded on our mental ability to\ndeal with a group of rigid body motions. There is a very limited store\nof these groups, but no experiment can decide between them. All we can\ndo is make a choice, and we shall choose the simplest one. As it\nhappens, that was the Euclidean group, because, said Poincaré, we had\nfound that one of its properties not shared with the non-Euclidean\ngroup, was particularly simple. But the human species had, as it were,\nmade a choice, and that choice was now innate in the human\nmind. Because of the way knowledge is acquired and the fact that there\nis more than one appropriate group, we can never know whether space is\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean, only that we construct it as\nEuclidean.  This twist on the Kantian doctrine of the unknowability of\nthe Ding an sich (the thing in itself) and our confinement to\nthe world of appearances, was congenial to Poincaré as a working\nphysicist, but there is an important distinction to make. The\nviewpoint just explained is Poincaré’s philosophy of geometrical\nconventionalism. He advocated conventionalism in other areas of\nscience, arguing that what we call the laws of nature (Newton’s laws,\nthe conservation of energy, and so forth) were neither empirical\nmatters open to revision nor absolute truths but were well established\nresults that had been elevated to the role of axioms in present\nscientific theories. They could be challenged, but only if a whole\nscientific theory was being challenged, not idly when some awkward\nobservations were made. Faced with a satellite that did not seem to be\nobeying Newton’s laws one should, said Poincaré, consider some as-yet\nunnoticed force at work and not seek to re-write Newton. But a new\ntheory can be proposed, based on different assumptions that rewrite a\nlaw of nature, because these laws are not eternal truths—we\ncould never know such things. And if a new theory were to be proposed,\none can only choose between the new and the old on grounds of\nconvenience.  The crucial distinction here is that scientific conventionalism\noperates at a high level. The choices are made consciously and\nintellectually, the debate is only open to people with a considerable\namount of specialised education. Geometrical conventionalism operates\non the mind before it is capable of any kind of formal instruction,\nand if it did not operate the unfortunate subject would be incapable\nof any knowledge of the external world.  Poincaré’s views brought him into collision with Bertrand Russell\nin the 1890s when he was emerging from his brief Hegelian phase and\nentering his Kantian phase. Russell was trying to establish the\nKantian a priori by arguing that there is one fundamental geometry,\nwhich is projective geometry, and we have synthetic a priori knowledge\nof it (see Griffin 1991 on Russell and Nabonnand 2000 on the\ncontroversy).  There can be little doubt that Poincaré, with his much greater\ncommand of mathematics, won much of the debate, as Russell, with his\ncharacteristic willingness to admit his errors, was willing to\nconcede. But a significant difference of approach between them was\nnever to be resolved. Poincaré’s analysis began with the idea of rigid\nbodies, from which a concept of distance is created. Russell argued on\nthe contrary, that whatever we may discover the concept of distance to\nbe we know before we begin that the distance from London to Paris is\nmore than a metre. This Poincaré denied in his “Des\nfondements de la géométrie: à propos d’un livre de\nM. Russell” (1899).  In Poincaré’s view, we only know what the distance from one point\nto another is when we have found out what rigid bodies do, and this\nknowledge has become innate in us. In Russell’s view, no discussion of\nthe concept of distance could even contemplate that the distance from\nLondon to Paris is less than a metre—we would know we were not\ntalking about distance if we said something like that. Poincaré\ninsisted that talk of what we know should always be dependent on how\nwe know it; without such an analysis the claims were not knowledge\nclaims at all. Russell wanted distance to be regarded as a fundamental\nintuition.  A mathematical illustration may illuminate the disagreement. For\nPoincaré, talk about what we might call ordinary geometry, the sense\nof space that we have prior to advanced instruction, is really about\nthe ability we have to measure things. We can carry a rigid body\naround, and use it as a ruler. It is because we can do that that we\ncan speak of the distance between places. If you want to make the\nset-up more abstract, there must be a space and a group that acts on\nthe space and moves points in the space around. If this group has the\nproperty that however a region of that space is moved around it is\nnever mapped onto a proper subset of itself then one can construct\nrigid bodies and talk about distance.  For Russell, one is free to take a space and assign a\n‘distance’ to each pair of points (subject to some simple\nrules which I omit). Relative to this sense of distance, one can say\nif, as a region is moved around, points in it remain the same distance\napart or not. We have done this for our sense of distance on the\nsurface of the Earth, and we can do this whether or not we also have\nsome rigid body motions. In mathematical terms, Russell would be happy\nwith what is called a metric space. The point is not that one could\nimpose a metric on the surface of the Earth in which a particular pair\nof points, say in Cambridge, were a metre apart and London and Paris\nwere only half a metre apart—one could—but that one can\ntalk about distance without presupposing the action of a group. Some\nmetric spaces admit the action of groups that preserve distance,\nothers do not, but distance can be defined without talking about a\ngroup. Poincaré was never confronted with exactly this\nargument—metric spaces are an invention of the 20th\ncentury—but we know what he would have said. He would have said\nthat it was valid mathematics but entirely formal and could not be\nconsidered as genuine knowledge because it lacked a psychological\ndimension. We know this because it was his criticism of the axiomatic\ngeometries constructed by Hilbert (see below).  Poincaré’s arguments also met with objections from the Italian\nmathematician Federigo Enriques. Poincaré had argued that one way to\nsee the validity of the geometrical conventionalist argument was to\nconsider a disc in which everything was made of the same material,\nwhich expanded as it heated, and in which the temperature was a\nparticular function of the distance of the centre of the disc. This\nfunction, which Poincaré specified, ensured that the metric in the\ndisc, as measured by rods made of the same material as the disc, was\nthat of non-Euclidean geometry. Creatures living in the disc would\nreport that their space was non-Euclidean; we would reply that there\nspace was Euclidean but subject to the distorting effect of\ntemperature field. Plainly each side can maintain their position free\nof self-contradiction.  Enriques argued, in his Problemi della Scienza (1906),\nthat this was unreasonable. The creatures would be right to ascribe a\ngeometry to their space (and, indeed, non-Euclidean geometry) because\nthe distorting force is beyond their control. Their geodesics are\nbuilt in to the space, and it would be unreasonable of them to ascribe\nthe paths of geodesics to the operation of a ‘force’\nbecause that ‘force’ was not something they could even in\nprinciple manipulate. Heat, the gravitational effect of massive\nobjects, all these distorting influences are things that can be\nallowed for, because they can be changed. If, in the experiment above,\nit were to be claimed that space is Euclidean but our candidates for\nstraight lines are deformed it should be possible to vary the degree\nof deformation. One might conduct the experiment further away from any\nmassive objects, in emptier regions of space. If different experiments\ngave even slightly different results one would, in accordance with\nPoincaré’s own criteria for changing scientific conventions, look for\nsomething in the circumstances that was responsible for the deviation\nof the light rays from straightness. But if all experiments agreed,\nEnriques argued that it would be rational to conclude that light rays\ntravelled on geodesics and the geometry of space was\nnon-Euclidean.  It is also worth noticing that the growing sophistication of ideas\nabout how theoretical geometry relates to practical experience, and\nabout the nature of the knowledge that geometry supplies, belong to a\nfamily of changes across all of mathematics by 1900. An autonomous\ndiscipline of mathematics emerged that placed an increasing emphasis\non formal aspects of the subject and offered a complicated and often\ndistant relationship with the world of experience. This modernist turn\nin mathematics is discussed in various places (see Gray 2008 and the\nliterature cited there).  This essay has examined the main branches in the development of\ngeometry until the early years of the 20th century under\nthe headings of theoretical or abstract knowledge, empirical and other\nanalyses of the intelligibility of such knowledge, and the deductive\ncharacter of that knowledge.  The status of the straight line in elementary Euclidean geometry as\nboth the shortest curve joining any two of its points and as the curve\nthat points always in the same direction was disentangled. One line of\nenquiry led to geometries that emphasised straightness as the\nfundamental property (typically, projective geometry) and the other to\ngeometries that emphasised the shortest aspect. The former approach\nwas seen from the start as a non-metrical one, and became the favoured\narena for formal, even axiomatic investigations of geometry as a\ndeductive enterprise. The price was having less and less to say about\nphysical space (as Poincaré observed). The concept of geometry was\nradically enlarged, but in ways that were not intended to be accounts\nof an intelligible space.  The metrical account led to a progressive elucidation of a\nsignificant obscurity in Euclid’s Elements: the parallel\npostulate. For much of the 19th century, this was the only\nalternative to Euclid’s that was proposed as an intelligible geometry,\neven though it was generally agreed that only the most delicate\nexperiments could hope to decide the matter. Poincaré’s contested view\nwas that no experiment could so decide, and this raised important\nissues about the way abstract terms are to be interpreted.  Beyond the eye-catching idea of one alternative to Euclid’s system\nof geometry, which had stood for two thousand years, there was the\npanoply of metrical geometries hinted at in Gauss’s work on\ndifferential geometry and elaborated by Riemann. Here it finally\nproved possible to explain the relationship between straightest and\nshortest in a suitably general setting. It also became possible to\ndiscuss geometry as a body of ideas that grew out of naive ideas of\nlength, angle, shape, and size, and to do so in a sophisticated and\nrigorous way without appealing to axioms, whether or not those axioms\nwere intended as distillations of intelligible experience. In this\nway, it became possible to apply geometrical ideas in novel settings\nand in novel ways.  By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, it\nwas clear that Euclidean geometry had lost its pre-eminent\nposition. There were better formal, axiomatic systems (such as those\nproposed by Hilbert and some mathematicians in the school around\nPeano). There were rich systems that were more fundamental, in the\nsense of using fewer properties of the figures of traditional geometry\nsuch as the straight line (the many versions of projective\ngeometry). And there was a profusion of metrical geometries with more\nnatural starting points and deeper theories.  As a result, ideas about how theoretical geometry of whatever kind\nrelates to the space around us had become much more sophisticated. The\ntruth of geometry was no longer to be taken for granted, but had\nbecome in some measure empirical, and philosophical ideas about the\nintelligibility of geometry had also deepened.
