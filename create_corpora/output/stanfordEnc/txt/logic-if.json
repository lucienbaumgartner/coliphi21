In it, more quantifier dependencies\nand independencies can be expressed than in first-order logic. Its\nquantifiers range over individuals only; semantically IF first-order\nlogic, however, has the same expressive power as existential\nsecond-order logic. IF logic lacks certain metaproperties that\nfirst-order logic has (axiomatizability, Tarski-type semantics). On\nthe other hand, IF logic admits a self-applied truth-predicate –\na property that first-order logic notoriously does not enjoy.\nPhilosophical issues discussed in connection with IF logic include\nreformulating the logicist program, the question of truth in axiomatic\nset theory, and the nature of negation. Work in IF logic has also\ninspired alternative generalizations of first-order logic: slash logic\nand\n dependence logic.\n \nIn mathematical prose, one can say things such as ‘for all real\nnumbers \\(a\\) and for all positive real numbers \\(\\varepsilon\\), there\nexists a positive real number \\(\\delta\\) depending on \\(\\varepsilon\\)\nbut not on \\(a\\), such that…’ What is important here is\nquantifier dependence. The existential quantifier ‘there exists\n\\(\\delta\\)’ is said to depend on the universal quantifier\n‘for all \\(\\varepsilon\\)’ but not on the universal\nquantifier ‘for all \\(a\\).’ It was an essential part of\nKarl Weierstrass’s (1815–1897) work in the foundations of\nanalysis that he defined the notions of limit, continuity, and\nderivative in terms of quantifier\n dependence.[1] For\n a concrete example, a function \\(f : D \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\)\nis continuous, if for all \\(a\\) in the set \\(D\\) and for all\n\\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) there exists \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that for all\n\\(x\\) in \\(D\\), if \\(|x - a| \\lt \\delta\\), then \\(|f(x) - f(a)| \\lt \\varepsilon\\). The definition of uniform\ncontinuity is obtained from that of continuity by specifying that\nthe quantifer ‘there exists \\(\\delta\\)’ depends only on\nthe quantifier ‘for all \\(\\varepsilon\\),’ not on the\nquantifier ‘for all \\(a\\).’[2] \nIndependence friendly first-order logic (a.k.a. IF\nfirst-order logic, IF logic) was introduced by Jaakko\nHintikka and Gabriel Sandu in their article ‘Informational\nIndependence as a Semantical Phenomenon’ (1989); other early\nsources are Hintikka’s booklet Defining Truth, the Whole\nTruth, and Nothing but the Truth (1991) and Sandu’s Ph.D.\nthesis\n (1991).[3]\n IF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, involving\na specific syntactic device ‘/’ (slash, independence\nindicator), which has at the object language level the same effect as\nthe meta-level modifier ‘but does not depend on’ has in\nthe example just considered. In the notation of IF logic, the logical\nform of the statement that a function \\(f\\) is uniformly\ncontinuous would be\n\\((\\forall a)(\\forall \\varepsilon)(\\exists \\delta /\\forall a)(\\forall x)\nR\\), to be contrasted with the form of the statement that\n\\(f\\) merely is continuous,\n\\((\\forall a)(\\forall \\varepsilon)(\\exists \\delta)(\\forall x)\nR\\).  If in a first-order sentence an existential quantifier \\(\\exists\ny\\) lies in the syntactic scope of a universal quantifier \\(\\forall\nx\\), then by the semantics \\(\\exists y\\) automatically depends on\n\\(\\forall x\\). This is so e.g. with the sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y) R(x, y)\\). The dependence of \\(\\exists y\\) on \\(\\forall\nx\\) means that the witness of \\(\\exists y\\) may vary with the\nvalue interpreting \\(\\forall x\\). It suffices that there be a function\n\\(f\\) such that \\(R(a, f(a))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for any \\(a\\)\ninterpreting \\(\\forall x\\). Such functions, spelling out the\ndependencies of witnesses for existential quantifiers on\ninterpretations of universal quantifiers, are known in logical\nliterature as Skolem\n functions.[4]\n For comparison, in the sentence \\((\\exists y)(\\forall x) R(x, y)\\)\nthe quantifier \\(\\exists y\\) does not depend on the quantifier\n\\(\\forall x.\\) One and the same witness \\(c\\) for \\(\\exists y\\) must\nbe good against any interpretation \\(a\\) of \\(\\forall x\\), so that\n\\(R(a, c)\\) holds in \\(M\\). The corresponding Skolem function is a\n constant.[5] \nIn IF first-order logic, syntactic scopes no longer determine the\nsemantic relation of dependence. In the formula \\((\\forall x)(\\forall\ny)(\\exists z/\\forall y) R(x, y, z)\\), for instance, \\(\\exists z\\) is\nsyntactically subordinate to both \\(\\forall x\\) and \\(\\forall y\\), but\nis marked as independent of \\(\\forall y\\), and is hence dependent only\non \\(\\forall x\\). Semantically this means that the witness of\n\\(\\exists z\\) must be given by a function taking as an argument the\ninterpretation of \\(\\forall x\\), but not that of \\(\\forall y\\). In\norder for \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\exists z/\\forall y) R(x, y, z)\\)\nto be true in \\(M\\), there must be a function \\(f\\) of one argument\nsuch that \\(R(a, b, f(a))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for any \\(a\\) interpreting\n\\(\\forall x\\) and any \\(b\\) interpreting \\(\\forall y\\). \nWhat is gained with the slash notation? After all, clearly e.g.\n\\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\exists z/\\forall y)\nR(x, y, z)\\) is true in a model\n\\(M\\)\n iff[6]\n the first-order sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists z)(\\forall y)\nR(x, y, z)\\) is true therein. As a\nmatter of fact, the expressive power of IF logic exceeds that of\nfirst-order logic. Consider the sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists w/\\forall x)\nR(x, y, z, w)\\). Its\ntruth-condition is of the following form: there are one-argument\nfunctions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) such that \\(R(a,\nf(a), b, g(b))\\) holds in\n\\(M\\), for any \\(a\\) interpreting \\(\\forall x\\) and\n\\(b\\) interpreting\n \\(\\forall z\\).[7]\n So the sentence is true iff the following sentence (*) containing a\nfinite partially ordered quantifier is true: \nFor, by definition (*) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff the second-order\nsentence \\((\\exists f)(\\exists g)(\\forall x)(\\forall z) R(x, f(x), z,\ng(z))\\) is true therein. The latter may be termed the\nSkolem normal form of (*). It says that Skolem functions\nproviding witnesses for the quantifiers \\(\\exists y\\) and\n\\(\\exists w\\) in (*) exist. Finite partially ordered quantifiers\n– a.k.a. Henkin quantifiers or branching\nquantifiers – were proposed by Leon Henkin (1961) and have\nbeen subsequently studied\n extensively.[8]\n They are two-dimensional syntactic objects \nwhere each \\(Q_{ij}\\) is either \\(\\exists x_{ij}\\) or \\(\\forall\nx_{ij}\\). They are naturally interpreted by making systematic use of\nSkolem functions. \nLet us denote by \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) the logic of finite partially\nordered quantifiers obtained from first-order logic as follows: if\n\\(\\phi\\) is a first-order formula and \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is a finite\npartially ordered quantifier, then \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\phi\\) is a\nformula of\n \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\).[9]\n With \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) it is possible to express properties that\nare not definable in first-order logic. The first example was provided\nby Andrzej Ehrenfeucht (cf. Henkin 1961): a sentence that is true in a\nmodel iff the size of its domain is infinite. It turns out that\n\\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) can be translated into IF logic (see\nSubsect. 4.1). Therefore IF logic is more expressive than\nfirst-order logic. \nThe deepest reason for IF logic, as Hintikka sees it, is that the\nrelations of dependence and independece between quantifiers\nare the only way of expressing relations of dependence and independece\nbetween variables on the first-order level (Hintikka 1996:\n34–35, 73–74; 2002a: 404–405; 2006a: 71, 515). To\nunderstand this remark properly, recall that relations of quantifier\n(in)dependence are semantic relations, but syntactically\nexpressed. More precisely, in IF logic the (in)dependence\nrelations are syntactically expressed by the interplay of two factors:\nsyntactic scope and the independence indicator ‘/’. In a\ngiven sentence, an existential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\), say,\ndepends on precisely those universal quantifiers within whose scope\n\\(\\exists x\\) lies, but of which \\(\\exists x\\) is not marked\nas independent using the slash sign. What Hintikka means when he\nspeaks of (in)dependence relations between variables, are\nfunctional dependencies between quantities in a model. The\nkinetic energy of a material body depends on its mass and its speed,\nbut does not depend on the particular material body being considered.\nThis fact can be expressed in IF logic by the sentence \n\\((\\forall b)(\\forall m)(\\forall v)(\\exists e/\\forall b)\\)(if\n\\(b\\) is a material body which moves at the velocity \\(v\\)\nand has the mass \\(m\\), then the kinetic energy \\(e\\) of\n\\(b\\) equals \\(\\frac{1}{2} mv^2 )\\).\n \nThat this sentence states the existence of a functional dependence of\nkinetic energy on mass and speed is particularly clearly seen from the\nfact that if the sentence is true, the unique Skolem function for the\nquantifier \\(\\exists e\\) actually is the physical law\nconnecting masses, speeds and kinetic energies (cf. Hintikka 1996:\n34–35). \nWhile first-order logic can only express some relations between\nvariables, IF first-order logic with its greater expressive power can\nexpress more. Actually, IF logic is calculated to capture all such\nrelations (Hintikka 1996: 75–77; 2002a: 404–405; 2002b:\n197; 2006a: 72). This idea must, in its full generality, be seen as\nprogrammatic. For a more general framework, cf. Hintikka (2006a: 515,\n536, 752; 2008), Sandu & Sevenster (2010), Sandu (2013). \nAmong philosophical issues that have been addressed in connection with\nIF logic are the reconstruction of mathematical reasoning on the\nfirst-order level (Hintikka 1996, 1997), definability of a\nself-applied truth predicate (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2001; Sandu 1998),\ntruth and axiomatic set theory (Hintikka 1996, 2004a), and insights\ninto the nature of negation (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2002; Hintikka &\nSandu 1989; Sandu 1994). These issues will be discussed in\nSections 4 and 5. \nInspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein’s idea of a language-game,\nHintikka (1968) introduced the basic framework of what came to be\nknown as game-theoretical semantics (a.k.a. GTS). The basic\nlesson Hintikka adopts from Wittgenstein is that words – in\nparticular quantifiers – are associated with activities that\nrender them meaningful: words often have meaning only in the context\nof certain types of action (Hintikka 1968: 55–56). Wittgenstein\nsaid that by ‘language-game’ he means ‘the whole,\nconsisting of language and the actions into which it is woven’\n(Wittgenstein 1953: I, Sect. 7). \nIt becomes natural to ask which are the activities that go together\nwith quantifiers. As Hintikka explains (see Hintikka 2006a: 41, 67),\nWittgenstein had taken it as a criterion for something to be an object\nthat it can be looked for and found. Applying this idea to quantifiers\nwith such objects as values, Hintikka was led to formulate\nsemantic games for quantifiers. Crucially, these semantic\ngames can be formulated as games in the strict sense of game theory;\nbut at the same time they are exact codifications of language-games in\nWittgenstein’s sense, at least if one accepts that the\nactivities associated with quantifiers are ‘looking for’\nand\n ‘finding.’[10] \nSemantic games \\(G(\\phi , M)\\) for first-order sentences \\(\\phi\\) are\ntwo-player zero-sum games of perfect information, played on a given\nmodel \\(M\\). Let us call the two players simply player 1 and player\n 2.[11] \n The games\nare most easily explained for sentences in prenex normal form: a\nstring of quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free first-order\nformula. Universal quantifiers mark a move of player 1, while\nexistential quantifiers prompt a move by player 2. In both cases, the\nrelevant player must choose an individual from the domain \\(\\rM\\) of\n \\(M\\).[12] If \nthe game is played as follows. First, player 1 picks out an individual\n\\(a\\), whereafter player 2 chooses an individual \\(b\\). Then player 1\nproceeds to choose a further individual \\(c\\), to which player 2\nresponds by picking out an individual \\(d\\). Thereby a play of the\ngame has come to an end. The tuple \\((a, b, c, d)\\) of individuals\nchosen determines the winner of the play. If the quantifier-free\nformula \\(R(a, b, c, d)\\) holds in \\(M\\), player 2 wins, if not,\nplayer 1 wins. \nThe fact that one of the players wins a single play of game \\(G(\\phi ,\nM)\\) does not yet tell us anything about the truth-value of the\nsentence \\(\\phi\\). Truth and falsity are characterized in terms of the\nnotion of winning strategy. The sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists w) R(x, y, z, w)\\) is\ntrue in \\(M\\) if there is a winning strategy for player\n2 in the game just described: a recipe telling player 2 what to do,\nwhen (a specified amount of) information about the opponent’s\nearlier moves is given. Technically, the requirement is that there be\nstrategy functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), such that for\nany choices \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) by player \\(1,\nR(a, f(a), c, g(a, c))\\) holds in \\(M\\). Observe that\nstrategy function \\(f\\) is a Skolem function for the quantifier\n\\(\\exists y\\) in \\(\\phi\\), and similarly \\(g\\) is a Skolem\nfunction for the quantifier \\(\\exists w\\). The sentence \\(\\phi\\) is\nfalse in \\(M\\) if there is a winning strategy (set of\nstrategy functions) for player 1 in the corresponding game: a constant\n\\(c\\) and a function \\(h\\) such that for any choices \\(b\\) and \\(d\\)\nby player \\(2, R(c, b, h(b), d)\\) fails to hold in \\(M\\). \nGame-theoretical interpretaton of quantifiers was already suggested by\nHenkin (1961; cf. Hintikka 1968: 64). Henkin also pointed out, in\neffect, the connection between a full set of Skolem functions and a\nwinning strategy for player 2. Hintikka (1968) noted that conjunctions\nare naturally interpreted by a choice between the two conjuncts, made\nby player 1; similarly, disjunctions can be interpreted by a choice by\nplayer 2 between the two\n disjuncts.[13]\n Further, Hintikka proposed to interpret negation as a transposition\nof the roles of ‘verifier’ and ‘falsifier’\n(for more details, see Subsect. 3.2).  \nThe game-theoretical description of semantic games does not mention\nthe activities of searching and finding; for such an abstract\ndescription it suffices to speak of the players making a move. Also,\nthe characterization of truth and falsity as the existence of a\nwinning strategy for player 2 and player 1, respectively, does not\nrefer to efforts on the part of the players – say efforts to\nestablish truth or to find witnesses. The truth or falsity of a\nsentence is a matter of ‘combinatorics’: it is an issue of\nthe existence of a set of functions with certain properties (cf.\nHintikka 1968, 1996; Hodges 2013). So what happened to the original\nphilosophical conception according to which the meanings of\nquantifiers are tied to the activities of searching and finding?\nHintikka’s idea is that asserting a sentence involving\nquantifiers is to make a claim about what can and what cannot happen\nwhen a certain language-game is played; using language involving\nquantifiers requires mastering the rules of the corresponding semantic\ngames (Hintikka 1968: Sect. 8, 1996: 128, 2006a: 538). What\nis the content of such a claim in connection with the sentence\n\\(\\forall x\\exists y R(x, y)\\)? That whichever individual player 1\nchooses from the domain for \\(\\forall x\\), player 2 can find a witness\nindividual for \\(\\exists y\\). In other words, given a value for\n\\(\\forall x\\) (which itself can be seen as the result of the search by\nplayer 1), if player 2 is allowed to search free from any practical\nconstraints, she will find a value for \\(\\exists y\\) so that player 2\nwins the resulting play. Even though semantic games themselves can be\ndefined without recourse to activities such as looking for or finding,\nthese activities play an important conceptual role when the language\nuser reasons about these games. \nHintikka (1973a) initiated the application of GTS to the study of\nnatural language. This work was continued notably by Hintikka &\nKulas (1983, 1985), where game-theoretical rules for such items as\nnegation, anaphoric pronouns, genitives, tenses, intensional verbs,\ncertain prepositional constructions, and proper names were given, and\nthe distinction between abstract meaning and strategic meaning\n drawn.[14] \nThe framework of GTS enables asking questions of a game-theoretical\nnature about semantic evaluation. Hintikka (1973a) observed that\nsemantic games with imperfect information are devised without any\ndifficulty. As logical examples he used \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\)\nsentences. (For examples related to natural languages, see\nSubsect. 5.4.) \nFrom the vantage point of GTS, independence friendly first-order logic\ndiffers from first-order logic in that semantic games correlated with\nformulas of the former are, in general, games of imperfect\ninformation, while any game associated with a first-order formula is a\ngame of perfect information. Consider the game for \\(\\forall x\\exists\ny\\forall z(\\exists w/\\forall x) R(x, y, z, w)\\), played on a model\n\\(M\\). A play of this game proceeds exactly as plays of the game\ncorresponding to \\(\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z\\exists w R(x, y, z,\nw)\\). First, player 1 chooses an individual \\(a\\), whereafter player 2\nchooses an individual \\(b\\). Then player 1 proceeds to pick out a\nfurther individual \\(c\\), to which player 2 responds by choosing an\nindividual \\(d\\). So a play of the game has come to an end. The play\nis won by player 2, if indeed \\(R(a, b,c, d)\\) holds in \\(M\\);\notherwise it is won by player 1. But \\(\\exists w\\) was marked as\nindependent of \\(\\forall x\\) – why does not this fact show in\nany way in the course of a play? \nOne might be tempted to add to the description of a play:\n‘player 2 chooses a value for \\(\\exists w\\) in ignorance of the\nvalue for \\(\\forall x\\).’ However, such a paraphrase would not\nclarify the conceptual situation. It makes no sense to speak of the\nindependence of a move from other given moves by reference to a single\nplay; this can only be done by reference to a multitude of\nplays. Quantifier independence can be conceptualized in\ngame-theoretical terms making use of the notion of strategy.\nIn the example, a strategy of player 2 is a set \\(\\{f, g\\}\\) of\nstrategy functions, function \\(f\\) providing a value for \\(\\exists y\\)\ndepending on the value of \\(\\forall x\\), and function \\(g\\) providing\na value for \\(\\exists w\\) depending on the value chosen for \\(\\forall\nz\\) but not on the value chosen for \\(\\forall x\\). The strategy \\(\\{f,\ng\\}\\) is, then, a winning strategy for player 2, iff \\(R(a, f(a), c,\ng(c))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for all values \\(a\\) chosen for \\(\\forall x\\)\nand \\(c\\) chosen for \\(\\forall z\\). One precise way of implementing\nthe idea that player 2 is ‘ignorant’ of the move player 1\nmade for \\(\\forall x\\) is to say that (a) strategy\nfunctions always only take as arguments the opponent’s moves,\nand (b) the strategy function corresponding to\n\\(\\exists w\\) may not take as its argument the move player 1 made for\n\\(\\forall x\\). \nA sentence of IF first-order logic is by definition true in a model\n\\(M\\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in the\ncorrelated game, and false iff there is a winning strategy for player\n1 in the correlated game. There are sentences which under these\ncriteria are neither true nor false; they are called\nnon-determined (see Subsect. 3.3). \nIn Hintikka’s judgement, the game-theoretical semantics of\nquantifiers can be taken to have the same rationale that was mentioned\nas the deepest reason for IF first-order logic at the end of\nSection 1: GTS is a method of representing, on the\nfirst-order level, the (in)dependence relations between variables by\nmeans of informational (in)dependence in the sense of game theory\n(Hintikka 1991: 12–13, 2006a: 535). \nIn the literature one can find essentially different formulations of\n‘IF first-order logic.’ The differences are not restricted\nto syntax – examples of applying different semantic ideas can be\nfound as well.  \nAs already noted, there is a systematic connection between the Skolem\nfunctions and strategy functions of player 2. A Skolem function for an\nexistential quantifier is a function of the values assigned to the\npreceding universal quantifiers, but not a function\nof the values assigned to the preceding existential\n quantifiers.[15]\n Skolem functions are strategy functions taking as arguments\nexclusively moves made by player 1. Generally a strategy for a player\nin a two-player game can perfectly well make use of the\nprevious choices of either player. Hodges (2007) stresses that it\nmakes a difference on which notion – Skolem function or strategy\nfunction – the semantics of imperfect information is based.\nHodges (1997a) adopted the notational convention of writing, say,\n\\((\\exists y/x)\\) where Hintikka writes\n\\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\), hence marking the difference\nbetween semantic games formulated in terms of arbitrary strategy\nfunctions and those whose strategy functions are in effect Skolem\nfunctions; the variable \\(x\\) in \\((\\exists y/x)\\)\ncan be ‘bound’ by any syntactically preceding quantifier\ncarrying the variable \\(x\\). Hodges proposed to employ the former\nformulation, while in Hintikka (1991, 1995, 1996, 2002) and Sandu\n(1993, 1994) the latter formulation is employed. Hodges (2007: 119)\nwrites: \nThe distinction that Hodges makes between slash logic and IF logic\nserves to bring order to the mishmash of different formulations of IF\nfirst-order logic to be found in the\n literature.[16] \nIF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic. Now, any\nfirst-order formula is equivalent to a first-order formula in which no\nvariable occurs both free and bound, and in which no two nested\nquantifiers carry the same variable. Formulas meeting these two\nsyntactic conditions will be termed regular. Henceforth we\nsystematically restrict attention to regular first-order\n formulas.[17]\n A vocabulary (signature, non-logical terminology) is any\ncountable set \\(\\tau\\) of relation symbols (each of which carries a fixed\narity), function symbols (again each with a fixed arity), and constant\nsymbols. The first-order logic of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) will be referred to\nas \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\). A formula of \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\)\nis in negation normal form, if all occurrences of the\nnegation symbol \\({\\sim}\\) immediately precede an atomic formula. The set of\nformulas of IF first-order logic of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) (or\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau])\\) can be defined as the smallest set such\nthat: \nClauses (2) and (3) allow the degenerate case that the list of\nuniversal quantifiers is empty \\((n = 0)\\). The resulting expressions\n\\((\\exists x\\)/) and \\((\\vee\\)/) are identified with the usual\nexistential quantifier \\((\\exists x)\\) and the usual disjunction\n\\(\\vee\\), respectively. Similar stipulations are made about clauses\n(4) and (5). \nIn a suitable vocabulary, each of the following is a formula: \nBy contrast, none of the following sequences of symbols is a\nformula: \nIf \\(\\phi\\) is an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula, generated by the above\nclauses from some \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) formula \\(\\phi^*\\), the free\nvariables of \\(\\phi\\) are simply the free variables of\n\\(\\phi^*\\).  \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas without free variables are\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\n sentences.[18] \nDefining the semantics of a logic using GTS is a two-step process. The\nfirst step is to define the relevant semantic games. The\nsecond step is to define the notions of ‘true’ and\n‘false’ in terms of the semantic games; this happens by\nreference to the notion of winning strategy. Semantic games\nmay be defined by specifying recursively the alternative ways in which\na game associated with a given formula \\(\\phi\\) can be\n begun.[19] \nFor every vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\phi\\),\nmodel \\((\\tau\\) structure) \\(M\\), and variable assignment \\(g\\), a\ntwo-player zero-sum game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) between player 1 and\nplayer 2 is \n associated.[20] \n If \\(g\\) is a variable assignment, \\(g[x/a]\\) is the variable\nassignment which is otherwise like \\(g\\) but maps the variable \\(x\\)\nto the object \\(a\\). \nObserve that the independence indications play no role in the game\nrules. Indeed, quantifier independence will be implemented on the\nlevel of strategies.  \nIf a token of \\((\\vee /\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) or\n\\((\\exists x/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) appears in the\nformula \\(\\phi\\) in the scope of the universal quantifiers \\(\\forall\ny_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n,\\forall z_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall z_m\\) (and only\nthese universal quantifiers), a strategy function of player 2\nfor this token in game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is any function \\(f\\)\nsatisfying the following: \nThe arguments of \\(f\\) are the elements\n\\(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_m\\) that\nplayer 1 has chosen so as to interpret the quantifiers\n\\(\\forall z_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall z_m\\).\nThe value \\(f(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_m)\\) is the left or the right disjunct\nwhen the token is a disjunction; and an element of the domain when the\ntoken is an existential quantifier.\n \nThe notion of the strategy function of player 1 for tokens of\n\\((\\wedge /\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) and \\((\\forall\nx/\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) can be defined dually. Strategy\nfunctions are construed as Skolem functions – the more general\nnotion of strategy function operative in slash logic is not considered\nhere (cf. the beginning of\nSect. 3 and Subsect. 6.1). Quantifier indepenence\nwill be implemented directly in terms of the arguments of the\nstrategy functions. \nA strategy of player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is a set\n\\(F\\) of her strategy functions, one function for each token of\n\\((\\vee /\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) and \\((\\exists x/\\forall\ny_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) appearing in \\(\\phi\\). Player 2 is said\nto follow the strategy \\(F\\), if for each token of \\((\\vee\n/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) and \\((\\exists x/\\forall y_1\n,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) for which she must make a move when game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is played, she makes the move determined by the\ncorresponding strategy function. A winning strategy for\nplayer 2 in \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is a strategy \\(F\\) such that against\nany sequence of moves by player 1, following strategy \\(F\\) yields a\nwin for player 2. The notions of strategy and winning strategy can be\nsimilarly defined for \n player 1.[21] \nThe satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) in the model \\(M\\) under the\nassignment \\(g\\) are then defined as\n follows:[22] \nAs with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), variable assignments do not affect the\n(dis)satisfaction of sentences, i.e., formulas containing no\nfree variables. Indeed, we may\n define:[23] \nThe fact that \\(\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) will be denoted by ‘\\(M\n\\vDash \\phi\\).’ Writing \\(M \\not\\vDash \\phi\\) indicates, then,\nthat \\(\\phi\\) is not true in \\(M\\). This does\nnot mean that \\(\\phi\\) would in the above-defined sense be false\nin \\(M\\). As mentioned in the end of Section 2, there\nare semantic games in which neither player has a winning strategy. \nThe syntax of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be generalized by removing the\nrestriction according to which the negation sign may only appear as\nprefixed to an atomic\n formula.[24].\n In order to interpret negation in GTS, two roles are added\nas a new ingredient in the specification of the games: those of\n‘verifier’ and ‘falsifier.’ Initially player 1\nhas the role of ‘falsifier’ and player 2 that of\n‘verifier.’ The roles may get switched, but only for one\nreason: when negation is encountered. All clauses defining semantic\ngames must be rephrased in terms of roles instead of players. It is\nthe player whose role is ‘verifier’ who makes a move for\ndisjunctions and existential quantifiers, and similarly the player\nwhose role is ‘falsifier’ who moves for conjunctions and\nuniversal quantifiers. When a formula \\({\\sim}\\psi\\) is encountered, the\nplayers change roles and the game continues with \\(\\psi\\). Finally, if\nthe encountered atomic formula is true, ‘verifier’ wins\nand ‘falsifier’ loses, otherwise the payoffs are reversed.\nThe negation \\({\\sim}\\) is variably referred to as strong negation,\ndual negation, or game-theoretical\n negation.[25]\n It works as one would expect: \\(\\phi\\) is false in \\(M\\) iff its\nnegation \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is true therein (cf. Sandu 1993).  \nFailure of bivalence. There are sentences \\(\\phi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and models \\(M\\) such that \\(\\phi\\) is neither true\nnor false in \\(M\\). Consider evaluating the sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y/\\forall x) x = y\\) on a model whose domain has exactly\ntwo elements, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Player 1 has no winning strategy. If he\nchooses \\(a\\) to interpret \\(\\forall x\\), he loses the play in which\nplayer 2 chooses \\(a\\) to interpret \\((\\exists y/\\forall\nx)\\). Similarly, if player 1 chooses \\(b\\), he loses the play in which\nplayer 2 likewise chooses \\(b\\). Neither does player 2 have a winning\nstrategy. Her strategy functions for \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) are\nconstants (zero-place functions). There are two such constants\navailable: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Whichever one of these strategy functions\nplayer 2 assumes, there is a move by player 1 defeating it.  If player\n2 opts for \\(a\\), player 1 wins the play in which he chooses \\(b\\);\nand if player 2 applies \\(b\\), player 1 wins the play in which he\nchooses \\(a\\). Game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\) is non-determined:\nneither player has a winning \n strategy.[26] \n The notion of non-determinacy may be extended to formulas as well: \nIn \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), falsity does not ensue from non-truth. That\nis, bivalence fails in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). However, it should be\nnoted that it does not fail due to the postulation of a third\ntruth-value or a truth-value gap (cf. Hintikka 1991: 20,\n 55).[27]\n Rather, the failure is a consequence of the basic assumptions of the\nentire semantic theory (GTS). Non-determinacy corresponds to a\nstructural property: the fact that certain kinds of functions do not\nexist on the model considered. \nDue to the failure of bivalence, the logical law of excluded middle\nfails for the dual negation \\({\\sim}\\). Actually, \\(\\phi\\) is\nnon-determined in \\(M\\) iff \\(M \\not\\vDash(\\phi\n\\vee{\\sim}\\phi)\\).  \nLogical equivalence. Sentences \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\chi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) are truth equivalent if they are true in\nprecisely the same models, and falsity equivalent if they are\nfalse in precisely the same models. Sentences \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\chi\\) are\nlogically equivalent if they are both truth equivalent and\nfalsity\n equivalent.[28]\n Due to the failure of bivalence, in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) truth\nequivalence does not guarantee logical equivalence.  \nTruth, falsity, and independence indications. The\nsyntax of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) allows formulas in which both universal\nand existential quantifiers appear slashed, e.g., \nOn the other hand, quantifier independence is implemented at the level\nof strategies. Consequently independence indications following a\nuniversal quantifier are vacuous, when the satisfaction of a formula\n(truth of a sentence) is considered. Similarly, independence\nindications following an existential quantifier are vacuous when the\ndissatisfaction of a formula (falsity of a sentence) is at stake. The\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) is true in the model \\(M\\) iff player 2 has a\nwinning strategy \\(F=\\{c\\}\\) in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\). This, again,\nmeans that whichever elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) player 1 chooses to\ninterpret \\((\\forall x)\\) and \\((\\forall z/\\exists y)\\), respectively,\nthe constant interpretation \\(c\\) of \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) given\nby the (zero-place) strategy function \\(c\\) satisfies \\(R(a, c, b)\\)\nin \\(M\\). But this amounts to the same as requiring that whichever\nelements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) player 1 chooses to interpret \\((\\forall x)\\)\nand \\((\\forall z)\\), respectively, the constant interpretation \\(c\\)\nof \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) satisfies \\(R(a, c, b)\\) in\n\\(M\\). Indeed, \\(\\phi\\) is truth equivalent to a sentence containing\nno slashed universal quantifiers:  \n\\(\\phi\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff the sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y/\\forall x)(\\forall z) R(x, y, z)\\) is true in \\(M\\).\n \nSimilarly, \\(\\phi\\) is falsity equivalent to a sentence containing no\nslashed existential quantifiers: \\(\\phi\\) is false in a model \\(M\\)\niff the sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z/\\exists y) R(x, y,\nz)\\) is false therein. \nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), \\(\\phi\\) is false in a\nmodel \\(M\\) iff \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff \\(\\phi\\) is not\ntrue in \\(M\\). By contrast, in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) falsity and\nnon-truth do not coincide. An extension of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be\nintroduced, where it is possible to speak of the non-truth of\nsentences. To this end, let us introduce a new negation symbol, \\(\\neg\\),\nreferred to as weak negation, contradictory negation\nor classical\n negation.[29]\n The set of formulas of extended IF first-order logic (to be\ndenoted \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) is obtained from the set of formulas of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) by closing it under the operations \\(\\neg\\), \\(\\wedge\\),\nand\n \\(\\vee\\):[30] \nSo if \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas, e.g.\n\\(\\neg \\phi\\) and \\((\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) are \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\)\nformulas; by contrast \\((\\forall x)\\neg \\phi\\) is not. For the\ncrucial restriction that \\(\\neg\\) may not occur in the scope of a\nquantifier, see Hintikka (1991: 49; 1996: 148). For counterexamples to\nthis restriction see, however, Hintikka (1996: 148; 2002c) and\nespecially Hintikka (2006b) in which the so-called fully extended\nIF first-order logic (FEIFL) is considered. In\nFEIFL, any occurrences of \\(\\neg\\) are allowed which are\nsubject to the following syntactic condition: if\n(Q\\(x/W)\\) is a quantifier in the syntactic scope of an\noccurrence of \\(\\neg\\), then all quantifiers listed in \\(W\\) are\nlikewise in the syntactic scope of that occurrence of \\(\\neg\\). \nThe semantics of an \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) formula formed by\ncontradictory negation is simply this: \nFrom the viewpoint of GTS, the connective \\(\\neg\\) behaves in an unusual\nway. For all connectives of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), there is a game rule\n(which can be seen as specifying the meaning of the connective). For\ncontradictory negation there is no game rule, and its semantics is not\nexplained in terms of plays of semantic games. A formula \\(\\neg \\phi\\)\nserves to say, globally, something about an entire game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\). If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence, to\nsay that \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) is to say that player 2 does\nnot have a winning strategy in game \\(G(\\phi ,\nM)\\). If, again, there is indeed a winning strategy for player\n2 in \\(G(\\phi , M)\\), by stipulation \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is false\nin\n \\(M\\).[31] \nNot only is \\(\\neg \\phi\\) not itself a formula of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\),\nbut it cannot in general even be expressed in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\n(see Subsect. 4.2). The law of excluded middle holds for the\ncontradictory negation: for all sentences \\(\\phi\\) and all models\n\\(M\\), indeed \\(M \\vDash(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\). In\nSection 5 it will be seen how Hintikka has proposed to make\nuse of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) when discussing issues in the philosophy\nof mathematics.  \nThe metalogical properties of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have been discussed\nin several publications, by Hintikka as well as\n Sandu.[32]\n When presenting them, reference will be made to existential\nsecond-order logic\n \\((\\mathbf{ESO})\\);[33]\n further important notions are those of the skolemization and\nSkolem normal form of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula. For\nprecise definitions of these notions,\n the supplementary document\n can be consulted. In brief, \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) is obtained from\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) by allowing existential quantification over\nrelation and function symbols in a first-order formula. The\nskolemization \\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi]\\) of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) is\na first-order formula of a larger vocabulary. It explicates\nin terms of function symbols how existential quantifiers and\ndisjunction symbols of \\(\\phi\\) depend on preceding universal\nquantifiers. For example, a skolemization of the \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence \\(\\phi = (\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists v/\\forall\nx)R(x, y, z, v)\\) of vocabulary \\(\\{R\\}\\) is the \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nsentence \\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi] = (\\forall x)(\\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\\) of\nvocabulary \\(\\{R, f, h\\}\\). Its Skolem normal form, again, is the\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence \\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi] = (\\exists f)(\\exists h)(\\forall\nx)(\\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\\). The first-order sentence\n\\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi]\\) must not be confused with the second-order sentence\n\\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi]\\).  \nGame-theoretical vs. Tarskian semantics of FO. The\nset of formulas of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is a proper subset of the set\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas. The standard semantics of\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is not the one provided by GTS, but the Tarskian\nsemantics specifying recursively the satisfaction relation \\(M,\ng \\vDash \\phi\\). If the Axiom of Choice is\n assumed,[34]\n the two semantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) coincide: \nTheorem (assuming AC). (Hodges 1983: 94, Hintikka\n& Kulas 1985: 6–7) Let \\(\\tau\\) be any vocabulary, \\(M\\)\nany \\(\\tau\\) structure, \\(g\\) any variable assignment and \\(\\phi\\) any\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) formula. Then \\(M, g \\vDash \\phi\\) holds in the standard sense iff there is a winning\nstrategy for player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi , M,\n g)\\).[35] \nRelation to ESO.\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) are\n intertranslatable:[36] \nTheorem (assuming AC)\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have the same expressive\npower.\n \nThat is, (1) for every \\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) there\nis an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\phi'\\) such that for all\n\\(\\tau\\) structures \\(M\\) and variable assignments \\(g\\), we have:\n\\(M, g \\vDash \\phi\\) iff \\(M, g \\vDash \\phi'\\). Actually,\n\\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi]\\) is a suitable \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) formula. And (2)\nfor every \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\psi\\) there is an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\psi'\\) such that \\(M, g \\vDash\n\\psi\\) iff \\(M, g \\vDash \\psi'\\), for all \\(\\tau\\) structures \\(M\\)\nand variable assignments \\(g\\). This follows from the fact that\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) can be translated into \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) (Enderton\n1970, Walkoe 1970), which again can be translated into\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). \nHintikka suggests that \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is, substantially\nspeaking, a first-order logic: the entities its quantified\nvariables range over are individuals, and so are all entities\nwith which the players of the semantic games operate. (See\nSubsect. 5.1 for a discussion of this idea.) A part of the\ninterest of the intertranslatability theorem lies in the fact that if\nHintikka’s controversial claim is accepted, this would mean that\nthe expressive power of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) can actually be achieved\non the first-order level. \nIFL is more expressive than FO. The following are\nexamples of properties expressible in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) but not in\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\): infinity of the domain, non-completeness of a\nlinear order, ill-foundedness of a binary relation, disconnectedness\nof a graph, equicardinality of the extensions of two first-order\nformulas \\(\\phi(x)\\) and \\(\\psi(x)\\), infinity of the\nextension of a first-order formula \\(\\phi(x)\\), and the\ntopological notion of open set (see, e.g., Hintikka 1996,\nVäänänen 2007). When attention is restricted to\nfinite models, Ronald Fagin’s famous theorem (1974)\nconnects \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and the complexity class\n\\(\\mathbf{NP}\\): a computational problem is solvable by an\nalgorithm running in non-deterministic polynomial time iff it is\ndefinable in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) relative to the class of all finite\nstructures. The following are \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\)-complete properties\nand hence expressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), over the class of all\nfinite models: evenness of the domain, oddness of the domain,\n3-colorability of a graph, and the existence of a Hamiltonian path on\na\n graph.[37] \nAs an example the Dedekind-infinity of the domain may be considered. A\nset \\(S\\) is Dedekind-infinite precisely when there exists an\ninjective function from \\(S\\) to its proper subset. Let\n\\(\\phi_{inf}\\) be the following sentence of\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\):[38] \nThe Skolem normal form of \\(\\phi_{inf}\\) is \n \nRelative to a model \\(M\\) this\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence asserts the existence of functions \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) and an element \\(t\\) such that \\(f = g\\) (implication from left\nto right), this function is injective (implication from right to\nleft), and its domain is the whole domain of \\(M\\) but the element\n\\(t\\) does not appear in its range. Consequently the range is a proper\nsubset of the domain of \\(M\\). In other words, the sentence\n\\(\\phi_{inf}\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff the domain of \\(M\\) is\ninfinite. \nProperties in common with FO. IF first-order logic\nshares many metalogical properties with first-order\n logic.[39] \nCompactness. A set of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences\nhas a model iff all its finite subsets have a model.\n \nLöwenheim-Skolem property. Suppose \\(\\phi\\) is an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence that has an infinite model, or\narbitrarily large finite models. Then \\(\\phi\\) has models of all infinite\ncardinalities.\n \nThe separation theorem holds in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) in a strengthened\nform; the ‘separation sentence’ \\(\\theta\\) is in particular a\nsentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\).  \nSeparation theorem. Suppose \\(\\phi\\) is an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), and \\(\\psi\\) an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence of vocabulary \\(\\tau'\\). Suppose further\nthat \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) have no models in common. Then there is a\nfirst-order sentence \\(\\theta\\) of vocabulary \\(\\tau \\cap \\tau'\\) such that every model of \\(\\phi\\) is a model of \\(\\theta\\), but\n\\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) have no models in common.\n \nIt is well known that for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) there is a sound and\ncomplete proof procedure. Because a first-order sentence \\(\\phi\\) is\ninconsistent (non-satisfiable) iff its negation \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is valid (true\nin all models), trivially \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) also has a sound and\ncomplete disproof\n procedure.[40]\n The latter property extends to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (while the former\ndoes not, see Subsect. 4.3): \nExistence of a complete disproof procedure. The set\nof inconsistent \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences is recursively\nenumerable.\n \nIn Subsection 3.4, the contradictory negation \\(\\neg\\) was\ndistinguished from the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\). In \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nthe two coincide: for any first-order sentence \\(\\phi\\), we have \\(M\n\\vDash{\\sim}\\phi\\) iff \\(M \\vDash \\neg \\phi\\).  \nStrong negation fails as a semantic operation. Let us\nwrite \\([\\phi]\\) for the set of models of sentence \\(\\phi\\). In the special\ncase of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\) clearly defines a\nsemantic operation: whenever \\(\\chi\\) and \\(\\theta\\) are sentences such that\n\\([\\chi] = [\\theta]\\), we have \\([{\\sim}\\chi] = [{\\sim}\\theta]\\). Burgess (2003)\nobserved that in the context of IF logic this property is lost in a\nvery strong sense. In fact there are IF sentences \\(\\chi\\) and \\(\\theta\\)\nsuch that while \\([\\chi] = [\\theta]\\), the sets \\([{\\sim}\\chi]\\) and \\([{\\sim}\\theta]\\)\nare not only distinct but even disjoint.  \nInexpressibility of contradictory negation. In\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\) and the contradictory\nnegation \\(\\neg\\) do not coincide: we may have \\(M \\vDash\n\\neg \\phi\\) without having \\(M \\vDash{\\sim}\\phi\\). This fact by itself\nstill leaves open the possibility that the contradictory negation of\nevery sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) could be defined in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), i.e., that there was a sentence\n\\(neg(\\phi)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(M \\vDash\\) \\(neg(\\phi)\\)\niff \\(M \\not\\vDash \\phi\\), for all models \\(M\\). All we know by the\nfailure of the law of excluded middle is that not in all cases can\n\\(neg(\\phi)\\) be chosen to be \\({\\sim}\\phi\\). However, as a matter of\nfact contradictory negation is inexpressible in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). There are sentences \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsuch that \\(\\neg \\phi\\) (which is a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) is\nnot truth equivalent to any sentence of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). This follows\nfrom the well-known fact that \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) is not closed under\nnegation and \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same expressive power as\n \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\).[41] \nStrong inexpressibility of contradictory negation. As\na corollary to the separation theorem, the result holds in a much\nstronger form. If \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are sentences of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(M \\vDash \\phi\\) iff \\(M \\not\\vDash\n\\psi\\), then each of \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is truth equivalent to a\nsentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Hence the contradictory negation \\(\\neg\n\\phi\\) is only expressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) for those\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences \\(\\phi\\) that are truth equivalent to an\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) \n sentence.[42] \nDetermined fragment. Let us say that an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence \\(\\phi\\) is determined if it\nsatisfies: \\(M \\vDash(\\phi \\vee{\\sim}\\phi)\\), for all models\n\\(M\\). The determined fragment of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nis the set of determined \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences. In the\ndetermined fragment contradictory negation is syntactically\nexpressible by the strong negation. By the strong inexpressibility of\ncontradictory negation, the determined fragment of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same expressive power as\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Membership in the determined fragment is a\nsufficient but not necessary condition for an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence to have its contradictory negation expressible in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). The sentence\n\\((\\forall y)(\\exists x/\\forall y) x = y\\) is not\n determined;[43]\n yet its contradictory negation \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y) x \\ne y\\) is\nexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). \nContradictory negation and GTS. The truth-conditions\nthat GTS yields are of the form ‘there are strategy functions\n\\(f_1 ,\\ldots ,f_n\\) such\nthat —,’ i.e., it gives rise to truth-conditions\nexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\). By the strong inexpressibility of\ncontradictory negation, there is no single \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence, not translatable into \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), whose\ncontradictory negation has a truth-condition of that form. This fact\nmakes it understandable why contradictory negation should not be\nexpected to admit of a game-theoretical interpretation along the same\nlines in which the other logical operators are interpreted. Different\nways of assigning a game-theoretical interpretation to contradictory\nnegation can, however, be developed. To this end, in the context of\nfully extended IF first-order logic (FEIFL,\ncf. Subsect. 3.4), Hintikka has proposed to use semantic games with\nsubgames. (See Hintikka 2002c, 2006b; for subgames, see\nCarlson & Hintikka 1979, Hintikka & Kulas 1983.) This approach\nleads to mixing the play level with the strategy level: choices of\nindividuals made in a subgame may depend on strategy functions chosen\nin earlier subgames. In Tulenheimo (2014), a game-theoretical\nsemantics is formulated for the fragment of FEIFL\nthat consists of formulas in prenex form. Plays of the correlated\ngames do not involve choosing any second-order objects, such as\nstrategy functions. Contradictory negation \\((\\neg)\\) is interpreted by\nintroducing an additional component in game positions: a\nmode. At the play level, the negation \\(\\neg\\) triggers not only a\nrole switch (like the dual negation \\({\\sim})\\), but it also involves changing\nthe mode from positive to negative or vice versa. The semantic effect\nof modes becomes visible at the strategy level: modes regulate the way\nin which the truth condition of a sentence involves existentially or\nuniversally quantifying over strategy functions. Like independence\nindications, also occurrences of \\(\\neg\\) are, then, interpreted in terms of\nconditions that act on the strategy level. For related research, see\nFigueira et al. (2011). \nContradictory negation and finite models. Certain\nmajor open questions in logic and theoretical computer science can be\nformulated in terms of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). It is an open question in\ncomplexity theory whether \\(\\mathbf{NP} = \\mathbf{coNP}\\),\nthat is, whether the class of \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\)-solvable problems is\nthe same as the class of problems whose complement is solvable in\n\\(\\mathbf{NP}\\). By Fagin’s theorem (1974), this open\nproblem can be equivalently formulated as follows: Is\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) closed under negation over finite\nmodels? That is, is there for every IF sentence \\(\\phi\\) another IF\nsentence \\(neg(\\phi)\\) such that for any finite model\n\\(M\\), \\(neg(\\phi)\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff \\(\\phi\\) is not\ntrue in \\(M\\)? Proving that the answer is negative would settle\nthe notorious \\(\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}\\) problem, i.e.,\nestablish that there are computational problems for which one can\nefficiently verify whether a proposed solution is correct\nalthough one cannot efficiently find a\n solution.[44] \nAs is well known, \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) admits of a sound and complete\nproof procedure: there is a mechanical way of generating precisely\nthose first-order sentences that are valid (true in all models). This\nfact can also be expressed by saying that \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is\naxiomatizable, or that the set of valid sentences of\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is recursively\n enumerable.[45]\n Due to its greater expressive power, axiomatizability fails\nfor \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). In other words, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is\nsemantically\n incomplete.[46] \nOne way to show this is as follows. Suppose for the sake of\ncontradiction that the set of valid \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences is\nrecursively enumerable. Recall that the sentence\n\\(\\phi_{inf}\\) discussed in Subsection 4.1 is\ntrue in all and only infinite models. Note, then, that an\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) sentence \\(\\chi\\) is true in all finite\nmodels iff the \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence\n\\((\\phi_{inf} \\vee \\chi)\\) is valid. Given a valid\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence, it can be effectively checked whether\nthe sentence is syntactically of the form\n\\((\\phi_{inf} \\vee \\chi)\\), where \\(\\chi\\) is a\nfirst-order sentence. Hence the recursive enumeration of all valid\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences yields a recursive enumeration of\nfirst-order sentences \\(\\chi\\) true in all finite models. But this\ncontradicts Trakhtenbrot’s theorem, according to which the set\nof \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) sentences true in all finite models is\nnot recursively\n enumerable.[47] \nWhat is the relevance of the failure of axiomatizability of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)? Discussing finite partially ordered quantifiers,\nQuine (1970: 89–91) suggests that we should refuse to give the\nstatus of logic to any generalization of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) which\ndoes not have a sound and complete proof procedure both for\nvalidity and for inconsistency. For Quine, any such\ngeneralization belongs to mathematics rather than logic. Since\n\\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) is not axiomatizable, it falls outside the realm\nof logic, thus\n delineated.[48] \nHintikka finds this type of allegation unfounded. First,\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) shares many of the important metalogical results\nwith \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) (cf. Subsect. 4.1). Second, just\nlike \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), also \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) can be translated\ninto second-order logic. The only difference is that in the former\ncase a larger variety of quantifier (in)dependencies must be encoded\nby Skolem functions than in the latter. Why would the former\ntranslation render \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) a part of mathematics while\nthe latter would allow \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) to remain a logic (Hintikka\n1991: 26–27)? Third, one must make a distinction between what is\nneeded to understand an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence, and what is\nneeded to mechanically deal with the validities (logical truths) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Due to its non-axiomatizability, there are no\nmechanical rules for generating the set of all validities of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). However, to understand a sentence is to know\nwhat things are like when it is true, not to know what things\nare like when it is logically true (Hintikka 1995:\n13–14). Fourth, because of non-axiomatizability, the valid\ninference patterns in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) cannot be exhausted by any\nrecursive enumeration. Insofar as important mathematical problems can\nbe reduced to questions about the validity of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nformulas (Subsect. 5.3), progress in mathematics can be seen\nto consist (not of the discovery of stronger set-theoretical axioms\nbut) of ever more powerful rules for establishing validity in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka 1996: 100; 2000: 135–136). \nThe principle of compositionality (a.k.a. Frege principle) states that\nsemantic attributes of a complex expression \\(E\\) are determined\nby the semantic attributes of its constituent expressions and the\nstructure of \\(E\\). In particular, the semantic attribute of\ninterest (e.g., truth) may be determined in terms of one or\nmore auxiliary semantic attributes (e.g.,\n satisfaction).[49]\n Hintikka has argued that compositionality amounts to semantic\ncontext-independence: semantic attributes of a complex expression\ndepend only on the semantic attributes of its constituent\nexpressions, plus its structure – they do not depend on\nthe sentential context in which the expression is embedded. Semantic\ncontext-independence makes it possible to carry out semantic analysis\nfrom inside out – from simpler expressions to more\ncomplex\n ones.[50]\n This is what is needed for recursive definitions of semantic\nattributes – such as Tarski-type definitions of truth and\nsatisfiability – to be\n possible.[51]\n By contrast, the GTS analysis of sentences is an outside in\nprocess: a semantic game starts with an entire sentence, and stepwise\nanalyzes the sentence into simpler and simpler components, eventually\nreaching an atomic formula (together with an appropriate variable\nassignment). Therefore GTS allows accounting for semantic\ncontext-dependencies that violate the principle of\n compositionality.[52] \nIn \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) an existential quantifier may depend only on\nsome of the universal quantifiers in whose scope it lies.\nAccordingly, its interpretation depends on its relation to quantifiers\noutside its own scope. Such an existential quantifier is\n context-dependent.[53]\n On the face of it, then, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) cannot but violate the\nprinciple of compositionality and does not admit of a Tarski-type\ntruth-definition.  \nHodges (1997a,b) showed, however, that \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be\ngiven a compositional\n semantics.[54]\n The semantics is given by recursively defining the satisfaction\nrelation ‘\\(M \\vDash_X \\phi\\)’\n(read: \\(\\phi\\) is satisfied in \\(M\\) by \\(X)\\), where\n\\(X\\) is a set of variable assignments. While the\nTarskian semantics for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is in terms of single\nvariable assignments, Hodges’s semantics employs sets of\nvariable assignments. The game-theoretical semantics of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is captured by this compositional semantics: for\nevery formula \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), player 2 has a winning\nstrategy in \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) iff the\ncondition \\(M \\vDash_{\\{g\\}} \\phi\\) holds.\nHintikka remarks (2006a: 65) that if one is sufficiently ruthless, one\ncan always save compositionality by building the laws of semantic\ninteraction of different expressions into the respective meanings of\nthose\n expressions.[55] \nIt is methodologically worth pointing out that compositionality is not\nneeded for defining \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). The very existence\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) proves that rejecting compositionality is no\nobstacle for the formulation of a powerful logic (Hintikka 1995). It\nshould also be noted that what makes Hodges’s result work is its\ntype-theoretical ascent. Let us say that a Tarski-type\ncompositional semantics is a compositional semantics which interprets\neach formula \\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables in terms of an\n\\(n\\)-tuple of elements of the domain. Hence the standard\nsemantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is Tarski-type, but Hodges’s\nsemantics employing the satisfaction relation ‘\\(M \\vDash_X \\phi\\)’ is not, because the latter\nevaluates a formula \\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables relative to an\nentire set of \\(n\\)-tuples of elements. Cameron &\nHodges (2001) proved that actually there is \\(no\\) Tarski-type\ncompositional semantics for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).  \nThe notion of compositionality can be refined by imposing constraints\non the auxiliary semantic attributes. Sandu and Hintikka (2001: 60)\nsuggested, by analogy with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), that\n‘satisfaction by a single variable assignment’ would be a\nnatural auxiliary attribute in connection with \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).\nBy the result of Cameron and Hodges, no semantics for\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) exists that would be compositional in this\nrestricted sense. \nThe definability of truth can only be discussed in connection with\nlanguages capable of speaking of themselves. Let us consider an\narithmetical vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) and restrict attention to the standard\nmodel \\(N\\) of Peano’s axioms. Each sentence \\(\\phi\\) of\nvocabulary \\(\\tau\\) can then be represented by a natural number\n\\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\), its Gödel number. It\nis assumed that \\(\\tau\\) contains a numeral\n\\(\\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\phi {}^\\urcorner}\\) for each\nnumber \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\). If \\(L\\) and\n\\(L'\\) are abstract logics of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), such as\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), and\n\\(\\TRUE(x)\\) is a formula of \\(L'\\) such that\nevery sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(L\\) satisfies:  \nthen \\(\\TRUE(x)\\) is said to be a\ntruth-predicate (explicit\ntruth-definition) of logic \\(L\\) in logic\n\\(L'\\) for the model \\(N\\). By Alfred Tarski’s\nfamous theorem of the undefinability of truth (Tarski 1933),\nthere is no truth-predicate for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) itself for the model \\(N\\). More generally,\nTarski showed that under certain assumptions, a truth-definition for a\nlogic \\(L\\) can only be given in a metalanguage which is\nessentially stronger than \\(L\\). One of the assumptions is that\nthe negation used behaves like contradictory negation. On the other\nhand, Tarski also pointed out that an implicit truth-definition for\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) itself is\npossible. Let \\(\\tau\\) be an arithmetical vocabulary, and let us stay\nwith the standard model \\(N\\) of Peano’s axioms. Let\n‘\\(\\TRUE\\)’ be a unary predicate not appearing in\n\\(\\tau\\). An \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) formula \\(\\psi(x)\\) of vocabulary\n\\(\\tau \\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}\\) is an implicit truth-definition\nfor \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau \\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}]\\) for \\(N\\), if for every\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) sentence \\(\\phi\\), the following holds:  \n\\(N \\vDash \\phi\\) iff there is an interpretation\n\\(\\TRUE^N\\) of the unary predicate \\(\\TRUE\\) such that \n \\((N, \\TRUE^N ) \\vDash \\psi(\\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\phi {}^\\urcorner})\\).[56] \nIntuitively, \\(\\TRUE^N\\) is the set of those\nnatural numbers that are Gödel numbers of true arithmetic\nsentences of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\); and \\(\\psi(x)\\) says that\n\\(x\\) is a Gödel number in the extension of the predicate\n\\(\\TRUE\\). The formula \\(\\psi(x)\\) is a conjunction\nincluding clauses that mimic, on the object-language level, the\nmetalogical recursive clauses of the Tarski-type truth-definition for\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). E.g., one of the conjuncts is \nThe implicit nature of the truth-definition is seen from the fact that\nthe predicate \\(\\TRUE\\) appears on both sides of the equivalence\nsign in these\n clauses.[57]\n The above implicit truth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) for \\(N\\) is\nof the form ‘there is a set \\(S\\) interpreting the\npredicate \\(\\TRUE\\) such that \\(\\psi(x)\\).’ Thus the\nimplicit truth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) gives\nrise to the explicit truth-definition \\(\\exists \\TRUE\\, \\psi(x)\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Since\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have the same expressive power,\na truth-predicate of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) for \\(N\\) can be formulated in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).  \nThe same reasoning can be applied to \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) itself, and\nthereby to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka 1991, 1996; Hyttinen & Sandu\n2000; Sandu 1996, 1998). Namely, an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) formula\n\\(\\chi(x)\\) of vocabulary \\(\\tau \\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}\\) can be formulated\nwhich is an implicit truth-definition of\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Therefore the \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\)\nformula \\(\\exists \\TRUE\\, \\chi(x)\\) is an explicit\ntruth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Here the\ntruth-predicate is formulated in the very same language whose notion\nof truth is being defined: \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\). Hence \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\),\nand thereby \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), is capable of explicitly defining its\nown truth-predicate relative to \\(N\\).[58] \n This result does not contradict\nTarski’s undefinability result, because here non-determined\nsentences are possible; the negation used is not contradictory\nnegation.[59] \nTarski (1983) adopted a view accoding to which truth cannot be defined\nfor natural languages. It has been argued in Hintikka & Sandu\n(1999) that this was due to Tarski’s belief that\ncompositionality fails in natural\n languages.[60]\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) does not have a Tarski-type compositional\nsemantics, but it admits of formulating a self-applied\ntruth-predicate. The proposed reason why Tarski believed it not to be\npossible to discuss the notion of truth in natural languages\nthemselves, cannot be entertained from the viewpoint of\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).[61] \nExpressive power. Since \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is not\nclosed under contradictory negation, \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is strictly\nmore expressive than \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (cf. Subsect.\n 4.2).[62]\n The following properties are expressible in \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) but\nnot in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka 1996: 188–190): finiteness\nof the domain, well-foundedness of a binary relation, connectedness of\na graph, principle of mathematical induction, Bolzano-Weierstrass\ntheorem, and the topological notion of continuity. \nMetalogical properties. The nice metatheorems that\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) shares with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) are lost:\nCompactness, Löwenheim-Skolem property, separation theorem, and\nthe existence of a complete disproof procedure all fail for\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (Hintikka 1991: 49, 1996: 189). No self-applied\ntruth-predictate is possible for \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\). The definition\nof such a truth-predicate would have to contain the clause \nBut this clause is not a well-formed formula of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\),\nsince \\(\\neg\\) appears in the scope of the universal quantifier\n\\((\\forall y)\\) (cf. Hintikka 1996: 151). \nThe validity problem of the full second-order can be effectively\nreduced to the validity problem of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\). Namely, why\ncannot a second-order sentence simply be thought of as a two-sorted\nfirst-order sentence? Because in order to capture the standard\ninterpretation of second-order\n logic,[63]\n it must be said that for every extensionally possible set of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of elements of sort 1 there exists a member of sort\n2 having those and only those elements as members, for all arities\n\\(n\\) such that the second-order sentence contains a quantifier\n\\((\\exists R)\\) where \\(R\\) is\n \\(n\\)-ary.[64]\n Such additional conditions can be expressed by a finite conjunction\n\\(X\\) of contradictory negations of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\)\nsentences. So there is an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence \\(Y\\)\nsuch that \\(X\\) itself is logically equivalent to\n\\(\\neg Y\\). Therefore, if \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence and\n\\(\\phi^*\\) its reconstruction in two-sorted first-order logic, we have:\n\\(\\phi\\) is valid iff \\((\\neg X \\vee \\phi^*)\\) is valid iff\n\\((Y \\vee \\phi^*)\\) is valid. The validity of \\((\\neg X \\vee \\phi^*)\\) means that \\(\\phi^*\\) is a logical consequence of \\(X\\).\nBecause \\(Y\\) is an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence, it can be\nexpressed in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). It follows that the validity of any\nsecond-order sentence can be expressed as the validity of a sentence\nof\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).[65] \nAlgebraic structure. The two negations available in\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}, \\neg\\) and \\({\\sim}\\), agree on true sentences, as well\nas on false ones: if \\(\\phi\\) is true (false) in \\(M\\), then both\n\\({\\sim}\\phi\\) and \\(\\neg \\phi\\) are false (true) in \\(M\\). By contrast, if\n\\(\\phi\\) is non-determined in \\(M\\), then \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is non-determined\nas well, but \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true. The combination \\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) of the two\nnegations applied to a sentence \\(\\phi\\) asserts that \\(\\phi\\) is not\n false.[66] \nThe propositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) involves the four\noperators \\(\\neg , {\\sim}, \\wedge\\), and \\(\\vee\\). Hintikka (2004b) raises the\nquestion of the algebraic structure induced by these operators, when\nany two truth equivalent sentences are identified. The operators\n\\(\\neg , \\wedge\\), and \\(\\vee\\) give rise to a Boolean algebra – but what\ndoes the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\) add to this structure?  \nRestricting attention to truth equivalence, \\({\\sim}\\) is definable from the\noperators \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\neg{\\sim}\\). For, \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff\n\\(\\neg(\\neg{\\sim}\\phi)\\) is true in \\(M\\). Instead of \\({\\sim}\\), the operator\n\\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) may then be considered. Hintikka points out that the\npropositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (formulated in terms of\nthe operators \\(\\vee , \\wedge , \\neg\\) and \\(\\neg{\\sim})\\) is a Boolean algebra with\nan operator in the sense of Jónsson & Tarski (1951). The\nadditional operator \\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) is a closure operator.  \nJónsson and Tarski (1951, Thm. 3.14) showed that any closure\nalgebra is isomorphic to an algebraic system formed by a set equipped\nwith a reflexive and transitive\n relation.[67]\n As a matter of fact, the relevant algebraic structure is precisely\nthat of the propositional modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\). Hence the\npropositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) has the same algebraic\nstructure as \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\). By a well-known result due to\nGödel (1933) and McKinsey & Tarski (1948), intuitionistic\npropositional logic can be interpreted in \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\), via a\ntranslation \\(t\\) such that \\(\\phi\\) is intuitionistically provable\niff \\(t(\\phi)\\) is a valid \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) formula. Thus,\nintuitionistic propositional logic is interpretable in\n \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\).[68] \nHintikka (2006a: 73–77) takes the following to be among\nconsequences of the novel insights made possible by (extended) IF\nfirst-order logic: reconstruction of normal mathematical reasoning on\nthe first-order level, a novel perspective on the notion of truth in\naxiomatic set theory, insights into the nature of negation, and the\nformulation of a self-applied truth-predicate. A related topic of\ngeneral interest is the phenomenon of informational independence in\nnatural languages. The ideas related to negation and definability of\ntruth have been discussed in Subsections 4.2 and 4.5,\nrespectively. Let us consider here the remaining issues. \nHintikka maintains that the only reasonable way of making a\ndistinction between first-order logic and higher-order logic is by\nreference to the entities that one’s quantified variables range\nover. A first-order logic is, then, a logic in which all quantifiers\nrange over individuals, in contrast to higher-order entities\n(e.g., subsets of the domain). On this basis Hintikka holds\nthat substantially speaking, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and even\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) are first-order\n logics.[69]\n Solomon Feferman (2006: 457–461) criticizes the criterion that\nHintikka employs for judging the first-order status of a logic.\nFeferman makes use of generalized quantifiers in his\n argument.[70]\n The formulas  \ninvolving generalized quantifiers are syntactically\nfirst-order, insofar as the quantified variables \\(z_{i1},\\ldots\n,z_{in_i} = [z_i]\\) are first-order \\((1 \\le i \\le k)\\). The semantics\nof a generalized quantifier \\(Q\\) is formulated by associating with\neach domain M a \\(k\\)-ary relation \\(Q_M\\) on M, with \\(Q_M\n\\subseteq\\) M\\(^{n_1} \\times \\ldots \\times\\)\nM\\(^{n_k}\\). E.g., for any infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\),\nthere is a generalized quantifier \\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}\\) such that\n\\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}z P(z)\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff there are at\nleast \\(\\kappa\\) elements that satisfy the predicate \\(P\\). Hence\ngeneralized quantifiers can be semantically higher-order. The\nfact that the variables in a formula range over individuals only, does\nnot offer a reliable criterion for the logic’s first-order\nstatus.  \nHintikka’s criterion could be reformulated by saying that a\nlogic is of first order, if any play of a semantic game\nassociated with a formula of this logic only involves (in addition to\nchoices interpreting conjunctions and disjunctions) choices of\nindividuals, as opposed to choices of higher-order entities. By this\ncriterion \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (and even \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) are\nfirst-order logics, but the logic of generalized quantifiers such as\n\\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}\\) is\n not.[71]\n Feferman (2006: 461) anticipates the possibility of such a reply, but\nfinds it unconvincing. \nBy a result of Hintikka (1955), the problem of deciding whether a\nsentence of second-order logic is valid can be effectively reduced to\nthe validity problem of\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).[72]\n Väänänen (2001) has shown that the set of valid\nsentences of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same very high complexity as\nthe set of validities of the full second-order\n logic.[73]\n Väänänen (2001) and Feferman (2006) conclude that\nspeaking of validity in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) leads to a strong\ncommitment to full second-order logic. Hintikka (2006a: 476–477)\nlooks at these results from the opposite direction: for him they mean\nthat indeed one can speak of validity in full second-order logic in\nterms of validity in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). What is more, Hintikka\n(1997) affirms that even \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is a first-order logic.\nIf so, any mathematical theory that can be expressed by the truth of\nan \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) sentence is likewise free from problems of\nset existence.  \nHintikka’s position leads to a puzzle. If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) not truth equivalent to any \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nsentence, the truth-condition of the sentence \\(\\neg \\phi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) cannot be formulated without recourse to the set\nof all strategies of player 2: \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true in model \\(M\\)\niff for all strategies of player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi ,\nM)\\), there is a sequence of moves by player 1 such that player\n1 wins the resulting play. The set of all strategies of player 2 is\nundeniably a higher-order entity. How can commitment to entities other\nthan individuals be said to have been avoided here? Can the meaning of\nthe sentence \\(\\neg \\phi\\) be well understood without presupposing the\ngenuinely second-order idea of all strategies of a given\n player?[74]\n Rather than being nominalistic, Hintikka’s position appears to\nbe a variant of universalia in rebus. While rules of semantic\ngames pertain to actions performed on first-order objects,\ncombinatorial properties of sets of plays can only be formulated in\nsecond-order terms. As soon as game rules are defined for a language\nfragment, also the corresponding combinatorial properties are fully\ndetermined, among them the properties labeled as truth and\nfalsity. \nAccording to Hintikka, our pretheoretical idea of the truth of a\nquantified sentence \\(\\phi\\) (in negation normal form) is that there\nexist ‘witness individuals’ for the existential\nquantifiers, usually depending on values corresponding to the\npreceding universal\n quantifiers.[75]\n It is the existence of such witnesses that constitutes the truth of\n\\(\\phi\\). Providing witnesses is precisely what Skolem functions for\n\\(\\phi\\)\n do.[76]\n The truth of a quantified sentence \\(\\phi\\) amounts to the existence of\na full set of Skolem functions for \\(\\phi\\). In Hintikka’s view,\nthen, our ordinary notion of first-order truth is conceptualized in\nterms of (existential) second-order logic. What happens when this idea\nis applied to axiomatic set theory, say Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\nwith the Axiom of Choice \\((\\mathbf{ZFC})\\)? It should be born in\nmind that the very idea of axiomatic set theory is to dispense with\nhigher-order logic; its underlying logic is taken to be\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Hintikka argues as\n follows.[77] \nFor each sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\), there is another\nsentence \\(\\phi^* = (\\exists f_1)\\ldots(\\exists f_n)\\psi^*\\)\nof \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) which says, intuitively, that ‘Skolem\nfunctions’ for \\(\\phi\\) exist. These ‘Skolem functions’\nare certain individuals of the domain of a model of\n\\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). Here both \\(\\phi^*\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are first-order\nsentences. But if for every sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) we\nhave \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\phi^*\\) being logically equivalent, why could the\nsentences \\(\\phi^*\\) not be used for formulating a truth-predicate for\n\\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) itself? However, by\nTarski’s undefinability result, no such truth-predicate\n exists.[78]\n So there must be a model of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) and a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\ntrue in that model such that \\(\\phi^*\\) is false: not all ‘Skolem\nfunctions’ asserted to exist by \\(\\phi^*\\) actually exist in the\nmodel.  \nThis reasoning shows that \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) does not fully capture the\nidea of truth according to which the truth of a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nmeans that the Skolem functions for \\(\\phi\\) exist. Furthermore, it\nalso shows that the standard interpretation of higher-order logic is\nnot fully captured by \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). To see this, observe that for\nevery sentence \\(\\phi\\) there is a logically equivalent\nsecond-order sentence \\(\\phi^{**} = (\\exists\nF_1)\\ldots(\\exists F_n)\\psi^{**}\\) actually asserting the existence of\nSkolem functions for \\(\\phi\\). The first-order sentence\n\\(\\phi^* = (\\exists f_1)\\ldots(\\exists f_n)\\psi^*\\) must not be\nconfused with the second-order sentence \\(\\phi^{**} = (\\exists\nF_1)\\ldots(\\exists F_n)\\psi^{**}\\).  The Skolem functions \\(F_i\\) of\nwhich the sentence \\(\\phi^{**}\\) speaks are sets built out of\nindividuals of the set-theoretical universe, while the ‘Skolem\nfunctions’ \\(f_i\\) spoken of by \\(\\phi^*\\) are\n individuals.[79] \nThe conclusion of Hintikka’s argument is that our ordinary\nnotion of truth is misrepresented by \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\).\nFurthermore, by Tarski’s undefinability result the situation\ncannot be improved by adding further axioms to \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\).\nIn Hintikka’s judgment, axiomatic set theory is a systematic but\nfutile attempt to capture on the first-order level truths of\nstandardly interpreted second-order logic. Like Gödel (1947),\nalso Hintikka holds that the concepts needed to state, say, the\ncontinuum hypothesis are sufficiently well-defined to determine the\ntruth-value of this conjecture. The continuum hypothesis does not\nreceive its meaning from phrasing it in \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\).\nGödel and Hintikka agree that the independence results due to\nGödel himself and Paul Cohen do not by themselves show anything\nabout the truth or falsity of the continuum hypothesis. But unlike\nGödel, Hintikka finds the derivability of any conjecture whatever\nin \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) (or in any of its extensions) simply\nirrelevant for the truth of the conjecture. For Hintikka, it is a\n‘combinatorial’ question whether every infinite subset of\nthe reals is either countable or else has the cardinality of the set\nof all reals – a question properly conceptualized within\nsecond-order logic. This is what Hintikka takes to be the\npretheoretical sense of the truth of the continuum hypothesis, and\nthat is not captured by\n \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\).[80] \nHintikka sees \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) as allowing to reconstruct all\nnormal mathematical reasoning on the first-order level. This result is\nessentially dependent on the acceptability of Hintikka’s claim\nthat \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is ontologically committed to individuals\nonly (Subsect. 5.1). But how would \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\)\nserve to reconstruct an important part of all mathematical\nreasoning? \nHintikka (1996: 194–210) discusses mathematical\ntheories (or mathematical axiomatizations) and mathematical\nproblems (or questions of logical consequence)\nseparately. \nAny higher-order mathematical theory \\(T\\) gives rise to\na many-sorted first-order theory \\(T^*\\). If the theory is finite,\nthere is a finite conjunction \\(J\\) formulated in\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (equivalent to the contradictory negation of an\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence) expressing the requirement that the\nstandard interpretation of higher-order logic is respected. The\nquestion of the truth of the higher-order theory \\(T\\) is thus\nreduced to the truth of the sentence \\((T^* \\wedge J)\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (cf. Subsect. 4.6).  \nThe mathematical problem of whether a given sentence\n\\(C\\) is a logical consequence of a finite higher-order theory\n\\(T\\) coincides with the problem of whether the second-order\nsentence \\((\\neg(T^* \\wedge J) \\vee C^*)\\) is\nvalid. Recalling that there is a sentence \\(\\chi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(J\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg \\chi\\),\nit follows that \\(\\neg(T^* \\wedge J)\\) is equivalent to a\nsentence of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Consequently there is a sentence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) which is valid iff the sentence\n\\((\\neg(T^* \\wedge J) \\vee C^*)\\) is valid (cf.\nSubsect. 4.6). Mathematical problems can be understood as\nquestions of the validity of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence. Among mathematical problems thus reconstructible using\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) are the continuum hypothesis, Goldbach’s\nconjecture, Souslin’s conjecture, the existence of an\ninaccessible cardinal, and the existence of a measurable\n cardinal.[81] \nAs conceptualizations apparently transcending the proposed framework\n– not expressible in a higher-order logic – Hintikka\nconsiders the maximality assumption expressed by David Hilbert’s\nso-called axiom of completeness. The axiom says that no mathematical\nobjects can be added to the intended models without violating the\nother\n axioms.[82] \nIf indeed problems related to the idea of all subsets are\navoided in \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (Hintikka 1997), it offers a way of\ndefending a certain form logicism. Unlike in historical logicism, the\nidea is not to consider logic as an axiom system on the same level as\nmathematical axiom systems (Hintikka 1996:\n 183),[83]\n and to attempt to reduce mathematics to logic. Rather, Hintikka\n(1996: 184) proposes to ask: (a) Can the crucial\nmathematical concepts be defined in logical terms?\n(b) Can the modes of semantically valid logical\ninferences used in mathematics be expressed in logical terms? The idea\nis not to concentrate on deductive rules of logic: no complete set of\ndeductive rules exist anyway for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Because the\nstatus of higher-order logic is potentially dubious – due to the\nproblems associated with the notion of powerset – a positive\nsolution to questions (a) and (b) calls for a first-order logic more\npowerful than \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\).  \nThe suggested reduction of all mathematics expressible in higher-order\nlogic to the first-order level would be philosophically significant in\nshowing that mathematics is not a study of general concepts, but of\nstructures consisting of particulars (Hintikka 1996: 207). This is not\nto say that actual mathematics would be best carried out in terms of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), only that it could in principle be so carried\nout (Hintikka 1996: 205, 2006a: 477). For a critique of\nHintikka’s conclusions, see Väänänen (2001),\nFeferman (2006). \nWhen Hintikka began to apply GTS to the study of natural language\n(Hintikka 1973a), he took up the question of whether branching\nquantifiers occur in natural languages. He was led to ask whether\nthere are semantic games with imperfect information. He detected\nvarious types of grammatical constructions in English that involve\ninformational\n independence.[84]\n An often cited example is the sentence  \nSome relative of each villager and some relative of each townsman\nhate each other,\n \ntrue under its relevant reading when the choice of a relative of each\ntownsman can be made independently of the individual chosen for\n‘each\n villager.’[85]\n Hintikka (1973a) sketched an argument to the effect that actually\nevery \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) sentence can be reproduced as a\nrepresentation of an English sentence. From this it would follow that\nthe logic of idiomatic English quantifiers is much stronger than\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), and that no effective procedure exists for\nclassifying sentences as analytical or nonanalytical, synonymous or\n nonsynonymous.[86]\n This would be methodologically a very important result, showing that\nsyntactic methods are even in principle insufficient in linguistic\ntheorizing. Jon Barwise (1979) suggested that particularly convincing\nexamples supporting Hintikka’s thesis can be given in terms of\ngeneralized quantifiers.  \nLauri Carlson and Alice ter Meulen (1979) were the first to observe\ncases of informational independence between quantifiers and\nintensional operators. Consider the\n question[87] \nWho does everybody admire?\n \nUnder one of its readings, the presupposition of this question is\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)\\) admires\\((x,\ny)\\). The desideratum of this question is  \nI know who everybody admires.\n \nWriting ‘\\(K_I\\)’ for ‘I\n know,’[88]\n the desideratum has a reading whose logical form is  \n\\(K_I (\\forall x)(\\exists y/K_I)\\) admires\\((x, y)\\).\n \nThis desireratum is satisfied by an answer pointing out a function\n\\(f\\) which yields for each person a suitable admired person.\nSuch a function can be his or her father. Importantly, the\nvalue \\(f(b)\\) of this function only depends on the\nperson \\(b\\) interpreting ‘everybody,’ but does not\ndepend on the scenario \\(w\\), compatible with the\nquestioner’s knowledge, that interprets the construction\n‘I know.’ Interestingly, the desideratum\n\\(K_I \n(\\forall x)(\\exists y/K_I)\\)\nadmires\\((x, y)\\) is not expressible without an explicit\nindependence indicator. It is also worth noting that this case cannot\nbe represented in the notation of \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\). This is\nbecause several types of semantic interactions are possible among\nquantifiers and intensional operators, and blocking interactions of\none type does not automatically block interactions of other types. In\nthe example, the witness of \\(\\exists y\\) must not vary with the\nscenario \\(w\\) interpreting the operator\n\\(K_I\\), but still the values of both\nvariables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must belong to the domain of the\nparticular scenario \\(w\\) chosen to interpret\n \\(K_I\\).[89] \nHintikka’s ideas on desiderata of wh-questions were influenced\nby his exchange with the linguist Elisabet\n Engdahl.[90]\n These wh-questions, again, functioned as important test cases for the\nappearance of informational independence in natural languages.  \nHintikka and Sandu (1989) took up the task of formulating an explicit\nunified formal treatment for the different varieties of informational\nindependence in natural language semantics. They posed the question of\nwhich are the mechanisms that allow English to exceed the expressive\npower of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). For, natural languages typically do not\nresort to higher-order quantifiers. Hintikka and Sandu suggested that\ninformational independence plays a key role in increasing the\nexpressive power of natural\n languages.[91] \nIn GTS as developed for English in Hintikka & Kulas (1983, 1985),\ngame rules are associated with a great variety of linguistic\nexpressions (cf. Subsect. 2.1). As Hintikka (1990) has\nstressed, informational independence is a cross-categorical\nphenomenon: it can occur in connection with expressions of widely\ndifferent grammatical categories. Hintikka and Sandu (1989) propose\nseveral examples from English calculated to show that there is an\nabundance of instances of informational independence in natural\nlanguages. Among examples are wh-questions of the kind discussed\nabove, and the distinction between the de dicto and de\nre readings of certain English sentences. Hintikka and Sandu\nsuggest that representing such readings in terms of IF logic is more\ntruthful to the syntax of English than the alternative, non-IF\nrepresentations are.  In connection with knowledge, a de\ndicto attribution such as \n\\(K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x) (x\\) is a spy)\n \ncan be turned into a de re attribution by marking the\nexistential quantifier as independent of the knowledge-operator (cf.\nHintikka and Sandu 1989): \n\\(K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x/K_{\\textit{Ralph}}) (x\\) is a spy).\n \nBecause knowledge is a factive attitude (the actual world is among\nRalph’s epistemic alternatives), this amounts indeed to the same\nas the condition \n\\((\\exists x) K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (x\\) is a spy).\n \nRebuschi & Tulenheimo (2011) observed that independent quantifiers\nare of special interest in connection with non-factive attitudes such\nas belief. The logical form of a statement ascribing to Ralph a belief\npertaining to a specific but non-existent object is  \n\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x/B_{\\textit{Ralph}}) (x\\) is a spy),\n \nwhere ‘\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}}\\)’ stands for\n‘Ralph believes\n that.’[92] \nAttitudes of this form were dubbed de objecto attitudes.\nSince the (intentional) object of such an attitude need not exist\nactually, the de objecto attitude is weaker than the de\nre attitude \n\\((\\exists x) B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (x\\) is a spy).\n \nOn the other hand, the pattern of operators \\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}}\n(\\exists x/B_{\\textit{Ralph}})\\) requires that the witness of the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\) be the same relative to all\ndoxastic alternatives of Ralph, so the de objecto attitude is\nstronger than the de dicto attitude \n\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x) (x\\) is a spy).\n \nJanssen (2013) discusses the possibility of providing in terms of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) a compositional analysis of the de re /\nde dicto ambiguity in natural languages. Brasoveanu and\nFarkas (2011) argue that scopal properties of natural language\nindefinites are best elucidated in terms of a semantics inspired by\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), more precisely by formulating the semantics\nrelative to sets of variable assignments as done in Hodges’s\ncompositional semantics for slash logic.  \nAs a rule, informational independence is not indicated syntactically\nin\n English.[93]\n Methodological consequences of this fact are discussed in Hintikka\n(1990), where he tentatively puts forward the Syntactic Silence\nThesis, according to which sufficiently radical cross-categorical\nphenomena are not likely to be marked syntactically in natural\nlanguages. Evidence for this thesis would, for its part, be evidence\nagainst the sufficiency of syntax-oriented approaches to\nsemantics. \nSyntatically slash logic uses quantifiers like\n\\((\\exists x/y)\\) instead of quantifiers such as\n\\((\\exists x/\\forall y)\\). Semantically slash logic is\notherwise like \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) except that its game-theoretical\nsemantics is based on the idea that a player’s strategy\nfunctions may utilize as their arguments any preceding moves\nmade in the current play, save for those whose use is, by the slash\nnotation, explicitly indicated as forbidden (cf. Sect. 3).\nThat is, also a player’s own earlier moves may appear as\narguments of a strategy function. This can make a difference in the\npresence of imperfect information. For example, consider evaluating\nthe slash-logic sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\exists z/x)\nx = z\\) containing the vacuous quantifier\n\\(\\exists y\\). This sentence is true on a two-element domain,\nsince player 2 can copy as the value of \\(y\\) the value that\nplayer 1 has chosen for \\(x\\), and then select the value of\n\\(z\\) using a strategy function whose only argument is the value\nof \\(y\\). (For this phenomenon of ‘signaling,’ see\nHodges 1997a, Sandu 2001, Janssen & Dechesne 2006, Barbero 2013.)\nBy contrast, the IF sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\exists z/\\forall x)\nx = z\\) fails to be true on such a domain, since there\na strategy function for \\((\\exists z/\\forall x)\\) must be\na constant, and no such strategy function can guarantee a win for\nplayer 2 against both possible values that player 1 can choose for\n\\(x\\). As mentioned in Subsection 4.4, Hodges (1997a,b)\nshowed that slash logic admits of an alternative, compositional\nsemantics. This requires evaluating formulas relative to sets of\nvariable assignments, instead of single assignments as in connection\nwith \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Hodges (1997a,b) and Figueira et\nal. (2009, 2011) discuss an extension of slash logic in which the\ncontradictory negation of slash logic sentences can be expressed. \nJouko Väänänen (2007) formulated a new approach to IF\nlogic that he dubbed dependence logic \\((\\mathbf{DL})\\);\nfor further work on \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\), see e.g. Kontinen\net al. (2013). The syntax of \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) is obtained\nfrom that of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) by allowing atomic formulas of the\nfollowing special form:  \nIntuitively such a formula means that the value of \\(x_{n+1}\\) depends\nonly on the values of \\(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\). The semantics of\n\\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) cannot be formulated relative to single variable\nassignments like that of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\): we cannot explicate what it\nmeans for the value of \\(x_{n+1}\\) to depend on those of \\(x_1 ,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) with reference to a single assignment on the variables \\(x_1\n,\\ldots ,x_{n+1}\\).  For example, consider the assignment described\nbelow:  \nRelative to this assignment, all of the following claims hold:\nwhenever the value of \\(x_1\\) equals 7, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8;\nwhenever the value of \\(x_2\\) equals 5, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8;\nwhenever the value of \\(x_1\\) equals 7 and the value of \\(x_2\\) equals\n5, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8; irrespective of the values of\n\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8. The question of\ndependence only becomes interesting and non-vacuous relative to a set\nof assignments: \nThe set \\(X\\) consisting of the above five assignments satisfies\nthe formula \\(=(x_1\\); \\(x_3)\\): the\nvalue of \\(x_3\\) depends only on the value of\n\\(x_1\\). As is readily observed, any two assignments in\n\\(X\\) which assign the same value to \\(x_1\\)\nassign also the same value to \\(x_3\\). The interesting\nnovelty of \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) is that claims about variable\ndependencies are made at the atomic level. Quantifiers of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and those of slash logic with their independence\nindications easily lead to somewhat messy formulas, whereas\n\\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) looks exactly like \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), apart from\nits greater flexibility in forms of atomic formulas. \nIn this entry IF first-order logic and extended IF first-order logic\nhave been surveyed. Their metalogical properties have been explained\nand the philosophical relevance of these properties has been\ndiscussed. The suggested consequences of these logics for\nphilosophical issues such as the existence of a self-applied\ntruth-predicate, the logicist program, the philosophical relevance of\naxiomatic set theory, and informational independence in natural\nlanguages have been covered as well. Slash logic and dependence logic\n– both closely related to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and inspired by\nit – were also briefly considered.","contact.mail":"tero.tulenheimo@univ-lille3.fr","contact.domain":"univ-lille3.fr"}]
