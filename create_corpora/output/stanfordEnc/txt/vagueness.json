This makes the notion of a borderline case crucial\nin accounts of vagueness. I shall concentrate on an historical\ncharacterization of borderline cases that most commentators would\naccept. Vagueness will then be contrasted with ambiguity and\ngenerality. This will clarify the nature of the philosophical\nchallenge posed by vagueness. I will then discuss some rival theories\nof vagueness with an emphasis on many-valued logic, supervaluationism\nand contextualism. I will conclude with the issue of whether all\nvagueness is linguistic.\n\nIf you cut one head off of a two headed man, have you decapitated him?\nWhat is the maximum height of a short man? When does a fertilized egg\ndevelop into a person? \nThese questions are impossible to answer because they involve absolute\nborderline cases. In the vast majority of cases, the unknowability of\na borderline statement is only relative to a given means of settling\nthe issue (Sorensen 2001, chapter 1). For instance, a boy may count as\na borderline case of ‘obese’ because people cannot tell\nwhether he is obese just by looking at him. A curious mother could try\nto settle the matter by calculating her son’s body mass index. The\nformula is to divide his weight (in kilograms) by the square of his\nheight (in meters). If the value exceeds 30, this test counts him as\nobese. The calculation will itself leave some borderline cases. The\nmother could then use a weight-for-height chart. These charts are not\nentirely decisive because they do not reflect the ratio of fat to\nmuscle, whether the child has large bones, and so on. The boy will\nonly count as an absolute borderline case of ‘obese’ if no\npossible method of inquiry could settle whether he is obese. When we\nreach this stage, we start to suspect that our uncertainty is due to\nthe concept of obesity rather than to our limited means of testing for\nobesity. \nAbsolute borderline cases are targeted by Charles Sander Peirce’s\nentry for ‘vague’ in the 1902 Dictionary of Philosophy\nand Psychology: \nIn the case of relative borderline cases, the question is clear but\nour means for answering it are incomplete. In the case of absolute\nborderline cases, there is incompleteness in the question itself. \nWhen a term is applied to one of its absolute borderline cases the\nresult is a statement that resists all attempts to settle whether it\nis true or false. No amount of conceptual analysis or empirical\ninquiry can settle whether removing one head from a two headed man\ncounts as decapitating him. We could give the appearance of settling\nthe matter by stipulating that ‘decapitate’ means\n‘remove a head’ (as opposed to ‘make headless’\nor ‘remove the head’ or ‘remove the most important\nhead’). But that would amount to changing the topic to an issue\nthat merely sounds the same as decapitation. \nVagueness is standardly defined as the possession of borderline cases.\nFor example, ‘tall’ is vague because a man who is 1.8\nmeters in height is neither clearly tall nor clearly non-tall. No\namount of conceptual analysis or empirical investigation can settle\nwhether a 1.8 meter man is tall. Borderline cases are inquiry\nresistant. \n \nWhere does the tail of a snake begin? When posed as a rhetorical\nquestion, the speaker is hinting that there is no definite answer. But\nthe tail can be located by tracing down from the snake’s rib cage. A\nfalse attribution of indeterminacy will lead to the premature\nabandonment of inquiry. The risk of futile inquiry into questions that\ncannot be answered must be balanced against the risk of abandoning\nquestions that are actually answerable.\n \nInquiry resistance typically recurses. For in addition to the\nunclarity of the borderline case, there is normally unclarity as to\nwhere the unclarity begins. Twilight governs times that are borderline\nbetween day and night. But our uncertainty as to when twilight begins,\nshows there must be borderline cases of borderline cases of\n‘day’.  Consequently, ‘borderline case’ has\nborderline cases. This higher order vagueness seems to show that\n‘vague’ is vague (Hu 2017). \nThe vagueness of ‘vague’ would have two important\n consequences. First, Gottlob Frege could no longer coherently\n characterize vague predicates as incoherent. For his accusation uses\n ‘vague’. Frege’s ideal of precision is itself vague\n because ‘precise’ is the complement of\n ‘vague’.\n\n \nSecond, the vagueness of ‘vague’ dooms efforts to avoid a\nsharp line between true and false with a buffer zone that is neither\ntrue nor false. If the line is not drawn between the true and the\nfalse, then it will be between the true and the intermediate state.\nIntroducing further intermediates just delays the inevitable. \nThis motivates second thoughts about second order vagueness.  Instead\nof continuing to treat higher order vagueness as an insight, several\nphilosophers repudiate higher order vagueness as an illusion (Wright\n2010). They deny that there is an open-ended iteration of borderline\nstatus. They find it telling that speakers do not go around talking\nabout borderline borderline cases and borderline borderline borderline\ncases and so forth (Raffman 2005, 23).  \nDefenders of higher order vagueness say that ordinary speakers avoid\niterating ‘borderline’ for the same reason they avoid\niterating ‘million’ or ‘know’. The iterations\nare confusing but perfectly meaningful. ‘Borderline’\nbehaves just like a vague predicate. For instance,\n‘borderline’ can be embedded in a sorites argument.\nDefenders of higher order vagueness have also tried to clinch the case\nwith particular specimens such as borderline hermaphrodites (reasoning\nthat these individuals are borderline borderline males) (Sorensen\n2010).   \n‘Tall’ is relative. A 1.8 meter pygmy is tall for a pygmy\nbut a 1.8 meter Masai is not tall for a Masai. Although relativization\ndisambiguates, it does not eliminate borderline cases. There are\nshorter pygmies who are borderline tall for a pygmy and taller Masai\nwho are borderline tall for a Masai. The direct bearers of vagueness\nare a word’s full disambiguations such as ‘tall for an\neighteenth century French man’. Words are only vague indirectly,\nby virtue of having a sense that is vague. In contrast, an ambiguous\nword bears its ambiguity directly—simply in virtue of having\nmultiple meanings. \nThis contrast between vagueness and ambiguity is obscured by the fact\nthat most words are both vague and ambiguous. ‘Child’ is\nambiguous between ‘offspring’ and ‘immature\noffspring’. The latter reading of ‘child’ is vague\nbecause there are borderline cases of immature offspring. The contrast\nis further complicated by the fact that most words are also general.\nFor instance, ‘child’ covers both boys and girls. \nAmbiguity and vagueness also contrast with respect to the speaker’s\ndiscretion. If a word is ambiguous, the speaker can resolve the\nambiguity without departing from literal usage. For instance, he can\ndeclare that he meant ‘child’ to express the concept of an\nimmature offspring. If a word is vague, the speaker cannot resolve the\nborderline case. For instance, the speaker cannot make\n‘child’ literally mean anyone under eighteen just by\nintending it. That concept is not, as it were, on the menu\ncorresponding to ‘child’. He would be understood as taking\na special liberty with the term to suit a special\npurpose. Acknowledging departure from ordinary usage would relieve him\nof the obligation to defend the sharp cut-off.  \nWhen the movie director Alfred Hitchcock mused ‘All actors are\nchildren’ he was taking liberties with clear negative cases of\n‘child’ rather than its borderline cases. The aptness of\nhis generalization is not judged by its literal truth-value (because\nit is obviously untrue). Likewise, we do not judge precisifications of\nborderline cases by their truth-values (because they are obviously not\nascertainable as true or false). We instead judge precisifications by\ntheir simplicity, conservativeness, and fruitfulness. A\nprecisification that draws the line across the borderline cases\nconserves more paradigm usage than one that draws the line across\nclear cases. But conservatism is just one desideratum among many.\nSometimes the best balance is achieved at the cost of turning former\npositive cases into negative cases.  \nOnce we shift from literal to figurative usage, we gain fictive\ncontrol over our entire vocabulary—not just vague words. When a\ntravel agent says ‘France is a hexagon’, we do not infer\nthat she has committed the geometrical error of classifying France as\na six sided polygon. We instead interpret the travel agent as speaking\nfiguratively, as meaning that France is shaped like a hexagon.\nSimilarly, when the travel agent says ‘Reno is the biggest\nlittle city’, we do not interpret her as overlooking the\nvagueness of ‘little city’. Just as she uses the obvious\nfalsehood of ‘France is a hexagon’ to signal a metaphor,\nshe uses the obvious indeterminacy of ‘Reno is the biggest\nlittle city’ to signal hyperbole.  \nGiven that speakers lack any literal discretion over vague terms, we\nought not to chide them for indecisiveness. Where there is no decision\nto be made, there is no scope for vice.  \nSpeakers would have literal discretion if statements applying a\npredicate to its borderline cases were just permissible variations in\nlinguistic usage. For instance, Crispin Wright and Stewart Shapiro say\na competent speaker can faultlessly classify the borderline case as a\npositive instance while another competent speaker can faultlessly\nclassify the case as a negative instance.  \nFor the sake of comparison, consider discretion between alternative\nspellings. Professor Letterman uses ‘judgment’ instead of\n‘judgement’ because he wants to promote the principle that\na silent E signals a long vowel. He still has fond memories of Tom\nLehrer’s 1971 children’s song “Silent E”:  \nProfessor Letterman disapproves of those who add the misleading E but\nconcedes that ‘judgement’ is a permissible spelling; he\ndoes not penalize his students for misspelling when they make their\nhard-hearted choice of ‘judgement’. Indeed, like other\nprofessors, he scolds students if they fail to stick with the same\nspelling throughout the composition. Choose but stick to your choice!\n \nProfessor Letterman’s assertion ‘The word for my favorite mental\nact is spelled j-u-d-g-m-e-n-t’ is robust with respect to the\nnews that it is also spelled j-u-d-g-e-m-e-n-t. He would continue to\nassert it. He can conjoin the original assertion with information\nabout the alternative: ‘The word for my favorite mental act is\nspelled j-u-d-g-m-e-n-t and is also spelled j-u-d-g-e-m-e-n-t’.\nIn contrast, Professor Letterman’s assertion that ‘Martha is a\nwoman’ is not robust with respect to the news that Martha is a\nborderline case of ‘woman’ (say, Letterman learns Martha\nis younger than she looks). The new information would lead Letterman\nto retract his assertion in favor of a hedged remark such as\n‘Martha might be a woman and Martha might not be a woman’.\nProfessor Letterman’s loss of confidence is hard to explain if the\ninformation about her borderline status were simply news of a\ndifferent but permissible way of describing her. Discoveries of\nnotational variants do not warrant changes in former beliefs.  \nNews of borderline status has an evidential character. Loss of clarity\nbrings loss of warrant. If you do not lower your confidence, you are\nopen to the charge of dogmatism. To concede that Martha is a\nborderline case of ‘woman’ is to concede that you do not\nknow that she is a woman. That is why debates can be dissolved by\nshowing that the dispute is over a borderline case. The debaters\nshould be agnostic if they are dealing with a borderline case. They do\nnot have a license to form beliefs beyond their evidence.  \nNews of an alternative sense is like news of an alternative spelling;\nthere is no evidential impact (except for meta-linguistic beliefs\nabout the nature of words). Your assertion that ‘All bachelors\nare men’ is robust with respect to the news that\n‘bachelor’ has an alternative sense in which it means a\nmale seal. Assertions are not robust with respect to news of hidden\ngenerality. If a South African girl says ‘No elephant can be\ndomesticated’ but is then taught that there is another species\nof elephant indigenous to Asia, then she will lose some confidence;\nmaybe Asian elephants can be domesticated. News of hidden generality\nhas evidential impact. When it comes to robustness, vagueness\nresembles generality more than vagueness resembles ambiguity.  \nMathematical terms such as ‘prime number’ show that a term\ncan be general without being vague. A term can also be vague without\nbeing general. Borderline cases of analytically empty predicates\nillustrate this possibility. \nGenerality is obviously useful. Often, lessons about a particular\nF can be projected to other Fs in virtue of their\ncommon F-ness. When a girl learns that her cat has a\nnictating membrane that protects its eyes, she rightly expects her\nneighbor’s cat also has a nictating membrane. Generality saves labor.\nWhen the girl says that she wants a toy rather than clothes, she\nnarrows the range of acceptable gifts without going through the\ntrouble of specifying a particular gift. The girl also balances\nvalues: a gift should be intrinsically desired and yet also be a\nsurprise. If uncertain about which channel is the weather channel, she\ncan hedge by describing the channel as ‘forty-something’.\nThere is an inverse relationship between the contentfulness of a\nproposition and its probability: the more specific a claim, the less\nlikely it is to be true. By gauging generality, we can make sensible\ntrade-offs between truth and detail. \n‘Vague’ has a sense which is synonymous with abnormal\ngenerality. This precipitates many equivocal explanations of\nvagueness. For instance, many commentators say that vagueness exists\nbecause broad categories ease the task of classification. If I can\ndescribe your sweater as red, then I do not need to ascertain whether\nit is scarlet. This freedom to use wide intervals obviously helps us\nto learn, teach, communicate, and remember. But so what? The problem\nis to explain the existence of borderline cases. Are they present\nbecause vagueness serves a function? Or are borderline cases\nside-effects of ordinary conversation—like echoes? \nEvery natural language is both vague and ambiguous. However, both\nfeatures seem eliminable. Indeed, both are eliminated in miniature\nlanguages such as checkers notation, computer programming languages,\nand mathematical descriptions. Moreover, it seems that both vagueness\nand ambiguity ought to be minimized. ‘Vague’ and\n‘ambiguous’ are pejorative terms. And they deserve their\nbad reputations. Think of all the automotive misery that has been\nprefaced by \nEnglish can be lethal. Philosophers have long motivated appeals for an\nideal language by pointing out how ambiguity creates the menace of\nequivocation: \nHappily, we know how to criticize and correct all equivocations.\nIndeed, every natural language is self-disambiguating in the sense\nthat each has all the resources needed to uniquely specify any reading\none desires. Ambiguity is often the cause but rarely the object of\nphilosophical rumination. \nVagueness, in contrast, precipitates a profound problem: the sorites\nparadox. For instance, \nInduction step: If an n day old human being is a child, then\nthat human being is also a child when it is n + 1 days\nold. \nConclusion: Therefore, a 36,500 day old human being is a child. \nThe conclusion is false because a 100 year old man is clearly a\nnon-child. Since the base step of the argument is also plainly true\nand the argument is valid by mathematical induction, we seem to have\nno choice but to reject the second premise. \nGeorge Boolos (1991) observes that we have an autonomous case against\nthe induction step. In addition to implying plausible conditionals\nsuch as ‘If a 1 day old human being is a child, then that human\nbeing is also a child when it is 2 days old’, the induction step\nalso implies ludicrous conditionals such as ‘If a 1 day old\nhuman being is a child, then that human being is also a child when it\nis 36,500 days old’.\n \nBoolos is puzzled why we overlook these clear counterexamples. One\nexplanation is that we tend to treat the induction step as a generic\ngeneralization such as ‘ People have ten toes’(Sorensen\n2012). Whereas the formal generalization ‘All people have ten\ntoes’ is refuted by people with eleven toes, the generic\ngeneralization tolerates exceptions.\n\n \nThis hypothesis is plausible for newcomers to the sorites paradox. But\nit is less plausible for those being tutored by Professor Boolos. He\nguides logic students to the correct interpretation of the induction\nstep. When students drift to a generic reading, Boolos reminds them\nthat induction step is a formal generalization.\n \nGuided by Boolos’ firm hand, logic students drive a second\nstake into the heart of the sorites paradox. Yet the paradox seems far\nfrom dead.  The negation of the second premise classically implies a\nsharp threshold for childhood. For it implies the existential\ngeneralization that there is a number n such that\nan n day old human being is a child but is no longer a child\none day later. \nEpistemicists accept this astonishing consequence. They think\nvagueness is a form of ignorance. Timothy Williamson (1994) traces the\nignorance of the threshold for childhood to “margin for\nerror” principles. If one knows that an n day old human\nbeing is a child, then that human being must also be a child when\nn + 1 days old. Otherwise, one is right by luck. Given that\nthere is a threshold, we would be ignorant of its location. \nDebate over the margin for error principle draws us deep into\nepistemology and modality (Yli-Vakkuri 2016). Some commentators switch\nfocus to attitudes weaker than knowledge. According to Nicholas Smith\n(2008, 182) we cannot even guess that the threshold for baldness is\nthe 400th hair. Hartry Field (2010, 203) denies that a rational man\ncan fear that he has just passed the threshold into being old. Hope,\nspeculation, and wonder do not require evidence but they do require\nunderstanding. So it is revealing that these attitudes have trouble\ngetting a purchase on the threshold of oldness (or any other vague\npredicate). A simple explanation is that bare linguistic competence\ngives us knowledge that are no such thresholds. This accounts for the\ncomical air of the epistemicist. Just as there is no conceptual room\nto worry that there is a natural number between sixty and sixty one,\nthere is no conceptual room to worry that one has passed the threshold\nof oldness between one’s sixtieth and sixty first birthday.  \nAn old epistemicist might reply: My piecemeal confidence that a given\nnumber is not the threshold for oldness does not agglomerate into\ncollective confidence that there is no such number. If I bet against\neach number being the threshold, then I must have placed a losing bet\nsomewhere. For if I won each bet then there was no opportunity for me\nto make the transition to oldness. My bookie could have made a\n“Dutch book” against me. He would have been entitled to\npayment without having to identify which bet I lost. Since\nprobabilities may be extracted from hypothetical betting behavior, I\nmust actually assign some small (normally negligible) probability to\nhypotheses identifying particular thresholds. So must you.  \nStephen Schiffer (2003, 204) denies that classical probability\ncalculations apply in vague contexts. Suppose Donald is borderline old\nand borderline bald. According to Schiffer we should be just as\nconfident in the conjunction ‘Donald is old and bald’ as\nin either conjunct. Adding conjuncts does not reduce confidence\nbecause we have a “vague partial belief” rather than the\nstandard belief assumed by mathematicians developing probability\ntheory.  Schiffer offers a calculus for this vagueness-related\npropositional attitude. He crafts the rules for vague partial belief\nto provide a\npsychological solution to the sorites paradox.  \nThe project is complicated by the fact that vague partial beliefs\ninteract with precise beliefs (MacFarlane 2010). Consider a statement\nthat has a mixture of vague and precise conjuncts: ‘Donald is\nold and bald and has an even number of hairs’. Adding the extra\nprecise conjunct should diminish confidence. Schiffer also needs to\naccommodate the fact that some speakers are undecided about whether\nthe nature of the uncertainty involves vagueness. Even an idealized\nspeaker may be unsure because there is vagueness about the borders\nbetween vagueness related uncertainty and other sorts of uncertainty.\n \nOther commentators grant that it is logically possible that vague\npredicates have thresholds. They just think it would be a miracle:\n“It is logically possible that the words on this page will come\nto life and sort my socks. But I know enough about words to dismiss\nthis as a serious possibility. So I am right to boggle at the\npossibility that our rough and ready terms such as ‘red’\ncould so sensitively classify objects.” Epistemicists counter\nthat this bafflement rests on an over-estimate of the role of\nstipulation in meaning. Epistemicists say much meaning is acquired\npassively by default rather than actively by decision. If some\nboundaries are more eligible for reference than others, then the\nenvironment does the work. \nMost philosophers doubt whether precise analytical tools fit vague\narguments. H. G. Wells was amongst the first to suggest that we must\nmoderate the application of logic: \nMany more believe that the problem is with logic itself rather than\nthe manner in which it is applied. They favor solving the sorites\nparadox by replacing standard logic with an earthier deviant\nlogic. \nThere is a desperately wide range of opinions as to how the revision\nof logic should be executed. Every form of deviant logic has been\napplied in the hope of resolving the sorites paradox. \nAn early favorite was many-valued logic. On this approach, borderline\nstatements are assigned truth-values that lie between full truth and\nfull falsehood. Some logicians favor three truth-values, others prefer\nfour or five. The most popular approach is to use an infinite number\nof truth-values represented by the real numbers between 0 (for full\nfalsehood) and 1 (for full truth). This infinite spectrum of\ntruth-values might be of service for a continuous sorites argument\ninvolving ‘small real number’ (Weber and Colyvan\n2010). \nCritics object that this proliferation of truth-values exacerbates the\nover-precision of classical logic. Instead of having just one\nartificially sharp line between the true and the false, the\nmany-valued logician has infinitely many sharp lines such as that\nbetween statements with a truth of .323483925 and those with a higher\ntruth-value. In Mark Sainsbury’s words, “… you do not\nimprove a bad idea by iterating it.” (1996, 255)  \nA proponent of an infinite valued logic might reply to Sainsbury with\nan analogy. It is a bad idea to model a circle with a straight line.\nUsing two lines is not much better, nor is there is much improvement\nusing a three sided polygon (a triangle). But as we add more straight\nlines to the polygon (square, pentagon, hexagon, and so on) we make\nprogress—by iterating the bad idea of modeling a circle with\nstraight lines.  \nIndeed, it would be tempting to triumphantly conclude ‘The\ncircle has been modeled as an infinitely sided polygon’. This\nvictory declaration would itself need clarification. Has the circle\nbeen revealed to be an infinitely sided polygon? Have curved lines\nbeen replaced by straight lines? Have curved lines (and hence circles)\nbeen proven to not exist? A model can succeed without it being clear\nwhat has been achieved.  \nBut it is premature to dwell on the simile ‘Precision is to\nvagueness as straightness is to curvature’. The many-valued\nlogician must first vindicate the analogy by providing details about\nhow to calculate the truth-values of vague statements from the\ntruth-values of their component statements.  \nProponents of many-valued logic approach this obligation with great\nindustry. Precise new rules are introduced to calculate the truth\nvalue of compound statements that contain statements with intermediate\ntruth-values. For instance, the revised rule for conjunctions is to\nassign the conjunction the same truth-value as the conjunct with the\nlowest truth-value. \nThese rules are designed to yield all standard theorems when all the\ntruth values are 1 and 0. In this sense, classical logic is a limiting\ncase of many-valued logic. Classical logic is agreed to work fine in\nthe area for which it was designed—mathematics.  \nMost theorems of standard logic break down when intermediate\ntruth-values are involved. (An irregular minority, such as ‘If\nP, then P’, survive.) Even the classical\ncontradiction ‘Donald is bald and it is not the case that he is\nbald’ receives a truth-value of .5 when ‘Donald is\nbald’ has a truth-value of .5. Many-valued logicians note that\nthe error they are imputing to classical logic is often so small that\nclassical logic can still be fruitfully applied. But they insist that\nthe sorites paradox illustrates how tiny errors accumulate into a\nbig error. \nCritics of the many-valued approach complain that it botches phenomena\nsuch as hedging. If I regard you as a borderline case of ‘tall\nman’, I cannot sincerely assert that you are tall and I cannot\nsincerely assert that you are of average height. But I can assert the\nhedged claim ‘Either you are tall or of average\nheight’. The many-valued rule for disjunction is to assign the\nwhole statement the truth-value of its highest disjunct. Normally, the\nadded disjunct in a hedged claim is not more plausible than the other\ndisjuncts. Thus it cannot increase the degree of\ntruth. Disappointingly, the proponent of many-valued logic cannot\ntrace the increase of assertibility to an increase in the degree of\ntruth. \nEpistemicists explain the rise in assertibility by the increasing\nprobability of truth. Since the addition of disjuncts can raise\nprobability indefinitely, the epistemicists correctly predict that we\ncan hedge our way to full assertibility. However, epistemicists do not\nhave a monopoly on this prediction. \nAccording to supervaluationists, borderline statements lack a\ntruth-value. This neatly explains why it is universally impossible to\nknow the truth-value of a borderline statement. Supervaluationists\noffer details about the nature of absolute borderline cases. Simple\nsentences about borderline cases lack a truth-value. Compounds of\nthese statements can have a truth-value if they come out true\nregardless of how the statement is precisified. For instance,\n‘Either Mr. Stoop is tall or it is not the case that Mr. Stoop\nis tall’ is true because it comes out true under all ways of\nsharpening ‘tall’. Thus the method of supervaluations\nallows one to retain all the theorems of standard logic while\nadmitting “truth-value gaps”. \nOne may wonder whether this striking result is a genuine convergence\nwith standard logic. Is the supervaluationist characterizing vague\nstatements as propositions? Or is he merely pointing out that certain\nnon-propositions have a structure isomorphic to logical theorems?\n(Some electrical circuits are isomorphic to tautologies but this does\nnot make the circuits tautologies.) Kit Fine (1975, 282), and\nespecially David Lewis (1982), characterize vagueness as\nhyper-ambiguity. Instead of there being one vague concept, there are\nmany precise concepts that closely resemble each other.\n‘Child’ can mean a human being at most one day old or mean\na human being at most two days old or mean a human being at most three\ndays old …. Thus the logic of vagueness is a logic for\nequivocators. Lewis’ idea is that ambiguous statements are true when\nthey come out true under all disambiguations. But logicians normally\nrequire that a statement be disambiguated before logic is\napplied. The mere fact that an ambiguous statement comes out true\nunder all its disambiguations does not show that the statement itself\nis true. Sentences which are actually disambiguated may have\ntruth-values. But the best that can be said of those that merely\ncould be disambiguated is that they would have had a\ntruth-value had they been disambiguated (Tye 1989). \nSupervaluationism will converge with classical logic only if each word\nof the supervaluated sentence is uniformly interpreted. For instance,\n‘Either a carbon copy of Teddy Roosevelt’s signature is an\nautograph or it is not the case that a carbon copy of Teddy\nRoosevelt’s signature is an autograph’ comes out true only if\n‘autograph’ is interpreted the same way in both disjuncts.\nVague sentences resist mixed interpretations. However, mixed\ninterpretations are permissible for ambiguous sentences. As Lewis\nhimself notes in a criticism of relevance logic, ‘Scrooge walked\nalong the bank on his way to the bank’ can receive a mixed\ndisambiguation. When exterminators offer ‘non-toxic ant\npoison’, we charitably switch relativizations within the noun\nphrase: the substance is safe for human beings but deadly for\nants. \nEven if one agrees that supervaluationism converges with classical\nlogic about theoremhood, they clearly differ in other respects.\nSupervaluationism requires rejection of inference rules such as\ncontraposition, conditional proof and reductio ad absurdum \n(Williamson 1994, 151–152). In the eyes of the\nsupervaluationist, a demonstration that a statement is not true does\nnot guarantee that the statement is false. \nThe supervaluationist is also under pressure to reject semantic\nprinciples which are intimately associated with the application of\nlogical laws. According to Alfred Tarski’s Convention T, a statement\n‘S’ is true if and only if S. In other\nwords, truth is disquotational. Supervaluationists say that being\nsupertrue (being true under all precisifications) suffices for being\ntrue. But given Convention T, supertruth would then be disquotational.\nSince the supervaluationists accept the principle of excluded middle,\nthey would be forced to say ‘P’ is supertrue or\n‘Not P’ is supertrue (even if\n‘P’ applies a predicate to a borderline case).\nThis would imply that either ‘P’ is true or\n‘Not P’ is true. (Williamson 1994, 162–163)\nAnd that would be a fatal loss of truth-value gaps for\nsupervaluationism. \nThere is a final concern about the “ontological honesty”\nof the supervaluationist’s existential quantifier. As part of his\nsolution to the sorites paradox, the supervaluationist will assert\n‘There is a human being who was a child when n days old\nbut not when n + 1 days old’. For this statement comes\nout true under all admissible precisifications of ‘child’.\nHowever, when pressed the supervaluationist will add an unofficial\nclarification: “Oh, of course I do not mean that there really is\na sharp threshold for childhood.” \nAfter the clarification, some wonder how supervaluationism differs\nfrom drastic metaphysical skepticism. In his nihilist days, Peter\nUnger (1979) admitted that it is useful to talk as if there\nare children. But he insisted that strictly speaking, vague terms such\nas ‘child’ cannot apply to anything. Unger was free to use\nsupervaluationism as a theory to explain our ordinary discourse about\nchildren. (Unger instead used other resources to explain how we\nfruitfully apply empty predicates.) But once the dust had cleared and\nthe precise rubble came into focus, Unger had to conclude that there\nare no children. \nOfficially, the supervaluationist rejects the induction step of the\nsorites argument. Unofficially, he seems to instead reject the\nbase step of the sorites argument. \nSupervaluationism is also haunted by a logical analogy. Whereas the\nsupervaluationist analyzes borderline cases in terms of truth-value\ngaps the dialetheist analyzes them in terms of truth-value gluts. A\nglut is a proposition that is both true and false. The rule for\nassigning gluts is the mirror image of the rule for assigning gaps: A\nstatement is true exactly if it comes out true on at least one\nprecisification. The statement is false just if it comes out false on\nat least one precisification. So if the statement comes out true under\none precisification and false under another precisification, the\nstatement is both true and false.  \nTo avoid triviality, the dialetheist must adopt a logic that stops two\ncontradictory statements from jointly implying everything. The\nresulting “subvaluationism” is a dual of\nsupervaluationism.\n \nThe spiritual father of subvaluationism is Georg Hegel. For Hegel, the\nbasic kind of vagueness is conflict vagueness. The man at the\nthreshold of your doorway is both inside your room and outside your\nroom. Degree vagueness is just a special case of the conflict inherit\nin becoming.  Any process requires a gradual manifestation of a\ncontradiction inherit in the original state. At some stage, a\nmetamorphosizing caterpillar is not a butterfly (by virtue of what it\nwas) and a butterfly (by virtue of what it will be). Hegelians\nbelieved this dialectical conception of vagueness solved the sorites\nand demonstrated the inadequacy of classical logic. The Russian Marxist\nGeorgi Plekhanov (1908 [1937]) proposed a logic of contradiction to succeed\nclassical logic (Hyde 2008, 93–5). One of his students, Henry Mehlberg\n(1958) went on to substitute gaps for gluts. The first version of\nsupervaluationism is thus a synthesis, reconciling the thesis of\nclassical logic with the anti-thesis posed by the logic of\ncontradiction.\n\n \nViewed formally, there seems no more reason to prefer one departure\nfrom classical logic rather than the other. Since Western philosophers\nabominate contradiction, parity with dialetheism would diminish the\ngreat popularity of supervaluationism. \nA Machiavellian epistemicist will welcome this battle between the gaps\nand the gluts. He roots for the weaker side. Although he does not want\nthe subvaluationist to win, the Machiavellian epistemicist does want\nthe subvaluationist to achieve mutual annihilation with his\nsupervaluationist doppelgänger. His political calculation is:\nGaps + Gluts = Bivalence.  \nPablo Corberos (2011) has argued that subvaluationism provides a\nbetter treatment of higher order vagueness than supervaluationism. But\nfor the most part, the subvaluationists (and their frenemies) have\nmerely claimed subvaluationism to be at least as attractive as\nsupervaluationism (Hyde and Colyvan 2008). This modest ambition seems\nprudent. After all, truth-value gaps have far more independent support\nfrom the history of philosophy (at least if confined to Western\nphilosophy). Prior to the explosive growth of vagueness research after\n1975, ordinary language philosophers amassed a panoramic battery of\nanalyses suggesting that gaps are involved in presupposition,\nreference failure, fiction, future contingent propositions,\nperformatives, and so on and so on. Supervaluationism rigorously\nconsolidated these appeals to ordinary language.  \nDialetheists characterize intolerance for contradiction as a shallow\nphenomenon, restricted to a twentieth Western academic milieu (maybe\neven now being eclipsed by the rise of China). Experimental\nphilosophers have challenged the old appeals to ordinary language with\nempirical results suggesting that glutty talk is as readily stimulated\nby borderline cases as gappy talk (Alxatib and Pelletier 2011, Ripley\n2011).  \nJust as contextualism in epistemology runs orthogonal to the familiar\ndivisions amongst epistemologists (foundationalism, reliabilism,\ncoherentism, etc.), there are contextualists of every persuasion\namongst vagueness theorists. They develop an analogy between the\nsorites paradox and indexical sophistries such as: \n1. Base step: The horizon is more than 1 meter away. \n2. Induction step: If the horizon is more than n meters away,\nthen it is more than n + 1 meters away. \n3. Conclusion: The horizon is more than a billion meters away. \nThe horizon is where the earth meets the sky and is certainly less\nthan a billion meters away. (The circumference of the earth is only\nforty million meters.) Yet when you travel toward the horizon to\nspecify the n at which the induction step fails, your trip is\nas futile as the pursuit of the rainbow. You cannot reach the horizon\nbecause it shifts with your location.  \nAll contextualists accuse the sorites monger of equivocating. In one\nsense, the meaning of ‘child’ is uniform; the\ncontext-invariant rule for using the term (its\n“character”) is constant. However, the set of things to\nwhich the term applies (its “content”) shifts with the\ncontext. In this respect, vague words resemble indexical terms such\nas: I, you, here, now, today, tomorrow. When a debtor tells his\ncreditor on Monday ‘I will pay you back tomorrow’ and then\nrepeats the sentence on Tuesday, there is a sense in which he has said\nthe same thing (the character is the same) and a sense in which he has\nsaid something different (the content has shifted because\n‘tomorrow’ now picks out Wednesday).  \nAccording to the contextualists, the rules governing the shifts\nprohibit us from interpreting any instance of the induction step as\nhaving a true antecedent and a false consequent. The very process of\ntrying to refute the induction step changes the context so that the\ninstance will not come out false. Indeed, contextualists typically\nemphasize that each instance is true. Assent is\nmandatory. Consequently, direct attacks on the induction step must\nfail. One is put in mind of Seneca’s admonition to his student Nero:\n“However many you put to death, you will never kill your\nsuccessor.” \nHans Kamp, the founder of contextualism, maintained that the extension\nof vague words orbits the speaker’s store of conversational\ncommitments.  In a more psychological vein, Diana Raffman says changes\nin context trigger gestalt shifts between look-alike categories.  \nStewart Shapiro integrates Kamp’s ideas with Friedrich Waismann’s\nconcept of open texture. Shapiro thinks speakers have discretion over\nborderline cases because they are judgment dependent. They come out\ntrue in virtue of the speaker judging them to be true. Given that the\naudience does not resist, borderline cases of ‘child’ can\nbe correctly described as children. The audience recognizes that other\ncompetent speakers could describe the borderline case differently. As\nWaismann lyricizes “Every description stretches, as it were,\ninto a horizon of open possibilities: However far I go, I shall always\ncarry this horizon with me.” (1968, 122)  \nAmerican pragmaticism colors Delia Graff Fara’s contextualism.\nConsider dandelion farms. Why would someone grow weeds? The answer is\nthat ‘weed’ is relative to interests. Dandelions are\nunwanted by lawn caretakers but are desired by farmers for food, wine,\nand medical uses. Fara thinks this interest relativity extends to all\nvague words. For instance, ‘child’ means a degree of\nimmaturity that is significant to the speaker. Since the interests of\nthe speaker shift, there is an opportunity for a shift in the\nextension of ‘child’. Fara is reluctant to describe\nherself as a contextualist because the context only has an indirect\neffect on the extension via the changes it makes to the speaker’s\ninterest.  \nHow strictly are we to take the comparison between vague words and\nindexical terms? Scott Soames (2002, 445) answers that all vague words\nliterally are indexical.  \nThis straightforward response is open to the objection that the\nsorites monger could stabilize reference. When the sorites monger\nrelativizes ‘horizon’ to the northeast corner of the\nEmpire State Building’s observation deck, he seems to generate a\ngenuine sorites paradox that exploits the vagueness of\n‘horizon’ (not its indexicality). \nAll natural languages have stabilizing pronouns, ellipsis, and other\nanaphoric devices. For instance, in ‘Jack is tired now and Jill\nis too’, the ‘too’ forces a uniform reading of\n‘tired’. Jason Stanley suggests that the sorites monger\nemploy the premise:  \nEach ‘thatn’ refers to the\nnth element in a sequence of worsening examples of\n‘child’. The meaning of ‘child’ is not\nshifting because the first occurrence of the term governs all the\nsubsequent clauses (thanks to ‘too’). If vague terms were\nliterally indexical, the sorites monger would have a strong reply. If\nvague terms only resemble indexicals, then the contextualist needs to\ndevelop the analogy in a way that circumvents Stanley’s counsel to the\nsorites monger.  \nThe contextualist would also need to address a second technique for\nstabilizing the context. R. M. Sainsbury (2013) advises the sorites\nmonger to present his premises in apparently random order. No pair of\nsuccessive cases raises an alarm that similar cases are being treated\ndifferently. Unless the hearer has extraordinary memory, he will not\nfeel pressured to adjust the context.\n \nThe contextualist must find enough shiftiness to block every sorites\nargument. Since vagueness seeps into every syntactic category, critics\ncomplain that contextualism exceeds the level of ambiguity\ncountenanced by linguistics and psycholinguists.\n \nAnother concern is that some sorites arguments involve predicates that\ndo not give us an opportunity to equivocate. Consider a sorites with a\nbase step that starts from a number too large for us to think about.\nOr consider an inductive predicate that is too complex for us to\nreason with. One example is obtained by iterating ‘mother\nof’ a thousand times (Sorensen 2001, 33). This predicate could\nbe embedded in a mind numbing sorites that would never generate\ncontext shifts.  \nOther unthinkable sorites arguments use predicates that can only be\ngrasped by individuals in other possible worlds or by creatures with\ndifferent types of minds than ours. More fancifully, there could be a\nvague predicate, such as Saul Kripke’s “killer yellow”,\nthat instantly kills anyone who thinks about it. The basic problem is\nthat contextualism is a psychologistic theory of the sorites.\nArguments can exist without being propounded.  \nSupervaluationists encourage the view that all vagueness is a matter\nof linguistic indecision: the reason why there are borderline cases is\nthat we have not bothered to make up our minds.\n \nThe method of supervaluation allows us to assign truth-values prior to\nany decisions.  Expressivists think this is a mistake akin to\nassigning truth-values to normative claims (MacFarlane 2016). They\nmodel vagueness as practical uncertainty as to whether to treat a\nborderline F as an F. The deliberator may accept the tautologies of\nclassical logic as constraints governing competing plans for drawing\nlines. I can accept ‘Either Donald is bald or not’ without\naccepting either disjunct. An existentially quantified sentence can be\naccepted even when no instance is. A shrug of the shoulders signals\nreadiness to go either way, not ignorance as to which possible world\none inhabits. The supervaluationist tries to express this insight by\nexpanding the conditions under which truth-values can be\nassigned. This the wrong medium for the message.\n\n \nThe expressivist is poised to explain how supervaluationism developed\ninto the most respected theory of vagueness. Frege portrayed vagueness\nas a side-effect of laziness. But supervaluationists countered that\nindecision is functional.  Instead of committing ourselves\nprematurely, we can fill in meanings as we go along in light of new\ninformation and interests. This conjecture is promising for the highly\nstipulative enterprise of promulgating and enforcing laws (Endicott\n2000). Judges frequently seem to exercise and control discretion by\nmeans of vague language.  Uncertainties about the scope of discretion\nmay arise from higher order vagueness (Schauer 2016).\n \nDiscretion through gap-filling pleases those who regard adjudication\nas a creative process. It alarms those who think we should be judged\nby laws rather than men. The doctrine of discretion through\nindeterminacy has also been questioned on grounds that the source of\nthe discretion is the generality of the legal terms rather than their\nvagueness (Poscher 2012).  \nSupervaluationists emphasize the distinction between words and\nobjects. Objects themselves do not seem to be the sort of thing that\ncan be general, ambiguous, or vague (Eklund 2011). From this\nperspective, Georg Hegel appears to commit a category mistake when he\ncharacterizes clouds as vague. Although we sometimes speak of clouds\nbeing ambiguous or even being general to a region, this does not\nentitle us to infer that there is metaphysical ambiguity or\nmetaphysical generality.  \nSupervaluationists are here incorporating an orthodoxy dating back to\nBertrand Russell’s seminal article “Vagueness” (1923).\nThis consensus was re-affirmed by Michael Dummett (1975) and\nritualistically re-avowed by subsequent commentators.  \nIn 1978 Gareth Evans focused opposition to vague objects with a short\nproof modeled after Saul Kripke’s attack on contingent identity. If\nthere is a vague object, then some statement of the form\n‘a = b’ must be vague (where each of the\nflanking singular terms precisely designates that object). For the\nvagueness is allegedly due to the object rather than its\nrepresentation. But any statement of form ‘a =\na’ is definitely true. Consequently, a has the\nproperty of being definitely identical to a. Since a\n= b, then b must also have the property of being\ndefinitely identical to a. Therefore ‘a =\nb’ must be definitely true!  \nEvans agrees that there are vague identity statements in which one of\nthe flanking terms is vague (just as Kripke agrees that there are\ncontingent identity statements when one of the flanking terms is a\nflaccid designator). But then the vagueness is due to language, not\nthe world.  \nDespite Evans’ impressive assault, there was a renewal of interest in\nvague objects in the 1980s. As a precedent for this revival, Peter van\nInwagen (1990, 283) recalls that in the 1960s, there was a consensus\nthat all necessity is linguistic. Most philosophers now take the\npossibility of essential properties seriously. \nSome of the reasons are technical. Problems with Kripke’s refutation\nof contingent identity have structural parallels that affect Evans’\nproof. Evans also relies on inferences that deviant logicians\nchallenge (Parsons 2000).  \nIn the absence of a decisive reductio ad absurdum, many\nlogicians feel their role to be the liberal one of articulating the\nlogical space for vague objects. There should be “Vague objects\nfor those who want them” (Cowles and White 1991). Logic should\nbe ontologically neutral.  \n\nSince epistemicists try to solve the sorites with little more than a\nresolute application of classical logic, they are methodologically\ncommitted to a partisan role for logic. Instead of looking for\nloopholes, we should accept the consequence (Williamson 2015). \nSome non-enemies of vague objects also have an ambition to consolidate\nvarious species of indeterminacy (Barnes and Williams 2011). Talk of\nindeterminacy is found in quantum mechanics, analyses of the open\nfuture, fictional incompleteness, and the continuum hypothesis.\nPerhaps vagueness is just one face of indeterminacy.  \nThis panoramic vision contrasts with the continuing resolution of many\nto tether vagueness to the sorites paradox (Eklund 2011). They fear\nthat the clarity achieved by semantic ascent will be muddied by\nmetaphysics.  \nBut maybe the mud is already on the mountain top. Trenton Merricks\n(2001) claims that standard characterizations of linguistic vagueness\nrely on metaphysical vagueness. If ‘Donald is bald’ lacks\na truth-value because there is no fact to make the statement true,\nthen the shortage appears to be ontological. \nThe view that vagueness is always linguistic has been attacked from\nother directions. Consider the vagueness of maps (Varzi 2001). The\nvagueness is pictorial rather than discursive. So one cannot conclude\nthat vagueness is linguistic merely from the premise that vagueness is\nrepresentational.  \nOr consider vague instrumental music such as Claude Debussy’s\n“The Clouds”. Music has syntax but too little semantics to\nqualify as language. There is a little diffuse reference through\ndevices such as musical quotation, leitmotifs, and homages. These\nreferential devices are not precise. Therefore, some music is vague\n(Sorensen 2010). The strength and significance of this argument\ndepends on the relationship between music and language. Under the\nmusilanguage hypothesis, language and music branched off from a common\n“musilanguage” with language specializing in semantics and\nmusic specializing in the expression of emotion. This scenario makes\nit plausible that purely instrumental music could have remnants of\nsemantic meaning.  \nMental imagery also seems vague. When rising suddenly after a\nprolonged crouch, I “see stars before my eyes”. I can tell\nthere are more than ten of these hallucinated lights but I cannot tell\nhow many. Is this indeterminacy in thought to be reduced to\nindeterminacy in language? Why not vice versa? Language is an\noutgrowth of human psychology. Thus it seems natural to view language\nas merely an accessible intermediate bearer of vagueness.","contact.mail":"roy.sorensen@austin.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"austin.utexas.edu"}]
