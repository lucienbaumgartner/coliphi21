This simple demand for thoroughgoing\nintelligibility yields some of the boldest and most challenging theses\nin the history of philosophy. In this entry we begin by explaining\nthe Principle and then turn to the history of the debates around it.\nWe conclude with an examination of the emerging contemporary\ndiscussion of the Principle.\n\nSuppose you enter a farmers’ market, pick out a few cucumbers\nand ask the merchant for the price. “Five dollars a\npound”. A bit expensive, you may think, but you pay. Before you\nleave the stand two other people approach the seller with the very\nsame question (“How much are the cucumbers?”). “A\ndollar a pound”, she says to the one; “Ten dollars a\npound”, she tells the other. At least two of you are likely to\nattack the merchant with a simple question: Why the price discrepancy?\nOf course, you may simply leave the place if you have a simple\nexplanation for the discrepancy (for example, that both you and the\nperson who was asked to pay ten dollars a pound belong to commonly\ndiscriminated minorities). You may also conclude that the seller is\njust out of her mind (or that she is just conducting a psychological\nexperiment). In all of these cases you will be entertaining an\nexplanation or reason for a fact that appears odd.\nBut what kinds of facts demand an explanation? Do all\nfacts—including the most ordinary ones—demand an\nexplanation? If you accept an unrestricted form of the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (= PSR), you will require an explanation for\nany fact, or in other words, you will reject the possibility\nof any brute, or unexplainable, facts. \nA simple formulation of the principle is as follows: \nThe term “fact” in the above formulation is not intended\nto express any commitment to an ontology of facts. Still, if one\nwishes to avoid such connotations, the principle can be formulated\nmore schematically: \nThe PSR is, in fact, a family of principles which are\ngenerated by various restrictions of (2), and by ascriptions of\ndifferent degrees of modal strength to (2). To begin with, variants of\nthe PSR may differ according to how they restrict the kinds of\nthings that require a reason (the explananda). Thus, one might\nrestrict the PSR to only actual entities, or include possibilia as\nwell. Alternatively, one might formulate the PSR as requiring a\nsufficient reason for every (true) proposition or as pertaining to\nentities and their properties. A variant of the PSR restricted to\nentities might require an explanation for the existence and\nnon-existence of entities, or it might be further restricted by\nrequiring a reason only for the existence (or only for the\nnon-existence) of entities. A version of the PSR that is restricted to\npropositions might range over both contingent and necessary\npropositions, or it might be further restricted to only one of these\nsub-domains. \nSimilarly, different versions of the PSR issue from various ways of\nrestricting the kinds of things that count as providing a\nreason (the explanantia). It is likely (though not necessary)\nthat one’s decision about the kinds of explananda that fall\nunder the range of the PSR will determine the kinds of things counted\nas explanantia. \nVariants of the PSR may be generated not only by placing restrictions\non the relata at stake (both the explananda and the explanantia), but\nalso on the notion of the relation at stake. Frequently, the relation\nof providing a reason is conceived as irreflexive, antisymmetric and\ntransitive, though each of these characteristics may be, and indeed\nhave been, challenged. The relation of providing a reason can be\nconceived as an ontological relation (as in contemporary discussions\nof ground), or as a purely epistemological relation. \nA modally strong version of the PSR will take the Principle as\nnecessary and obtaining in all possible worlds, while a weak modal\nversion will present the Principle as merely contingently true.\nAnother distinction can be drawn between a factive, as\nopposed to merely regulative, version of the Principle. A\nregulative version of the PSR would consider it as a condition for\nintelligibility (on a par with the Law of Non-Contradiction) and\nthus as guiding our studying of nature. The factive version simply\nstates that the Principle is true in actuality (or even in all\npossible worlds). The regulative and the factive versions differ in\nterms of allowing for the falsification of the principle. The factive\nversion could be easily refuted by a single counter-example. A\nproponent of the regulative variant of the PSR would argue that an\nempirical falsification of the PSR makes as little sense as an\nempirical falsification of the Law of Non-Contradiction.  Encountering\na fact which seems to have no explanation, the proponent of\nthe regulative variant would respond by insisting that we must keep\nsearching for an explanation. \nA proponent of the unrestricted version of the PSR could argue\nthat one’s choice of a specific variant of the PSR cannot be\narbitrary, on pain of inconsistency (i.e., one must provide a reason\nwhy to prefer one variant over others). Relying on this last point,\nshe may further contend that in the absence of compelling reasons to\nthe contrary, the unrestricted version of the Principle should be\nconsidered as default. \nOne of the most interesting questions regarding the PSR is why accept\nit at all. Insofar as the PSR stipulates that all things must be\nexplainable, it seems that the PSR itself demands an explanation.\nSeveral modern philosophers attempted to provide a proof for the PSR,\nthough so far these attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Another\nimportant question related to the PSR is the possibility of\nself-explanatory facts and self-caused entities; particularly, one\nmight wonder how these are distinguished from unexplainable, brute\nfacts and uncaused entities. One might also wonder whether the PSR\nallows for any primitive concepts that cannot be further\nexplained. \nA third crucial problem for proponents of the PSR is how to address\nthe Agrippan Trilemma between the apparently exhaustive three horns\nof: (i) acceptance of brute facts, (ii) acceptance of an infinite\nregress of explanation (or grounding), or (iii) acceptance of\nself-explanatory facts. Prima facie, each horn in the\ntrilemma undermines the position of the proponent of the PSR. \nFinally, the proponent of the PSR faces intriguing problems in\naddressing perfectly symmetrical states. We have seen that some\nvariants of the PSR require an explanation for the existence of\nthings (thus, assuming nonexistence as a “default”\nstate requiring no explanation), while other variants require an\nexplanation for both the existence and nonexistence of\nthings. Let us look quickly at the latter\n(“default”-free) variant. Specifically, we might wonder\nhow a proponent of the “default”-free variant of the PSR\nwould respond to a situation in which we have neither a reason for the\nexistence of x, nor have a reason for the non-existence of\nx? A proponent of the PSR might indeed respond by denying the\npossibility of such a scenario (given the PSR and bivalence). A similar dilemma might be\nraised with regard to issues of identity: given the absence of a\nreason for the identity of x and y, as well as for\ntheir non-identity, should we assume either identity or non-identity\nas a default\n position?[1] \nWith these general considerations in place, let us examine the\nhistorical role that the Principle has played. The term\n“Principle of Sufficient Reason [principe de raison\nsuffisante/principium reddendae rationis]” was coined by\nLeibniz, though Spinoza is thought by many scholars to have preceded\nLeibniz in appreciating the importance of the Principle and placing it\nat the center of his philosophical\n system.[2]\n The Principle seems at first sight to have a strong intuitive\nappeal—we always ask for explanations—yet it is taken by\nmany to be too bold and expensive due to the radical implications it\nseems to yield. Among the alleged consequences of the Principle are:\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles, necessitarianism, the relativity of\nspace and time, the existence of a self-necessitated Being (i.e.,\nGod), and the Principle of Plenitude. \nThough there are several important precursors who, as we will see,\nseem to advocate variants of the PSR before the modern period, we will\nbegin our discussion with the two main expositors of the Principle:\nSpinoza and Leibniz. \nSpinoza’s earliest statement of the PSR appears in his first\npublished work, the 1663 geometrical exposition of Descartes’\nPrinciples of Philosophy. The eleventh axiom of Part I of the\nbook states: \nNothing exists of which it cannot be asked, what is the cause (or\nreason) [causa (sive ratio)], why it exists. \nIn a brief explanatory note to this axiom, Spinoza adds: \nSince existing is something positive, we cannot say that it has\nnothing as its cause (by Axiom 7). Therefore, we must assign some\npositive cause, or reason, why [a thing] exists—either an\nexternal one, i.e., one outside the thing itself, or an internal one,\none comprehended in the nature and definition of the existing thing\nitself. (Geb.\n I/158/4–9)[3] \nAxiom 7, to which Spinoza appeals in the explanation, is a variant of\nthe “ex nihilo, nihil fit” (“from nothing,\nnothing comes”) principle, and stipulates that an existing thing\nand its perfections (or qualities) cannot have nothing or a\nnon-existing thing as their cause. Interestingly, however, in another\nwork from this early period of his philosophical writing, the\nTreatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, Spinoza allows\nfor one unique item to be without a cause. In §70 of this\ntreatise, Spinoza argues: \n[T]hat Thought is also called true which involves objectively the\nessence of some principle that does not have a cause, and is\nknown through itself and in itself. (II/26/33–4. Our\nemphasis) \nIt is not completely clear what “the principle\n[principium]” at stake is, but given its qualification\nas “known through itself and in itself”, it may refer to\nGod and indicate Spinoza’s understanding of Descartes’\nrather nuanced view—in his Second Set of Replies—according\nto which God does not need a cause in order to exist, but\nthere is a reason why God does not need a cause (AT VII:\n164–65; cf. Carraud 2002: Ch.\n 2).[4] \nSpinoza does not mention the PSR in his 1670 Theological Political\nTreatise (TTP), though the spirit of the Principle can be easily\ndiscerned throughout the book. For example, in the conclusion of the\nFifteenth Chapter of the TTP Spinoza makes the following extraordinary\nannouncement: \n[W]hat altar of refuge can a man find for himself when he commits\ntreason against the majesty of reason. (III/188) \nThere is much to be said about this image of reason, which ascribes to\nreason the same exhaustiveness, dominance, and omnipresence that\ntraditional theologies ascribe to God. This passage leaves no room for\nanything that is beyond, or against, reason. \nThe closest that Spinoza comes in the TTP to endorsing the PSR is in\nhis discussion of miracles. Let us have a close look at the following\npassage: \nBut since miracles have occurred according to the power of\nunderstanding of the common people, who were, in fact, completely\nignorant of the principles of natural things, it is certain that the\nancients took for a miracle what they could not explain in the way the\ncommon people are accustomed to explain natural things, viz. by\nfalling back on memory to recall some other similar thing they are\naccustomed to imagine without wonder. For the common people think\nthey understand a thing well enough when they do not wonder at\nit. (III/84/5–11. Our emphasis) \nWhat precisely went wrong in the vulgus’ attempt (and\nfailure) to explain miracles? Obviously they erred, according to\nSpinoza, because they were “completely ignorant of the\nprinciples of natural things”; but why did they stay ignorant in\nspite of their genuine attempt to trace the causes of miracles? Why\ndid they not look for the natural explanations of miracles? The\nvulgus were definitely not wrong in trying to find a causal\nexplanation for miracles; Spinoza openly argues that we ought to try\nto explain things through their proximate causes. What went wrong in\nthe method of the “common people” was that they did not go\nfar enough in their attempt to explain the nature of things.\nInstead of stubbornly seeking the complete causal chain for each fact,\nthey felt content once an extraordinary fact was shown to be the\nresult of a familiar phenomenon—that does not entice\nwonder—while paying no attention to the need to explain the\nfamiliar. In a way, they were rudimentary common-sense philosophers\nwho asked for an explanation for what appears to be against common\nsense, and were completely reassured once the unfamiliar turned out to\nbe a result of the common. For Spinoza, our familiarity with a\nphenomenon does not render it intelligible, and the familiar, just\nlike the extraordinary, demands a clear causal explanation. Indeed, it\nis precisely at this point that the thoroughness of one’s\ncommitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason is tested. Few people\nwould deny the need to explain unusual phenomena (e.g., flying\nhippos), but fewer would demand an explanation for what is common and\nordinary (e.g., time), and it is precisely here where the task of the\nphilosopher begins, first in making us de-familiarize ourselves with,\nand question the nature of, the ordinary, and then in attempting to\nexplain it. \nIn Spinoza’s major work, the Ethics, the PSR is stated\nimplicitly already by the second axiom of Part I: \nE1a2: What cannot be conceived [concipi] through another,\nmust be conceived through itself. \nThe immediate implication of E1a2 is that everything is\n conceived.[5]\n Since, for Spinoza, to conceive something is to explain it (see\nE1p10s, E1p14d and Della Rocca 2008: 5) it seems that E1a2 amounts to\nthe claim that everything is explainable. Some commentators have also\nseen the PSR encoded in E1a3: \nFrom a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and\nconversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an\neffect to follow. \nIf we interpret “effect” narrowly as something with a\ncause, then the second clause is trivial. If we interpret it more\nbroadly as anything that exists, obtains, happens (or whatever the\nrelata of causation are taken to be) has a cause, then the second\nclause contains a statement of a version of the PSR: everything has a\ncause (Lin forthcoming). \nIn E1p11d2, Spinoza states explicitly a variant of the PSR: “For\neach thing there must be assigned a cause, or reason, both\nfor its existence and for its nonexistence”. Similarly, in\nE1p8s2, Spinoza argues, “if a certain number of individuals\nexists, there must be a cause why those individuals, and why neither\nmore nor fewer, exist”. Spinoza’s insistence that even the\nnon-existence of things must be explainable is crucial. It\nallows him, for example, to argue that were God not to exist, his\nnon-existence must be explainable. Since God is a substance, Spinoza\nargues, his existence or non-existence cannot be caused or explained\nexternally (Spinoza takes substances to be causally independent of\neach other); hence, were God not to exist, he would have to be the\ncause of his non-existence, just as a square-circle is the cause of\nits non-existence. But since God is not a contradictory entity, He\ncannot internally rule out His own existence, and hence He must exist\n(E1p11d). \nSpinoza accepts a very strong version of the PSR. According to some\nreadings, he grants the PSR unlimited extension, and takes it to be\nnecessary. In fact, the PSR seems to be the primary motivation behind\nSpinoza’s strict necessitarianism. For Spinoza, if there are two\n(or more) possible worlds, it would seem that neither one would have a\nsufficient reason or cause (for if there were such a\nsufficient reason, this world would be necessitated, and all other\nworlds would be impossible). In other words, for Spinoza, the PSR\ndictates that there is only one possible world (see Della Rocca 2008:\n69–78, and Lin 2011: 23–25. Occasionally, however,\nSpinoza’s endorsement of the PSR is in tension with other\nprinciples of his metaphysics, such as the priority of the infinite\n(see Melamed 2012b and Melamed 2013a: xvii). \nSpinoza holds not only that the existence of things must be\nexplained, but also that the coherence, or incoherence, of their\nessences (what others would call their possibility) must be\nexplained (E1p33s1). Similarly, the essences of things must also have\na cause (E1p25). In general, many commentators have thought that\nSpinoza relies, either explicitly or implicitly on the PSR to motivate\nmany of his most important and innovative doctrines, such as the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles (E1p4. Although see Lin\nforthcoming for a dissenting view), substance monism (E1p11\nand E1p14), and the rejection of free will (E1p32 and\nE2pp48–49). In E1p21d Spinoza relies on the PSR to infer a bold\ncausal principle: a simple cause has one, and only one, simple effect.\nHad the cause more than one effect, the difference between the two\neffects would be unexplainable insofar as each effect is supposed to\nbe fully explained by the same cause. Thus, if we experience a cause\nbringing about more than one effect, we should conclude that that the\ncause was not simple, but comprised of parts (so that the different\nparts contributed to the causation of the different effects. See\nMelamed 2013a: 117–119, and Melamed 2013b: 212–213. \nRecently, Michael Della Rocca argued not only that the PSR\n“provide[s] the key to unlocking many of the mysteries of\nSpinoza’s philosophical system” (2008: 9), but that\nSpinoza requires the reduction of the most basic\nphilosophical concepts to reason or intelligibility. This alleged\n“double use of the PSR” stipulates (1) that everything\nmust be explainable, and (2) that it should be (ultimately) explained\nin terms of intelligibility. Hence, according to Della Rocca, Spinoza\nreduces his major philosophical concepts—existence, causation,\nrightness, and power—to intelligibility (2008: 8–9). While\nthis is a fascinating and bold reading of Spinoza’s metaphysics,\nit seems to contradict his crucial doctrine of the causal and\nconceptual barrier between the attributes (E1p10 and E2p6). The\nreduction of any non-Thought item to intelligibility (presumably, a\nfeature of the attribute of\n thought[6])\n undermines the barrier between the attributes, and with it the entire\nedifice of Spinoza’s ontology (see Della Rocca 2012:\n12–16; Melamed 2012a; and Melamed 2013a: xv and 196 n. 84). \nHow would Spinoza respond to the Agrippan Trilemma? Clearly Spinoza is\nunsympathetic to any acceptance of brute facts. Yet he allows for\nsome, restricted cases of self-explanation and infinite regress of\nexplanation. Let us take a brief look at these two issues. \nSpinoza begins the Ethics with the definitions of causa\nsui (E1d1), and of substance as that which “is conceived\nthrough itself” (E1d3). Positing these reflexive definitions at\nthe outset might have been a calculated methodological move whose aim\nwas to bypass the challenging task of proving the legitimacy of these\nnotions. But since Spinoza considers his definitions as not merely\nstipulative (see TIE §95 and Ep. 60), we may well ask for a\ndefense of the legitimacy of self-explanations. \nThe class of truths that Spinoza considers as self-explanatory are\ntruths that follow merely from the essence or—what is\nthe same—the nature of a thing. In E1p11d, Spinoza provides two\nexamples of self-explanation:  \n[T]he very nature of a square circle indicates the reason why it does\nnot exist, viz. because it involves a contradiction…, the\nreason why a substance exists also follows from its nature alone,\nbecause it involves existence.  \nIn contrast, claims Spinoza, the existence (as well as the\nnon-existence) of a triangle (or any other thing that is not a\nsubstance) do no follow merely from the essence of the\ntriangle:  \nThe reason why a circle or triangle exists, or why it does not exist,\ndoes not follow from the nature of these things, but from the order of\nthe whole of corporeal Nature. (E1p11d).  \nThus, consider the following three propositions: (i) The triangle has\nthree angles, (ii) The substance exists, and (iii) The triangle\nexists. Proposition (i) is clearly self-explanatory, since the essence\nof the triangle (which contains the nature of the number three and the\nnature of an angle) is the sufficient reason for its having three angles\n(adding any other information is of no explanatory value). Spinoza\nconsiders proposition (ii) as self-explanatory as well. Notice that\nSpinoza does not define substance (in E1d3) as existing by virtue of\nits essence, but rather derives this claim from the definition of\nsubstance (in E1p7). In contrast to (i) and (ii), the existence of a\ntriangle does not follow merely from its essence (since it is caused\nby entities external to the triangle, and therefore has to be\nexplained through these external causes). \nLet us turn now to the question of the legitimacy of infinite regress.\nIn E1p28, Spinoza openly states that within each attribute there is an\ninfinite causal chain of finite modes: \nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence;\nand again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to\nproduce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an\neffect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate\nexistence, and so on, to infinity. [Italics added] \nEach link in this causal chain is preceded by infinitely many causes\nand is followed by infinitely many effects. Each link also provides at\nleast part of the explanation for the existence of the\nfollowing link. Is the existence of such an infinite regress\nconsistent with the PSR? Spinoza has no qualms about answering this\nquestion in the positive. We may legitimately ask what is the cause of\neach link in the chain, and the answer would be: the preceding link.\nSpinoza also thinks that we may—indeed, should—ask what is\nthe cause, or reason, for the existence of the entire infinite\nchain? He simply thinks that he can provide a clear answer to the\nlatter question as well: God (or the being which is the ground of its\nown existence). Consider the following passage from Spinoza’s\ncelebrated “Letter on the Infinite” in which he criticizes\nproofs of the existence of God which rely on the impossibility of an\nactual infinity of causes and effects. \nIn passing I should like to note here that the more recent\nPeripatetics have, as I think, misunderstood the demonstration by\nwhich the Ancients tried to prove God’s existence. For as I find\nit in a certain Jew, called Rab Chasdai, it runs as follows: if\nthere is an infinite regress of causes, then all things that\nare will also have been caused; but it does not pertain to anything\nwhich has been caused, to exist necessarily by the force of its own\nnature; therefore, there is nothing in Nature to whose essence it\npertains to exist necessarily; but the latter is absurd; therefore,\nthe former is also. Hence the force of this argument does not lie\nin the impossibility of there being an actual infinite or an infinite\nregress of causes, but only in the supposition that things which do\nnot exist necessarily by their own nature are not determined to exist\nby a thing which does necessarily exist by its own nature. [Ep.\n12| IV/61/15–62/10; italics added] \nIn this passage, Spinoza follows the late medieval Jewish philosopher\nHasdai Crescas in rejecting the Aristotelian ban on actual infinity\n(see Melamed 2014). For Spinoza (and Crescas) the existence of an\ninfinite regress of causes is perfectly legitimate. Yet, if all the\nitems in this infinite chain are contingent beings (i.e.,\n“things which do not exist necessarily by their own\n nature”[7]),\n the chain itself remains a contingent being, and there must be a reason\nwhich explains its instantiation in reality. The ultimate reason for\nthe instantiation of such an infinite chain of contingent beings must,\nclaims Spinoza, be a being whose existence is not contingent (for\notherwise, the chain will remain merely contingent and its\ninstantiation in reality would not be sufficiently explained). Thus,\nSpinoza allows for an infinite regress of causes (or explanations) as\nlong as the entire infinite chain is grounded in a \nbeing which exists by virtue of its mere essence. \nNo philosopher is more closely associated with the PSR than Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). He was the first to call it by name\nand, arguably, the first to formulate it with full generality. His\ntreatment of the PSR is also noteworthy for its systematicity and the\ncentrality that he accords it. \nLeibniz often presents it, along with the Principle of Contradiction,\nas a principle of “reasoning”. For example, in the\nMonadology he writes: \n31. Our reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction, in virtue of which we judge that which involves a\ncontradiction to be false, and that which is opposed or contradictory\nto the false to be true. \n32. And that of sufficient reason, by virtue of which we consider that\nwe can find no true or existent fact, no true assertion, without there\nbeing a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise, although\nmost of the time these reasons cannot be known to us. (G VI, 612/L\n646) \nThese principles are characterized in what appears to be epistemic\nterms. They are principles of “our reasoning”. They\nconcern what we “judge” or “find”. And yet it\nis clear that Leibniz intends them to have metaphysical as well as\nepistemic import. In the case of the PSR, this will become more\nevident when we discuss how Leibniz understands the notion of a\nsufficient reason but it is already indicated in the passage quoted\nabove by the fact that Leibniz explicitly states that there are\nsufficient reasons for every truth or fact even if such reasons are\nunknowable by us. \nThe scope of the PSR, as stated above, includes facts and truths.\nLeibniz sometimes, however, characterizes the scope of the principle\nin different terms. For example, he writes: \n[T]he principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing\nhappens without a reason. (G VII 355; LC L2; AG 321, our\nemphasis) \nThe PSR is here said to apply to what “happens”. This\nsuggests a version of the PSR that applies not to truths or facts but\nrather events: Every event has a sufficient reason. \nThese vacillations in the formulation of the PSR are not typically\ntaken to register indecision on Leibniz’s part as to the scope\nof the PSR. Rather they are usually understood as indicating that\nLeibniz views the scope of the PSR to be very wide, perhaps even\nabsolutely general, but at least wide enough to encompass facts,\ntruths, and events (see Rodriguez-Pererya forthcoming). \nLeibniz associates the Principle of Contradiction and the PSR with a\nvariety of domains where each is especially important. For example,\nthere are domains where the truths of the domain depend on\none of the two principles. These domains are characterized modally:\nThe Principle of Contradiction rules over the domain of necessary\ntruths and the PSR rules over the domain of contingent truths (A 6 4\n1616/MP 75; G VII 355–56/LC 15–16). \nThere are also domains that are characterized in terms of subject\nmatter or areas of inquiry. The Principle of Contradiction allows us\nto study mathematics, whereas the PSR allows us to study metaphysics,\nnatural theology, and physics (G VII, 355–6; LC L2; AG 321). It\nis far from obvious that these two ways of assigning domains to the\nPrinciples are equivalent. For example, it would be natural to assume\nthat metaphysics and natural theology would include necessary\npropositions and thus the PSR would encroach upon the territory\nassigned to the Principle of Contradiction according to the modal\ncharacterization. \nWe must therefore distinguish distinct ways of associating the\nprinciples with various domains. The first way is to specify the\ndomain to which each principle applies. Leibniz appears to\nbelieve that, according to this approach, there is a single universal\ndomain and it is associated equally with each principle. There are no\ncontradictory contingent facts or truths and so the Principle of\nNoncontradiction applies to all contingent truths as well as\nall necessary truths. Likewise, it is usually assumed that, for\nLeibniz, every necessary truth has a sufficient reason (see Broad\n1975: 12 and 34 and Rodriguez-Pererya forthcoming). For\nexample, mathematical truths, might have sufficient reasons in the\nform of proofs that rest on statements of identity. Thus the PSR\napplies to all necessary truths as well as all contingent\ntruths. \nThe second way of associating the principles with specific domains is\nto specify the domain of truths that is grounded on or\ndepends on each principle. According to Leibniz, only\ncontingent truths depend on and are grounded by the PSR. Likewise,\nLeibniz believes that only necessary truths depend on and are grounded\nby the Principle of Contradiction. What does it mean for some truths\nto depend on a principle? Leibniz is not explicit on this\npoint but we will get a better idea in the next section when we\nconsider the question of what counts as a sufficient reason. \nThe third way is to specify a domain of truths that can be\ninvestigated on the basis of each principle. For Leibniz, we\ncan know mathematical truths only on the basis of the Principle of\nContradiction and only metaphysical, theological, and physical truths\nrequire the PSR in order to be known. We will see in more detail in\nwhat way the PSR allows us to investigate these domains the section on\napplications. \nWhen Leibniz insists that every truth or fact requires a sufficient\nreason, what does he mean by “sufficient reason?” In some\ntexts he suggests that sufficient reason is an “a\npriori proof”. This should not be understood in Kantian\nterms as a proof that doesn’t require any input from sense\nexperience. Rather, Leibniz uses the term “a\npriori” in its original pre-Kantian meaning, which means an\nargument from causes to effects. An a priori proof is a proof\nthat reflects the causal order. Thus a sufficient reason would be a\nproof that is both a demonstration and an explanation (see Adams 1994:\n109). \nIn order to fully understand Leibniz’s conception of a\nsufficient reason, we need to also understand his theory of truth and\nits relationship to his theory of modality. Let us begin with truth.\nTo keep things simple, we will focus only on categorical propositions\nof subject-predicate form. A proposition is true, according to\nLeibniz, just in case the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. Uncontroversially, the concept of the\npredicate is unmarried is contained in the concept\nbachelor and it is this conceptual containment which explains\nthe truth of the statement bachelors are unmarried. But\nLeibniz makes the further highly controversial claim that all\ntrue statements are true for this reason, even statements like\nCaesar crossed the Rubicon. That is, this statement is true\nbecause the concept crossed the Rubicon is contained in the\nconcept of Caesar. This theory of truth is sometimes called the\nconceptual containment theory of truth. It has as a\nconsequence that all truths are analytic. But wouldn’t such a\ntheory entail that all truths are necessary? After all, how could an\nanalytic truth be contingent? \nIn response to this worry, Leibniz develops an account of contingency\nin terms of infinite\n analysis.[8]\n Leibniz understands analysis as the process of replacing the terms of\na proposition with definitions or partial definitions. A demonstration\nresults when an identity is obtained through the process of analysis\nin a finite number of steps. Leibniz claims that all and only\nnecessary truths have a finite demonstration by analysis and all and\nonly contingent truths do not have a demonstration by analysis in a\nfinite number of steps. In this way, he preserves the distinction\nbetween necessary and contingent truths while also maintaining that\nall truths are analytic, that is, true in virtue of the meaning of the\nconcepts involved. \nThis has led some commenters to think that Leibniz gave up the account\nof sufficient reason as an a priori proof. If there were a\nproof or demonstration, it would reveal that the concept of the\npredicate was contained in the concept of the subject in a finite\nnumber of steps and hence every proposition would be necessary.\nLeibniz is not a necessitarian in his mature philosophy and thus he\ncould not have accepted this consequence. Instead, he must have\nshifted from the conception of a sufficient reason as an a\npriori proof to that of an a priori proof sequence,\nwhere the latter notion is understood as an analysis that converges on\nan identity without reaching it in a finite number of steps (see\nSleigh 1983: 200). What it means for an analysis to converge on an\nidentity is, unfortunately, obscure. Nevertheless, there is some clear\nsense in which every contingent truth has a sufficient reason on this\nunderstanding. The sufficient reason why it is true that Caesar\ncrossed the Rubicon, for example, is that the concept crossing the\nRubicon is contained in the concept Caesar. The truth of\nthe proposition obtains in virtue of the concepts of the subject and\nthe predicate. Of course, this reason is undiscoverable by any finite\nhuman mind because it is buried too deeply in the concept of Caesar.\nOnly God, in his omniscience sees the conceptual connection between\nthem. It is enough for there to be such a connection for there be a\nsufficient reason. \nSuch a conception of the nature of a sufficient reason have lead some\ncommentators to think that for Leibniz the PSR is a logical notion or\nthat it is a metaphysical notion that is ultimately reducible to logic\n(Couturat 1901: 123ff and Russell 1937: v). But the notion of a\nsufficient reason as a non-terminating proof sequence is not the only\nconception of a sufficient reason to be found in Leibniz. And other\nconceptions have a decidedly less logical and more metaphysical\nflavor. \nOne such characterization of a sufficient reason comes from\nLeibniz’s conviction that in order to preserve the notion of\ncausal activity, without which substances are not really\nsubstances—i.e., truly fundamental building blocks of\nreality—philosophy must revive something like the ancient\nAristotelian notion of a substantial form (see the discussion in the\nentry on\n Aristotle’s Metaphysics).\n Each genuine substance, for Leibniz, has what he calls a\n“primitive active force”. This force is the nature or\nessence of the substance. Now according to Leibniz, substances do not\ncausally interact with one another (see the entry\n Leibniz on causation).\n The changes that they undergo derive solely from their own natures or\nprimitive active force, which consequently determines the whole of its\nhistory. Many texts suggest that, for Leibniz, the sufficient reason\nfor any state of a substance is its primitive active force (NE\n65–6; T 400/G VI, 354; Mon. 18/G VI, 609–610; G IV, 507; G\nIII, 72). \nIn many ways primitive active force plays the role of the concept of\nthe subject in the logical version of the PSR. Just as on the logical\nversion the PSR that a is F is explained by the fact\nthat the concept of F-ness is in the concept of a,\nso too on the metaphysical version of the PSR fact that a is\nF is explained by the primitive active force of a\nthat determines it to be F. Whereas commentators such as\nCouturat and Russell emphasize the logical notion of a sufficient\nreason to the detriment of the metaphysical notion, other commentators\nsee the logical and the metaphysical as two equally fundamental\npresentations of the same datum (see Frankel 1994). \nAnother metaphysical characterization of a sufficient reason connects\nwith the Principle of the Best, which says that for any proposition\np, p is true just in case p holds in the\nbest possible world (G VI.448/DM 22; Mon. 46, 53, 54/G VI,\n614–616). Is the Principle of the Best a supplement to the PSR\nor a rival to the PSR? It is, in fact, a consequence of the PSR in\nconjunction with three additional assumptions: (1) the sufficient\nreason for every choice is that the chooser perceives it to the best;\n(2) God chooses the actual world; (3) God perceives something to be\nwhat is best just in case it is the best. \nIn some texts, Leibniz suggests that the sufficient reason for\ncontingent truths cannot be found in the concepts or natures of\nthings. We must instead look to the Principle of the Best (Mon.\n36–38/G VI, 613). In other words the sufficient reason for any\ncontingent proposition of the form “a is\nF” is that a is F is true in the best\npossible word. This appears to be an entirely different sort of reason\nthan the fact that “a is F” is analytic\nor that the nature of a determines that it is F.\nThose reasons are to be found internal to the concept of the subject\nor the nature of the substance. Reasons that advert to the Principle\nof the Best look outside the concept of the subject or the nature of\nthe substance and make comparisons between worlds in terms of their\nrelative perfections. It is possible that Leibniz thought that these\ndifferent conceptions of sufficient reasons were equivalent but that\nthey are so is far from obvious. \nLeibniz argues for the PSR in three distinct ways: (1) from the\nconcept of a sufficient reason and the concept of a\n“requisite”; (2) from his theory of truth; and (3)\ninductively. \nIn some texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR is a conceptual truth that\nis derivable from the concepts of a sufficient reason and the concept\nof a requisite (A VI, ii, 483; see also G VII 393, LC L5.18; A\nVI.iii.133). The concept of a requisite is that of a necessary\ncondition. In this context, Leibniz defines a sufficient reason as a\nsufficient condition. If something exists, then all of its requisites\nhave been posited. Leibniz then asserts that if all of a things\nrequisites have been posited, then it exists. Thus all of a\nthing’s requisites are a thing’s sufficient reason. The\nquestion-begging assumption is that all the necessary conditions for\nsomething to exist are jointly sufficient for it to exist. Anybody who\ndenies the PSR will not agree with this assumption and it is clearly\nnot encoded in the definitions of requisite and\nsufficient reason provided by Leibniz. \nIn other texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR follows from the\nconceptual containment theory of truth (A VI.iv.1645/L 268). Every\ntruth is such that the concept of the predicate is contained the\nconcept of the subject. This conceptual connection is the sufficient\nreason for the truth. Thus every truth has a sufficient reason. \nIt is worth noting that Leibniz believed the PSR before he developed\nhis conceptual containment Theory of Truth. In fact, the PSR is one of\nLeibniz’s earliest and most stable philosophical commitments\n(see, for example, Leibniz’s 1671 letter to Wedderkopf A\nII.ii.117f/L146). This observation has led some scholars to conclude\nthat rather than deriving the PSR from the conceptual containment\ntheory of truth, Leibniz was in fact led to the conceptual containment\ntheory from his antecedent commitment to the PSR. The conceptual\ncontainment theory explains how there could be a sufficient reason for\nevery truth by guaranteeing that there will be an explanation in terms\nof conceptual relations (see Adams 1994: 69). \nIn his Fifth paper to Clarke, Leibniz argues for the PSR inductively.\nHe says that there are many cases where a fact has a sufficient reason\nand no cases where fact is known not to have a sufficient reason. He\nthen says that it is reasonable to assume that the PSR holds in all\ncases where we do not know that sufficient reason. Leibniz describes\nthis as “the method of experimental philosophy, which proceeds\na posteriori” (G VII 420; LC, L5.129). \nLeibniz says that PSR is needed if we are to go beyond mathematics to\nmetaphysics and natural science. How does the PSR help in those\ndomains of inquiry? There is a general pattern of argument that\nLeibniz uses to establish conclusions using the PSR. First he assumes\nthe falsity of what he wants to prove. Call the proposition to be\nproved p. Then he tries to show that if p were\nfalse, there would be some fact or truth for which there was no\nsufficient reason. But by the PSR, there is no fact or truth.\nTherefore, p is true. Leibniz uses this template to argue for\na number of claims, including the identity of indiscernibles,\nrelationalism with respect to space and time, and the existence of\nGod. Let us briefly look at how Leibniz uses the PSR to argue for each\nof these theses. \nLeibniz presents arguments for the existence of God from the PSR in a\nnumber of different places (for example, The Ultimate Origination\nof Things, G VII 302–3; L 486–8. Monadology\n§37). Suppose that God does not exist. If God does not exist,\nthen the only things that exist are contingent beings. Would the\nentire series of contingent things have an explanation? The\nexplanation of the entire series cannot be a member of the series\nsince then it would explain itself and no contingent thing is\nself-explanatory. But the explanation cannot be outside of the series\nbecause we have assumed that there is no non-contingent being, i.e.,\nGod. Thus if God did not exist, there would be something unexplained:\nthe series of contingent beings. Everything has an explanation.\nTherefore God exists. \nLeibniz also thinks that the PSR rules out the possibility that there\ncould be two or more indistinguishable, that is, indiscernible, things\n(A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). If there were two such things, God would have\ntreated them differently insofar as he has related them differently to\nthe rest of the world. For example, if there were two blades of grass\nthat were indiscernible from each other, then one blade would stand in\nspatial and temporal relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world, whereas\nthe other blade would stand in some other spatial and temporal\nrelation \\(R'\\) to the rest of the world. Why did God choose to put\nthe first blade relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world instead of\n\\(R'\\)? Leibniz claims that since they are indiscernible from each\nother, there could be no reason for God to treat them\ndifferently. Thus if there were two indiscernible individuals, then\nGod would have acted for no reason. But there is a reason for\neverything. So, there are no indiscernible yet numerically distinct\nthings. \nFor similar reasons, Leibniz thinks that space and time cannot be\nsubstances or anything else absolute and must ultimately be a system\nof relations that obtain between bodies (e.g., LC, L, 3.5). This is\nbecause if space, for example, were absolute, then there would be\nspace points that were indiscernible from one another. God would treat\nthese space points differently from each other insofar as he orients\nhis creation in space one way rather than another. This would have to\nbe an arbitrary decision for the reasons outlined above. So, space and\ntime are not absolute (see Lin 2011). \nThe PSR is nearly as old as philosophy itself. Anaximander, one of the\nearliest of the pre-Socratics, is usually credited—on the basis\nof Aristotle’s de Caelo, (b12\n295b10–16)—with being the first to make use of it.\nAnaximander argues, we are told, that the Earth remains stationary in\nspace because it is indifferent between motions in any direction. This\nindifference means that there is no reason why it should move in one\ndirection rather than another. Since he concludes from this that it\ndoes not move, we can assume that Anaximander believes that motion in\nthe absence of a reason is impossible. \nParmenides, another pre-Socratic, implicitly appeals to the PSR when\nhe claims that the world cannot have come into existence because then\nit would have come from nothing (Fragment B8 9–10). Nothing\ncomes from nothing. If it did, Parmenides asks, why did it not come\ninto existence at an earlier or a later time? Parmenides appears to\nreason as follows. If the world came into existence, the actual moment\nthat it came into existence would be arbitrary. It would be a brute\nfact. There are no brute facts (the PSR). So, the world did not come\ninto existence. \nAnother ancient source for the PSR is Archimedes who writes:  \nEqual weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights\nat unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the\nweight which is at the greater distance (On the Equilibrium of Planes, 189).  \nThis is a special case of the PSR and is cited by Leibniz in his\ncorrespondence with Clarke as a precedent for the PSR. \nIn the medieval period, Peter Abelard argued that God must create the\nbest of all possible worlds. If he didn’t, Abelard argues, there\nwould have to be some reason for it. But what reason could that be\nexcept God’s injustice or jealousy? But God cannot be unjust or\njealous. So there is no possible reason for God making anything less\nthan the best. Everything has a reason. Thus God makes the best\npossible world (McCallum 1948, 93). Abelard’s opinion was rejected as heresy and\nmainstream opinion of philosophers during the Middle Ages appears to\nreject the PSR. God, on the mainstream medieval view, enjoys freedom\nof indifference with respect to his creation. Thus there is no\nsufficient reason for why God created what he did and the PSR slips\nfrom prominence until its early modern revival at the hands of Spinoza\nand Leibniz. \nSome great epistemological rationalists, such as Plato and Descartes,\nappear to endorse the PSR but in fact do not. For example, in the\nTimaeus Plato writes,  \n[E]verything that comes to be must of necessity come to be by the\nagency of some cause, for it is impossible for anything to come to be\nwithout a cause. (28a4–5)  \nThis passage appears to assert the PSR. But Plato believes that there\nare things that are not among the things that “come to\nbe”, and some of these things have no cause or reason. For\nexample, the Demiurge creates the world by imposing order on\ndisorderly motion. The disorderly motion preexists the work of the\nDemiurge. It is uncaused and there is no reason for it. \nAt times, Descartes appears to endorse the PSR. For example, he argues\nfor the existence of God in the third Mediation on the basis\nof the principle that there must be at least as much reality in the\ncause as in the effect. And he justifies this causal principle by\nclaiming that “Nothing comes from nothing”. This appears\nto make him as much an adherent of the PSR as Parmenides who, as we\nhave seen, argues for his conclusions on the same basis. But elsewhere\nDescartes claims that God creates the eternal truths, such as\nmathematical and metaphysical truths (Letters to Mersenne, April 15,\nMay 6, and 27, 1630; Fifth Replies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261).\nMoreover, he claims that God creates these truths by an act of will\nwhich is free and indifferent. Thus there can be no reason for\nGod’s will to create any of these truths. If the act of will by\nmeans of which God creates the mathematical and metaphysical truths is\ncontingent and yet has no sufficient reason according to Descartes,\nthen his philosophy is deeply antithetical to the PSR. Of course,\nDescartes, like many of the others we have discussed may have endorsed\na restricted version of the PSR. But the most natural and\nrationalistically acceptable restriction would be to contingent\ntruths. Descartes’ doctrine of the creation of the eternal\ntruths holds that there is at least one contingent truth (the act of\nwill by means of which God creates the eternal truths) which lacks a\nsufficient reason. \nHume’s critique of causation presents an important challenge to\nthe PSR. In his Treatise of Human Nature (I, 3, 3) Hume\nconsiders several arguments which attempt to prove the “general\nmaxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must have a\ncause” and finds all of them wanting. Hume argues that\nsince the ideas of cause and its effect are evidently distinct, we can\nclearly conceive or imagine an object without its cause. He takes the\nseparability of the two ideas to show that there is no necessary\nconceptual relation between the ideas of cause and effect insofar as\nconceiving the one without the other does not imply any contradiction\nor absurdity. \nChristian Wolff (1679–1754), the most influential German\nphilosopher of the first half of the eighteenth century, was a\nfollower of Leibniz and developed the latter’s system. Like\nLeibniz, Wolff assigned to the PSR a central role in his system while\nattempting to avoid necessitarianism (or “fatalism”). Like\nSpinoza and Leibniz, Wolff demanded a reason for both the possibility\nof things [ratio essendi] (i.e., coherence of essence) and\nfor the actualization, or coming to be, of essences [ratio\nfiendi]. Wolff mildly criticized Leibniz’s grounding of the\nPSR merely in experience and attempted to marshal several proofs for\nthe principle (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings, §§30–31,\n143; Ontologia, §§56–78). One of these proofs\nattempts to prove the PSR relying on the principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings §31), while the\nmost famous proof attempts to derive the PSR from the Law of\nNon-Contradiction. According to the latter, if a thing \\(A\\) is\nassumed to exist without reason, than “nothing is posited that\nexplains why \\(A\\) exists”. This, according to Wolff, would\nmean that \\(A\\) exists because of nothing (Ontologia,\n§70), which Wolff claims to be absurd. Kant criticized the proof\nclaiming that it is based on an equivocal use of the term\n“nothing” (AK 1:398). \nLeonhard Euler, the great Swiss mathematician and a contemporary of\nWolff, warned against the “wretched abuse” of the PSR by\nthose who  \nemploy it so dexterously that by means of it they are in a condition\nto demonstrate whatever suits their purpose, and to demolish whatever\nis raised against them. (Letters to German Princess, Letter\nXIII)  \nAccording to Euler, many of the proofs which rely on the PSR amount to\nnothing over and above a petitio principii, while others\nderive carelessly the impossibility of things from our ignorance of\nthe causes of these things. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), Kant claims to\nprovide a proof for the PSR by showing that  \n[T]he PSR is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective\ncognition of appearances with regards to their relation in the\nsuccessive series of time. (B/246/A201)  \nRelying on his transcendental method Kant argues in the “Second\nAnalogy of Experience” that a certain version of the PSR is a\ncondition for the possibility of experience, and as a result also a\ncondition for the possibility of objects of experience. Yet, this\nargument also restricts the validity of the PSR to human experience,\ni.e., to things which appear in space and time. Any use of the PSR\nthat transgresses the boundaries of human experience is bound to\ngenerate antinomies. \nKant’s view of space and time as exhibiting brute\ndifference (i.e., the non-identity of locations in space and time\ncannot be reduced to conceptual explanation) stands in sharp contrast\nto the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, and thereby also\nto the PSR. Salomon Maimon, Kant’s rationalist critic, attempted\nto enforce rationalist strictures on Kant’s philosophy by\narguing that Kant is unable to explain the necessary agreement of\nintuitions and concepts. According to Kant, intuitions and concepts\ncome from entirely different sources: sensibility and understanding.\nBut if this were the case, claims Maimon, we could not explain the\nconstant agreement between intuitions and concepts, which is necessary\nfor the possibility of experience. This agreement can be explained if\nwe reject the radical heterogeneity of intuitions and concepts, and\nview intuitions as disguised concepts. Thus, any difference exhibited\nin space and time must have its ground in the universal forms of our\nthought in general (Maimon, Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, Ch. 1, p. 13). Maimon also argued that we must seek\nan explanation for the fact that we have two forms of\nintuition rather than one, and suggested that it is only the interplay\nbetween the two forms of intuition which allows us to exhibit\ndifference, by using a unity in one form to exhibit difference in the\nother form, i.e., conceive different times by concentrating on the\nchange occurring at the same location in space, or conceive different\nlocations in space at the same point in time (Essay, Ch. 1,\npp. 13–14). \nGround [Grund] and the Principle of Sufficient Ground\n[der Satz vom zureichenden Grund] play a significant role in\nHegel’s Logic. For Hegel, the demand for ground provides a major\nsource of transition from one thing to another. It is, Hegel says,\n“the expulsion of itself from itself” (Encyclopedia\nLogic, §121A). Ground, for Hegel, is the unity of identity\nand difference: the ground of \\(x\\) has to explain all features of\n\\(x\\), and in sense duplicates it, yet it must also be different\nfrom \\(x\\) in order to have explanatory value and not be a mere\npetitio principii. \nThe PSR is the subject of Schopenahuer’s 1813 doctoral\ndissertation: The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. In this work, Schopenhauer provides a brief history of\nthe PSR, and then raises the questions of the justification for the\nPSR and the proper scope of the principle. Schopenhauer follows Wolff\nin distinguishing among four kinds of reasons, corresponding to four\nkinds of objects, and charges that much philosophical confusion arises\nfrom attempts to explain objects of one kind by reasoning that belongs\nto the other kind. These four kinds of explanation, or four variants\nof the PSR, share the very same ground. Along Kantian lines\nSchopenhauer suggests that it is the subject’s activity in\nregularly connecting representations that is the ground of the PSR\n(The Fourfold Root, §16). \nThe notion of grounding has been increasingly a topic of\ndiscussion in contemporary metaphysics. Grounding is said to be a kind\nof explanation distinct from causal explanation. It is a metaphysical or\nconstitutive explanation. It is generally taken to be asymmetric,\nirreflexive, and transitive. Alleged examples of grounding relations\nare: dispositions (e.g., fragility) are grounded in categorical\nfeatures (e.g., molecular structure); semantic facts (e.g., Jones\nmeans addition by “+”) are grounded by\nnon-semantic facts (e.g., Jones is disposed to draw certain\ninferences); mental properties (e.g., pain) are grounded by physical\nproperties (e.g., c-fibers firing; see Rosen 2010 and Fine 2012). It has recently been\nproposed by Dasgupta that a version of the PSR could be formulated in\nterms of grounds. The proposal is formulated as follows: \nPSR: For every substantive fact \\(Y\\) there are some facts, the\n\\(X\\)s, such that (i) the \\(X\\)s ground \\(Y\\) and (ii) each\none of the \\(X\\)s is autonomous. (Dasgupta 2016: 12) \nHere substantive means apt for grounding and\nautonomous means not apt for grounding. For example, perhaps\nessentialist facts are autonomous where essentialist facts are facts\nof the form: it is essential to \\(x\\) that \\(\\phi\\). The idea is that\njust as definitions are not apt for proof, essentialist facts are not\napt for grounding explanations, that is, they are autonomous (Dasgupta\n2016: 6–9). The notion of an autonomous fact allows the adherent\nof this version of the PSR to avoid the Agrippan Trilemma without\nallowing for self-explanatory facts or infinite regresses. Chains of\nexplanation terminate with autonomous facts, which are not brute\nbecause they are not apt for explanation.  \nFollowing Bolzano (Theory of Science:\nvol. II, 259–264), most contemporary theories of grounding\naffirm the irreflexivity of this relation (see Fine 2001: 15; Schaffer\n2009: 364; and Rosen 2010: 115). More recently, Fine showed that given\ncertain plausible premises, one may point out counterexamples to\nirreflexivity (Fine 2010; cf. Krämer 2013), and the issue has\nbeen further challenged by Jenkins (2011). \nJonathan Schaffer has relied on the notion of ground to revive an\nAristotelian, structured metaphysics, i.e., a metaphysics which is\nordered by priority relations (Schaffer 2009), and to defend Priority\nMonism (see the entry on\n monism).\n In response, Michael Della Rocca (2014) has argued that strict\nadherence to the PSR—and to Ockham’s Razor (see the entry\non\n simplicity)—undermines\n Schaffer’s structured metaphysics (and Priority Monism), since\ninsofar as all the features of the grounded are already present in the\nground, the existence of the grounded is just redundant. (See also\nthe entry on\n metaphysical grounding). \nThe role of the PSR in ethics and political theory has not been\nseriously studied so far. Clearly, the PSR may be marshaled in order\nto question our reliance on mere intuitions. The repugnance of a\ncertain view cannot be taken at face value, but rather requires a\njustification. In the past, various racist and conservative views\nrelied merely on the alleged repugnance of certain sexual acts (e.g.,\nhomosexuality, interracial relations). The requirement to dig deeper\nand ask a person to justify her intuitions may help the person\nunderstand the maxims guiding her specific moral beliefs. Adherence to\nthe PSR may also shift the onus of proof in the debate between those\nwho consider our preferential evaluation of human beings over other\nthings in nature as simply brute (Williams 2006: 195) and those who\ninsist that if human beings have a special value, there must be a\nreason for the ascription of such value (Buss 2012: 343).","contact.mail":"ymelame1@jhu.edu","contact.domain":"jhu.edu"},{"date.published":"2010-09-14","date.changed":"2016-09-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/","author1":"Yitzhak Y.

This simple demand for thoroughgoing\nintelligibility yields some of the boldest and most challenging theses\nin the history of philosophy. In this entry we begin by explaining\nthe Principle and then turn to the history of the debates around it.\nWe conclude with an examination of the emerging contemporary\ndiscussion of the Principle.\n\nSuppose you enter a farmers’ market, pick out a few cucumbers\nand ask the merchant for the price. “Five dollars a\npound”. A bit expensive, you may think, but you pay. Before you\nleave the stand two other people approach the seller with the very\nsame question (“How much are the cucumbers?”). “A\ndollar a pound”, she says to the one; “Ten dollars a\npound”, she tells the other. At least two of you are likely to\nattack the merchant with a simple question: Why the price discrepancy?\nOf course, you may simply leave the place if you have a simple\nexplanation for the discrepancy (for example, that both you and the\nperson who was asked to pay ten dollars a pound belong to commonly\ndiscriminated minorities). You may also conclude that the seller is\njust out of her mind (or that she is just conducting a psychological\nexperiment). In all of these cases you will be entertaining an\nexplanation or reason for a fact that appears odd.\nBut what kinds of facts demand an explanation? Do all\nfacts—including the most ordinary ones—demand an\nexplanation? If you accept an unrestricted form of the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (= PSR), you will require an explanation for\nany fact, or in other words, you will reject the possibility\nof any brute, or unexplainable, facts. \nA simple formulation of the principle is as follows: \nThe term “fact” in the above formulation is not intended\nto express any commitment to an ontology of facts. Still, if one\nwishes to avoid such connotations, the principle can be formulated\nmore schematically: \nThe PSR is, in fact, a family of principles which are\ngenerated by various restrictions of (2), and by ascriptions of\ndifferent degrees of modal strength to (2). To begin with, variants of\nthe PSR may differ according to how they restrict the kinds of\nthings that require a reason (the explananda). Thus, one might\nrestrict the PSR to only actual entities, or include possibilia as\nwell. Alternatively, one might formulate the PSR as requiring a\nsufficient reason for every (true) proposition or as pertaining to\nentities and their properties. A variant of the PSR restricted to\nentities might require an explanation for the existence and\nnon-existence of entities, or it might be further restricted by\nrequiring a reason only for the existence (or only for the\nnon-existence) of entities. A version of the PSR that is restricted to\npropositions might range over both contingent and necessary\npropositions, or it might be further restricted to only one of these\nsub-domains. \nSimilarly, different versions of the PSR issue from various ways of\nrestricting the kinds of things that count as providing a\nreason (the explanantia). It is likely (though not necessary)\nthat one’s decision about the kinds of explananda that fall\nunder the range of the PSR will determine the kinds of things counted\nas explanantia. \nVariants of the PSR may be generated not only by placing restrictions\non the relata at stake (both the explananda and the explanantia), but\nalso on the notion of the relation at stake. Frequently, the relation\nof providing a reason is conceived as irreflexive, antisymmetric and\ntransitive, though each of these characteristics may be, and indeed\nhave been, challenged. The relation of providing a reason can be\nconceived as an ontological relation (as in contemporary discussions\nof ground), or as a purely epistemological relation. \nA modally strong version of the PSR will take the Principle as\nnecessary and obtaining in all possible worlds, while a weak modal\nversion will present the Principle as merely contingently true.\nAnother distinction can be drawn between a factive, as\nopposed to merely regulative, version of the Principle. A\nregulative version of the PSR would consider it as a condition for\nintelligibility (on a par with the Law of Non-Contradiction) and\nthus as guiding our studying of nature. The factive version simply\nstates that the Principle is true in actuality (or even in all\npossible worlds). The regulative and the factive versions differ in\nterms of allowing for the falsification of the principle. The factive\nversion could be easily refuted by a single counter-example. A\nproponent of the regulative variant of the PSR would argue that an\nempirical falsification of the PSR makes as little sense as an\nempirical falsification of the Law of Non-Contradiction.  Encountering\na fact which seems to have no explanation, the proponent of\nthe regulative variant would respond by insisting that we must keep\nsearching for an explanation. \nA proponent of the unrestricted version of the PSR could argue\nthat one’s choice of a specific variant of the PSR cannot be\narbitrary, on pain of inconsistency (i.e., one must provide a reason\nwhy to prefer one variant over others). Relying on this last point,\nshe may further contend that in the absence of compelling reasons to\nthe contrary, the unrestricted version of the Principle should be\nconsidered as default. \nOne of the most interesting questions regarding the PSR is why accept\nit at all. Insofar as the PSR stipulates that all things must be\nexplainable, it seems that the PSR itself demands an explanation.\nSeveral modern philosophers attempted to provide a proof for the PSR,\nthough so far these attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Another\nimportant question related to the PSR is the possibility of\nself-explanatory facts and self-caused entities; particularly, one\nmight wonder how these are distinguished from unexplainable, brute\nfacts and uncaused entities. One might also wonder whether the PSR\nallows for any primitive concepts that cannot be further\nexplained. \nA third crucial problem for proponents of the PSR is how to address\nthe Agrippan Trilemma between the apparently exhaustive three horns\nof: (i) acceptance of brute facts, (ii) acceptance of an infinite\nregress of explanation (or grounding), or (iii) acceptance of\nself-explanatory facts. Prima facie, each horn in the\ntrilemma undermines the position of the proponent of the PSR. \nFinally, the proponent of the PSR faces intriguing problems in\naddressing perfectly symmetrical states. We have seen that some\nvariants of the PSR require an explanation for the existence of\nthings (thus, assuming nonexistence as a “default”\nstate requiring no explanation), while other variants require an\nexplanation for both the existence and nonexistence of\nthings. Let us look quickly at the latter\n(“default”-free) variant. Specifically, we might wonder\nhow a proponent of the “default”-free variant of the PSR\nwould respond to a situation in which we have neither a reason for the\nexistence of x, nor have a reason for the non-existence of\nx? A proponent of the PSR might indeed respond by denying the\npossibility of such a scenario (given the PSR and bivalence). A similar dilemma might be\nraised with regard to issues of identity: given the absence of a\nreason for the identity of x and y, as well as for\ntheir non-identity, should we assume either identity or non-identity\nas a default\n position?[1] \nWith these general considerations in place, let us examine the\nhistorical role that the Principle has played. The term\n“Principle of Sufficient Reason [principe de raison\nsuffisante/principium reddendae rationis]” was coined by\nLeibniz, though Spinoza is thought by many scholars to have preceded\nLeibniz in appreciating the importance of the Principle and placing it\nat the center of his philosophical\n system.[2]\n The Principle seems at first sight to have a strong intuitive\nappeal—we always ask for explanations—yet it is taken by\nmany to be too bold and expensive due to the radical implications it\nseems to yield. Among the alleged consequences of the Principle are:\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles, necessitarianism, the relativity of\nspace and time, the existence of a self-necessitated Being (i.e.,\nGod), and the Principle of Plenitude. \nThough there are several important precursors who, as we will see,\nseem to advocate variants of the PSR before the modern period, we will\nbegin our discussion with the two main expositors of the Principle:\nSpinoza and Leibniz. \nSpinoza’s earliest statement of the PSR appears in his first\npublished work, the 1663 geometrical exposition of Descartes’\nPrinciples of Philosophy. The eleventh axiom of Part I of the\nbook states: \nNothing exists of which it cannot be asked, what is the cause (or\nreason) [causa (sive ratio)], why it exists. \nIn a brief explanatory note to this axiom, Spinoza adds: \nSince existing is something positive, we cannot say that it has\nnothing as its cause (by Axiom 7). Therefore, we must assign some\npositive cause, or reason, why [a thing] exists—either an\nexternal one, i.e., one outside the thing itself, or an internal one,\none comprehended in the nature and definition of the existing thing\nitself. (Geb.\n I/158/4–9)[3] \nAxiom 7, to which Spinoza appeals in the explanation, is a variant of\nthe “ex nihilo, nihil fit” (“from nothing,\nnothing comes”) principle, and stipulates that an existing thing\nand its perfections (or qualities) cannot have nothing or a\nnon-existing thing as their cause. Interestingly, however, in another\nwork from this early period of his philosophical writing, the\nTreatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, Spinoza allows\nfor one unique item to be without a cause. In §70 of this\ntreatise, Spinoza argues: \n[T]hat Thought is also called true which involves objectively the\nessence of some principle that does not have a cause, and is\nknown through itself and in itself. (II/26/33–4. Our\nemphasis) \nIt is not completely clear what “the principle\n[principium]” at stake is, but given its qualification\nas “known through itself and in itself”, it may refer to\nGod and indicate Spinoza’s understanding of Descartes’\nrather nuanced view—in his Second Set of Replies—according\nto which God does not need a cause in order to exist, but\nthere is a reason why God does not need a cause (AT VII:\n164–65; cf. Carraud 2002: Ch.\n 2).[4] \nSpinoza does not mention the PSR in his 1670 Theological Political\nTreatise (TTP), though the spirit of the Principle can be easily\ndiscerned throughout the book. For example, in the conclusion of the\nFifteenth Chapter of the TTP Spinoza makes the following extraordinary\nannouncement: \n[W]hat altar of refuge can a man find for himself when he commits\ntreason against the majesty of reason. (III/188) \nThere is much to be said about this image of reason, which ascribes to\nreason the same exhaustiveness, dominance, and omnipresence that\ntraditional theologies ascribe to God. This passage leaves no room for\nanything that is beyond, or against, reason. \nThe closest that Spinoza comes in the TTP to endorsing the PSR is in\nhis discussion of miracles. Let us have a close look at the following\npassage: \nBut since miracles have occurred according to the power of\nunderstanding of the common people, who were, in fact, completely\nignorant of the principles of natural things, it is certain that the\nancients took for a miracle what they could not explain in the way the\ncommon people are accustomed to explain natural things, viz. by\nfalling back on memory to recall some other similar thing they are\naccustomed to imagine without wonder. For the common people think\nthey understand a thing well enough when they do not wonder at\nit. (III/84/5–11. Our emphasis) \nWhat precisely went wrong in the vulgus’ attempt (and\nfailure) to explain miracles? Obviously they erred, according to\nSpinoza, because they were “completely ignorant of the\nprinciples of natural things”; but why did they stay ignorant in\nspite of their genuine attempt to trace the causes of miracles? Why\ndid they not look for the natural explanations of miracles? The\nvulgus were definitely not wrong in trying to find a causal\nexplanation for miracles; Spinoza openly argues that we ought to try\nto explain things through their proximate causes. What went wrong in\nthe method of the “common people” was that they did not go\nfar enough in their attempt to explain the nature of things.\nInstead of stubbornly seeking the complete causal chain for each fact,\nthey felt content once an extraordinary fact was shown to be the\nresult of a familiar phenomenon—that does not entice\nwonder—while paying no attention to the need to explain the\nfamiliar. In a way, they were rudimentary common-sense philosophers\nwho asked for an explanation for what appears to be against common\nsense, and were completely reassured once the unfamiliar turned out to\nbe a result of the common. For Spinoza, our familiarity with a\nphenomenon does not render it intelligible, and the familiar, just\nlike the extraordinary, demands a clear causal explanation. Indeed, it\nis precisely at this point that the thoroughness of one’s\ncommitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason is tested. Few people\nwould deny the need to explain unusual phenomena (e.g., flying\nhippos), but fewer would demand an explanation for what is common and\nordinary (e.g., time), and it is precisely here where the task of the\nphilosopher begins, first in making us de-familiarize ourselves with,\nand question the nature of, the ordinary, and then in attempting to\nexplain it. \nIn Spinoza’s major work, the Ethics, the PSR is stated\nimplicitly already by the second axiom of Part I: \nE1a2: What cannot be conceived [concipi] through another,\nmust be conceived through itself. \nThe immediate implication of E1a2 is that everything is\n conceived.[5]\n Since, for Spinoza, to conceive something is to explain it (see\nE1p10s, E1p14d and Della Rocca 2008: 5) it seems that E1a2 amounts to\nthe claim that everything is explainable. Some commentators have also\nseen the PSR encoded in E1a3: \nFrom a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and\nconversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an\neffect to follow. \nIf we interpret “effect” narrowly as something with a\ncause, then the second clause is trivial. If we interpret it more\nbroadly as anything that exists, obtains, happens (or whatever the\nrelata of causation are taken to be) has a cause, then the second\nclause contains a statement of a version of the PSR: everything has a\ncause (Lin forthcoming). \nIn E1p11d2, Spinoza states explicitly a variant of the PSR: “For\neach thing there must be assigned a cause, or reason, both\nfor its existence and for its nonexistence”. Similarly, in\nE1p8s2, Spinoza argues, “if a certain number of individuals\nexists, there must be a cause why those individuals, and why neither\nmore nor fewer, exist”. Spinoza’s insistence that even the\nnon-existence of things must be explainable is crucial. It\nallows him, for example, to argue that were God not to exist, his\nnon-existence must be explainable. Since God is a substance, Spinoza\nargues, his existence or non-existence cannot be caused or explained\nexternally (Spinoza takes substances to be causally independent of\neach other); hence, were God not to exist, he would have to be the\ncause of his non-existence, just as a square-circle is the cause of\nits non-existence. But since God is not a contradictory entity, He\ncannot internally rule out His own existence, and hence He must exist\n(E1p11d). \nSpinoza accepts a very strong version of the PSR. According to some\nreadings, he grants the PSR unlimited extension, and takes it to be\nnecessary. In fact, the PSR seems to be the primary motivation behind\nSpinoza’s strict necessitarianism. For Spinoza, if there are two\n(or more) possible worlds, it would seem that neither one would have a\nsufficient reason or cause (for if there were such a\nsufficient reason, this world would be necessitated, and all other\nworlds would be impossible). In other words, for Spinoza, the PSR\ndictates that there is only one possible world (see Della Rocca 2008:\n69–78, and Lin 2011: 23–25. Occasionally, however,\nSpinoza’s endorsement of the PSR is in tension with other\nprinciples of his metaphysics, such as the priority of the infinite\n(see Melamed 2012b and Melamed 2013a: xvii). \nSpinoza holds not only that the existence of things must be\nexplained, but also that the coherence, or incoherence, of their\nessences (what others would call their possibility) must be\nexplained (E1p33s1). Similarly, the essences of things must also have\na cause (E1p25). In general, many commentators have thought that\nSpinoza relies, either explicitly or implicitly on the PSR to motivate\nmany of his most important and innovative doctrines, such as the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles (E1p4. Although see Lin\nforthcoming for a dissenting view), substance monism (E1p11\nand E1p14), and the rejection of free will (E1p32 and\nE2pp48–49). In E1p21d Spinoza relies on the PSR to infer a bold\ncausal principle: a simple cause has one, and only one, simple effect.\nHad the cause more than one effect, the difference between the two\neffects would be unexplainable insofar as each effect is supposed to\nbe fully explained by the same cause. Thus, if we experience a cause\nbringing about more than one effect, we should conclude that that the\ncause was not simple, but comprised of parts (so that the different\nparts contributed to the causation of the different effects. See\nMelamed 2013a: 117–119, and Melamed 2013b: 212–213. \nRecently, Michael Della Rocca argued not only that the PSR\n“provide[s] the key to unlocking many of the mysteries of\nSpinoza’s philosophical system” (2008: 9), but that\nSpinoza requires the reduction of the most basic\nphilosophical concepts to reason or intelligibility. This alleged\n“double use of the PSR” stipulates (1) that everything\nmust be explainable, and (2) that it should be (ultimately) explained\nin terms of intelligibility. Hence, according to Della Rocca, Spinoza\nreduces his major philosophical concepts—existence, causation,\nrightness, and power—to intelligibility (2008: 8–9). While\nthis is a fascinating and bold reading of Spinoza’s metaphysics,\nit seems to contradict his crucial doctrine of the causal and\nconceptual barrier between the attributes (E1p10 and E2p6). The\nreduction of any non-Thought item to intelligibility (presumably, a\nfeature of the attribute of\n thought[6])\n undermines the barrier between the attributes, and with it the entire\nedifice of Spinoza’s ontology (see Della Rocca 2012:\n12–16; Melamed 2012a; and Melamed 2013a: xv and 196 n. 84). \nHow would Spinoza respond to the Agrippan Trilemma? Clearly Spinoza is\nunsympathetic to any acceptance of brute facts. Yet he allows for\nsome, restricted cases of self-explanation and infinite regress of\nexplanation. Let us take a brief look at these two issues. \nSpinoza begins the Ethics with the definitions of causa\nsui (E1d1), and of substance as that which “is conceived\nthrough itself” (E1d3). Positing these reflexive definitions at\nthe outset might have been a calculated methodological move whose aim\nwas to bypass the challenging task of proving the legitimacy of these\nnotions. But since Spinoza considers his definitions as not merely\nstipulative (see TIE §95 and Ep. 60), we may well ask for a\ndefense of the legitimacy of self-explanations. \nThe class of truths that Spinoza considers as self-explanatory are\ntruths that follow merely from the essence or—what is\nthe same—the nature of a thing. In E1p11d, Spinoza provides two\nexamples of self-explanation:  \n[T]he very nature of a square circle indicates the reason why it does\nnot exist, viz. because it involves a contradiction…, the\nreason why a substance exists also follows from its nature alone,\nbecause it involves existence.  \nIn contrast, claims Spinoza, the existence (as well as the\nnon-existence) of a triangle (or any other thing that is not a\nsubstance) do no follow merely from the essence of the\ntriangle:  \nThe reason why a circle or triangle exists, or why it does not exist,\ndoes not follow from the nature of these things, but from the order of\nthe whole of corporeal Nature. (E1p11d).  \nThus, consider the following three propositions: (i) The triangle has\nthree angles, (ii) The substance exists, and (iii) The triangle\nexists. Proposition (i) is clearly self-explanatory, since the essence\nof the triangle (which contains the nature of the number three and the\nnature of an angle) is the sufficient reason for its having three angles\n(adding any other information is of no explanatory value). Spinoza\nconsiders proposition (ii) as self-explanatory as well. Notice that\nSpinoza does not define substance (in E1d3) as existing by virtue of\nits essence, but rather derives this claim from the definition of\nsubstance (in E1p7). In contrast to (i) and (ii), the existence of a\ntriangle does not follow merely from its essence (since it is caused\nby entities external to the triangle, and therefore has to be\nexplained through these external causes). \nLet us turn now to the question of the legitimacy of infinite regress.\nIn E1p28, Spinoza openly states that within each attribute there is an\ninfinite causal chain of finite modes: \nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence;\nand again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to\nproduce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an\neffect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate\nexistence, and so on, to infinity. [Italics added] \nEach link in this causal chain is preceded by infinitely many causes\nand is followed by infinitely many effects. Each link also provides at\nleast part of the explanation for the existence of the\nfollowing link. Is the existence of such an infinite regress\nconsistent with the PSR? Spinoza has no qualms about answering this\nquestion in the positive. We may legitimately ask what is the cause of\neach link in the chain, and the answer would be: the preceding link.\nSpinoza also thinks that we may—indeed, should—ask what is\nthe cause, or reason, for the existence of the entire infinite\nchain? He simply thinks that he can provide a clear answer to the\nlatter question as well: God (or the being which is the ground of its\nown existence). Consider the following passage from Spinoza’s\ncelebrated “Letter on the Infinite” in which he criticizes\nproofs of the existence of God which rely on the impossibility of an\nactual infinity of causes and effects. \nIn passing I should like to note here that the more recent\nPeripatetics have, as I think, misunderstood the demonstration by\nwhich the Ancients tried to prove God’s existence. For as I find\nit in a certain Jew, called Rab Chasdai, it runs as follows: if\nthere is an infinite regress of causes, then all things that\nare will also have been caused; but it does not pertain to anything\nwhich has been caused, to exist necessarily by the force of its own\nnature; therefore, there is nothing in Nature to whose essence it\npertains to exist necessarily; but the latter is absurd; therefore,\nthe former is also. Hence the force of this argument does not lie\nin the impossibility of there being an actual infinite or an infinite\nregress of causes, but only in the supposition that things which do\nnot exist necessarily by their own nature are not determined to exist\nby a thing which does necessarily exist by its own nature. [Ep.\n12| IV/61/15–62/10; italics added] \nIn this passage, Spinoza follows the late medieval Jewish philosopher\nHasdai Crescas in rejecting the Aristotelian ban on actual infinity\n(see Melamed 2014). For Spinoza (and Crescas) the existence of an\ninfinite regress of causes is perfectly legitimate. Yet, if all the\nitems in this infinite chain are contingent beings (i.e.,\n“things which do not exist necessarily by their own\n nature”[7]),\n the chain itself remains a contingent being, and there must be a reason\nwhich explains its instantiation in reality. The ultimate reason for\nthe instantiation of such an infinite chain of contingent beings must,\nclaims Spinoza, be a being whose existence is not contingent (for\notherwise, the chain will remain merely contingent and its\ninstantiation in reality would not be sufficiently explained). Thus,\nSpinoza allows for an infinite regress of causes (or explanations) as\nlong as the entire infinite chain is grounded in a \nbeing which exists by virtue of its mere essence. \nNo philosopher is more closely associated with the PSR than Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). He was the first to call it by name\nand, arguably, the first to formulate it with full generality. His\ntreatment of the PSR is also noteworthy for its systematicity and the\ncentrality that he accords it. \nLeibniz often presents it, along with the Principle of Contradiction,\nas a principle of “reasoning”. For example, in the\nMonadology he writes: \n31. Our reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction, in virtue of which we judge that which involves a\ncontradiction to be false, and that which is opposed or contradictory\nto the false to be true. \n32. And that of sufficient reason, by virtue of which we consider that\nwe can find no true or existent fact, no true assertion, without there\nbeing a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise, although\nmost of the time these reasons cannot be known to us. (G VI, 612/L\n646) \nThese principles are characterized in what appears to be epistemic\nterms. They are principles of “our reasoning”. They\nconcern what we “judge” or “find”. And yet it\nis clear that Leibniz intends them to have metaphysical as well as\nepistemic import. In the case of the PSR, this will become more\nevident when we discuss how Leibniz understands the notion of a\nsufficient reason but it is already indicated in the passage quoted\nabove by the fact that Leibniz explicitly states that there are\nsufficient reasons for every truth or fact even if such reasons are\nunknowable by us. \nThe scope of the PSR, as stated above, includes facts and truths.\nLeibniz sometimes, however, characterizes the scope of the principle\nin different terms. For example, he writes: \n[T]he principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing\nhappens without a reason. (G VII 355; LC L2; AG 321, our\nemphasis) \nThe PSR is here said to apply to what “happens”. This\nsuggests a version of the PSR that applies not to truths or facts but\nrather events: Every event has a sufficient reason. \nThese vacillations in the formulation of the PSR are not typically\ntaken to register indecision on Leibniz’s part as to the scope\nof the PSR. Rather they are usually understood as indicating that\nLeibniz views the scope of the PSR to be very wide, perhaps even\nabsolutely general, but at least wide enough to encompass facts,\ntruths, and events (see Rodriguez-Pererya forthcoming). \nLeibniz associates the Principle of Contradiction and the PSR with a\nvariety of domains where each is especially important. For example,\nthere are domains where the truths of the domain depend on\none of the two principles. These domains are characterized modally:\nThe Principle of Contradiction rules over the domain of necessary\ntruths and the PSR rules over the domain of contingent truths (A 6 4\n1616/MP 75; G VII 355–56/LC 15–16). \nThere are also domains that are characterized in terms of subject\nmatter or areas of inquiry. The Principle of Contradiction allows us\nto study mathematics, whereas the PSR allows us to study metaphysics,\nnatural theology, and physics (G VII, 355–6; LC L2; AG 321). It\nis far from obvious that these two ways of assigning domains to the\nPrinciples are equivalent. For example, it would be natural to assume\nthat metaphysics and natural theology would include necessary\npropositions and thus the PSR would encroach upon the territory\nassigned to the Principle of Contradiction according to the modal\ncharacterization. \nWe must therefore distinguish distinct ways of associating the\nprinciples with various domains. The first way is to specify the\ndomain to which each principle applies. Leibniz appears to\nbelieve that, according to this approach, there is a single universal\ndomain and it is associated equally with each principle. There are no\ncontradictory contingent facts or truths and so the Principle of\nNoncontradiction applies to all contingent truths as well as\nall necessary truths. Likewise, it is usually assumed that, for\nLeibniz, every necessary truth has a sufficient reason (see Broad\n1975: 12 and 34 and Rodriguez-Pererya forthcoming). For\nexample, mathematical truths, might have sufficient reasons in the\nform of proofs that rest on statements of identity. Thus the PSR\napplies to all necessary truths as well as all contingent\ntruths. \nThe second way of associating the principles with specific domains is\nto specify the domain of truths that is grounded on or\ndepends on each principle. According to Leibniz, only\ncontingent truths depend on and are grounded by the PSR. Likewise,\nLeibniz believes that only necessary truths depend on and are grounded\nby the Principle of Contradiction. What does it mean for some truths\nto depend on a principle? Leibniz is not explicit on this\npoint but we will get a better idea in the next section when we\nconsider the question of what counts as a sufficient reason. \nThe third way is to specify a domain of truths that can be\ninvestigated on the basis of each principle. For Leibniz, we\ncan know mathematical truths only on the basis of the Principle of\nContradiction and only metaphysical, theological, and physical truths\nrequire the PSR in order to be known. We will see in more detail in\nwhat way the PSR allows us to investigate these domains the section on\napplications. \nWhen Leibniz insists that every truth or fact requires a sufficient\nreason, what does he mean by “sufficient reason?” In some\ntexts he suggests that sufficient reason is an “a\npriori proof”. This should not be understood in Kantian\nterms as a proof that doesn’t require any input from sense\nexperience. Rather, Leibniz uses the term “a\npriori” in its original pre-Kantian meaning, which means an\nargument from causes to effects. An a priori proof is a proof\nthat reflects the causal order. Thus a sufficient reason would be a\nproof that is both a demonstration and an explanation (see Adams 1994:\n109). \nIn order to fully understand Leibniz’s conception of a\nsufficient reason, we need to also understand his theory of truth and\nits relationship to his theory of modality. Let us begin with truth.\nTo keep things simple, we will focus only on categorical propositions\nof subject-predicate form. A proposition is true, according to\nLeibniz, just in case the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. Uncontroversially, the concept of the\npredicate is unmarried is contained in the concept\nbachelor and it is this conceptual containment which explains\nthe truth of the statement bachelors are unmarried. But\nLeibniz makes the further highly controversial claim that all\ntrue statements are true for this reason, even statements like\nCaesar crossed the Rubicon. That is, this statement is true\nbecause the concept crossed the Rubicon is contained in the\nconcept of Caesar. This theory of truth is sometimes called the\nconceptual containment theory of truth. It has as a\nconsequence that all truths are analytic. But wouldn’t such a\ntheory entail that all truths are necessary? After all, how could an\nanalytic truth be contingent? \nIn response to this worry, Leibniz develops an account of contingency\nin terms of infinite\n analysis.[8]\n Leibniz understands analysis as the process of replacing the terms of\na proposition with definitions or partial definitions. A demonstration\nresults when an identity is obtained through the process of analysis\nin a finite number of steps. Leibniz claims that all and only\nnecessary truths have a finite demonstration by analysis and all and\nonly contingent truths do not have a demonstration by analysis in a\nfinite number of steps. In this way, he preserves the distinction\nbetween necessary and contingent truths while also maintaining that\nall truths are analytic, that is, true in virtue of the meaning of the\nconcepts involved. \nThis has led some commenters to think that Leibniz gave up the account\nof sufficient reason as an a priori proof. If there were a\nproof or demonstration, it would reveal that the concept of the\npredicate was contained in the concept of the subject in a finite\nnumber of steps and hence every proposition would be necessary.\nLeibniz is not a necessitarian in his mature philosophy and thus he\ncould not have accepted this consequence. Instead, he must have\nshifted from the conception of a sufficient reason as an a\npriori proof to that of an a priori proof sequence,\nwhere the latter notion is understood as an analysis that converges on\nan identity without reaching it in a finite number of steps (see\nSleigh 1983: 200). What it means for an analysis to converge on an\nidentity is, unfortunately, obscure. Nevertheless, there is some clear\nsense in which every contingent truth has a sufficient reason on this\nunderstanding. The sufficient reason why it is true that Caesar\ncrossed the Rubicon, for example, is that the concept crossing the\nRubicon is contained in the concept Caesar. The truth of\nthe proposition obtains in virtue of the concepts of the subject and\nthe predicate. Of course, this reason is undiscoverable by any finite\nhuman mind because it is buried too deeply in the concept of Caesar.\nOnly God, in his omniscience sees the conceptual connection between\nthem. It is enough for there to be such a connection for there be a\nsufficient reason. \nSuch a conception of the nature of a sufficient reason have lead some\ncommentators to think that for Leibniz the PSR is a logical notion or\nthat it is a metaphysical notion that is ultimately reducible to logic\n(Couturat 1901: 123ff and Russell 1937: v). But the notion of a\nsufficient reason as a non-terminating proof sequence is not the only\nconception of a sufficient reason to be found in Leibniz. And other\nconceptions have a decidedly less logical and more metaphysical\nflavor. \nOne such characterization of a sufficient reason comes from\nLeibniz’s conviction that in order to preserve the notion of\ncausal activity, without which substances are not really\nsubstances—i.e., truly fundamental building blocks of\nreality—philosophy must revive something like the ancient\nAristotelian notion of a substantial form (see the discussion in the\nentry on\n Aristotle’s Metaphysics).\n Each genuine substance, for Leibniz, has what he calls a\n“primitive active force”. This force is the nature or\nessence of the substance. Now according to Leibniz, substances do not\ncausally interact with one another (see the entry\n Leibniz on causation).\n The changes that they undergo derive solely from their own natures or\nprimitive active force, which consequently determines the whole of its\nhistory. Many texts suggest that, for Leibniz, the sufficient reason\nfor any state of a substance is its primitive active force (NE\n65–6; T 400/G VI, 354; Mon. 18/G VI, 609–610; G IV, 507; G\nIII, 72). \nIn many ways primitive active force plays the role of the concept of\nthe subject in the logical version of the PSR. Just as on the logical\nversion the PSR that a is F is explained by the fact\nthat the concept of F-ness is in the concept of a,\nso too on the metaphysical version of the PSR fact that a is\nF is explained by the primitive active force of a\nthat determines it to be F. Whereas commentators such as\nCouturat and Russell emphasize the logical notion of a sufficient\nreason to the detriment of the metaphysical notion, other commentators\nsee the logical and the metaphysical as two equally fundamental\npresentations of the same datum (see Frankel 1994). \nAnother metaphysical characterization of a sufficient reason connects\nwith the Principle of the Best, which says that for any proposition\np, p is true just in case p holds in the\nbest possible world (G VI.448/DM 22; Mon. 46, 53, 54/G VI,\n614–616). Is the Principle of the Best a supplement to the PSR\nor a rival to the PSR? It is, in fact, a consequence of the PSR in\nconjunction with three additional assumptions: (1) the sufficient\nreason for every choice is that the chooser perceives it to the best;\n(2) God chooses the actual world; (3) God perceives something to be\nwhat is best just in case it is the best. \nIn some texts, Leibniz suggests that the sufficient reason for\ncontingent truths cannot be found in the concepts or natures of\nthings. We must instead look to the Principle of the Best (Mon.\n36–38/G VI, 613). In other words the sufficient reason for any\ncontingent proposition of the form “a is\nF” is that a is F is true in the best\npossible word. This appears to be an entirely different sort of reason\nthan the fact that “a is F” is analytic\nor that the nature of a determines that it is F.\nThose reasons are to be found internal to the concept of the subject\nor the nature of the substance. Reasons that advert to the Principle\nof the Best look outside the concept of the subject or the nature of\nthe substance and make comparisons between worlds in terms of their\nrelative perfections. It is possible that Leibniz thought that these\ndifferent conceptions of sufficient reasons were equivalent but that\nthey are so is far from obvious. \nLeibniz argues for the PSR in three distinct ways: (1) from the\nconcept of a sufficient reason and the concept of a\n“requisite”; (2) from his theory of truth; and (3)\ninductively. \nIn some texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR is a conceptual truth that\nis derivable from the concepts of a sufficient reason and the concept\nof a requisite (A VI, ii, 483; see also G VII 393, LC L5.18; A\nVI.iii.133). The concept of a requisite is that of a necessary\ncondition. In this context, Leibniz defines a sufficient reason as a\nsufficient condition. If something exists, then all of its requisites\nhave been posited. Leibniz then asserts that if all of a things\nrequisites have been posited, then it exists. Thus all of a\nthing’s requisites are a thing’s sufficient reason. The\nquestion-begging assumption is that all the necessary conditions for\nsomething to exist are jointly sufficient for it to exist. Anybody who\ndenies the PSR will not agree with this assumption and it is clearly\nnot encoded in the definitions of requisite and\nsufficient reason provided by Leibniz. \nIn other texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR follows from the\nconceptual containment theory of truth (A VI.iv.1645/L 268). Every\ntruth is such that the concept of the predicate is contained the\nconcept of the subject. This conceptual connection is the sufficient\nreason for the truth. Thus every truth has a sufficient reason. \nIt is worth noting that Leibniz believed the PSR before he developed\nhis conceptual containment Theory of Truth. In fact, the PSR is one of\nLeibniz’s earliest and most stable philosophical commitments\n(see, for example, Leibniz’s 1671 letter to Wedderkopf A\nII.ii.117f/L146). This observation has led some scholars to conclude\nthat rather than deriving the PSR from the conceptual containment\ntheory of truth, Leibniz was in fact led to the conceptual containment\ntheory from his antecedent commitment to the PSR. The conceptual\ncontainment theory explains how there could be a sufficient reason for\nevery truth by guaranteeing that there will be an explanation in terms\nof conceptual relations (see Adams 1994: 69). \nIn his Fifth paper to Clarke, Leibniz argues for the PSR inductively.\nHe says that there are many cases where a fact has a sufficient reason\nand no cases where fact is known not to have a sufficient reason. He\nthen says that it is reasonable to assume that the PSR holds in all\ncases where we do not know that sufficient reason. Leibniz describes\nthis as “the method of experimental philosophy, which proceeds\na posteriori” (G VII 420; LC, L5.129). \nLeibniz says that PSR is needed if we are to go beyond mathematics to\nmetaphysics and natural science. How does the PSR help in those\ndomains of inquiry? There is a general pattern of argument that\nLeibniz uses to establish conclusions using the PSR. First he assumes\nthe falsity of what he wants to prove. Call the proposition to be\nproved p. Then he tries to show that if p were\nfalse, there would be some fact or truth for which there was no\nsufficient reason. But by the PSR, there is no fact or truth.\nTherefore, p is true. Leibniz uses this template to argue for\na number of claims, including the identity of indiscernibles,\nrelationalism with respect to space and time, and the existence of\nGod. Let us briefly look at how Leibniz uses the PSR to argue for each\nof these theses. \nLeibniz presents arguments for the existence of God from the PSR in a\nnumber of different places (for example, The Ultimate Origination\nof Things, G VII 302–3; L 486–8. Monadology\n§37). Suppose that God does not exist. If God does not exist,\nthen the only things that exist are contingent beings. Would the\nentire series of contingent things have an explanation? The\nexplanation of the entire series cannot be a member of the series\nsince then it would explain itself and no contingent thing is\nself-explanatory. But the explanation cannot be outside of the series\nbecause we have assumed that there is no non-contingent being, i.e.,\nGod. Thus if God did not exist, there would be something unexplained:\nthe series of contingent beings. Everything has an explanation.\nTherefore God exists. \nLeibniz also thinks that the PSR rules out the possibility that there\ncould be two or more indistinguishable, that is, indiscernible, things\n(A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). If there were two such things, God would have\ntreated them differently insofar as he has related them differently to\nthe rest of the world. For example, if there were two blades of grass\nthat were indiscernible from each other, then one blade would stand in\nspatial and temporal relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world, whereas\nthe other blade would stand in some other spatial and temporal\nrelation \\(R'\\) to the rest of the world. Why did God choose to put\nthe first blade relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world instead of\n\\(R'\\)? Leibniz claims that since they are indiscernible from each\nother, there could be no reason for God to treat them\ndifferently. Thus if there were two indiscernible individuals, then\nGod would have acted for no reason. But there is a reason for\neverything. So, there are no indiscernible yet numerically distinct\nthings. \nFor similar reasons, Leibniz thinks that space and time cannot be\nsubstances or anything else absolute and must ultimately be a system\nof relations that obtain between bodies (e.g., LC, L, 3.5). This is\nbecause if space, for example, were absolute, then there would be\nspace points that were indiscernible from one another. God would treat\nthese space points differently from each other insofar as he orients\nhis creation in space one way rather than another. This would have to\nbe an arbitrary decision for the reasons outlined above. So, space and\ntime are not absolute (see Lin 2011). \nThe PSR is nearly as old as philosophy itself. Anaximander, one of the\nearliest of the pre-Socratics, is usually credited—on the basis\nof Aristotle’s de Caelo, (b12\n295b10–16)—with being the first to make use of it.\nAnaximander argues, we are told, that the Earth remains stationary in\nspace because it is indifferent between motions in any direction. This\nindifference means that there is no reason why it should move in one\ndirection rather than another. Since he concludes from this that it\ndoes not move, we can assume that Anaximander believes that motion in\nthe absence of a reason is impossible. \nParmenides, another pre-Socratic, implicitly appeals to the PSR when\nhe claims that the world cannot have come into existence because then\nit would have come from nothing (Fragment B8 9–10). Nothing\ncomes from nothing. If it did, Parmenides asks, why did it not come\ninto existence at an earlier or a later time? Parmenides appears to\nreason as follows. If the world came into existence, the actual moment\nthat it came into existence would be arbitrary. It would be a brute\nfact. There are no brute facts (the PSR). So, the world did not come\ninto existence. \nAnother ancient source for the PSR is Archimedes who writes:  \nEqual weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights\nat unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the\nweight which is at the greater distance (On the Equilibrium of Planes, 189).  \nThis is a special case of the PSR and is cited by Leibniz in his\ncorrespondence with Clarke as a precedent for the PSR. \nIn the medieval period, Peter Abelard argued that God must create the\nbest of all possible worlds. If he didn’t, Abelard argues, there\nwould have to be some reason for it. But what reason could that be\nexcept God’s injustice or jealousy? But God cannot be unjust or\njealous. So there is no possible reason for God making anything less\nthan the best. Everything has a reason. Thus God makes the best\npossible world (McCallum 1948, 93). Abelard’s opinion was rejected as heresy and\nmainstream opinion of philosophers during the Middle Ages appears to\nreject the PSR. God, on the mainstream medieval view, enjoys freedom\nof indifference with respect to his creation. Thus there is no\nsufficient reason for why God created what he did and the PSR slips\nfrom prominence until its early modern revival at the hands of Spinoza\nand Leibniz. \nSome great epistemological rationalists, such as Plato and Descartes,\nappear to endorse the PSR but in fact do not. For example, in the\nTimaeus Plato writes,  \n[E]verything that comes to be must of necessity come to be by the\nagency of some cause, for it is impossible for anything to come to be\nwithout a cause. (28a4–5)  \nThis passage appears to assert the PSR. But Plato believes that there\nare things that are not among the things that “come to\nbe”, and some of these things have no cause or reason. For\nexample, the Demiurge creates the world by imposing order on\ndisorderly motion. The disorderly motion preexists the work of the\nDemiurge. It is uncaused and there is no reason for it. \nAt times, Descartes appears to endorse the PSR. For example, he argues\nfor the existence of God in the third Mediation on the basis\nof the principle that there must be at least as much reality in the\ncause as in the effect. And he justifies this causal principle by\nclaiming that “Nothing comes from nothing”. This appears\nto make him as much an adherent of the PSR as Parmenides who, as we\nhave seen, argues for his conclusions on the same basis. But elsewhere\nDescartes claims that God creates the eternal truths, such as\nmathematical and metaphysical truths (Letters to Mersenne, April 15,\nMay 6, and 27, 1630; Fifth Replies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261).\nMoreover, he claims that God creates these truths by an act of will\nwhich is free and indifferent. Thus there can be no reason for\nGod’s will to create any of these truths. If the act of will by\nmeans of which God creates the mathematical and metaphysical truths is\ncontingent and yet has no sufficient reason according to Descartes,\nthen his philosophy is deeply antithetical to the PSR. Of course,\nDescartes, like many of the others we have discussed may have endorsed\na restricted version of the PSR. But the most natural and\nrationalistically acceptable restriction would be to contingent\ntruths. Descartes’ doctrine of the creation of the eternal\ntruths holds that there is at least one contingent truth (the act of\nwill by means of which God creates the eternal truths) which lacks a\nsufficient reason. \nHume’s critique of causation presents an important challenge to\nthe PSR. In his Treatise of Human Nature (I, 3, 3) Hume\nconsiders several arguments which attempt to prove the “general\nmaxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must have a\ncause” and finds all of them wanting. Hume argues that\nsince the ideas of cause and its effect are evidently distinct, we can\nclearly conceive or imagine an object without its cause. He takes the\nseparability of the two ideas to show that there is no necessary\nconceptual relation between the ideas of cause and effect insofar as\nconceiving the one without the other does not imply any contradiction\nor absurdity. \nChristian Wolff (1679–1754), the most influential German\nphilosopher of the first half of the eighteenth century, was a\nfollower of Leibniz and developed the latter’s system. Like\nLeibniz, Wolff assigned to the PSR a central role in his system while\nattempting to avoid necessitarianism (or “fatalism”). Like\nSpinoza and Leibniz, Wolff demanded a reason for both the possibility\nof things [ratio essendi] (i.e., coherence of essence) and\nfor the actualization, or coming to be, of essences [ratio\nfiendi]. Wolff mildly criticized Leibniz’s grounding of the\nPSR merely in experience and attempted to marshal several proofs for\nthe principle (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings, §§30–31,\n143; Ontologia, §§56–78). One of these proofs\nattempts to prove the PSR relying on the principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings §31), while the\nmost famous proof attempts to derive the PSR from the Law of\nNon-Contradiction. According to the latter, if a thing \\(A\\) is\nassumed to exist without reason, than “nothing is posited that\nexplains why \\(A\\) exists”. This, according to Wolff, would\nmean that \\(A\\) exists because of nothing (Ontologia,\n§70), which Wolff claims to be absurd. Kant criticized the proof\nclaiming that it is based on an equivocal use of the term\n“nothing” (AK 1:398). \nLeonhard Euler, the great Swiss mathematician and a contemporary of\nWolff, warned against the “wretched abuse” of the PSR by\nthose who  \nemploy it so dexterously that by means of it they are in a condition\nto demonstrate whatever suits their purpose, and to demolish whatever\nis raised against them. (Letters to German Princess, Letter\nXIII)  \nAccording to Euler, many of the proofs which rely on the PSR amount to\nnothing over and above a petitio principii, while others\nderive carelessly the impossibility of things from our ignorance of\nthe causes of these things. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), Kant claims to\nprovide a proof for the PSR by showing that  \n[T]he PSR is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective\ncognition of appearances with regards to their relation in the\nsuccessive series of time. (B/246/A201)  \nRelying on his transcendental method Kant argues in the “Second\nAnalogy of Experience” that a certain version of the PSR is a\ncondition for the possibility of experience, and as a result also a\ncondition for the possibility of objects of experience. Yet, this\nargument also restricts the validity of the PSR to human experience,\ni.e., to things which appear in space and time. Any use of the PSR\nthat transgresses the boundaries of human experience is bound to\ngenerate antinomies. \nKant’s view of space and time as exhibiting brute\ndifference (i.e., the non-identity of locations in space and time\ncannot be reduced to conceptual explanation) stands in sharp contrast\nto the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, and thereby also\nto the PSR. Salomon Maimon, Kant’s rationalist critic, attempted\nto enforce rationalist strictures on Kant’s philosophy by\narguing that Kant is unable to explain the necessary agreement of\nintuitions and concepts. According to Kant, intuitions and concepts\ncome from entirely different sources: sensibility and understanding.\nBut if this were the case, claims Maimon, we could not explain the\nconstant agreement between intuitions and concepts, which is necessary\nfor the possibility of experience. This agreement can be explained if\nwe reject the radical heterogeneity of intuitions and concepts, and\nview intuitions as disguised concepts. Thus, any difference exhibited\nin space and time must have its ground in the universal forms of our\nthought in general (Maimon, Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, Ch. 1, p. 13). Maimon also argued that we must seek\nan explanation for the fact that we have two forms of\nintuition rather than one, and suggested that it is only the interplay\nbetween the two forms of intuition which allows us to exhibit\ndifference, by using a unity in one form to exhibit difference in the\nother form, i.e., conceive different times by concentrating on the\nchange occurring at the same location in space, or conceive different\nlocations in space at the same point in time (Essay, Ch. 1,\npp. 13–14). \nGround [Grund] and the Principle of Sufficient Ground\n[der Satz vom zureichenden Grund] play a significant role in\nHegel’s Logic. For Hegel, the demand for ground provides a major\nsource of transition from one thing to another. It is, Hegel says,\n“the expulsion of itself from itself” (Encyclopedia\nLogic, §121A). Ground, for Hegel, is the unity of identity\nand difference: the ground of \\(x\\) has to explain all features of\n\\(x\\), and in sense duplicates it, yet it must also be different\nfrom \\(x\\) in order to have explanatory value and not be a mere\npetitio principii. \nThe PSR is the subject of Schopenahuer’s 1813 doctoral\ndissertation: The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. In this work, Schopenhauer provides a brief history of\nthe PSR, and then raises the questions of the justification for the\nPSR and the proper scope of the principle. Schopenhauer follows Wolff\nin distinguishing among four kinds of reasons, corresponding to four\nkinds of objects, and charges that much philosophical confusion arises\nfrom attempts to explain objects of one kind by reasoning that belongs\nto the other kind. These four kinds of explanation, or four variants\nof the PSR, share the very same ground. Along Kantian lines\nSchopenhauer suggests that it is the subject’s activity in\nregularly connecting representations that is the ground of the PSR\n(The Fourfold Root, §16). \nThe notion of grounding has been increasingly a topic of\ndiscussion in contemporary metaphysics. Grounding is said to be a kind\nof explanation distinct from causal explanation. It is a metaphysical or\nconstitutive explanation. It is generally taken to be asymmetric,\nirreflexive, and transitive. Alleged examples of grounding relations\nare: dispositions (e.g., fragility) are grounded in categorical\nfeatures (e.g., molecular structure); semantic facts (e.g., Jones\nmeans addition by “+”) are grounded by\nnon-semantic facts (e.g., Jones is disposed to draw certain\ninferences); mental properties (e.g., pain) are grounded by physical\nproperties (e.g., c-fibers firing; see Rosen 2010 and Fine 2012). It has recently been\nproposed by Dasgupta that a version of the PSR could be formulated in\nterms of grounds. The proposal is formulated as follows: \nPSR: For every substantive fact \\(Y\\) there are some facts, the\n\\(X\\)s, such that (i) the \\(X\\)s ground \\(Y\\) and (ii) each\none of the \\(X\\)s is autonomous. (Dasgupta 2016: 12) \nHere substantive means apt for grounding and\nautonomous means not apt for grounding. For example, perhaps\nessentialist facts are autonomous where essentialist facts are facts\nof the form: it is essential to \\(x\\) that \\(\\phi\\). The idea is that\njust as definitions are not apt for proof, essentialist facts are not\napt for grounding explanations, that is, they are autonomous (Dasgupta\n2016: 6–9). The notion of an autonomous fact allows the adherent\nof this version of the PSR to avoid the Agrippan Trilemma without\nallowing for self-explanatory facts or infinite regresses. Chains of\nexplanation terminate with autonomous facts, which are not brute\nbecause they are not apt for explanation.  \nFollowing Bolzano (Theory of Science:\nvol. II, 259–264), most contemporary theories of grounding\naffirm the irreflexivity of this relation (see Fine 2001: 15; Schaffer\n2009: 364; and Rosen 2010: 115). More recently, Fine showed that given\ncertain plausible premises, one may point out counterexamples to\nirreflexivity (Fine 2010; cf. Krämer 2013), and the issue has\nbeen further challenged by Jenkins (2011). \nJonathan Schaffer has relied on the notion of ground to revive an\nAristotelian, structured metaphysics, i.e., a metaphysics which is\nordered by priority relations (Schaffer 2009), and to defend Priority\nMonism (see the entry on\n monism).\n In response, Michael Della Rocca (2014) has argued that strict\nadherence to the PSR—and to Ockham’s Razor (see the entry\non\n simplicity)—undermines\n Schaffer’s structured metaphysics (and Priority Monism), since\ninsofar as all the features of the grounded are already present in the\nground, the existence of the grounded is just redundant. (See also\nthe entry on\n metaphysical grounding). \nThe role of the PSR in ethics and political theory has not been\nseriously studied so far. Clearly, the PSR may be marshaled in order\nto question our reliance on mere intuitions. The repugnance of a\ncertain view cannot be taken at face value, but rather requires a\njustification. In the past, various racist and conservative views\nrelied merely on the alleged repugnance of certain sexual acts (e.g.,\nhomosexuality, interracial relations). The requirement to dig deeper\nand ask a person to justify her intuitions may help the person\nunderstand the maxims guiding her specific moral beliefs. Adherence to\nthe PSR may also shift the onus of proof in the debate between those\nwho consider our preferential evaluation of human beings over other\nthings in nature as simply brute (Williams 2006: 195) and those who\ninsist that if human beings have a special value, there must be a\nreason for the ascription of such value (Buss 2012: 343).","contact.mail":"mlin@philosophy.rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"philosophy.rutgers.edu"}]
