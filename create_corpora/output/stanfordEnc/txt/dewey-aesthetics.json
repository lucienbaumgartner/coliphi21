His fame is based largely on his\nmembership in the school of American Pragmatists of which Charles\nSanders Peirce and William James were the leading early figures. He\nhas also had a great deal of influence in aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of art. His work Art as Experience (1934) is\nregarded by many as one of the most important contributions to this\narea in the 20th century. Yet it is not as widely discussed\nas that evaluation would indicate. There are several reasons for this.\n\n\n\nFirst, although Dewey seems to write in an almost folksy style, his\nphilosophical prose is often difficult and dense. Second, the book\nearly on had the misfortune of receiving two reviews that negatively\nimpacted its reception. The first, by an avowed follower, Stephen\nPepper, complained that it was not truly pragmatist and that Dewey had\nreverted to an earlier Hegelianism (Pepper 1939). The second, by\nBenedetto Croce, seemed to confirm this (Croce 1948). Croce, widely\nseen as Hegelian himself, saw so many similarities between Dewey's\nwork and his own that he accused Dewey of lifting his ideas. Dewey\n(1948) insisted otherwise, but the sense that there was something too\nHegelian in Art as Experience remained. This did not stop\nmany philosophers, educators, and other intellectuals from producing\nworks in aesthetic theory that were strongly influenced by Dewey. Even\nbefore Art as Experience Dewey's writings on aesthetics and\nart influenced, and were influenced by, such writers as: Mary Mullen\n(1923), who taught seminars on aesthetics and was Associate Director\nof Education for the Barnes Foundation; Lawrence Buermeyer (1924), who\nwas another Associate Director of Education at the Barnes Foundation;\nAlbert Barnes (1928); and Thomas Munro (1928). After the book's\npublication his followers included Irwin Edman (1939), Stephen Pepper\n(1939, 1945, 1953), Horace Kallen (1942), Thomas Munro again (numerous\nbooks) and Van Meter Ames (1947, 1953). Art historian Meyer Schapiro\nwas one of his students.\n\n\nHowever, in the 1950s there was an analytic revolution in\nEnglish-speaking aesthetics. Prior aesthetic theories were considered\nto be too speculative and unclear. Dewey's work was caught up in this\ncondemnation. Arnold Isenberg (1987, orig. 1950) for instance, in a\nfounding document of analytic aesthetics, dismissed Art as\nExperience as a “hodgepodge of conflicting methods and\nundisciplined speculations,” (p. 128) although he found it full\nof profound suggestions. Dewey's theories of expression and creativity\nwere particular targets of analytic attack. Dewey's was among the\nviews singled out in a general critique of expression as a defining\ncharacteristic of art, although often his own distinctive theory was\nignored in the process. A situation followed, and continued well into\nthe 1980s, in which, according to one editor of The Journal of\nAesthetics and Art Criticism, Dewey's aesthetics was virtually\nignored (Fisher 1989). While Monroe Beardsley, one of the most\nimportant late 20th century aestheticians, kept an interest\nin Dewey alive (1958, 1975, 1982), particularly in his discussions of\naesthetic experience, other major figures, including Arthur Danto,\nMary Mothersill and Richard Wollheim, completely ignored him. Nelson\nGoodman may be a partial exception (Freeland 2001). Goodman certainly\nshared with Dewey a conviction that art and science are close in many\nways and, like Dewey, he replaced the question “what is\nart?” with “when is art?” They also both took a\nnaturalist approach to the arts. However, Goodman, who never refers to\nDewey in his Languages of Art (1976), saw art in terms of\nlanguages and other symbol systems, whereas Dewey saw it in terms of\nexperience. Joseph Margolis (1980) is perhaps the most important\ncontemporary aesthetician coming out of the analytic school to take\nDewey seriously, having a natural affinity to pragmatist ways of\nthought. His idea that works of art are culturally emergent but\nphysically embodied entities is Deweyan in spirit, as is his\ninsistence on a robust relativist theory of interpretation. However,\nMargolis seldom refers to Dewey and, although he believes himself\ncloser to Dewey's “Hegelianism” than to Peirce's\n“Kantianism,” he finds Peirce more interesting. He also\nfaults Dewey for not being an historicist (1999). Another contemporary\nAmerican aesthetician, Arnold Berleant, has continuously developed\nthemes similar to Dewey's, for example, in his concepts of the\n“aesthetic field” and “engagement.”\n(1970,1991). \n\n\nThe relative lack of interest in Dewey changed for several reasons in\nthe late 1970s. First, Richard Rorty turned analytic philosophy on its\nhead by advocating a return to pragmatism (Rorty 1979, 1982). In this,\nDewey was one of his avowed heroes. Unfortunately, Rorty was not a\nclose reader of Dewey's aesthetics. The Society for the Advancement of\nAmerican Philosophy along with their publication, The Journal of\nSpeculative Philosophy, as well as the Center for Dewey Studies\nalso contributed to this revival. Dewey was further promoted in\naesthetics through the work of Richard Shusterman (1992, 1997a, 2000)\nwho went so far as to advocate a pragmatist aesthetics, with Dewey as\nhis main champion. He particularly emphasized the possibilities of\ntreating popular art as fine art with his well-known example of rap as\nfine art. He also extended aesthetics into the realm of everyday life\nthrough his concept of “somaesthetics.” This strand of\npro-Deweyan thinking has also been recently pursued by Crispin\nSartwell in response to multi-culturalism and everyday aesthetics\n(Sartwell 1995, 2003) and by Yuriko Saito (Saito 2007) in her effort\nto extend aesthetics to everyday life. Dewey's aesthetics finally\nreceived an excellent exposition in the work of Thomas Alexander\n(Alexander 1987). Alexander developed his ideas further in a book on\neco-ontology and the aesthetics of existence (Alexander 2013). Mark\nJohnson developed Dewey's anti-dualism and the aesthetics of human\nunderstanding (Johnson 2007). Meanwhile, there has been a steady\ninterest in Dewey's aesthetics in the philosophy of education, with\narticles appearing on a regular basis in such publications as the\nJournal of Aesthetic Education and Studies in the\nPhilosophy of Education and several books (Jackson 1998, Garrison\n1997, Greene 2001, Maslak 2006, Granger 2006a). \nDewey's renewed influence was due in part to increased interest in\nvarious continental aestheticians. The similarities between Dewey and\nMerleau-Ponty are the most striking (Ames 1953, Kestenbaum 1977), but\nhe also shares certain features with Gadamer (Gilmour 1987, who also\nnotes important differences, and Jeannot 2001). Given his critique of\ncapitalism, one can also find connections between his thinking and\nthat of Marxist aestheticians, particularly Adorno (Lysaker 1998), although there are important differences as well as similarities, especially where Adorno advocates the autonomy of art while Dewey stresses continuity (Lewis 2005, Eldridge 2010).\nSome contemporary feminist aestheticians have come to realize that\nDewey shares many of their concerns, for example their rejection of\nmind/body dualism, their democratic instincts, their contextualism,\nand their tendency to break down traditional distinctions (Seigfried\n1996b, Duran 2001). There has also been some work on marked\nsimilarities between Dewey's aesthetic thought and that of Taoism\n(Grange 2001), Transcendental Meditation (Zigler 1982), Dogen's\nversion of Zen (Earls 1992), the great Indian aesthetician,\nAbhinavagupta (Mathur 1981), the Bhagavad-Gita (Stroud 2009), and\nConfucius (Shusterman 2009, Man 2007, Mullis 2005, Grange 2004).\nAlexander has recently discussed relations between Dewey and Eastern\nAesthetics generally (Alexander 2009) \nAn interesting aspect of Dewey's writing, and perhaps another reason\nfor the lack of on-going positive reception, was his lack of strong\ninterest in the history of aesthetics. He seldom explicated or\ncritiqued the aesthetic works of others. Although full of quotations,\nArt as Experience originally lacked adequate footnotes.\n(Fortunately, the recent Boydston edition tracks down all quotations,\nand even notes which books were in Dewey's library.) Poets figure as\nstrongly in Dewey's reading list as philosophers, especially\nColeridge, Housman, Keats, Poe, Shakespeare and Wordsworth. Visual\nartists are often quoted, especially Cezanne, Constable, Delacroix,\nManet, Matisse (whom he met), Reynolds, and Van Gogh. As for\nphilosophers, he was of course aware of the work of Plato and\nAristotle. Yet in Art as Experience he never mentions Hume's\naesthetics, Hegel receives only one citation (surprisingly, given the\naccusation that Dewey was too Hegelian), and Nietzsche none. Kant,\nhowever, plays an important role as an opponent, and Schopenhauer\nreceives a few mentions. Amongst contemporaries, he references Matthew\nArnold, Clive Bell, Bernard Bosanquet, Andrew Bradley, Benedetto\nCroce, Roger Fry, Thomas Hulme, Violet Paget (who wrote under the name\nVernon Lee), Walter Pater, George Santayana, Hippolyte Taine, and Leo\nTolstoy.  \nSince Dewey was a pragmatist it is worthwhile to look for antecedents\nin that tradition (see Shusterman 2006b). A strong case can be made\nfor many parallels with Emerson, whom many see as a proto-pragmatist.\nCharles S. Peirce also touched on themes more familiar in Dewey, for\nexample the continuity of aesthetics and ethics. Although William\nJames did not write in aesthetics, his psychological views had a\nstrong influence on Dewey's aesthetics. Alain Locke, the\nAfrican-American philosopher and pragmatist culture-theorist, probably\nhad some influence as well.  \nOther important thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries also\ninfluenced Dewey. His idea of the live creature interacting with its\nenvironment owes much to Charles Darwin (Perricone 2006), and although\nhe never cites Karl Marx, perhaps because he was so committed in his\npublic life to defending an anti-communist form of social liberalism,\nhis views on the relation between art and society were very close to\nthose of Marx, especially the young Marx. Another figure hovering in\nthe background was Sigmund Freud for, although Dewey is sometimes\ncritical of Freud's hypostatization of entities within the\nunconscious, in Art as Experience he gives\nsubconscious processes a significant role in the creative\nprocess. \nAlbert C. Barnes, the industrialist and collector, was Dewey's\nstrongest influence in aesthetics. The two were close friends, and\nDewey was a member of the staff of the Barnes Foundation of which he\nwas named Director in 1925 (Barnes Foundation 2011). Barnes, who took\na seminar under Dewey in 1917, avidly advocated Dewey's form of\npragmatism. He considered himself a strong defender of democracy,\nalthough ironically, he made it very difficult for people to see his\nown extensive collection and was thought by some to be authoritarian\nin his formalist theories of appreciation. Dewey not only quotes\nextensively from Barnes' writings but dedicates Art as\nExperience to him. Many of the illustrations in Dewey's book came\nfrom the Barnes collection. \nDewey was ahead of his time in his devotion to multiculturalism. The\nselection of illustrations Dewey chose for Art as Experience\nincluded Pueblo Indian pottery, Bushmen rock-painting, Scythian\nornament, and African sculpture, as well as works by El Greco, Renoir,\nCezanne and Matisse. He was interested in traditional and folk arts in\nMexico, admiring the designs of the rural schools over those of the\ncities (1926c). He was also associated, mainly through Barnes, with\nAfrican-American culture. Barnes was invited to write a chapter for\nThe New Negro edited by Alain Locke (Locke 1925). The New\nNegro was one of the founding documents of the Harlem\nRenaissance. The students in Dewey's and Barnes' first experimental\nclasses in art education were mainly from the black working class.\nBarnes collected African-American art and also encouraged\nAfrican-American students to study at the Barnes Foundation.\nAfrican-American painter and illustrator Aaron Douglas, who came to\nthe foundation in 1927, studied in Paris in 1931 under a Foundation\nfellowship (Jubilee 1982). Barnes also had a long association with\nLincoln University, a historically black college, many students of\nwhich studied at the Barnes Foundation (Hollingsworth 1994). Dewey was\nalso one of the founding members of the NAACP (National Association\nfor the Advancement of Colored People). Dewey also sought to promote\ncross-cultural understanding through his founding of the China\nInstitute in New York City in 1926. The China Institute, which\ncontinues today, advertises itself as the only institution in that\ncity to focus solely on Chinese civilization, art and culture. Hu\nShih, a student of Dewey's at Columbia and one of the leading figures\nin the creation of the Institute, invited him to Peking in 1919. (Ho\n2004—see the Other Internet Resources). \nAlthough Dewey was widely versed in literature, architecture,\npainting, sculpture, and the theater, he was relatively uneducated in\nmusic, and he was said to be tone-deaf. Yet he often had insightful\nthings to say about music, and many musicians and music educators have\ndrawn inspiration from his theory (e.g., Zeltner 1975). He seemed,\nunfortunately, to have been totally unaware of both photography and\nfilm as separate art forms. \nMany writers complain that Dewey showed little interest in the\navant-garde art of his time (for example, Eldridge 2010). It is true\nthat neither Cubism, Dadaism nor Surrealism play a role in his\nwriting, and his theory seems to actually preclude Non-objective\npainting (Jacobson 1960), although he does speak positively of\nabstract art. Nor did he refer much to such innovative poets as\nT.S. Eliot or Ezra Pound. Although this may indicate a conservative\napproach to the arts, he nonetheless had considerable influence on\nvarious innovative art movements both in his own time and\nlater. Perhaps most significantly, the director of the Federal Art\nProject from 1935–1943, Holger Cahill, was a Dewey follower\n(Mavigliano 1984). Amongst painters, Thomas Hart Benton, the\nregionalist realist, was an early convert to his philosophy. Dewey was\nalso on the board of Black Mountain College.  BMC was influential in\nthe arts, with students such as Merce Cunningham and John Cage. Josef\nAlbers, an important painting teacher there, was first influenced by\nDewey's educational theory and later by his aesthetics. (Gosse,\n2012) \nIn Mexico, Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre, or open-air painting\nschools, began during the Mexican Revolution and achieved an\nestablished structure under the government of Alvaro Obregon\n(1920–24). They were promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinez who was\ninspired by Dewey. (Dictionary of Art and Artist 2011—see Other\nInternet Resources) \nTurning to late 20th century artists, Dewey's influence on Abstract\nExpressionism was especially strong (Buettner 1975, Berube 1998). For\nexample, Robert Motherwell, who studied Art as Experience\nwhen he was a philosophy major at Stanford, considered it to be one of\nhis bibles (Berube 1998). Donald Judd, the Minimalist sculptor, read\nand admired Dewey (Raskin 2010). Earth Art, with its emphases on\ngetting art out of the museum, might even be seen as applied Dewey.\nThere is also reason to believe that Allan Kaprow, one of the\noriginators of Happenings and Performance Art, read Dewey and drew on\nhis ideas (Kelly 2003). Although one author has argued that\ncontemporary Body Art has moved away from the integrated consummated\naesthetic experience Dewey commends (Jay 2002), another argues that\nDewey anticipates this movement (Brodsky 2002). \nDewey's methodology may be off-putting to readers trained in analytic\nphilosophy. He was not much given to argument. (See Aldrich 1944, for\na partial defense of Dewey's philosophical method.) However, he did\ngive reasons for rejecting other leading theories in the field. Nor\nwas he adverse to public debate in philosophical journals. Given his\nemphasis on experience, his method was somewhat similar to that of\nphenomenologists in the tradition of Edmund Husserl. Yet, unlike\nHusserl, he was strongly committed to a scientific world-view and did\nnot bracket scientific knowledge in his search for philosophical\nunderstanding. His anti-dualism would have also made him hostile to\nHusserl's Cartesian tendencies. This same anti-dualism meant that he\nwas constantly engaged in undercutting distinctions. It is not\nsurprising then that he did not follow the method of contemporary\nanalytic philosophy of progressively making more and more subtle\ndistinctions in the search for precise definition. Because of his\nundercutting of distinctions, his thinking can sometimes seem similar\nto the deconstructionism of Jacques Derrida (Derrida 1976). However,\nunlike Derrida, Dewey would never claim that there is nothing\n“outside the text,” since the starting point of his\nphilosophy was always the live creature in its environment. Also his\nemphasis on continuity and his commitment to organicism exhibit a\ntypically modernist belief in harmonious wholes that was not shared by\nDerrida or by postmodernists generally. Nor would he have accepted\nDerrida's one-sided insistence on the importance of differences and\ndeferral as found in his idea of différance. Dewey\ncould be seen as against method if method is seen as requiring\ncertainty, but not if it focuses on probability. He did share with\nanalytic philosophy a tendency to back up his points with appeals to\ncommon sense and to the meanings of words. In evaluating Dewey's\nmethod one must also take into account his considered views on the\nlogic of inquiry as expressed in several books which will be reviewed\nin other articles in this encyclopedia. \nArt as Experience, Dewey's greatest work in aesthetics, had\nits antecedents. There were scattered short essays and remarks on\naesthetics and art in the 1880s (Dewey 1896, 1897) as well as\nsignificant discussion in his Psychology (Dewey 1887). Some\ndiscussion appears in Democracy and Education (Dewey 1915)\nand in his other works on education. He also published a few short\narticles on aesthetics in the publication of the Barnes foundation in\n1925 and 1926 (Dewey 1927). Dewey laid out the beginnings of a theory\nof aesthetic experience in his major work, Experience and\nNature (Dewey 1925a). There are also two important essays in\nPhilosophy and Civilization (Dewey 1931) that address\naesthetics. These are all described in the supplementary document  \nAs much as there is fascinating preliminary material in his earlier\nwritings the primary goal of none of these was an aesthetics or a\ntheory of art. Moreover, the understanding of the arts in these\nwritings is relatively primitive compared to Art as\nExperience. Not only is the density of thought and insight in the\nlater work much greater, but the writing is much clearer. Also, only\nin the later work do we get a full account of the phenomenology of\naesthetic and artistic experience. The explication of this book will\nfollow Dewey's own chapter headings. Explication of some additional\nchapters can be found in “Additional Materials on Dewey's\nAesthetics” (see the link in Other Internet Resources).  \nDewey somewhat surprisingly begins this work with the claim that the\nvery existence of works of art hinders any aesthetic theory that seeks\nto understand them. Art products exist externally and physically,\nwhereas, on his view, the work of art is really what the physical\nobject does within experience. Also the classic status of\nmany works of art isolates them from the conditions within which they\ncame to be, and hence from their experiential function. The business\nof aesthetics is to restore the continuity between the refined\nexperiences that are works of art and the experiences of everyday\nlife. We must, in short, turn away from artistic products to ordinary\nexperience. To understand the Parthenon, which is widely believed to\nbe a great work of art, one must turn to cultural context of Athens\nand the lives of the citizens who were expressing their civic religion\nthrough its creation. \nDewey then argues that we must begin with the aesthetic “in the\nraw” in order to understand the aesthetic “refined.”\nTo do this we must turn to the events and scenes that interest the\nman-in-the-street such as the sounds and sights of rushing\nfire-engines, the grace of a baseball player, and the satisfactions of\na housewife. We find then that the aesthetic begins in happy\nabsorption in activity, for example in our fascination with a fire in\na hearth as we poke it. Similarly, Dewey holds that an intelligent\nmechanic who does his work with care is “artistically\nengaged.” If his product is not aesthetically appealing this\nprobably has more to do with market conditions that encourage\nlow-quality work than with his abilities. \nThis move to the everyday entails recognition of the aesthetic nature\nof the popular arts. Average folk may be repelled by the thought that\nthey enjoy their casual recreation in part for aesthetic reasons. They\ndo not realize that what has life for them, such as movies, jazz, the\ncomics, and sensational newspaper stories, is art. Relegating art to\nthe museum comes with separating it from the experiences of everyday\nlife. Fine art fails to appeal to the masses when it is remote, and so\nthey seek aesthetic pleasure in “the vulgar.” The cause of\nthis is the common separation between spirit and matter, and the\nconsequent downgrading of matter. \nThere are, however, still people in the world who admire whatever\nintensifies immediate experience. Practices and artifacts from\ntraditional cultures were, in their original contexts, enhancements of\neveryday life. Dance, pantomime, music, and architecture were\noriginally connected with religious rites, not with theaters and\nmuseums. In prehistoric cultures the various arts consummated the\nmeaning of the community. This is also true for contemporary\ntraditional cultures. \nThe segregation of art from everyday life came with the rise of\nnationalism and imperialism. The Louvre began as a place to house\nNapoleon's loot. The rise of capitalism, with its valuation of rare\nand costly objects, also contributed to the development of the museum,\nas did the need to show good taste in an increasingly materialist\nworld. \nFor Dewey, experience should be understood in terms of the conditions\nof life. Man shares with animals certain basic vital needs, and\nderives the means for satisfying these needs from his animal nature.\nLife goes on not only in an environment but in interaction\nwith that environment. The live creature uses its organs to\ninteract with the environment through defense and conquest. Every need\nis a lack of adequate adjustment to the environment, and also a demand\nto restore adjustment—and each recovery is enriched by\nresistance met and overcome. \nLife overcomes and transforms factors of opposition to achieve higher\nsignificance. Harmony and equilibrium are the results not of\nmechanical processes but of rhythmic resolution of tension. The\nrhythmic alternation within the live creature between disunity and\nunity becomes conscious in humans. Emotion signifies breaks in\nexperience which are then resolved through reflective action. Objects\nbecome interesting as conditions for realizing harmony. Thought is\nthen incorporated into them as their meaning. \nThe artist, especially, cultivates resistance and tension to achieve a\nunified experience. By contrast, although the scientist, like the\nartist, is interested in problems, she always seeks to move on to the\nnext problem. Yet both artist and scientist are concerned with the\nsame materials, both think, and both have their aesthetic moments. The\naesthetic moment for the scientist happens when her thought becomes\nembedded as meaning in the object. The artist's thought is more\nimmediately embodied in the object as she works and thinks in her\nmedium. \nEmotions are not merely in the mind. The live animal confronts a\nnature which already has emotional qualities. Aspects of nature may\nbe, for example, irritating or comforting. Nature has such qualities\neven before it has mathematical or secondary qualities. Direct\nexperience is a function of man/nature interaction in which human\nenergy is constantly transformed. \nAesthetic experience involves a drama in which action, feeling, and\nmeaning are one. The result is balance. Such experience would not\noccur in a world of mere flux in which there was no cumulative change.\nNor would it occur in a world that is finished, for then there would\nbe no resolution or fulfillment. It is only possible in a world in\nwhich the live being loses and reestablishes equilibrium with its\nenvironment. \nPassing from disturbance to harmony provides man's most intense\nexperience. Happiness is the result of a deep fulfillment in which our\nwhole being has adjusted to the environment. Any such consummation is\nalso a new beginning. In happiness, an underlying harmony continues\nthrough the rhythmic phases of conflict and resolution. Dewey\ncontrasts a life in which the past is a burden to one that sees it as\na resource that can be used to inform the present. In this instance,\nthe future is a promise that surrounds the present as an aura. Happy\nperiods, in which memories and anticipations are absorbed into the\npresent, are an aesthetic ideal. Art celebrates these moments with\npeculiar intensity. \nDewey held that the sources of aesthetic experience are to found in\nsub-human animal life. Animals often attain a unity of experience that\nwe lose in our fragmented work-lives. The live animal is fully present\nwith all its senses active, especially when it is graceful. It\nsynthesizes past and future in the present. Similarly, tribal man is\nmost alive when most observant and filled with energy. He does not\nseparate observation, action, and foresight. His senses are not mere\npathways for storage. Rather, they prepare him for thought and action.\nExperience signifies heightened life and active engagement with the\nworld. In its highest form it involves an identification of self and\nworld. Such experience is the beginning of art. \nTheorists have often supposed that ethereal meanings and values are\ninaccessible to sense. This presupposes a nature/spirit dualism which\nDewey rejects. That people commonly resist connecting fine art and\neveryday life is explained by the current disorganization of our\ncultural lives. This disorder is hidden by the apparent order\nof social classes and the compartmentalization of life in which\nreligion, morals, politics and art all have separate domains. In this\nstate practice and insight, as well as imagination and doing, are kept\nseparate. \nDewey thought that the economic institutions of his time\n(1930s—the Depression) encouraged these separations. Under these\nconditions, sensations are mere mechanical stimuli that do not tell us\nanything about the reality behind them, and the various senses operate\nin isolation from each other. Moralists, at least, see sense as\nclosely related to emotion and appetite. Unfortunately, they see the\nsensuous as identical with the sensual, and the sensual with the\nlewd. \nThe sense organs are carried to their full realization through sense\nitself, i.e., through meaning embodied in experience. The world is\nmade actual in the qualities so experienced. Here, meaning cannot be\nseparated from action, will, or thought. Experience is not only the\nresult of interaction of subject and world, but also the subject's\nreward when it transforms interaction into participation. Dualisms of\nmind and body, by contrast come from a fear of life. \nDewey thinks it important here to distinguish mere recognition from\nperception. Recognition uses matter as means. Perception, by contrast,\nentails the past being carried into the present to enrich its content.\nA life that involves merely labeling things is not really conscious.\nThe conscious activity of man develops out of a cooperation of\ninternal needs and external materials that results in a culminating\nevent. Man converts cause and effect into means and end, and thereby\nmakes organic stimulation the bearer of meaning. \nRather than reducing the human to the animal, Dewey holds that man\ntakes the unity of sense and impulse of animal life and infuses it\nwith conscious meaning through communication. Human is more complex\nthan animal life: for humans there are more opportunities for\nresistance and tension, for invention, and for depth of insight and\nfeeling. The rhythms of struggle and consummation are more varied and\nlong-lasting, and the fulfillments are more intense. \nSpace and time are also different. For humans, space is not just a\nvoid filled with dangers and opportunities. It is a scene for their\ndoings and undergoings. Time, also, is not a mere continuum, but an\norganized medium of the rhythms of impulse and the processes of\ngrowth. These involve pauses and completions that themselves begin new\ndevelopmental processes. It is form in art that makes clear the\norganization of space and time in life experience. \nIn art, man uses the materials and energies of nature to expand life.\nArt is proof that man can consciously restore the union of sensation,\nneeds, and actions found in animal life. Consciousness adds\nregulation, selection and variation to this process. The idea of art\nis, then, humanity's greatest accomplishment. The Greeks distinguished\norder from matter, and man from the rest of nature, by way of art.\nArt, for them, was the guiding ideal for humankind. For Dewey,\nhistorically, science was developed as a means to generate other arts,\nand ultimately it is only their handmaiden. \nAlthough it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between fine and\nuseful art, Dewey thinks this extrinsic to art itself. What makes the\nwork “fine” is that the artist lived fully while producing\nit. Fine art involves completeness of living in perception and making.\nWhether the thing is put to use is irrelevant. That most utensils\ntoday are non-aesthetic is because of the unhappy conditions of their\nproduction and consumption. \nDewey thought that those who reject the continuity between everyday\nexperience and fine art fail to see that matter is needed to realize\nideals. Nature is man's habitat, and culture endures because men find\na support for it in nature. Culture results from prolonged, cumulative\ninteraction with the environment. We deeply respond to art because of\nits connection with both cultural and natural experience. \nRather than giving art primacy in aesthetic, Dewey believes that\nhumans only feel properly alive when absorbing the aesthetic features\nof nature. Aesthetic experience of the natural environment can even\ntake the form of ecstatic communion. This is due to ancient habits\ngained in the relations between the living being and its environment.\nSensuous experience can absorb into itself meanings and values that\nare designated “ideal” or “spiritual.” Dewey\nobserves that belief that nature is full of spirits is closely tied to\npoetry. The sensuous surfaces of things incorporate not only what is\ngiven by the senses but the most profound insight. Many of the arts\noriginate in primitive rituals which were not simply intended as means\nto get rain, etc., but for the enhancement of experience. Similarly\nmyth was not just an early form of science. \nDewey concludes that the idea of the supernatural is more a function\nof the psychology that generates works of art than of science or\nphilosophy. This can be seen by the solemn processions and other\nartistic phenomena in churches. Keats famously wrote “Beauty is\ntruth, truth beauty—that is all ye know on earth, and all ye\nneed to know.” Dewey agrees that any reasoning that excludes\nimagination and the embodiment of ideas in emotionally charged sense\ncannot reach truth. For Keats, “truth” meant wisdom, which\nin turn meant trust in the good. All we need to know then is the\ninsight of imagination exemplified in beauty. It is not surprising\nthen that moments of intense aesthetic perception were Keats's\nultimate solace. The philosophy of Keats, shared by Dewey, accepts\nlife with all its uncertainty and turns that experience into art. \nThis chapter is Dewey's most famous writing in aesthetics. Here he\ndefines the important concept of “an experience.”\n“An experience” is one in which the material of\nexperience is fulfilled or consummated, as for example when a problem\nis solved, or a game is played to its conclusion. Dewey contrasts this\nwith inchoate experience in which we are distracted and do not\ncomplete our course of action. “An experience,”\nis also marked off from other experiences, containing within itself an\nindividualizing quality. Dewey believes his talk of “an\nexperience” is in accord with everyday usage, even though it is\ncontrary to the way philosophers talk about experience. For Dewey,\nlife is a collection of histories, each with their own plots,\ninceptions, conclusions, movements and rhythms. Each has a unique\npervading quality. \nDewey then proceeds to offer a more dramatic sense of\n“an experience.” Two examples of this sort of\n“an experience” are a quarrel with a friend and\nthat meal in Paris which seemed to capture all that food can be. In\n“an experience” every part flows freely into what follows,\ncarrying with it what preceded without sacrificing its identity. The\nparts are phases of an enduring whole. Nor are there any holes or\nmechanical dead spots in an experience. Rather, there are\npauses that define its quality and sum up what has been undergone. \nWorks of art are important examples of “an\nexperience.” Here, separate elements are fused into a unity,\nalthough, rather than disappearing, their identity is enhanced. The\nunity of an experience, which is neither exclusively\nemotional, practical, nor intellectual, is determined by a single\npervasive quality. Contra Locke and Hume, Dewey holds that the trains\nof ideas in thought are not just linked by association, but involve\nthe development of an underlying quality. Conclusions in thought are\nsimilar to the consummating phase of “an\nexperience.” Thinking has its own aesthetic quality. It differs\nfrom art only in that its material consists of abstract symbols rather\nthan qualities. The experience of thinking satisfies us emotionally\nbecause it is internally integrated, and yet no intellectual activity\nis integrated in this way unless it has aesthetic quality. Thus, for\nDewey, there is no clear separation between the aesthetic and the\nintellectual. \nDewey thought that practical action, too, can involve meaning growing\ntowards a consummation. The Greek concept of good conduct as graceful\nis an example of the aesthetic in the moral. On the other hand, much\nmoral action has no aesthetic quality and is mere half-hearted\nduty-following. \nIn aesthetic experience there is concern for the connection between\neach incident in a series and what went before. Interest controls what\nis selected or rejected in the developing experience. By contrast, in\nnon-aesthetic experience we drift, evade, and compromise. The\nnon-aesthetic is a function either of loose succession or mechanical\nconnection of parts. Since so much of experience is like one of these\nwe take this to be the norm and place aesthetic experience outside\neveryday life. But no experience has unity without aesthetic\nquality. \nStill, Dewey does not hold “an experience” to be\nco-extensive with aesthetic experience. Philosophical and scientific\ninquiries can have aesthetic quality every bit as much as art. Their\nparts may link to each other and move to consummation. The\nconsummation may even be anticipated and savored. However, such\nexperiences are mostly intellectual or practical in nature. Also,\nwhereas intellectual effort may be summarized in a “truth”\nthere is no such thing in art. \nWhen Dewey says that every integral experience (another term for\n“an experience”) moves to a close he means that\nthe energies within it have done the work they are supposed to do. An\nelement of “undergoing” or suffering may occur in this,\nfor incorporating what preceded can be painful, and yet the suffering\nis part of the complete enjoyed experience. \nDewey holds that aesthetic quality is emotional. Emotions are not\nstatic entities with no element of growth. When significant, they are\nqualities of a complex changing experience, of a developing drama.\nThere are no separate things called emotions. Emotions, rather, are\naspects of events and objects. They are not, generally speaking,\nprivate. They belong to a self concerned with movement and change.\nUnlike automatic reflexes, they are parts of an on-going\nsituation. \nEmotion is a cementing force that gives diverse things their\nqualitative unity. This can give an experience aesthetic character.\nFor example, an employee interview can either be mechanical and\nordinary or can involve an interplay that turns it into an\nexperience. In the latter case, the events are connected, each\nchanging the underlying quality as they collectively move to\nconsummation. This may involve the employer's imaginative projection\nof the character of the applicant onto the job, with resultant harmony\nor conflict. \nThe structure of “an experience” goes as follows.\nThe subject undergoes something or some properties, these properties\ndetermine his or her doing something, and the process continues until\nthe self and the object are mutually adapted, ending with felt\nharmony. This even holds for the thinker interacting with his or her\nideas. When the doing and undergoing are joined in perception they\ngain meaning. Meaning, in turn, is given depth through incorporating\npast experience. \nExcess of doing, or excess of undergoing, may interfere with\nexperience. For example, desire for action may lead to treating\nresistance as mere obstacle and not as a moment for reflection. Also,\nthe undergoing may be valued without any perception of meaning. A\nbalance is required between doing and undergoing to achieve\nan experience. \nDewey does not separate artistic practice from intellect. Intelligence\nis what perceives the relation between doing and undergoing. The\nartist thinks as intently as the scientist. Thus, thinking should not\nbe identified with using mathematical or verbal symbols. The artist\nmust respond intelligently to every brush stroke to know where she is\ngoing. She must see each element in the creative process in relation\nto the whole to be produced. The quality of her art depends on the\nintelligence she brings to bear. \nDewey believed it unfortunate that no term covers the act of\nproduction and the act of appreciation combined as one thing.\nPerception and enjoyment of art are often seen as having nothing in\ncommon with the creative act. The term “aesthetic” is\nsometimes used to designate the entire field and sometimes just the\nperceptual side. Once we see conscious experience as “doing and\nundergoing” we can see the connection between the productive and\nappreciative aspects of art. “Art” denotes the process of\nmaking something out of physical material that can be perceived by one\nof the senses. “Aesthetic” refers to experience as both\nappreciative and perceptive. It is the side of the consumer. And yet,\nproduction and consumption should not be seen as separate. Perfection\nof production is in terms of the enjoyment of the consumer: it is not\na mere matter of technique or execution. Craftsmanship is only\nartistic if it cares deeply about the subject matter and is\ndirected towards enjoyed perception. \nDewey believed that art brings together the same doing/undergoing\nrelation that makes an experience what it is. Something is\nartistic when the qualities of the result control the process of\nproduction. That the aesthetic experience is connected with the\nexperience of making can be seen in the fact that if we believed a\nproduct to be of some primitive people, and then discovered that it\nwas a product of nature, it would be perceived differently. Aesthetic\nsatisfaction must be linked to the activity that gave rise to it. For\nexample the taste of the epicure includes qualities that depend on\nreference to the manner of production of the thing enjoyed. \nThe process of artistic production is involved from the start with\nperception. It entails sensitive awareness of the evolving object and\nits aesthetic qualities. The artist ends the process when she\nperceives directly that the product is good. The sensitivity of the\nartist directs the continuous shaping and reshaping of the work. In\nthe creative process, hand and eye are intimately connected. Both act\nas instruments of the live creature as a whole. When the potter's\nactions for example are regulated by a series of perceptions, the bowl\nis graceful. \nThe product is aesthetic only if the doing and undergoing are related\nto form a perceptual whole. This occurs in imagination as well as in\nobservation. The artist must build up a coherent experience\ncontinuously through constant change. Even when an author writes down\nwhat she had already clearly conceived her work is not private: art is\nmade for public consumption. Similarly, the architect must think in\nthe medium. Even here, doings and perceptions interact and mutually\naffect each other in imagination. \nThe activities of the perceiver are comparable to those of the\ncreator. Reception that is full perception, and not mere recognition,\nis a series of responsive acts resulting in fulfillment. In\nperception, consciousness becomes alive. Consciousness requires\nimplicit involvement of motor response throughout the organism, which\nentails that the scene perceived be pervaded by emotion. Although this\nphase of experience involves surrender, this can only be done through\ncontrolled activity, not withdrawal. It is a “going-out”\nof energy which is also a “plunging” into the\nsubject-matter. \nWe need apprenticeship to perceive great works of art. Aesthetic\nexperience of art requires a continuous interaction between the total\norganism and the object. The typical guided tour in a museum does not\ninvolve such interaction. In proper appreciation the beholder must\ncreate her own experience in such a way as to include relations\nsimilar to those perceived by the artist. Re-creation is required for\nthe object to be seen as a work of art. The beholder as well\nas the producer selects and simplifies according to her interests,\ngathering details into a whole. \nThe end of art is significant only as an integration of parts.\nDominant in aesthetic experience are the characteristics that cause\nthe experience to be integrated and complete. In integral experience\nthere is a dynamic form that involves growth. This form has three\nstages: inception, development, and fulfillment. Aesthetic experience\nconverts resistances into movement towards a close. Experiencing is a\nrhythm of intake and outgiving between which there are pauses each of\nwhich, in turn, incorporates within itself the prior doing. Thus the\nform of the whole is in each part. The consummation phase of\nexperience is not merely located at the end. For an artist is engaged\nin completing her work at every stage of the process. And this\ninvolves summing up what has gone before. \nDewey's theory of creativity is developed within the context of a\ntheory of expressive acts (Dewey 1934, Chapter 4). Leo Tolstoy had\nfeatured expression in his theory of art and there are some\nsimilarities between Dewey's handling and his. However Dewey begins\nfrom a naturalist standpoint. His first move is to claim that every\nexperience begins as an impulsion. “Impulsion,” as\ndistinguished from “impulse,” is a developmental movement\nof the whole organism in response to a need arising from\ninteraction with the environment, for example a craving for food. It\nis the beginning stage of a complete experience, whereas impulse is\nmomentary, for example a tongue reacting to a sour taste. \nFor Dewey, the epidermis is only superficially the limit of the body.\nIn fact, various external things belong to, and are needed by, the\nbody. This includes not only such things as food and air, but tools\nand other aspects of human culture. In short, the self depends on its\nenvironment for its survival, and must secure its materials through\nforays into the world. Because of this, the initial impulsion meets\nthings that oppose it. The self must convert these obstacles into\nsomething useful, thus transforming its blind efforts into purpose and\nmeaning. \nImpulsion becomes aware of itself only through overcoming obstacles.\nWhen resistance generates curiosity and is overcome, the result is\nelation. Emotion is then converted into both interest and reflective\naction through assimilating meanings from the past. In this\nre-creative act the impulsion gains form and solidity, and old\nmaterial is given new life. What would otherwise be either a smooth\npassageway or an obstruction becomes a medium for creativity. \nNot all outward activity is expression. Dewey insists that someone who\nsimply acts angrily is not expressing anger. What may seem\nexpressive to an outside observer because it tells us something about\nthe state of the person observed may not be expressive from the\nstandpoint of the subject. Mere “giving way” to impulsion\ndoes not constitute expression. Expression requires clarification,\nwhich for Dewey means an ordering of impulsion by way of incorporating\nvalues of prior experiences. Although emotional discharge is necessary\nfor expression, it is not sufficient. To discharge is to get rid of,\nwhereas to express is to carry to completion. \nA baby learns that it gains attention when it cries. As it becomes\naware of the meaning of its actions it performs those previously blind\nacts on purpose. In this way, consequences are incorporated\nas the meaning of future doings. The baby is then capable of\nexpression. Primitively spontaneous acts, for example smiles, are\nthereby converted into means of rich human intercourse. Similarly, the\nart of painting uses paint to express imaginative experience. \nDewey stresses that expression and art require material used as media.\nAn intrinsic connection exists between medium and the act of\nexpression. Tones only express emotion, and hence are musical, when\nthey occur in a medium of other tones, as when they are ordered in a\nmelody. “Expression” etymologically refers to a squeezing\nout. Yet, even the expression of wine from a wine press is not a mere\ndischarge. It involves interaction between wine press and grapes to\ntransform primitive material into something expressed. The work of art\ninvolves a building of experience out of interaction of various\nconditions and energies in which the thing expressed is wrung from the\nproducer. \nFor Dewey, the act of expression is a construction in time. It is a\nprolonged interaction of self and objective conditions that gives form\nand order to both. The author only comes to recognize what he/she set\nout to do with raw materials at the end of a process that began with\nexcitement about the subject matter. That excitement in turn stirs up\nmeanings based on prior experience. These, finally, enter a conscious\nstage. The fire of inspiration results in either painful disruption or\nthe creation of a refined product in expressive action. \nDewey observes that inspiration has often been attributed to a muse or\ngod because it is based on unconscious sources. It involves inner\nmaterial finding objective fuel to burn. The act of expression brings\nto completion the act of inspiration by means of this material. For an\nimpulsion to lead to expression there must be conflict, a place where\ninner impulse meets the environment. The tribal war dance for example\nrequires the uncertainty of an impending raid for its excitement. The\nemotion is not complete in itself within the individual: it is about\nsomething objective. Thus, emotion is implied in a situation, for\nexample a situation may be depressing or threatening. \nIn the fifth chapter Dewey turns to the expressive object. He believes\nthat the object should not be seen in isolation from the process that\nproduced it, nor from the individuality of vision from which it came.\nTheories which simply focus on the expressive object dwell on how the\nobject represents other objects and ignore the individual contribution\nof the artist. Conversely, theories that simply focus on the act of\nexpressing tend to see expression merely in terms of personal\ndischarge. \nWorks of art use materials that come from a public world, and they\nawaken new perceptions of the meanings of that world, connecting the\nuniversal and the individual organically. The work of art is\nrepresentative, not in the sense of literal reproduction, which would\nexclude the personal, but in that it tells people about the nature of\ntheir experience. \nDewey observes that some who have denied art meaning have done so on\nthe assumption that art does not have connection with outside content.\nHe agrees that art has a unique quality, but argues that this is based\non its concentrating meaning found in the world. For Dewey, the actual\nTintern Abbey expresses itself in Wordsworth's poem about it and a\ncity expresses itself in its celebrations. In this, he is quite\ndifferent from those theorists who believe that art expresses the\ninner emotions of the artist. The difference between art and science\nis that art expresses meanings, whereas science states them. A\nstatement gives us directions for obtaining an experience, but does\nnot supply us with experience. That water is H20\ntells us how to obtain or test for water. If science expressed the\ninner nature of things it would be in competition with art, but it\ndoes not. Aesthetic art, by contrast to science, constitutes\nan experience. \nA poem operates in the dimension of direct experience, not of\ndescription or propositional logic. The expressiveness of a painting\nis the painting itself. The meaning is there beyond the painter's\nprivate experience or that of the viewer. A painting by Van Gogh of a\nbridge is not representative of a bridge or even of Van Gogh's\nemotion. Rather, by means of pictorial presentation, Van Gogh presents\nthe viewer with a new object in which emotion and external scene are\nfused. He selects material with a view to expression, and the picture\nis expressive to the degree that he succeeds. \nDewey notes that formalist art critic Roger Fry spoke of relations of\nlines and colors coming to be full of passionate meaning within the\nartist. For Fry the object as such tends to disappear in the whole of\nvision. Dewey agrees with the first point and with the idea that\ncreative representation is not of natural items as they literally\nhappen. He adds however that the painter approaches the scene with\nemotion-laden background experiences. The lines and colors of the\npainter's work crystallize into a specific harmony or rhythm which is\na function also of the scene in its interaction with the beholder.\nThis passion in developing a new form is the aesthetic emotion. The\nprior emotion is not forgotten but fused with the emotion belonging to\nthe new vision. \nDewey, then, opposes the idea that the meanings of the lines and\ncolors in a painting would completely replace other meanings attached\nto the scene. He also rejects the notion that the work of art only\nexpresses something exclusive to art. The theory that subject-matter\nis irrelevant to art commits its advocates to seeing art as esoteric.\nTo distinguish between aesthetic values of ordinary experience\n(connected with subject-matter) and aesthetic values of art, as Fry\nwished, is impossible. There would be nothing for the artist to be\npassionate about if she approached the subject matter without\ninterests and attitudes. The artist first brings meaning and value\nfrom earlier experience to her observation giving the object its\nexpressiveness. The result is a completely new object of a completely\nnew experience. \nFor Dewey, an artwork clarifies and purifies confused meaning of prior\nexperience. By contrast, a non-art drawing that simply suggests\nemotions through arrangements of lines and colors is similar to a\nsignboard that indicates but does not contain meaning: it is only\nenjoyed because of what they remind us of. Also, whereas a statement\nor a diagram takes us to many things of the same kind, an expressive\nobject is individualized, for example in expressing a particular\ndepression. \nChapter Six begins with a discussion of medium. Dewey asserts that\nthere are many languages of art, each specific to the medium. He\nbelieves that meanings expressed in art cannot be translated into\nwords. Moreover, language requires not only speakers but listeners.\nThus, in art, the work is not complete until it is experienced by\nsomeone other than the artist. Artist, work and audience form a triad,\nfor even when the artist works in isolation she is herself vicariously\nthe audience. \nLanguage involves both what is said and how it is said: substance and\nform. The artist's creative effort is in forming the material so that\nit is the authentic substance of a work of art. If art were mere\nself-expression, substance and form would fall apart. Still,\nself-expression is important. Without it, the work would lose\nfreshness and originality, and although the material out of which the\nwork is made comes from the public world the manner of its making is\nindividual. \nDewey holds that someone who perceives a work aesthetically will\ncreate an experience in which the subject is new. A poem is a\nsuccession of experiences, and no two readers have the same\nexperience. Indeed each reader creates his or her own poem out of the\nsame raw material. The work of art is only actually such when it lives\nin a person's experience. As physical object, the work remains\nidentical, but as work of art, it is recreated. It would be absurd to\nask the artist what she meant by her work, for she would find\ndifferent meanings in it at different times. What the artist means in\na work, then, is whatever the perceiver can get out of it that is\nliving. This does not mean that any interpretation is as good as any\nother, as will be seen when we discuss Dewey's chapter on\ncriticism. \nIn philosophy, “relation” generally refers to something\nintellectual that subsists in propositions. But, as Dewey observes in\nhis seventh chapter, it refers in everyday discourse to something\ndirect and active. It leads us to think of the clashings and unitings\nof things, of modes of interaction. For Dewey, the relation that\ncharacterizes a work of art is mutual adaptation of the parts to\nconstitute the whole. This is also true for the aesthetic experience\nof a city. A person who aesthetically perceives New York from a ferry\nwould see the buildings as colorful volumes in relation to each\nanother and to the sky and river. The focus would be on a perceptual\nwhole made up of related parts, the values of each part modifying and\nmodified by the values of the other parts. \nReturning to art, Dewey notes that Matisse describes the process of\npainting in terms of putting down patches of color, which then lose\nimportance as other patches are put down, so that the different colors\nneed to be balanced. Similarly, a homeowner furnishes a room by\ninterrelating the parts in perception. In general, perception consists\nin a sequence of acts that build up on one another to achieve unity of\nform. Art only does this more deliberately than ordinary perception.\nWithin art, form is the working of forces that carry an experience of\nsome thing to fulfillment. Thus, form needs to be appropriate to the\nsubject matter. \nFor fulfillment or consummation there must be a process of building up\nvalues. This requires conserving the meaning of what has preceded.\nThere must also be anticipation of the future in each aspect or phase\nof the process. Consummation is, then, relative. Dewey concludes from\nhis discussion up to this point that continuity, cumulation,\nconservation, tension and anticipation are the conditions of aesthetic\nform. \nSince resistance or tension is needed for development, intelligence in\nart-making consists in overcoming difficulties. The perceiver\nalso needs to solve problems in order to better appreciate\nthe work. He or she must remake past experiences so that they may\nenter into the new one. Rigidly pre-determined products, by contrast,\nare academic. A true artist cares about the end product as the\ncompletion of what went before, not as something conforming to a prior\nplan. \nDewey believed that the beauty of fine art involves some strangeness\nor discovery that keeps it from being mechanical. This allows us to\nexperience the thing for its own sake. Unlike mechanical production,\nin artistic production the consummatory phase recurs throughout the\nwork. Thus the work is both instrumental and final. Art is\ninstrumental not in serving narrow purposes but in giving us a\nrefreshed attitude about ordinary experience and contributing to an\nenduring sense of serenity. \nWe admire skill as enhanced expression belonging to the\nproduct and not merely to the producer. Dewey\nbelieved that technique that emphasizes the artist is obtrusive\ninsofar as it does not carry the object to consummation. Properly,\ntechnique is the skill of managing the making of form. Advances in\ntechnique come from solving problems that grow out of our need for new\nmodes of experience. Historically, Dewey observes, three-dimensional\npainting was motivated by the need for something more than depiction\nof religious scenes. For example, the Venetian painters' use of color\nfor sculptural effect arose from the secularization of values which\nwas characteristic of their time. In general, a new technique passes\nthrough three stages: experimentation and exaggeration, incorporation\nand validation, and imitation and academicism. \nDewey asserts that new materials demand new techniques, and the artist\nis a born experimenter. Through experimentation, the artist opens up\nnew areas, or reveals new qualities in the familiar. What is now\nclassic is the result of previous adventure, which is why we still\nfind adventure in the classics. \nThere is in aesthetic experience a rhythm of surrender and reflection.\nWe interrupt the surrender aspect to attend to the above-mentioned\nformal conditions. The first, pre-analytic, phase of aesthetic\nexperience is one of overwhelming impression. We might, for example,\nbe seized by the glory of a landscape or by the magic of a painting.\nThis seizure is at a high level only to the extent that the viewer is\ncultivated. Like Hume, Dewey holds that cultivation comes through\npractice in discrimination. However he also sees aesthetic experience\nin terms of phases. In this mode, the seizure phase is followed by the\ndiscrimination phase, which can either affirm the object's value or\nconvince us that it was not worthy of our initial response.\nThis phase can, in turn, expand into criticism. \nDewey believed that there is objectivity in art evaluation based on\nseveral factors. First, works of art are parts of the objective world\nand are conditioned by materials and energies of that world. Second,\nfor an object to be the content of aesthetic experience it must\nsatisfy objective conditions which belong to that world. This is why\nthe artist shows interest in the world, and in her materials. \nThe first and most important of these objective conditions is rhythm.\nRhythm already exists in nature. The rhythms of dawn and sunset, rain\nand shine, the seasons, the movements of the moon and the stars,\nreproduction and death, waking and sleeping, heartbeat and breath, and\nthe rhythms involved in working with materials, were all seen by early\nmen as having mysterious meaning related to their survival. Even more\nsignificant were the rhythms involved with preparing for war and for\nplanting. Dramatic events also led men to impose or introduce rhythms\nthat were not previously there. \nReproducing the rhythms of nature generated a sense of drama in life.\nThe essences of animals were brought to life in the rhythms of dance,\nsculpture and painting. Combining the formative arts and the rhythms\nof voice and dance led to fine art. Man came to use the rhythms of\nnature to celebrate his relationship with nature and to commemorate\nhis most intense experiences. At first no distinction was made between\nart and science in the reproduction of these changes. For example, the\nfirst Greek stories about the origins of nature had aesthetic form,\nand the idea of natural law came from the idea of harmony. \nFor Dewey, every regular change in nature is a rhythm. Science\nprogresses as we refine our understanding of these changes. Science,\nhowever, parts ways with art when it presents rhythms through symbols\nthat mean nothing to perception. Nonetheless, even today science and\nart have a common interest in rhythm. Man uses rhythms to commemorate\nhis most intense experiences. The rhythms of art are grounded in the\nbasic patterns of the relation of live creature and its\nenvironment. \nThe art product is physical and potential, whereas the work of art is\nactive and experienced. It is what the product does. Dewey gives his\ndefinition of art in this, the eighth chapter Art as\nExperience. (Casey Haskins (1998) makes a case, however, for\nDewey's definition of art being found in the chapter titled “The\nVaried Substance of the Arts.”) Contrary to many interpreters,\nhe neither claims that art is identical to expression or to\nexperience. Moreover, like Nelson Goodman later (1978), he asks\n“when is art?” rather than “what is art?” For\nDewey, a work of art happens when the structure of the object\ninteracts with the energies of the subject's experience to generate a\nsubstance that develops cumulatively towards fulfillment of\nimpulsions. To fully understand this definition we must understand the\nrole of rhythm in art. Only when rhythm incorporated into the external\nobject is experienced is it aesthetic. Since rhythm is a\nmatter of perception, not of mere regularity, it includes what is\ncontributed by the self. \nIt is often thought that there are two kinds of art, spatial and\ntemporal, and that only the latter can have rhythm. But, Dewey argues,\nperception of rhythm in pictures and sculpture is as essential to\ntheir experience as that of music. Rhythm is a matter of bringing\nabout a complete and consummatory experience. The theory that rhythm\nis literal recurrence, what Dewey calls the tick-tock theory, sees it\nas merely mechanical. Yet, constant variation is as important to\nrhythm as is order. Indeed, more variation produces more interesting\neffects, provided that order is maintained and there is progress\ntowards fulfillment. \nDewey explicates this point through analyzing some lines from\nWordsworth's Prelude. He notes that no one word in this poem\nhas the meaning we would find in a dictionary. Rather, the meaning is\na function of the situation expressed. He also believes that an\nindividual experience, in this case a feeling of desolation, is\nconstantly built as the poem develops. The meaning of each word both\ndetermines, and is determined by, this developing experience. By\ncontrast, a popular gospel hymn is relatively external, physical, and\nuniform in both matter and form, although even here the process is\ncumulative. Although rhythm requires recurrence, recurrence is not the\nsame as literal repetition, for it involves relationships that both\nsum up and also carry forward. These relationships define parts, give\nthem individuality, and connect them to the whole. \nAnother theory of rhythm, the “tom-tom theory,” sees it as\na matter of repetition of beats. On this view, variation comes merely\nfrom the piling up of such uniform rhythms. The theory, Dewey\nbelieves, is based on a misunderstanding of tribal music in which it\nis forgotten that such rhythms usually occur in the context of singing\nand dance and involve development to greater levels of excitement.\nAlso, tribal rhythms are more complex and subtle than those of western\nmusic with its emphasis on harmony. \nWhat subject-matter is appropriate to art? Reynolds in the 18th\ncentury thought that only instances of heroic action and suffering\nwould count. However in the 19th century such ordinary topics of\neveryday life as railway-coaches and plates became the subject-matter\nof painting. The same democratic widening of subject-matter occurred\nin the other arts. In general, one of art's functions is to question\nthe limitations of subject-matter set by convention and moralism. The\nonly limitation set is by the interest of the artist. However,\nuniversality and originality in art depends on the artist's interest\nbeing sincere. Whatever narrows the permitted subject-matter of art\nnarrows the artist's ability to be sincere and hinders his or her\nimagination. This happens for example when the artist is required to\nwork on proletarian subject-matter, as in the Soviet Union. All of\nthis diversity suggests that there is some common substance to the\narts. But to say that this common substances is form is to arbitrarily\nseparate form and matter. \nNot only is there community of form in the arts but also community of\nsubstance, which is the topic of Dewey's ninth chapter. The creative\nprocess begins with a “total seizure,” an inclusive\nqualitative whole (a “mood”) which is then articulated,\nand even continues after articulation. This qualitative whole\ndetermines the development of a poem into parts, and when this does\nnot happen we become aware of breaks. \nThis element, which he also refers to as a “penetrating\nquality,” is immediately experienced in all parts of the work.\nYet it cannot be described, or even specified. It is so pervasive we\ntake it for granted. It is an emotionally intuited fusion of the\ndifferent elements of the work— without it, the parts would only\nbe mechanically related. The organic whole is the parts permeated by\nit. It may be called the spirit of the work. It is also the work's\n“reality” in that it makes us experience the work\nas real. It is the background that qualifies everything in\nthe foreground. \nFor Dewey, this background extends surprisingly far. Although we may\nassume that experiences have bounded edges like those of their\nobjects, the whole of an experience, and especially its qualitative\nbackground, which he calls “the setting,” extends\nindefinitely. By “setting,” Dewey simply means the\nbackground aspect of the experience, that which is not focused in the\nexperience. The margins of our experience shade into that indefinite\nexpanse we call the universe. However, this experiential background is\nonly made conscious in the specific objects that form the focus.\nBehind every explicit object there is something implicit that,\nalthough we call it vague, is not so in the original experience, for\nit is a function of the whole situation. An experience is mystical,\nDewey believes, to the extent that this feeling of an unlimited\nbackground is intense, and it is particularly intense in certain works\nof art, for example in tragedy. Symbolist poets stress it when they\nsay that a work of art must include something not understood.  \nThat the pervasive quality binds together the various elements of the\nwork is shown by the fact that we constantly see things immediately as\nbelonging to a work or not. That art enhances the pervasive quality\nexplains why we experience increased clarity in front of any work of\nart we experience intensely, and why we experience religious feelings\nin connection with aesthetic intensity. This sense of a world beyond\nus gives us an expanded sense of self and a feeling of unity. However,\nDewey is not making a metaphysical claim here: although he is speaking\nof an intuition it is not of the Absolute but of a deeper dimension of\nordinary reality as experienced. \nEvery work of art uses a medium associated with different organs. Art\nintensifies the significance of the fact that our experience is\nmediated through these organs. In painting, color gives us a scene\nwithout mixture of the other senses. Color must then carry the\nqualities given by the other senses, thus enhancing its\nexpressiveness. There is something magical in the power of flat\npictures to depict a diverse universe, as also in the power of mere\nsounds to express events. In art media all the possibilities of a\nspecialized organ of perception are exploited. Seeing, for example,\noperates with “full energy” in the medium of paint. Medium\nis “taken up” into it and remains within the result. \nAesthetic effects necessarily attach to their medium. When another\nmedium is substituted, as in boards painted to look like stone, the\nresult looks fake. When means and ends are external to each other the\nexperience is non-aesthetic. This also applies to ethics when\nconsidered from the standpoint of aesthetics. For example, being good\nto avoid punishment has no aesthetic value. The Greeks recognized that\ngood conduct has grace and proportion, fusing means and ends. \nSensitivity to a medium is essential both to artistic creation and\naesthetic perception. Thus Dewey, like Clive Bell before him (Bell\n1914), warns us away from looking at paintings as illustrations. Nor\nare we to look at them in terms of technique. Both approaches involve\nseparation of means and ends. The medium mediates between the artist\nand the perceiver. The artist, unlike the ordinary person, is able to\ntransform material into medium. Non-artists, by contrast, require many\nmaterials to express themselves, and the results of their efforts are\noften confused. \nIn his tenth chapter Dewey insists that art is the quality of a thing\nand is thus adjectival. To say that tennis is an art is to say that\nthere is art in tennis. The product is not the work of art, rather the\nwork is the enjoyed experience of a human. Since art does not denote\nobjects it is not divided into different classes. It is simply an\nactivity that is differentiated based on the medium used. Artists are\nconcerned with qualities, and qualities are concrete and particular.\nFor a painter, there are no two reds because each is influenced by its\ncontext. \nDewey is critical of various classifications of the arts, for instance\nthat between higher and lower sense organs, or between the arts of\nspace and time, or between representative and non-representative art.\nHe also has problems with rigid classification and definition in terms\nof genus and species when it comes to aesthetics. The idea of fixed\nclasses is associated with the idea of fixed rules which Dewey also\nrejects. Classification limits perception and inhibits creativity. As\na consequence, Dewey spends much time in this chapter discussing\nspecific differences between the various fine art media which will not\nbe surveyed here. \nIn his eleventh chapter Dewey expresses a wish to overcome what he\nbelieves to be false and antiquated psychological theories that hinder\naesthetic understanding. For example, he denies the Lockean view that\nthe undergoings of the self are mere impressions stamped on wax.\nExperience is neither merely physical nor merely mental. Rather,\nthings and events of the world are transformed in the context of the\nlive creature, and the creature itself is transformed through this\ninteraction. Contrary theories hold that experience happens\nexclusively within the mind, fragmenting the self into sense, feeling,\nand desire. However, these are actually only different aspects of the\ninteraction of self and environment. The separation, for example,\nbetween intellectual and sensual aspects of the soul is based rather\non differences in social class. Dewey believed that badly ordered\nsocieties exaggerate these distinctions, which is the business of art\nto overcome. \nTheories that assume that aesthetic quality is projected onto the\naesthetic object, for example Santayana's idea that art is objectified\npleasure, exemplify this separation. Although the separation of self\nand object has practical importance in everyday life it dissolves in\naesthetic experience. Dewey opposes the idea, set forth by I. A.\nRichards, that a painting causes certain effects in us. Rather, a\npainting is a total effect arising from the interaction of live\ncreature and such external factors as pigment and light. Its beauty is\na part of that effect. Dewey also criticizes Kant's reduction of\nattentive observation to mere contemplation and his reduction of the\nemotional element of the aesthetic to pleasure taken in contemplation.\nThe problem with Kant is that he drew distinctions and then made them\ninto compartmental divisions, thus separating the aesthetic from other\nmodes of experience. His notion of pure feeling led to beauty being\nseen as remote from desire and action. Dewey, by contrast, sees\naesthetic experience as incorporation of desire and thought into the\nperceptual. \nThe pleasure taken in reading a poem is not in the contemplation but\nin fulfillment of tendencies in the subject perceived. As opposed to\ntraditional psychology, Dewey holds that impulsion comes first,\nfollowed by sensation. The presence of intense sensuous qualities\nshows the presence of impulsion. Aesthetic appreciation has balance\nwhen many impulses are involved. Aesthetic experience may only be said\nto be disinterested if this means that it contains no specialized\ninterest. \nFor Dewey, imagination is not a self-contained faculty but a quality\nthat pervades all making and observation. It is a way of seeing that\nmakes old things new. Following Coleridge, he holds that the\nimagination welds together diverse elements into a new unified\nexperience. Contrary to Coleridge, however, it is not a power. Rather,\nit is something that happens when various materials come together. Nor\nis it simply giving familiar experience a new look, for it only\nhappens when mind and material interpenetrate. The role of imagination\ncan be seen in terms of the dialectic of inner and outer vision in\ncreative making in which inner vision seems at first richer, and then\nouter vision seems to have more energy, although the inner vision\ncontrols the outer. Imagination is the interaction of the two.  \nDewey's twelfth chapter draws implications from his aesthetic theory\nfor philosophy in general. Continuing his discussion of imagination,\nhe holds that all conscious experience has some element of\nimagination, for imagination is conscious adjustment of the new and\nthe old. Yet all imaginative experience is not the same. Art is\ndistinguished from reverie and dream in that the meanings of art are\nembodied in material. Aesthetic experience is distinguished from other\nimaginative experience by the fact that the meanings embodied are\nespecially wide and deep. Although scientific inventions are also\nproducts of imagination, works of art do not operate in the realm of\nphysical existence. A work of art concentrates and enlarges immediate\nexperience, directly expressing imaginatively-evoked meaning. It also\nencourages its audience to carry out a similar imaginative act. \nAesthetic experience is a challenge to philosophy because it is free\nto develop as experience. Thus, philosophers must go to\naesthetics to find out what experience is. Moreover, a philosopher's\naesthetic theory will test his or her ability to understand experience\nitself. Aesthetic theories have typically taken a single factor and\nexplained aesthetic experience in terms of it, for example, taking\nimagination as a single element rather than as that which holds all\nthe elements together. The various aesthetic theories may be\nclassified according to which element they emphasize. Dewey believes\nthat each theory imposes preconceived ideas upon the subject matter.\nThe make-believe theory, for example, tends to see the imaginative\nexperience of art in terms of reverie. Although reverie is not absent\nfrom art, there are equally essential elements, especially the element\nof creative control that causes ideas to be embodied in an object. In\nart, the product must be saturated both with the qualities of the\nrepresented object and those of the emotion expressed. \nBecause art often gives us a sense of increased understanding, some\nphilosophers have seen it as a mode of knowledge, sometimes even as\nsuperior to science. There have been many different things suggested\nas what is known through art. This shows that the philosophers\ninvolved were not thinking about art or aesthetic experience. On\nDewey's view, the sense of increased understanding in art comes from\nthe fact that knowledge is transformed both in production and in\nexperience by being merged with non-intellectual elements. Life is\nmade more intelligible by art not through conceptualization but\nthrough clarification and intensification in experience. \nDewey does not reject essences, he simply rejects previous theories of\nthem. He insists that essences exists even though they are not objects\nin the mind. For Dewey, essence appears as the quality of intense\naesthetic experience which is so immediate as to be mystical. But it\nis not to be associated with the ultimate essences of traditional\nmetaphysics. Following ordinary language, Dewey notes that\n“essence” can also mean the “gist” of a thing,\nwhat is indispensable. For Dewey, all artistic expression moves\ntowards organization of meaning that captures essences in this sense.\nAn example of this is the painter Courbet who conveys the essence\nliquidity saturating the landscape. The work of art forms “an\nexperience as an experience” (Dewey 1934, p. 298). The essential\nis the result of art and of artists having expressed essential\nmeanings in perception, and not something that exists prior to\nart. \nDewey then turns to various traditional theories of art. Plato, as he\nnoted earlier, unconsciously borrows his idea of essence from the\narts. When Croce sees essence as the object of intuition and\nidentifies this with expression he is just imposing his prior\nphilosophical speculations on aesthetic experience. Dewey rejects\nCroce's idea that the only real existence is mind and that the work of\nart is a state of mind. (This comment led to Croce's published review\nof Dewey and to the ongoing reception of Dewey's book mentioned in the\nintroduction and elaborated in the last section of this article.)\nSchopenhauer is also dismissed as just a dialectical development of\nKant. Dewey objects specifically to Schopenhauer's ruling charm out of\naesthetic experience and even more to his fixed hierarchies of beauty\nand of the arts. Dewey's main purpose in these attacks is to show that\nphilosophy also involves imagination and that art controls the\nimaginative adventures of philosophy through integrating opposites and\novercoming isolation in thought.  \nDewey's thirteenth chapter addresses the nature of criticism. For\nDewey, judgment is an act of intelligence performed on perception for\nthe purpose of more adequate perception. It is development in the\nmedium of thought of deeply realized experience. He rejects therefore\njudicial criticism in which the verdict is central. Such criticism is\nproduced out a desire for authority on the side of critics, and for\nprotection on the part of the audience. \nDewey holds that there are no infallible touchstones in criticism. In\nfact, it is harmful to think that there are such. This can be seen in\nthe blunders of the judicial critic, for example the attacks on\npostimpressionists in the 1913 Armory show. In general, judicial\ncriticism confuses a particular technique with aesthetic form. This is\nnot to say, however, that judgment is arbitrary. Rather, good judgment\nrequires a rich background, disciplined insight, and the capacity to\ndiscriminate and to unify. Judicial criticism fails because it cannot\nhandle new movements in art which, by their nature, express something\nnew in human experience. \nThe opposite extreme is impressionist criticism, which holds that\njudgment is impossible and that all that is needed is a statement of\nresponse. For Dewey, impressions, i.e., unanalyzed qualitative\neffects, are only the beginnings of judgments. To analyze an\nimpression is to go beyond it to grounds and consequences. Even\ndefining an impression by grounding it in personal history is moving\ntowards judgment. Just as the artist takes objective material from a\ncommon world and transforms it by imaginative vision, so too the\ncritic must attend to objective features of the work he or she is\nstudying. The result is perceptive appreciation that is also\nknowledgeable. \nDewey believes that although there are no standards for critical\njudgment there are criteria of judgment. Previous discussions of the\nrelation of form and matter, and of the role of medium in art, have\naddressed this point. These criteria are not rules but rather means of\ndiscovering what the work of art is as an experience. The\nbusiness of criticism is to deepen experience for others\nthrough re-educating perception. We fully understand the work only\nwhen we go through the same processes the artist went through when\nproducing it, and the critic shares in promoting this process. \nDewey holds that judgment has two main functions: discrimination and\nunification. The first involves understanding of parts, and the second\nleads to understanding how they are related to each other and to the\nwhole. The first is analysis, and the second is synthesis. The two are\ninseparable. The critic gains a capacity for analysis through a\nlong-standing consuming interest in the subject. She should intensely\nlike the subject and also have rich and full experience of\nit, as well a personal intimacy with the tradition of the subject's\nart form. Acquaintance with the masterpieces of the tradition will be\nher touchstone, although they, too, are appreciated only within the\ncontext of that tradition. The critic should also be familiar with an\ninternational variety of traditions, African, Persian, etc.\nLack of such knowledge leads to overestimation of some artists at the\nexpense of others. Since the critic will have knowledge of a wide\nvariety of conditions and materials, she will appreciate a multitude\nof forms and will not praise work simply for technical skill. This\nwide knowledge will also allow for discrimination, and for determining\nthe intent of the artist. The critic should also have knowledge of the\nlogical development of the individual artist's work. \nAs both critics and artists have personal areas of interest, they tend\nto push the unique modes of vision associated with these areas to\ntheir limits. Each mode of vision is associated with a method, and\neach method has its own failing: for example symbolism can become\nunintelligible, and abstract art can become a mere scientific\nexercise. Each tendency succeeds, Dewey believes, when matter and form\nachieve equilibrium. The critic fails when she thinks that her own\ntendency is the only legitimate one. \nFor Dewey, the synthetic or unifying phase of judgment involves the\ninsight of the critic. There are no rules in the synthetic phase, for\nthis aspect of criticism is an art. Parts should be seen in terms of\ntheir role within the larger integral whole. The critic must discover\nsome “unifying strand” in the work, one that is not simply\nimposed on the work. There can be many unifying ideas in a work of\nart, but the theme and the design described by the critic must be\nreally present throughout. \nDanger in criticism includes reduction of an entire work to an\nisolated element, for example looking at technique apart from form.\nAlso, although one should take into account cultural milieus, it is\ndangerous to reduce works to economic, political, sociological, or\npsychoanalytic terms. Certain factors may be relevant to the biography\nof the artist but not to understanding the work itself. In short, (and\nanticipating Monroe Beardsley) Dewey believes that the aesthetic merit\nof a work is within the work, and extraneous material should\nnot substitute for understanding the work itself. \nNor is there any value in judging art by the philosophical position\npresented. If one valued Milton for this reason one would have to\nreject Dante, Lucretius and Goethe, each of whom presents a different\nphilosophy. Confusion comes from neglecting significance of the\nmedium. The material of science, philosophy, and the arts is the same:\nthe live creature and its environment. However, whereas science uses\nits medium to control and predict, art uses its medium to enhance\nexperience. Dewey, in opposition to Santayana, admired Shakespeare for\nholding that nature offers many meanings. The value of experience is\ngreatest in its ability to reveal many ideals, and the value of ideals\nis in the experiences they generate. \nDewey also favors poet Robert Browning's view of the relation between\nthe individual and the universal. Nature manifests continuity, i.e.,\nendurance through change. The critic must be sensitive to the signs of\nchange. Although the critic is an individual and hence has his or her\nown bias, he should transform this bias into a means of sensitive\nperception and insight while not allowing it to harden. He should also\nrecognize that there are a multitude of other qualities in the world\nworthy of art. He may then help others to have a fuller appreciation\nof the objective properties of artworks. Critical judgment depends on\ndeepening the perception of others. Its business is not to evaluate\nbut to re-educate perception, the perfection of perception being the\nmoral purpose of art. We only fully understand the meaning of a work\nwhen we have gone through the processes the artist went through, and\nthe critic promotes this experience.  \nDewey's last chapter addresses the large issue of art and\ncivilization. He begins by noting that communication is the foundation\nof all activities that involve “internal” union between\nhuman beings. Many relations between persons, for example between\ninvestors and laborers, are “external” and mechanical, and\nhence not really communication. Art is a universal mode of language.\nIt is not affected by the accidents of history in the way that speech\nis. Music for example can bring people together in loyalty and\ninspiration. Although each culture is held together by its own\nindividuality, it is still possible to create continuity and community\nbetween cultures as long as one does not try to reduce one to the\nother. One can expand experience to absorb the attitudes and values of\nother cultures. Friendship is, on a smaller scale, a solution to the\nsame problem, for it comes from sympathy through imagination. We\nunderstand others when their desires and aims expand us. To civilize\nis to instruct others in life, and this requires communication of\nvalues by way of imagination. The arts aid individuals in achieving\nthis. \nHowever Dewey believed that today the arts fail to organically connect\nwith other aspects of culture, especially science and industry. The\nisolation of art is one manifestation of the incoherence of our\nsociety. Science gives us a new conception of the physical world. But\nwe also hold a conception of the world which we inherited from older\nmoral and religious traditions. Thus, the moral and physical worlds\nare separated, resulting in philosophical dualism. Recovering an\norganic place for the arts in our society is closely tied to this\nproblem. \nDewey believed that as the scientific method has not yet become a\nnatural part of experience its impact will continue to be both\nexternal and disintegrating. Yet although science strips things of\ntheir value, the world in which art operates remains the same. Thus\nthe death of art is not imminent. Moreover, science shows that man is\na part of nature. This helps man to recognize that his ideas are the\nresult of nature within. Also, resistance and conflict contribute to\nart. So, when science discloses such resistance, it promotes art, as\nit does when it arouses curiosity, enlivens observation, and gives us\nrespect for experience. A new unity would come with integration of\nscience into the cultural whole. \nDewey observes that the separation between fine art and useful art,\nalthough it goes back to the Greeks, is intensified today by mass\nproduction and the greater importance of industry and trade.\nProduction of goods is now mechanical, and this is opposed to the\naesthetic. Still, integration of art in civilization is not\nimpossible. Although well-constructed objects have form, the aesthetic\ncomes only when external form fits our larger experience. If the parts\nare efficiently related, as in a well-constructed machine, the result\nis aesthetically favorable. Dewey was a fan of aesthetics of modernist\ndesign. He believed that recent commercial products have improved form\nand color, train cars are no longer overloaded with silly ornament,\nand apartment interiors are better adapted to our needs. Although he\nadmits that factories and slums mar the landscape, he observes that\nthe human eye is adapting to the shapes and colors of urban life. Even\nobjects in the natural landscape are perceived in terms of these new\nforms. But, given that the human organism needs satisfaction through\nthe various organs, the surroundings that have resulted from\nindustrialism are less fulfilling than previously . \nDewey believes that the trouble is with the economic system. The\nproblem cannot be resolved merely through increased wages or reduced\nwork hours. Increasing leisure hours only reinforces the dualism of\nlabor and leisure. A radical social change which would allow for more\nworker participation in the production and distribution of products is\nthe only thing that would improve the quality of experience. Increased\nsense of freedom and increased control in the processes of production\nwould give the worker an intimate interest and hence aesthetic\nsatisfaction in his work. Nothing about machine production per\nse makes worker satisfaction impossible. It is private control of\nforces of production for private gain that impoverishes our lives.\nWhen art is merely the “beauty parlor of civilization,”\nboth art and civilization are insecure. We can only organize the\nproletariat into the social system via a revolution that affects the\nimagination and emotions of man. Art is not secure until the\nproletariat are free in their productive activity and until they can\nenjoy the fruits of their labor. To do this, the material of art\nshould be drawn from all sources, and art should be accessible to\nall. \nAlthough this view is similar to Marxist theory Dewey does not favor\nreducing art to propaganda. Indeed, he asserts that theories that see\nart as directly moral ultimately fail because they see it in terms of\nhow we personally relate to selected works. They fail to look at the\nlarger context of civilization. Poetry criticizes not directly but by\nmeans of an imaginative vision of an alternate reality. Art instructs\nby way of communicating, but we need to understand such instruction as\nincluding imagination. Moral action depends on being able to\nimaginatively put oneself into another's shoes and art encourages\nthis. Indeed, art is more moral than morality, for morality tends to\nbe bogged down in convention, unless it is the product of moral\nprophets, who have always been poets. If art were to be recognized as\ngoing beyond idle pleasure or luxurious display, and morals were seen\nas a matter of shared values, then the problem of their relation would\nbe resolved. Art is morally powerful because it is indifferent to\nmoral praise and blame. Dewey agrees with Shelley that morals require\ngoing out of ourselves and identifying with the beautiful. The union\nof the possible and the actual in art is continued in the moral\nrealm. \nDewey's ideas on aesthetics and arts have been frequently both\ncriticized and defended over the seventy-five years following the\npublication of Art as Experience. These will be reviewed in\ntheir order of appearance. Vivas (1937) argues that Dewey holds two\ntheories about the emotions' role in aesthetic experience, one that\nthe esthetic object arouses emotion in the spectator, and the other\nthat the content of meaning of art, objectively speaking, is emotion.\nBut, he argues, experimental aesthetics has shown that emotion is an\naccidental consequence of aesthetic apprehension, and so should not be\nincluded in its definition. The same aesthetic object can arouse\ndifferent emotional reactions in different spectators. Some trained\npersons in music even deny that adequate aesthetic experience involves\nemotion. Dewey also has not given an explanation of the means by which\nthe object expresses emotion. Vivas himself defines aesthetic\nexperience in terms of rapt attention involving apprehension of the\nobject's immanent meanings. \nIn a second article (Vivas 1938), he asks: Are emotions attached to\nthe material? How is this consistent with the idea that emotion is not\nexpressed in the object? And how are these ideas consistent with the\nidea that emotion is aroused in the spectator? Vivas insists that not\nall art arouses emotion in everyone who has effective intercourse with\nit. Music, for sophisticated listeners, is often not suggestive of\nemotions. When we find “sadness” in music we would do\nbetter to call it an objective character of the music than an emotion.\nAnother problem for Dewey: if the self disappears in experience then\nhow can the object arouse emotion in the self or have emotion attached\nto it? Also, if the self disappears into harmony, how can there be the\nkind of disharmony associated with emotion? \nI have already mentioned Pepper's objection that Dewey's theory is not\nsufficiently pragmatic (Pepper 1939). His specific objection is that\nDewey's views were eclectic, incorporating elements both of pragmatism\nand of Hegelian organicism. Pepper believes that both theories, as\nwell as formalism, can be valuable when taken separately, but that the\nmixture in Dewey hurts pragmatism. Pepper identified organicism with\nthe view that the ultimate reality is The Absolute. Dewey replied\n(1939b) that he had based his aesthetic theory on examination of the\nsubject-matter and not on any a priori theory. Words he used,\nsuch as “coherence,” “whole,”\n“integration,” and “complete,” were intended\nto have meaning consistent with his pragmatic empiricism and did not\nby themselves indicate a commitment to idealism. Moreover, it was one\nof his main points that although these terms were applicable\nto aesthetic matters they could not, contra the idealists, be extended\nto the world as a whole. The terms had a special sense applying only\nto experiences as aesthetic. Dewey rejected any theory of a great\ncosmic harmony associated with the Hegelian notion of the\nAbsolute. \nIn a later work, Pepper (1945) agrees with Dewey that each reading of\na poem brings a new experience, but thinks that, since there is also\nidentity of context that can make the differences minor, we can speak\nof an identical quality running through the different situations.\nPepper has many positive things to say about Dewey's\n“contextualism” (his word for pragmatism in aesthetics),\nbut he insists that there is much more permanence of aesthetic values\nin the world than Dewey would admit. A great work of art may be\nappreciated as long as the physical work exists and someone exists to\nperceive it, and insofar as it appeals to common instincts, it may\nappeal to people of varied cultures. \nThe Italian philosopher and aesthetician Benedetto Croce read Dewey's\nArt as Experience and responded to it. He rightly pointed out\nmany similarities between his own and Dewey's thought. (Croce 1948).\nThere were, however, still three points of serious contention: (1)\nCroce places significantly more importance on the universality of art\nthan Dewey, (2) he still insists that the material of art consists not\nof external things but of internal sentiments of human passions: a\ncharacteristically idealist position that Dewey vehemently rejects,\nand (3) whereas he believes that art gives knowledge of a higher\nreality, Dewey does not. Croce asserts that Dewey is still arguing\nagainst Hegelians of his youth who held, for example, to a notion of\n“the Absolute,” which Croce had rejected. Dewey (1948), in\nresponding to Croce, argues that the list of shared beliefs Croce\nmentioned in his review were just ideas widely familiar to\naestheticians. He thinks that because of Croce's idealism there can be\nno common ground of discussion between them. He also makes an\nunsatisfactory distinction between pragmatism, which he claims is a\ntheory of knowledge, and aesthetic theory, which he thinks has nothing\nto do with knowledge. Also, he seems inconsistently dualist when, in\nhis reply to Croce, he cuts his own system into two parts, pragmatic\nand aesthetic. His criticism that Croce is simply applying to the\ndomain of aesthetics ideas drawn from a preconceived system of\nphilosophy, seems unfair, since he does this to some extent himself.\nIn his reply, Croce (1952) argues that Dewey is too wedded to\nempiricism and pragmatism and that it is only because Dewey, contrary\nto his own claims, is committed to a kind of dualism, that he cannot\nunderstand Croce's identification of intuition and expression or\nrecognize how similar Croce's view is to his own. Simoni (1952) argues\nthat neither Croce nor Dewey were Hegelian in the sense of believing\nin the Absolute. Douglas (1970) agrees with Simoni, finding many\nsimilarities between Dewey and Croce. However, Douglas does agree with\nPepper (1939) that Dewey never reconciled the pragmatist and\nhistoricist (Hegelian) dimensions of his thought. \nRomanell (1949) held that Croce and Dewey at least share the view that\nart is about aesthetic experience. However, Dewey's definition of the\nsubject-matter of philosophy of art as aesthetic experience (which\ntreats it as a special type of experience) is inconsistent with his\ndefinition of it as the aesthetic phase of experience. Also, when\nDewey speaks of aesthetic experience he is not functionalist and is\nnot consistent with his pragmatism. Dewey should have held that just\nas there is no such thing as religious experience, there is no such\nthing as aesthetic experience. Dewey (1950) replied that every\nnormally complete experience is aesthetic in its consummatory phase,\nthat the arts and their experience are developments of this primary\nphase, and that there is nothing inconsistent in this. Where Romanell\nsees incompatibility Dewey sees continuity of development. Ames (1953)\nprovides an excellent defense against Dewey's critics up to this point\nin time.  However Susanne Langer (1954) attacked Dewey for holding that aesthetic values must be direct satisfactions or instrumental values, conflating the aesthetic with the mundane (Kruse 2007). \nAs mentioned earlier, many attacks on Dewey focused on his views on\nexpression. Although Hospers (1946) does not specifically criticize\nhim, and Bouwsma (1954) does not mention him, their attacks on\nexpression theory can be taken to be indirectly against Dewey. Tormey\n(1986) fills this gap. He chides Dewey for assuming that an artist is\nalways expressing something and that the expressive qualities in the\nwork are the result of that act. He thinks that Dewey wrongly abandons\nthe distinction between voluntary and involuntary expression, and in\ndoing so, undermines paradigmatic examples of expressive behavior. A\nwork of art may possess expressive qualities of sadness but this is\nnot necessarily the intended consequence of the productive activity of\nthe artist. For Tormey, the artist is not expressing him or herself:\nhe/she is simply making an expressive object. Mitias (1992) defends\nDewey against these criticisms. \nScruton (1974) objects mainly to Dewey's naturalism. He thinks that\nDewey insists that aesthetic need must underlie all our interest in\nart, and that he fails to capture what we mean when we say that we are\ninterested in a picture ‘for its own sake.’ Needs can be\nsatisfied by many objects but one cannot substitute pictures for one\nanother. Unlike animal need, interest in a picture involves thought of\nits object. As a political conservative, Scruton has been opposed to\nDewey's views on education. However, his work on architecture (Scruton\n1979), with its emphasis on context, unity, functionalism, and the\nrelations between architecture and everyday aesthetics, are remarkably\nsimilar to Dewey's views about art in general, although Dewey's name\nis never mentioned. \nJohn McDermott (1976) followed Dewey in arguing that all experience is\npotentially aesthetic, where the aesthetic sensibility refers to how\nwe feel about our situation. Art today leads us to life. In order to\nachieve consummatory experience we need to cooperate with our\nenvironment. \nAlthough Beardsley (1982) often speaks positively of Dewey's notion of\naesthetic experience, he thinks that Dewey was obsessed with the\ndangers of dualism and that he talked about “separation”\nin a misleading way. Dewey thinks the practices of hanging paintings\nin special buildings would deny continuity between art and life. Yet\nBeardsley sees no real problem here, for people who see a painting in\na museum bring their culture with them. Also, against Dewey's stress\non continuity, Beardsley thinks that discontinuity in nature\nand in culture is required for the emergence of genuine novelty in\nart. As opposed to Dewey, Beardsley stresses the ways in which art is\nindependent, relatively self-sufficient, and autonomous to a degree.\nGoldman (2005) argues that Beardsley borrows too much from Dewey's\nobscure discussion of experience, but articulates better than Dewey\nthe idea that aesthetic experience is a matter of complete engagement\nof our faculties with both instrumental and intrinsic benefits. \nNovitz (1992), who approves of Dewey's ideas that art derives from\nexperiences of everyday life and that the artistic process infuses our\ndaily lives, questions the idea that fine art always embodies\nconsummatory or unified experiences. He thinks Dewey has an idealized\nview of art that borrows from the very aestheticist theories he\ncriticizes, and that Dewey does not sufficiently question the\nboundaries of art.  \nShusterman (1992, etc., see bibliography) is the most widely known\nadvocate of Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. He strikingly contrasts\nDewey's approach to that of analytic aesthetics. Like Dewey, he\nstresses the idea that art and aesthetics are both culturally and\nphilosophically central. Some of his most trenchant comments involve\nsimilarities between Dewey's thought and such continental thinkers as\nFoucault and Adorno. However he also has his criticisms of Dewey. He\ntakes Dewey to be redefining art in terms of aesthetic experience,\nwhich he believes to be too slippery a concept to explain much.\nMoreover, he asserts that although Dewey has much to say about\naesthetic experience, Dewey also holds that it is indefinable, and\nthis leads to problems with its being a criterion of value in art. On\nthe other hand, Shusterman thinks that Dewey sees defining art in\nterms of experience as a matter of getting us to have more and better\nexperiences with art, and not of giving a definition in terms of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. So, although he doubts that\nphilosophical theory can redefine art, he suspects Dewey is not trying\nto do this anyway. Moreover, he thinks it not only possible but\nvaluable to make less dramatic classificatory changes, as for example\nin legitimating rock music as fine art. He believes that whereas Dewey\nsought a global redefinition of art, he is simply trying to remedy\ncertain limitations in art practice. Later, he (Shusterman 2000) has\nsaid that much art fails to generate Dewey's aesthetic experience. He\nalso observes that art cannot be redefined to be equal to\naesthetic experience as we are hardly going to reclassify an\nincredible experience of a sunset as art. Shusterman also insists on\nthe value of aesthetic experiences that are fragmented and ruptured,\ncontrary to Dewey's emphasis on unity, and notes that Dewey neglected\nthe possibility of lingering reflection after moments of consummation\n(Shusterman 2004).  Paul C. Taylor (2002) addresses Shusterman's reading of Dewey. \nSeigfried (1996b) takes a long overdue feminist look at Dewey's\naesthetics, finding several aspects that may enrich feminist\nexploration of women's experiences, including his antidualism, his\nperspectivalism, his working from concrete experience, his emphasis\nplaced on the role of feeling in experience, his emphasis on doing and\nmaking, and his attack on the division between practice and theory.\nHowever she notes that Dewey neglected sexism in his analysis, and\nsometimes made sexist assumptions. \nCarroll (2001) thinks Dewey's theory of art fails to cover many\ncontemporary works which then act as counterexamples to his definition\nof art as experience. For example, as Rothko's paintings can overwhelm\nus at one shot they may not have Dewey's requisite development and\nclosure. Carroll also thinks that the view that experiences of art\nmust be unified is too narrow. Cage's 4′33″,\nwhich Carroll takes to obviously be a work of art, does not consummate\nor have qualitative unity. Finally, he thinks that if experiences of\neveryday dispersion can be aesthetic then Dewey's distinction between\n“an experience” and disconnected daily experience\ndissolves. However, Jackson (1998) defends Dewey against similar\ncriticisms, especially with respect to Cage's\n4′33″ which he sees as fitting Dewey's definition\nnicely. For Jackson, it is the experience that requires\nunity, not the physical product. \nDickie (2001) says that Dewey sets forth an expression theory of art\nwithout any supporting argument. Lumping Dewey with Collingwood, he\nthinks such theorists place art in the same domain with the growl of a\ndog with a bone. They make the creation of art like the bowerbird's\nproduction of bowers, i.e., a result of innate natures without a plan\nin mind. For Dickie, expression of emotion is neither sufficient nor\nnecessary for defining art. He thinks these theories wrongly hold that\npsychological mechanisms in human nature are sufficient for the\nproduction of art, as if the production of artworks is teleologically\ndetermined by psychological mechanisms. \nFreeland (2001) observes that Dewey held that art is the best window\nto another culture, that it is a universal language, and that we\nshould try to experience another culture as from within. It is\npossible for barriers and prejudices to melt away when we enter into\nthe spirit of another culture's art. Although this universalism seems\nsimilar to Clive Bell's formalism, Freeland notes that for Dewey art\nis defined not as form but as expression of the life of community. She\nthinks however that we must also know many external facts about the\ncommunity, and that we must recognize that no culture is homogeneous:\nthere may not be one viewpoint in a culture. She also gives a\npositive nod to Dewey's call for a revolution in which the values\nleading to intelligent enjoyment of art are incorporated into our\nsocial relations. Finally, she classifies Dewey's aesthetics as a\ncognitive theory since it focuses on art's role in helping people to\nperceive and manipulate reality, finding continuity between Dewey's\nand Goodman's approaches to art as a kind of language. \nDewey's thought in aesthetics has also sometimes been brought to bear\nin analysis of other aspects of his philosophy. Noteworthy in this\nregard is the ethical work of Pappas (2008), especially his chapter\ntitled “The Intelligent, Aesthetic, and Democratic Way of\nLife.” Here he discusses Dewey's aesthetic notion of balance as\nit applies to ethics. Johnson (1994) and Fesmire (1999, 2003) also\nintroduce Dewey's aesthetic theories into discussion of ethics. Scott\nStroud (2011) further develops the Deweyan idea of moral\nself-cultivation as self-cultivation, while Nathan Crick (2010)\napplies Dewey's aesthetic ideas to a conception of rhetoric as an art\nwhich in a democracy promotes freedom.  \nRecently there have been lively debates over the Deweyan tradition in\nthe aesthetics of everyday life. Most of the contestants are inspired\nby Dewey's valuation of everyday aesthetic experience but depart from\nhim in various ways. Irvin (2008a) has argued that the fragmented\ncharacter of everyday aesthetic experiences might, contra Dewey's\nemphasis on consummation, be what gives them their distinctive\nquality. She goes so far as to assert that even scratching an itch can\nbe aesthetically appreciated (Irvin 2008b). Parsons and Carlson (2008)\ncontend that, although Dewey's aesthetic theory may seem particularly\nappropriate to appreciating everyday objects since we interact with\nthem in a more intimate and multi-sensory way than with art objects,\nthis approach, shared by Korsmeyer (1999), Brady (2005), Leddy (2005,\n2012), Shusterman (2006a, 2012), Saito (2007), fails to honor\ntraditional distinctions between aesthetic and mere\n“bodily” pleasures. They might have also mentioned Kuehn\n(2005) who takes an explicitly Deweyan approach to the aesthetics of\nfood, and Mandoki (2007) who takes Dewey as one source of her everyday aesthetics. They think it wrong that the pleasures of taking a bath, for\nexample, could be considered aesthetic. Rather, the objects of\neveryday aesthetic should be appreciated mainly for their functional\nbeauty (pleasures of the proximal senses are not aesthetic, although\nthey may still add some value to the overall experience), and\nknowledge of the function of everyday objects is required for their\nappropriate appreciation. Soucek (2009) and Dowling (2010) raise\ncriticisms against everyday aesthetics along similar lines. However\nPuolakka (2014) defends a Deweyan approach to everyday aesthetics\ndrawing on his theory of imagination and on recent work on Dewey and\nmoral imagination. \nDewey continues to have influence with respect to particular art\nforms. For example David Clowney and Robert Rawlins (2014) use Dewey\nto argue that risk-taking and showmanship are integral to music as\nperformed. Aili Bresnahan (2014) develops a Deweyan theory of performing arts practice with a special view to dance. \nIt is a mark of the endurance and power of Dewey's aesthetic theory\nthat it has been so frequently criticized and defended from so many\ndifferent angles. Although many of these criticisms rest on an\nincomplete or distorted understandings of Dewey's thought there are\nalso many that should be answered by anyone who seeks to carry on\nDewey's legacy.","contact.mail":"tle403@aol.com","contact.domain":"aol.com"}]
