There are a\nvariety of naturalisms, including: ontological naturalism, which holds\nthat reality contains no supernatural entities; methodological\nnaturalism, which holds that philosophical inquiry should be\nconsistent with scientific method; and moral naturalism, which\ntypically holds that there are moral facts and that such facts are\npart of the natural world.\n\n\nClassical Indian philosophers do not call themselves naturalists, but\ndifferent naturalistic traits are easily detectable in different\nschools. The validity of this claim is tied to the concept of nature\nadmitted in different systems, which alone determines the boundary\nbetween natural and supernatural. This article, therefore, first\ndiscusses two different theories of nature and in the light of that\nconstructs arguments for ontological naturalism, methodological\nnaturalism and moral naturalism by drawing on the writings of\nclassical Indian philosophers. Naturalistic traits are not uniformly\npresent in all systems: a single system of philosophy might uphold\nnaturalism from one perspective and non-naturalism from another. The\nNaiyāyikas for example, have shown marked preference for\nnaturalism in epistemology while in linguistic theory they are staunch\nconventionalists; the Advaita Vedantins on the other hand, are\nnon-naturalists in their ontology but their epistemology can be looked\nupon as naturalistic. A moral naturalism is shared by most Indian\nphilosophical systems. However, in importing these labels from Western\nphilosophy to the classical Indian philosophical systems, one needs to\nexercise caution because the concepts of nature, science, scientific\nmethod, etc. do not smoothly converge in the two theoretical\ntraditions.\n\nScholars differ among themselves regarding the classical period in\nIndian Philosophy, but here we will assume the classical period to\nreach from the end of the Vedic era to the beginning of the early\nmodern age in the fifteenth century CE. Classical Indian philosophy is\nby no means a monolith but accommodates within it different systems\nwhich either admitted or denied the infallibility of the Vedas (the\nhallowed Revealed Scripture of the Hindus). The systems upholding the\nauthority of the Vedas are Vedānta, Mīmāṃsā,\nSāṃkhya, Yoga, Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika, while\nthe systems that challenged its scriptural authority include\nCārvāka materialism and various schools of Buddhism and\nJainism. Naturalistic traits are available in these systems, but first\nit is necessary to determine the sense of naturalism relevant for the\npurpose at hand. \nPeter Strawson in his Woodbridge Lectures (Strawson 1987) points out\nthat the term ‘naturalism’ is elastic in its use. He\ndistinguishes two main varieties: hard or reductive and soft or\nliberal naturalism. Hard naturalists view human beings with their\ndifferent endowments as mere ‘objects’—parts of\nnature—to be described, analysed and causally explained. The\nclaim is that it is possible to have an absolute and pure objective\nview of human beings and their behaviour. Soft naturalists, on the\nother hand, are ready to accommodate subjective dispositions and\npersonal attitudes within a general naturalistic framework. Another\nway of discriminating naturalists in recent literature (Kornblith\n1985, Papineau 2007) is to distinguish between methodological and\nsubstantive naturalism; where the former has as its sub-varieties (a)\nReplacement Theory and (b) Expansionist/ Normative Theory, while the\nlatter may be subdivided into Ontological and Semantic varieties.\nAccording to Methodological Naturalism, philosophical theorizing\nshould be continuous with empirical enquiry in the sciences. Some\nMethodological Naturalists want to do away with normative\njustification theories and to replace them with empirical and\ndescriptive explanatory accounts. Other Methodological Naturalists are\nmore liberal and retain the normative level with the proviso that the\ntheorist must not forget that ‘it is an empirical question what\nnormative advice is actually usable and effective for creatures like\nus’. Ontological Substantive Naturalism is the reductive view\nthat there exists only natural and physical things and Semantic\nSubstantive Naturalists emphasize that philosophical analysis of any\ntheoretical concept must show it to be amenable to empirical\nenquiry. \nA rejection of the supernatural is the point of minimal agreement\namongst naturalists of all types, but there is no consensus regarding\nthe boundary between natural and supernatural. Most schools of Indian\nphilosophy identify nature with the empirical world or the world of\nexperience. Two extreme views about the empirical world are available\nto Indian theory. The Advaita Vedāntins declare the world of\nexperience unreal, an apparent transformation of the eternal and\nunchanging ultimate conscious principle. To the materialist\nCārvākas, on the other hand, this world is real and it is\ncomposed of physical matter, consciousness is an emergent property of\nmatter and self is nothing but conscious material body. They were also\nknown as svabhāvavādins (a term translatable as\n“naturalists”) because to discard everything supernatural\nfrom their world-view they subscribe to a doctrine which holds that\nthe occurrence of an effect is not determined by its cause but by its\nessential nature, thus making causation entirely redundant. This is\nindeed a unique move in the history of naturalism, for all types of\nnaturalism in the West are intimately connected with the provision of\na causal account of the world or of nature. In terms of our earlier\ntaxonomy, the Advaita Vedāntins might be branded as\nnon-naturalist and the Cārvākas as hard naturalist. In\nbetween these two lie the Buddhists, the Jainas, the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣikas and the Sāṃkhya-Yoga\nphilosophers, whose accounts of the empirical world need to be\nanalysed carefully if we are accurately to place them. Two questions,\nthe answers to which will help to discern naturalist traits in these\nsystems, are: what are the ultimate constituents of the empirical\nworld, and what is the accepted model of causation for a particular\nschool? For the bounds of nature are to be determined by the nature of\nreal entities as admitted in a system and the nature of causal\nconnection amongst these entities. If only physical things governed by\nthe rules of mechanical causation are taken to be natural, then\nattempts would be made either to reduce psychological, biological,\nsocial, moral and mathematical entities to the physical or to\nestablish somehow their causal relevance to the physical world. \nOnly Cārvāka hints at the causal closure of the physical\nworld, and the four models of causation entertained in Indian\nphilosophy allows interactions between matter and consciousness,\nmaterial particles and mathematical entities, non-living and living\nbeings, accumulated merits and demerits of past actions and present\nevents, and so on. This, however, should not lead one to think that\nIndian thinkers admit transgression of the barrier between the natural\nand the supernatural. On the contrary, they establish their own\ncriteria of demarcation and in doing so legitimize the admission of\nvarious kinds of entities in the ‘natural world’. \nThere are two contending theories of the natural world in India.\nAccording to the first, the empirical world arises out of combinations\nof atoms. Proponents of atomism (paramāṇuvāda) are\nfound among Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Buddhist and Jaina\nthinkers. Sāṃkhya philosophers hold instead that the world\nis a transformation of an ever-dynamic Ur-Nature\n(mūla-prakṛti). Variations of this second conception are\nalso available in some branches of Vedānta. \nLike Greek atomism, Indian atomism was speculative and local. The\nroots of Indian atomism can be traced back to the Upaniṣadic\ndoctrine of five elements (pañca-mahābhūtas), viz.,\nearth, water, fire, air, and vyom or ākāśa. According\nto the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, the first four\nelements are of two types—eternal and non-eternal. Atoms are\neternal, while composite ‘wholes’ are non-eternal, since\nevery product is eventually destroyed. Atoms, it is claimed, possess\nthe smallest magnitude (aṇu-parimāṇa), are spherical\n(parimaṇḍala), indivisible, and eternal. Though\nquantitatively identical, each type of atom has specific attribute. An\nearth atom has odour, a water atom taste, a fire atom colour and an\nair atom has touch as specific attribute. What motivates an atomistic\nconception of nature? Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika thinkers offer a\ntwo-step argument to establish the existence of atoms. The first step\nis: \nThere are two presuppositions of this argument: (1) A part of a whole\nis always smaller in size than a whole—a thesis of which no\ncounter-instance is available in our world; and (2) the parts of the\nsmallest visible composite thing are imperceptible. The second step of\nthe argument runs as follows: \nBut why is a process of infinite division inadmissible? Because,\nreason the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas, a mountain and a mustard\nseed will then be equal in size: both being infinitely divisible, they\nwill have countless parts. One might object that the said division\nwill stop only when there is nothing left to be divided, but that this\nwould imply that the whole world can be created out of nothing; and\nthe idea of creation ex nihilo is not viable. But division is possible\nonly when there is a thing to be divided, something which forms the\nbase (ādhāra) of division. A process of division annulling\nits base is as absurd a notion as digging a hole in empty space. To\navoid these inconsistencies, therefore, indivisible atoms must be\nadmitted. \nA theory is provided of atomic composition. There is a distinct order\nof combination of atoms. Two atoms of the same type combine to form a\ndyad (dyaṇuka) and three dyads of the same type combine to form\na triad (tryaṇuka), which is held to be the smallest perceptible\nobject. Triads combine in varying numbers to give rise to large\ncomposite wholes of different shapes and sizes. Dyads are also thought\nas the ‘ārambhaka’—that from which the process\nof creation starts, the atoms being eternal are uncreated and continue\nto exist when a creation comes to an end. \nThere are two main puzzles about the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\ntheory of composition. First, why can’t two atoms of different\ntypes form a dyad? An answer is, if an earth atom and a water atom\ncombine to produce a dyad, to which type will the resultant belong? It\ncannot belong to both types possessing two exclusive class-characters,\nnor can the resultant be of a mixed type, for then we shall never have\nany natural kind of perceptible dimension. The second issue here is\nwhy three atoms or two dyads cannot directly produce a composite\nobject. According to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas, sticking to\nthe order of conjunction of atoms is important to explain how\nperceptible magnitude arises at the stage of triad from the\ncombination of its imperceptible components. If an atom is of\nimperceptible magnitude, so will be the magnitude of a dyad, for a\nquality of a part produces in the whole the same quality in greater\ndegree. Now if the dyads are imperceptible, then by the same logic a\ntriad will also be imperceptible. If this process continues, then\nthere will never be any composite object of perceptible dimension. So\nthe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas need to give a rational\njustification for the perceptibility of a triad. They uphold that,\nunlike other qualities, the magnitude of a compound is not caused by\nthe magnitude of its components. The gross magnitude of a composite\nwhole is a resultant either of the grossness of its component or the\nlooseness of their conjunction or of the plurality of their numbers.\nThe first alternative has already been rejected. The second\nalternative also is not acceptable to the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣikas because they do not admit any\ninterstice between two atoms. So they endorse the last alternative\nthat the perceptible magnitude of a triad is caused by its number.\nSome think that triads of different elements can combine to form\ntetrads, and so on. Since the atoms of different elements have\nspecific qualities, there would be different structural arrangements\n(vyūha) in triads constituted by different types of atoms.\nDifferent qualities observed in large composite substances are due to\nsuch different structural arrangements of their components. \nLet us quickly review some other features of\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika atomism. First, like the four material\nelements, mind (manas) is also said to be of corporeal nature and\natomic in magnitude though lacking in sensible quality. Material atoms\nhave specific sensible qualities and so are called\n‘bhūta’; both matter and mind are capable of movement\nand so designated ‘mūrta’. The four elements come\nclosest to a scientific conception of matter. Second, all atoms are\nsaid to be quantitatively identical and qualitatively different. Two\natoms belonging to different types can be easily differentiated by\ntheir specific attributes, but the problem arises while\ndifferentiating two atoms of the same type, say, two earth atoms. The\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣikas therefore introduce in their ontology\na unique objective principle called ‘viśeṣa’\n(ultimate differentiator) for individuating atoms. Third, the wholes\nconstituted by atoms are not mere conjunctions of atoms, but are new\nentities inhering in their own parts. Fourth, the atomic theory is\nintimately connected with their theory of causation. A cause has been\ndefined in this system as an invariable, unconditional antecedent of\nan effect; an effect, on the other hand, is said to be the\ncounter-correlative of a prior absence. A counter-correlative of any\nabsence removes that absence. A pot is a counter-correlative of its\nprior absence because this absence of pot disappears as soon as the\npot is produced. Every effect is preceded by its prior absence, so\neach effect is a new production. Such theory of causation is known as\nārambhavāda, the theory that an effect always comes into\nexistence out of a prior state of non-existence (as opposed to the\ntheory of existent effect (satkāryavāda) advocated by the\nSāṃkhya school). Causes are of two types: (a) common\n(sādhāraṇa) and (b) uncommon\n(asādhāraṇa). A common cause is uniformly present\nbefore the occurrence of any effect whatsoever and is necessary for\neffectuation as such; an uncommon cause is that which invariably and\nunconditionally precedes a particular effect. Common causes are space,\ntime, accumulated merits and demerits of individual agents\n(adṛṣṭa), God, knowledge, desire and will (prayatna)\nof God, and prior absence (prāgabhāva). Uncommon causes are\ndivided into three classes: (a) inherent (samavāyi), (b)\nnon-inherent (asamavāyi) and (c) efficient (nimitta). Without\nentering into their technical definitions, let us understand them with\nthe help of an example. Atoms are the inherent causes of the world,\nconjunctions of atoms are its non-inherent causes, and God and\nadṛṣṭa are its efficient causes. Fifth, admitting\nnumbers as the cause of grossness of a triad shows that they have a\ncapacious world-view where numbers can have causal effect on the\nphysical world. \nFor a consideration of early modern Nyāya discussions of atomism\nin India in contrast with mechanical philosophy in Europe, see Ganeri\n2011, chapter 14. \nTwo realist schools of Buddhism, the Vaibhāṣika and the\nSautrāntika, also present an atomistic conception of nature.\nAccording to the former, matter is a collocation of the substratum of\ncolour, taste, odour and touch. Atoms are the minutest units of the\nrūpa-skandha (collocation of material elements). As it is\nmentioned in the Abhidharmakośa (I. 44), ‘Atoms of the\nvisual organ are arranged in the pupil of the eye in the shape of an\najājī flower; those of the auditory organ are arranged in\nthe earhole in the shape of a bhūrja leaf, atoms of the olfactory\norgan are arranged in the form of a long pin (śalākā)\ninside the nostrils, those of the gustatory organ inside the mouth in\nthe shape of the half-moon, and those of the cutaneous organ in the\nshape of the body.’ Atoms are thus indirectly related to\nobservational entities. Atoms, according to them, are indivisible,\nimperceptible and momentary. They continually undergo phase-changes.\nSome Sautrāntikas hold that atoms are not particles of matter but\na dynamic force or energy. According to Vasubandhu, atoms are always\nin an aggregate and never alone. For it has been mentioned by some\nthat the rūpa-skandha is that which can cause obstruction and is\nalso subject to transformation. A single atom cannot possess these\nproperties; hence atoms are always in a cluster. \nThe Buddhists then speculate about the nature of the smallest\naggregate. Sautrāntikas hold that seven atoms form the smallest\naggregate. They also maintain that atoms do not touch one another. So\nthe aggregate of atoms is not a solid whole but rather there is space\namong atoms. Others, however, concede the possibility of dense\ncombination of atoms. The combination of seven atoms takes place in\nthe form of a cluster with one atom at the centre and others around\nit. The Sarvāstivādins talk about eight types of atom. The\nfour fundamental types are of earth (solid), water (fluid), fire (hot)\nand air (moving). The secondary atom types are of colour, odour, taste\nand touch. Thus, according to this view, specific qualities are atomic\ntoo. Each secondary atom requires for its support four fundamental\natoms. So, by simple calculation, a non-sounding aggregate\n(aśabda) consists of 20 atoms, while a sounding aggregate\n(saśabda) is composed of 25 atoms. \nThe Jainas also propound atomism. All the entities admitted in their\nontology, except souls and space, are constituted by material elements\n(pudgalas). Atoms are eternal as regards their substance and each\nexists by occupying one space-point (pradeśa). These atoms are\nqualitatively similar, each possessing one kind of taste, smell and\ncolour and two kinds of touch, viz. hot or cold and rough or smooth.\nOther kinds of touch, viz. heavy, light, soft and hard, and varied\ncolour, taste and smell are found only in compounds formed by atoms.\nThe Jainas maintain that atoms are usually in motion but not always.\nDepending upon the spatio-temporal conditions, atomic motion is either\nregular (niyamita) or irregular. In one unit of time atoms regularly\nmove in a straight line. However, while in interaction with another\natom or a group of atoms, atomic motion becomes curvilinear. The\nJainas also speculate about the speed of a moving atom under different\nconditions. \nThe main difference between these atomisms and\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika atomism lies in their account of\ncombination of atoms. The latter had to resort to God’s will and\nan unseen force (apparently non-natural) to explain this process of\ncombination. The Jainas and the Buddhists, on the other hand, gave a\nsatisfactory account of the combination of atoms in terms of natural\nforces. The Jainas, for example, explain the bonding of atoms on the\nbasis of an empirical observation\n(Tattvārthādhigamasūtra, 5. 32). It is seen that when\ndrops of water fall on particles of barley, one single lump is formed.\nBy generalization, the claim is that a viscid / smooth (snigdha) atom\ntends to combine with a dry / rough (rukṣa) atom. Viscidity and\ndryness, smoothness and roughness, are no doubt natural properties of\natoms. The following rules of combination are formulated: \nŚubhagupta (Bāhyārthasiddhikārikā,\n56–58), a later Vaibhāṣika, offers an alternative\naccount of the combination of atoms. According to him, two atoms come\nclose to each other because of their inherent potency\n(dravyaśakti), though they are not actually conjoined. Like a\nmantra drawing out a snake and keeping it immobile by its inherent\npotency, two atoms are drawn towards each other and form an aggregate\nby their natural inherent potency. The accumulated atoms combine again\nto give rise to varied composite objects of the world. However not all\natoms are equally potent, and some never become a part of an aggregate\nbecause of their insufficient bonding power. Atoms when bonded\ntogether undergo a transformation because of mutual influence and\nnovel properties emerge in the aggregate which were not present in the\nsingle atoms. For example, carbon compounds when transformed into\ndiamonds become too hard to be disintegrated. \nThrough theoretical speculation alone, Indian atomists tried to throw\nlight on the nature of the ultimate particles. Some Buddhists, we have\nseen, even described atoms as packets of energy. The chemical laws\nthat the ancient Indians derived on the basis of their speculations\nabout the process of composition of atoms led to the advancement of\napplied chemistry and applied medicine. These theories may not have\nmuch relevance in the context of modern science or cosmology but the\nassociated debates about the nature of causation have contributed to\nan understanding of the philosophical foundations of scientific\nenquiry. \nSvabhāvavāda, which is the strongest form of ontological\nnaturalism in Indian scenario, literally means ‘the view of\nindividual nature/essences’ (Bhattacharya, R. 2002). The\nhard-core naturalists, Cārvākas, admit four types of basic\nmaterial elements—earth, water, fire and air. They reject\natomism, however, since they refuse to admit any imperceptible thing\nin their ontology, including God, Soul, ākāśa and all\nkinds of non-natural forces. The material elements are said to possess\nsome qualities naturally. Multifarious objects of this world including\nliving and conscious beings are produced out of the combination of\nmaterial elements. It is generally held that the nature of any effect\nis determined by the nature of its cause.The reductionist\nCārvākas and the nihilist Ājīvika-s, however, deny\nany causal connection between the material elements and the compounds\narising out of them. The Cārvākas, however, deny any causal\nconnection between the material elements and the compounds arising out\nof them. Just as fire is naturally hot and water is naturally cold,\nsimilarly, they hold, sugarcane is naturally sweet, margosa leaves are\nnaturally bitter and thorns are naturally sharp. They think that\nfurther componential or causal analysis is completely redundant. The\ndistinguishing feature of this kind of extreme naturalism is a belief\nin a fortuitous generation of events (ākasmikatāvāda).\nCausal relations are supposed to involve necessity, but necessity is\nnot perceptible and whatever is not perceptible cannot be inferred or\nestablished by any other means. Udayana argues, in an elaborate\ncritique of this view (Nyāyakusumāñjali I,\n4–5), that every event must have a cause because every event\nwithout exception has ‘conditional’ (sāpekṣa)\nexistence, this in turn because it has ‘occasional’\n(kādācitka) existence, i.e., it occurs at a certain time. An\neternal entity is always existent and a fictitious entity does not\nexist at any time: as these are not characterized by occasional\nexistence, these are not caused. The only counter-instance to this\nrule is prior absence, which has occasional existence but being\nbeginningless has no cause. Cārvākas affirm, however, that\nan event need not originate from a cause; it may come into being\nfortuitously. Even the occasional origination of an event is due to\nthe nature of the event and has got nothing to do with its cause. \nThe thesis of fortuitous generation may be given five alternative\nformulations on the basis of the etymological analysis of the word\n‘akasmāt’ (without cause): \nUdayana objects to all these formulations. If an effect were not\ndependent on its cause for its existence, then it could have occurred\nat any time, in fact at all times, and thus would lose its occasional\nnature. In fact, every effect has a temporal limit fixed by its cause,\nprior to which it cannot exist. The second formulation runs contrary\nto our perception of the occurrence of an event at a particular\nspatio-temporal location. The third formulation is unacceptable\nbecause the same thing cannot be both a cause and an effect at the\nsame time in respect of the same set of conditions, and because it is\nnot possible for anything to exist before its origination. The fourth\nformulation is rejected outright for no unreal thing can ever enter\ninto a causal process. The fifth formulation leaves us totally\nmystified because the proponents of the fortuitous generation thesis\nhave nowhere specified what this nature is by virtue of which an\neffect can occur without its cause. So we wonder, is this nature\ndifferent from or the same as the effect? On the first alternative the\nprinciple of causality is re-established while the second alternative\nis unintelligible. If the nature of an effect is the same as the\neffect and a thing can never be separated from its nature, then it\nwould follow that an existent entity would go on causing its own\nexistence over and over again. This is surely absurd. Philosophically\nthese arguments appear to be pretty convincing, but Cārvāka\nnaturalists may find an ally in quantum physical talk about\nspontaneous decay of a radioactive element, quantum jumps, and so\nforth. \nThat a whole arises out of smaller parts and that atoms are the\nmaterial causes of the world—these mainstays of atomism have\nbeen contested by other schools of Indian philosophy. There are two\nimportant cosmological theories in the anti-atomic\ncamp—Prakṛti-pariṇāma-vāda and\nBrahma-kāraṇa-vāda. Of these two, the first, a\nSāṃkhya view that the world evolves from Ur-Nature or\nprakṛti, is more relevant in the discussion of naturalism.\nUr-Nature is an ever-dynamic whole of all-pervasive magnitude having\nthree constituent principles or guṇas, viz. sattva, rajas and\ntamas. Sattva has the power to illuminate, rajas to activate and tamas\nto restraint. B.N. Seal (1958), therefore, thinks that these\nprinciples are three aspects of matter, viz., form, energy and mass.\nK.C. Bhattacharya (1956), on the other hand, has offered a\npsychological interpretation which appears to have a closer fit with\nthe text. Bhattacharya maintains that the Sāṃkhya considers\nthings of nature as contents of affective experience. Mohanty (1992)\nalso concurs that ‘the guṇas are the substantial, but\ndynamic, being of the elementary feelings that constitute, in their\ninterconnections, all experience.’ The guṇas as affective\nabsolutes constitute the object. In the process of evolution, the\nSāṃkhya gives the central role to rajas, which is said to\nbe an ever-active principle of pain. Mohanty explains, following\nBhattacharya, that ‘since pain implies the active wish to be\nfree from pain, pain is a freeing activity: it is restless willing to\nbe free. Pleasure is restful freedom from pain; indifference is not\nonly want of freedom but is also not actively willing freedom.’\nSo these three constituents of Ur-nature are present in all objects of\nthe world in different proportions and are responsible for our varied\nexperience. This theory of nature is complemented by a theory of\ncausation, viz. satkāryavāda, which states that an effect\nexists in its cause prior to its production in a latent or\nnon-manifest form. \nThe Sāṃkhya philosophers advance the following arguments in\nfavour of their theory of causation. (a) What is non-existent cannot\never be produced. Whatever is non-existent remains non-existent for\never and whatever is existent always exists. Nothing can be sometimes\nexistent and sometimes non-existent. Self, for example, is always\nexistent, whereas the fictitious sky-flower is eternally non-existent.\nNo agency can turn non-existent into existent. So if the effect were\nnon-existent in the material cause before the causal operation, then\nit would never be produced. (b) If a particular cause is to be a prior\ndeterminant of a particular effect, then there must be an appropriate\nrelation between cause and effect. That means, a cause produces an\neffect only being related to it. But no such relation can obtain, if\nthe effect were non-existent. For, a relation to obtain requires at\nleast two relata. Hence an effect must pre-exist in its cause.\nMoreover, on the Sāṃkhya view the relation between cause\nand effect is one of identity (tādātmya), and it is obvious\nthat an existent cause cannot be identical to a non-existent effect.\n(c) One may still wonder, why should not the effect be produced by an\nunrelated cause? The reason is that if the effect could arise without\nbeing related to the cause, then any cause could give rise to any\neffect. If there were no definite relation between threads and cloth,\nthen why does a pot not arise from threads? (d) The opponent might say\nthat the effect need not pre-exist in the material cause because when\nthe cause is potent even a non-existent effect can be made to exist by\nthe causal operation. When, on the other hand, the cause lacks the\npotency the desired effect cannot be produced. Since oil-seeds possess\nthe adequate potency, oil can be produced out of these seeds but not\nout of sand. Sāṃkhya philosophers concede this point and\nmaintain that causal operation enables a potent cause to manifest the\nlatent effect. However, they point out that positing potency or\nefficiency will not satisfy their opponents. For then the question\nwill be: where does this potency exist? The opponent must agree that\nthis potency exists in the material cause. Does this potency have any\nrelation with the effect or not? The answer has to be affirmative,\notherwise we would not have said that oilseeds possess the capacity of\nproducing oil and not pots. So once again we are back to the same\nquestion: how can the potency residing in the material cause be\nrelated with a non-existent effect? The Sāṃkhyas,\ntherefore, affirm that this causal efficiency is nothing other than\nthe existence of the effect in the material cause in a latent form.\n(e) The final argument in favour of the Sāṃkhya position\nreveals the whole issue very pointedly. The effect, they say, exists\nin the material cause because cause and effect are essentially the\nsame but only different in form. Since the cause is existent, the\neffect also must exist. The Sāṃkhya has a special stake in\nthis point because the whole debate is geared to proving the existence\nof prakṛti as the ultimate material cause of the universe. In\nthe process they also attempt to establish, contra Vedānta, that\nthe evolution of the universe is genuine and not merely illusory. \nThe process of evolution of the world from Ur-Nature is briefly as\nfollows. The first evolute of prakṛti is the mahat-tattva (the\nGreat Principle, the Cosmic Intelligence or buddhi). From this emerges\nI-consciousness (ahaṃkāra). From the sattva aspect of\nI-consciousness evolve five organs of knowledge (eye, ear, nose,\ntongue and skin), five motor organs (speech, hands, feet, reproductive\nand excretory organs) and manas (sometimes translated as mind); from\nthe tamas aspect of I-consciousness emerge five subtle elements\n(pañca-tanmātra), viz., sound, touch, colour, taste and\nsmell. The five subtle elements give rise to five gross elements,\nviz., ākāśa, air, fire, water and earth. \nIt has already been mentioned that the three constituents of Ur-Nature\nare always in transformation. Before the beginning of creation or\nempirical manifestation of Ur-Nature, there is a homogeneous\ntransformation (sadrśa-pariṇāma) of the principles,\nsattva transforms into sattva, rajas into rajas and tamas into tamas.\nAt the time of world-manifestation the active principle, rajas,\nbecomes predominant and activates the other two principles. The\nstability of Ur-Nature is disturbed due to its close proximity with\nthe Self (puruṣa), an independent co-eternal reality, like a\npiece of iron in proximity of a magnet, and the process of\nheterogeneous transformation begins. The constituent principles of\nUr-Nature combine with one another in different proportions and the\nmanifold world comes into existence. \nThe Sāṃkhya theory of evolution has been described as\nteleological because on this view the entire process of evolution\ntakes place for the sake of the enjoyment and liberation of\npuruṣa, the pure Self. As such, puruṣa stands outside the\nprocess of evolution. When puruṣa is reflected in the first\nevolute of Ur-Nature, cosmic intelligence, it conflates its own\nidentity with the first evolute and appears to have enjoyment and\nsuffering. When it once again comes to realise its own nature by\nattaining discriminatory knowledge, it is liberated. Certainly there\nare problems in the Sāṃkhya admission of a conscious but\ninactive principle, puruṣa. Puruṣa is eternal and\nubiquitous like prakṛti, but if these two are always in contact\nthe start of the creation process remains inexplicable. Again, it is\nnot easy to understand why Ur-Nature should ensnare the pure self into\nbondage and then liberate it through discriminatory knowledge.\nSāṃkhya philosophers say that the enjoyment of the pure\nself is a sham enjoyment, and so is the liberation because the pure\nself is eternally free. Then, however, the teleology loses its force,\nsomething that is perhaps inevitable because the Sāṃkhya\nteleology had always been proto-naturalistic, as is evident from two\nexamples used in the literature. Just as non-sentient cow-milk flows\nmerely from its own nature for the nourishment of the young calf and\nnon-sentient rain clouds naturally yield rain for the sustenance of\nlife on earth, so Ur-Nature ensnares the pure self for the\nlatter’s enjoyment and liberation. The Sāṃkhya theory\nhas never upheld a conscious teleology, rather it has spoken of the\nnatural directedness of Ur-Nature and its evolutes towards\nsatisfaction of another’s need. \nThough the later Sāṃkhya narration embraces a clear-cut\ndualism of Ur-Nature and pure self, Dasgupta (1987) mentioned a\nversion of early Sāṃkhya philosophy where the self is\nregarded as a non-manifest part of prakṛti. In this system\nconsciousness exists in the material Ur-Nature in a latent form. This\nmonistic theory is undoubtedly much more consistent; so why did the\nlater Sāṃkhya change its position to dualism? Dasgupta\nwrites succinctly, ‘Man’s body so far as it is a physical\nobject is like any other object of nature passing through the process\nof evolution. But the introduction of soul from the organic state\nmarks the epoch of a new kind of progress. This epoch attains it as\nthe highest achievement when it comes to the moral being. So far as\nthe physical world is concerned there is the same law of evolution\nfrom the relatively less differentiated, more determinate, more\ncoherent whole and looked at from this point of view man’s life\nand body are but a part of the universe suffering the same process of\ngrowth and decay. But looked at from another point of view all living\nbeings and man pre-eminently by virtue of his soul, is a person and\nthis addition of personality is a decisive addition. Thus so far as\nthe physical parts and the biological sides of life are concerned he\nis an object of nature, but so far as his soul is concerned he is a\nperson and it is this personality which constitutes his\nspirituality.’ The inexplicability of the normative, especially\nof the moral and the spiritual, a perennial bane of naturalism, thus\nled the proto-naturalist Sāṃkhya philosophers to admit pure\nself passively witnessing the process of evolution and standing\noutside the bounds of Ur-Nature. But that does not make empirical\nconsciousness in any way naturalistically unexplainable. In the world\nprocess, buddhi plays a conscious role, reflecting the pure\nconsciousness, just as the moon lightens up the world by borrowing the\nreflected light of the sun. \nA detailed account of self and consciousness within naturalistic\nframework is available in Ganeri (2012, Part I).  \nMethodological naturalism is the view that regards science and\nphilosophy as continuous. ‘Methodological naturalists’,\nwrites Papineau (2007), ‘see philosophy and science as engaged\nin essentially the same enterprise, pursuing similar ends and using\nsimilar methods.’ In classical Indian philosophical systems, we\nfind instances of method continuity as well as result continuity. In\nthis context, we shall discuss mainly the Nyāya view, for the\nNyāya methodology of scientific and epistemic investigation was\nadopted by other philosophical schools too. \nIn the West, the relation between science and philosophy has been\nalmost symbiotic. Sciences separated from philosophy only after\nattaining maturity, developed to their full capacity, proliferated\ninto different branches and, when the circle was complete, all the\noff-springs started coming closer to the parent disciplines to form an\ninter-disciplinary consortium. But even when sciences went their own\nway, a special branch of philosophy, traditional epistemology,\ncontinued to guard their foundation and police their frontiers with\nthe help of its unique method. Thus, in a second moment of fission,\nscience and philosophy were found to differ in contents as well as in\nmethods. In India, however, the fission did not occur so emphatically\nand the borders of different disciplines were never hermetically\nsealed. Consequently, there is science in philosophy and also\ntrans-empirical philosophy in empirical sciences. Different\nphilosophical systems combine the metaphysics of the transcendent with\nthe logic of the mundane and the rules of individual and social\nmorality. We find these systems supplying us with ratiocinative\nprinciples that form the core of a scientific methodology while\nsimultaneously facilitating the process of self-realisation\nculminating in liberation or mokṣa through discourses on the\nnature of reality. Thus with a view to unraveling the real nature of\nexistents (tattvadarśana), philosophical systems indulge in\nquasi-scientific discussions of cosmology, physics, chemistry,\npsychology, biology, and so on. That is why B.N. Seal (1958) has\ncalled these philosophical systems ‘positive sciences’.\nThus in both method and content philosophy and theoretical sciences\ncoincided to a large extent. Applied (phalita) sciences like alchemy\nand medicine did diverge from philosophy, but there too the influence\nof fundamental philosophical concepts like accredited means of\nknowledge, causality, adṛṣṭa, etc., was conspicuous\non patterns of observation and experimental design. \nThe Naiyāyikas are a part of this tradition. One of their most\nsignificant contributions is formulation of a method which forms the\ncore of inquiry in general and so also of scientific inquiry. The\nmethod has four main steps. The first step is to provide an\nenumeration (uddeśa) of the divisions of the subject matter. The\nsecond step is to supply a definition (lakṣaṇa) of the\nsubject under consideration, in the form of a distinguishing mark of\nit. The third step is an examination (parīkṣā) of the\ndefinition, and the fourth verification (nirṇaya). Enumeration\nsometimes includes classification (vibhāga); however, in general,\nclassification comes after definition. Any truth reached by this\nprocedure is raised to the status of an established theory\n(siddhānta). ‘Pramāṇas [methods of\nknowledge-acquisition] are operations subsidiary to the ascertainment\nof truth. The methods of special sciences are ancillary to these\npramāṇas’ (P. C. Ray, 1956). It is evident that\nmethodologically there is no difference between science and\nphilosophy, particularly epistemology. In Nyāya epistemology,\ncommon sense, science, logic and scriptures are all considered to be\ncontinuous with one another. \nNaturalized epistemology defines itself in contrast with analytic\nepistemology, which is also often described as\n‘traditional’ or ‘mainstream’ epistemology.\nAnalytic epistemology is justification-centric. The\nepistemologists’ preoccupation with the formulation of\nprinciples of epistemic appraisal are geared to meet sceptical\nchallenges. They adopt three main strategies. (1) They grant autonomy\nto epistemology, which is meant to provide the basis for all human\nscientific endeavours. Epistemology supposedly possesses an\nArchimedean standpoint or a view from nowhere, something that warrants\nthe objectivity of the sciences. This presupposition led to the\ndissociation between epistemology and psychology. (2) They declare\nthat all epistemic norms of justification are a priori in nature. They\nfurther maintain that providing causal explanation is no part of\nepistemology (Chisholm, 1992). Causal questions and matter of\njustification are to be kept strictly separate. So, according to\ntraditional epistemologists, to judge whether a person’s belief\nthat p counts as knowledge that p, it is sufficient to\nfind out if p is connected in the right way to other\npropositions, the rightness of the connection to be determined by\nlogic (Kitcher, 1983). That is, the evidential story and the causal\nstory should be kept strictly separate because the former is\nnecessarily normative, while the latter is descriptive; in providing\nan epistemic justification of a piece of knowledge, it is not\nnecessary to probe the question of its origins. (3) As a follow-up of\nthe Cartesian programme, analytic epistemologists try to ground\nknowledge of the external world on the subject’s knowledge of\ninner experience. Justification thus becomes internalist and knowing\nthat p entails knowing that knowing that p. If this\ncondition is not satisfied, no one can be a responsible knower. (4)\nMost traditional epistemologists also subscribe to the realist\nconception of truth and one determinate theory of reality. (5) They\nare also committed to the No Accident Thesis, which says that beliefs\nexpressed by true sentences are better guides to action than those\nexpressed by false sentences; it is no accident that well-confirmed\nsentences tend to be true. \nNaturalised epistemologists form a heterogeneous group and not all of\nthem contest all the above features. However, in general\nepistemological naturalists question the first three traits. (a) They\ngive up the privileged autonomous position of epistemology and uphold\nthat epistemology must be continuous with science. (b) Causal\nquestions must form part of epistemology, epistemologists should take\nstock of psychological conditions of cognition. (c) The traditional\ninternalist model of justification being unacceptable, either\nepistemology should give up the task of justification altogether or\nlook for alternative means of justification. Radical naturalists like\nthe early Quine want to replace epistemology by psychology and give up\nthe justification task entirely. Later Quine and more moderate\nnaturalists, on the other hand, re-instate justification but of a\ndifferent kind: some consider justification offered in terms of\ncausally reliable process of belief generation to be adequate, some\nothers admit epistemic justification but retain naturalism by making\nit supervenient on natural facts. \nThe most general arguments in favour of the claim that Indian\nepistemic systems are naturalistic are as follows. Each develops its\nrespective theory of veridical cognition and/or knowledge (the term\npramā is ambiguous) in response to sceptical threats. In spite of\nhaving different metaphysics, most attempt to explain cognition with\nreference to psycho-causal chain. As far as knowledge of the empirical\nworld is concerned, all admit the primacy of perception and thus\nprovide the systems of epistemology with a strong empirical\nfoundation. Indian traditions, in general, as we have seen, sustain a\nmethodological continuity between science and philosophy. Indian\nphilosophers did not feel any need for the a priori/ a posteriori\ndistinction, nor does their theory depend on necessity/possibility or\nanalytic/synthetic distinctions. As a result, they could easily\ncommute between the realm of the normative and that of the\ndescriptive. All these are considerations in favour of a moderate\nmethodological naturalism; however, in the absence of any special\nscientific domain, they do not lend support to the conjecture that\nIndian theory sustains a radical replacement naturalism. \nThe Nyāya response to sceptical objections occurs at two levels,\nat the first level enumerating a set of virtuous processes by which\ntrue beliefs are acquired, and the second level dealing with the\nratification of those reliable or virtuous processes of\nbelief-acquisition. Naiyāyikas admit four kinds of\ncognition—perceptual (pratyakṣa) inferential (anumiti),\nthat which arises from comparison (upamiti) and verbal\n(śābda), and four accredited means of acquiring veridical\ncognition (pramāṇa), viz., perception (pratyakṣa),\ninference (anumāna), comparison (upamāna) and authority\n(śabda). They decide the number of the accredited means by\nempirically observing the effectiveness and reliability of the\nrespective means in generating true beliefs. According to them, these\nprocesses generate true beliefs only when accompanied by genuine\nexcellence or epistemic virtue (guṇa). The virtue that makes a\ngenerating process meritorious differs in each type of true belief. In\ncase of perception the relation of the sense organ with the object\ncharacterised by the property which figures as the qualifier in the\nperceptual cognition is said to be the virtue. For example, when one\nperceives a white shell as white, our sense organ stands in\nappropriate relation with the object of perception, a shell in this\ncase, and apprehends the property whiteness which characterizes the\nshell in question and thus gives rise to a veridical perception. In a\nveridical inferential cognition the mark, which is invariably\nconcomitant with the thing to be inferred, must be known to be present\nin the locus of the inference. For instance, when someone correctly\ninfers fire on a distant hill, it is known to him that smoke, which is\ninvariably concomitant with fire, is present on the hill. In case of\nknowledge by comparison, knowledge of similarity is the excellence,\ne.g., someone rightly identifies an unknown animal as a bison on\nseeing its similarity with a cow which he came to know from an\nexpert’s utterance to the effect that a bison is similar to a\ncow. Finally, in case of verbal knowledge, the speaker’s\nveridical cognition of the state of affairs described by the sentence\nuttered is the excellence, e.g., when an umpire declares a batsman out\nin a cricket match on the basis of his expertise and veridical\ncognition of the state of affairs. A false belief results from the\npresence of some defect (doṣa), and not merely from absence of\nthe required virtue. Someone may perceive a white shell as yellow\nbecause he is suffering from jaundice or because of the yellow tinted\nlight in the room or due to some other defective condition. These\ndefects differ in each instance of false belief. The Naiyāyikas\ntherefore maintain that a false belief is caused by a defect and a\ntrue belief is caused by a virtue. This principle holds in all cases\nand all types of belief—be it commonsensical, scientific, or\nphilosophical. \nThe topic of epistemic luck is an important one in this theory. For,\nalthough a defective process usually generates a false belief and a\nmeritorious process generates a true belief, yet some beliefs may be\ntrue by fluke, in spite of being produced by a defective process.\nSuppose someone wrongly perceives mist as smoke and argues, ‘The\nhill has fire, as it has smoke on it’. Unbeknownst to him, the\nhill actually possesses fire. So this argument yields a veridical\nconclusion though the ground is defective. Or consider the following\nexample (Chakrabarti, 1994): ‘Suppose that on a Tuesday a cheat\nmistakenly believing it to be Monday says, “Today is\nTuesday”. If the listener does not suspect him to be a cheat, he\nwould “understand” that today is a Tuesday. What he would\nunderstand surely would agree with facts.’ Here also the\nresultant cognition is veridical even though it is produced by a\ndefective process. That is why the Naiyāyikas hold the following\nprinciple: if there is a false belief then there must be a defect in\nthe generating process, but not its converse, i.e., if there is a\ndefect in the generating process, then it produces a false belief\n(defects are necessary but not sufficient for error). The problem of\nepistemic luck has led scholars like Sibajiban Bhattacharyya to\ndeclare that the Naiyāyikas did not mean by veridical cognition\n(pramā) a justified true belief. Others, including J.N. Mohanty\n(Mohanty 1992, 2001) contest this view. They rather reconstruct the\nnotion of pramā as a justified true belief and include the two\nexamples mentioned above in the list of the Gettier-type\ncounter-examples, thereby attempting to accommodate pramāṇa\ntheories within the framework of traditional epistemology. \nThe Naiyāyikas beginning with Vācaspati Miśra\nsuccinctly uphold that since a belief cannot reveal its own truth, nor\ncan it be grasped in after-perception, it must be apprehended by a\nsubsequent inference following from volition leading to successful\nactivity. An example from the Nyāya literature will make the\npoint clear. Suppose a thirsty traveller perceives a lake at a\ndistance. Suppose further that all the propitious conditions for a\nveridical perception are present in this case, e.g., the\ntraveller’s vision is not defective, there is adequate light,\nand so on. Yet, if he were ever eluded by a mirage, he might doubt his\nvision. The only way to allay his doubts is, says the Naiyāyika,\nto approach the lake, take a dip in it and drink the water. If he\nfeels cool and his thirst is quenched, he can be sure about the truth\nof his perceptual belief. It is significant that the Naiyāyika\ncalls the volition leading to successful behaviour ‘samvādi\npravṛtti’, literally meaning coherent volition.\nOne’s volition is realised into action and he gets his desired\nobject. Thus there is coherence between the object of volition and the\nobject of perception. One’s perceptual belief that there is a\nlake at a distance is true, if and only if, there is a lake at a\ndistance. However, to establish it, he needs further corroboration.\nHis perceptual belief about the lake must cohere with his other\nbeliefs about water, e.g., it quenches thirst, wets a thing, and\ndouses fire, etc., which motivates him to act positively or negatively\nin a particular situation. I think the model of ratification here is\nsimilar to that of the crossword puzzle, which combines moderate\nfoundationalism with coherentism. A belief to be true must have a\ncontent-to-world fit. Yet, until such a belief, produced by an\naccredited means, matches other beliefs in the existing network, the\nbelief cannot be known / believed to be true nor the means of\ngeneration can be warranted. The same theory applies to scientific\nknowledge. They specifically mention the case of Āyurveda or the\nscience of medicine. Āyurveda is considered a science because\nAyurvedic prescriptions lead to successful action. When a sick man is\ncured by following the prescription of his doctor, he infers the truth\nof the utterance of his doctor and gradually gains confidence in\nĀyurveda as a science. \nThe Naiyāyikas address the question of ratification in the\ncontext of scriptural injunctions. No knowledge is, according to them,\nself-justified, and scriptural prescriptions are no exception, but\nthey are also not empirically testable. Vācaspati Miśra\nsuggests that scriptural injunctions can be verified by trading on\ntheir similarity with medicinal prescriptions: like medicinal\nprescriptions, scriptural prescriptions are also acceptable, since\nboth are uttered by an infallible speaker. It is interesting to note\nin this context that one of the premises of the argument that God is\ninfallible ultimately rests on another accredited belief-generating\nprocess, viz., reliable testimony or authority. And again, when the\nauthority as a means of valid cognition is questioned, there is a fall\nback on inference. Many a times we see the Naiyāyikas paying\nscant attention to obviously circular reasoning. This cannot be due to\ntheir inadvertence or ignorance. Rather, like true naturalists, they\nfavour repairing their boat while still floating. And significantly,\nat no stage in their rebuttal of scepticism do they resort to an\ninternalist mode of justification. \nThe naturalism of the Naiyāyikas can be thrown into relief by\ntheir dispute with Mādhyamika Buddhists. The Mādhyamikas\nplay the role of sceptic against the metaphysical realism of\nNyāya. Nāgārjuna points out that a Naiyāyika\ncannot establish the pramāṇa-hood of a pramāṇa\nby means of another pramāṇa for that will lead to an\ninfinite regress. Nor can the Naiyāyika establish it by pointing\nout its reliable character because that will lead to circularity (a\npiece of cognition is said to be pramā when it is produced by a\nreliable pramāṇa; to establish the reliability of a\npramāṇa by referring to the fact that it has always been\nsufficient for generating a pramā is obviously circular). This\nobjection would have been irrefutable if the Naiyāyikas had only\none kind of pramā and one kind of pramāṇa in their\nepistemic repertoire. But as the Naiyāyikas admit four different\npramāṇas for four different types of pramā, they can\nalways fall back on other pramāṇas when the reliability of\none is questioned: to justify perception, one might take recourse to\ninference, and again to justify inference one can rely on verbal\ncognition. As to establishing the reliability of the verbal cognition,\nthey appeal to inference. As Quine once said, ‘Such scruples\nagainst circularity have little points once we have stopped dreaming\nof deducing sciences from observation. If we are simply to understand\nthe link between observation and science, we are well advised to use\nany available information, including that provided by the very science\nwhose link with observation we are seeking to understand.’ A\nnaturalist need not be afraid of circularity. \nMoral naturalism has two characteristic features: first, moral facts\nare considered to be natural facts; second, moral facts can causally\ninfluence the physical world as well as human experience. Both these\nfeatures are present in the moral theories of many of the classical\nsystems of Indian philosophy. \nThe doctrine of karma is a foundational thesis of Indian moral\nphilosophy. According to the doctrine of karma, every action gives\nrise to some consequence; a good act leads to good consequence and a\nbad act to bad consequence: every human agent has to reap the\nconsequences of his/ her actions. One is sure to be rewarded or\npunished for one’s good or wrong deeds. A just moral scheme\nrequires that one should never suffer or enjoy the consequences of\nanother’s action. The burden of moral responsibility for\none’s deeds is thus to be borne by the individual. In spite of\nthis, most Indians believed and still believe that even if our present\nactions are causally necessitated by our past actions, our present\nactions can be free. \nThe validity of the doctrine, however, has often been doubted on\nempirical grounds. For, it is a common sight that saintly people\nsuffer in their life, while habitual wrongdoers enjoy happiness. To\naccount for such anomalies, a theory of rebirth is tagged to the\nkarma-doctrine. The logic is somewhat like this: since nothing comes\nfrom nothing, one must have done something good in the past, in this\nlife or some other life, if one is happy; and, on the other hand, if\none suffers then one must have done something wicked, if not in this\nlife then in some other previous life. Although, with the exception of\na few parapsychologists, nobody claims to have any scientific evidence\nfor rebirth, yet this is a rational justification of the belief in\nrebirth on the assumption that the universe is law-governed. The\noverarching law that the philosophers in India believed in was called\nṛta—the principle of cosmic order or harmony that\n‘makes science possible, the world beautiful and the humans\nmoral’. Ṛta is the principle underlying the\n‘finely-tuned universe’, the transgression of which leads\nto sin. It represents the totality of physical and moral laws, which\neven the gods are bound to obey. The law of karma follows from\nṛta as the causal basis of the phenomenal world. God is\nconstrained so to act as to keep in view the accumulated karma of\nindividuals, yet to bear fruit. \nKarma is standardly divided into three types in Indian thought: (1)\nthat which has started to bear fruit (prārabdha) and cannot be\ndiverted or stopped in the middle of its course; (2) that which is\nbeing performed now the consequence of which is being credited for\nfuture fruition (sañcīyamāna); and (3) that which has\nbeen accumulated but yet to start yielding results (sañcita). A\nvery apt illustration available in the literature is that of an archer\nwith his quiver full of arrows. The arrow which has been shot by the\narcher is like the first type, the arrow that the archer holds in his\nhand in a state of readiness is like the second type, and the arrows\nin the quiver, yet unused, are like the third type. It is evident that\nthe explanation of human acts being provided by the law of karma is a\ncausal explanation. Perrett 1998, p. 73 comments that ‘just as\ncausal principle exhorts us to keep seeking explanations for physical\noccurrences, so the karmic principle exhorts us to keep looking for\nexplanations for “moral” events.’ \nThe Mīmāṃsaka-s admit the doctrine of karma but\nsupports non-naturalism in moral context. They believe in two causal\nrealms — ritual and natural and according to them the ritual\norder is independent of the natural order. In fact the causal\nconnection that obtains between a ritual enjoined by the scripture and\nits result cannot be explained naturally, e.g., how the correct\nperformance of putreśṭi sacrifice fulfills one’s\ndesire for a son is beyond natural and scientific explanation\n(Chatterjee 2016). \nNyāya thinkers seek to relate the principle of karma with the\natomistic conception of nature described above, but in doing so might\nappear to compromise their commitment of metaphysical naturalism.\nIndividuals can enjoy or suffer the consequences of their actions only\nduring their embodied existence in the world. Atoms, therefore,\ncombine to form such a world as individuals deserve because of their\npast deeds. When accumulated merits and demerits become ready for\nfruition, they can impart motion to atoms. To admit an unseen force as\na cause of atomic motion, identified with the accumulated merits and\ndemerits of individual beings, might seem to run against a commitment\nto naturalism. Yet the idea that there is unbroken chain of causal\nconnection within the empirical world spanning across different lives\nsituates the postulated ‘unseen force’ itself within the\nboundaries of the natural world. Mohanty (1992, p. 222) observes that\n‘if actions of the self and the moral forces\n(adṛṣṭa) generated by actions account for empirical\nnature’s manifestation or creation, then ultimately nature is\nboth natural and moral: the two order coincides.’","contact.mail":"chatterjeeamita@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
