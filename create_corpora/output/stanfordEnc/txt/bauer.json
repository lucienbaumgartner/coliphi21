His career falls into two main phases,\ndivided by the Revolutions of 1848.  In the 1840s, the period known as\nthe Vormärz or the prelude to the German revolutions of March\n1848, Bauer was a leader of the Left-Hegelian movement, developing a\nrepublican interpretation of Hegel, which combined ethical and\naesthetic motifs. His theory of infinite self-consciousness, derived\nfrom Hegel’s account of subjective spirit, stressed rational autonomy\nand historical progress.  Investigating the textual sources of\nChristianity, Bauer described religion as a form of alienation, which,\nbecause of the deficiencies of earthly life, projected irrational,\ntranscendent powers over the self, while sanctioning particularistic\nsectarian and material interests. He criticized the Restoration state,\nits social and juridical base, and its orthodox religious\nideology. Analyzing the emergence of modern mass society, he rejected\nliberalism for its inconsequent opposition to the existing order, and\nfor its equation of freedom with property, but he accused socialism of\nan inadequate appreciation of individual autonomy.  After the defeats\nof 1848, Bauer repudiated Hegel. He predicted a general crisis of\nEuropean civilization, caused by the exhaustion of philosophy and the\nfailure of liberal and revolutionary politics. New prospects of\nliberation would, he believed, issue from the crisis. His late\nwritings examined the emergence of Russia as a world power, opening an\nera of global imperialism and war. These writings influenced\nNietzsche’s thinking on cultural renewal. Friedrich Engels and Karl\nKautsky claimed Bauer’s religious criticism for the socialist\nmovement, while the anti-traditionalist conservatism of his late work\ninfluenced the thought of Carl Schmitt in the twentieth century.\n\n Bruno Bauer was born on 6 September, 1809 in the town of Eisenberg\nin Thuringia, south-eastern Germany. In 1815, Bauer’s family\nmoved to Berlin, where his father was employed in the royal porcelain\nfactory in Charlottenburg. At the University of Berlin\n(1828–1834),he studied under Hegel, Schleiermacher, and the\nHegelians Hotho and Marheineke. On Hegel’s recommendation,\nBauer’s 1829 essay on Kant’s aesthetics won the Prussian\nroyal prize in philosophy. From 1834 to 1839, he lectured on theology\nand biblical texts in Berlin. He was transferred to the theology\nfaculty at Bonn after publishing an attack on his colleague and former\nteacher Hengstenberg. He taught in Bonn from 1839 till spring 1842,\nwhen he was dismissed for the unorthodoxy of his writings on the New\nTestament. The dismissal followed a consultation by the ministry of\neducation with the theology faculties of the six Prussian universities,\nbut no consensus emerged from the academic inquest. The order for\nBauer’s dismissal came directly from the King of Prussia,\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, who had decreed the suspension from state\nemployment of participants in a banquet to honour the South German\nliberal Karl Welcker, held in Berlin in 1841. On that occasion, Bauer\nhad proposed a toast to Hegel’s conception of the state. \n\nFrom 1842 to 1849, Bauer was active in political journalism and\nhistorical research on the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. He\nargued against the emancipation of Prussian Jews in 1842–43, seeing\nthis proposal as a political legitimation of particular religious\ninterests. He was the object of polemical attacks by Marx and Engels in\nThe Holy Family (1844) and The German Ideology\n(written in 1845–46). With his brother Edgar, Bauer founded the\nCharlottenburg Democratic Society in 1848, and stood unsuccessfully for\nelection to the Prussian National Assembly on a platform of popular\nsovereignty. \n\nRemaining in Prussia after the defeats of 1848–49, Bauer continued\nto produce work of biblical criticism and political analysis. He wrote\nin the mid 1850s for Die Zeit, a government-sponsored\nnewspaper, in which his anti-liberalism took a conservative turn. He\ncontributed articles on European affairs to other newspapers, such as\nDie Post, the Kleines Journal, and the New York\nDaily Tribune. From 1859–66 he collaborated with F.W.H. Wagener on\nhis conservative Staats- und Gesellschafts-Lexikon, editing\nalmost all 23 volumes, and writing numerous articles, several with\nanti-Semitic themes. In 1865 he acquired a small farm in Rixdorf, on\nthe outskirts of Berlin. He died there on 13 April 1882. \n\nBauer was a prolific writer, publishing a dozen substantial books\nand over 60 articles between 1838 and 1848 alone, but no critical\nedition of these works exists. They included analyses of Hegel, the\nBible, modern theologies, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution\nand its aftermath. The interpretation of Bauer’s work is problematic\nfor several reasons. Because of anonymous, pseudonymous, and\ncollaborative publication, some attributions are disputed; and\ndivergences exist between Bauer’s published texts and private\ncorrespondence. In the anonymous Trumpet of the Last Judgement\n(1841) and Hegel’s Doctrine of Religion and Art (1842), Bauer\nspoke not in his own voice, but in the ironic guise of a conservative\ncritic of Hegel, attributing to Hegel his own revolutionary views. \n\nThree lines of interpretation of Bauer can be distinguished. These\nfocus on his early work; his later writings have attracted little\ncritical attention. The first sees Bauer as a radical subjectivist,\nwhose social and religious criticism was closer to Enlightenment\nrationalism than to Hegel (Sass, 1978; Brudney, 1998). The second,\nlargely influenced by Marx, insists on Bauer’s abandonment of the\nHegelian left after 1843 (Rossi, 1974; Pepperle, 1978). The third\nemphasizes the continuity throughout the Vormärz of Bauer’s\nthought and of his republicanism, based on the Hegelian idea of the\nunity of thought and being (Moggach, 2003, 2006, 2011). \n\nBauer’s prize manuscript of 1829, De pulchri principiis,\npresented the unity of concept and objectivity as the central idea of\nHegel’s idealism. It examined this unity as expressed in art, comparing\nHegel’s aesthetic theory to Kant’s Third Critique. The manuscript\nsupplemented the criticisms of Kant from Hegel’s Berlin Aesthetics\nlectures with the logical analysis of categories provided by the 1827\nEncyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. Bauer argued\nthat while the Critique of Judgement attempted to bridge the\ngap between thought and being, and thus opened the way to Hegel, it\nreproduced the antinomies characteristic of the first two\ncritiques. Kant’s synthesis failed, since he continued to define the\nconcept as merely subjective, and the object as the unknowable\nthing-in-itself, transcending the cognitive power. Self-consciousness,\nor the subject of the transcendental unity of apperception, was\nlikewise impervious to cognition from the Kantian standpoint. In\nHegel’s syllogisms of the idea, objectivity attained rational form,\nwhile the concept acquired an explicit, material existence. Beauty,\nlife, and idea were moments in the process which constituted the\nactuality of reason. As the immediate unity of thought and\nobjectivity, art illustrated the inexhaustible fecundity of the\nphilosophical Idea. The manuscript underlined the opposition of faith\nand reason in its critique of the religious conceptions of the unity\nof thought and being. Faith was taken to be inimical to free inquiry,\nwhich is the element of reason. \n\nThroughout the 1830s, however, Bauer sought to reconcile thought\nand being through the idea of rational faith. In Zeitschrift\nfür spekulative Theologie, which he edited between 1836 and\n1838, and in Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche\nKritik, he offered a speculative account of Christian doctrines as\nexemplifications of logical categories. In the 1838 Religion of the\nOld Testament, Bauer depicted religious experience as a product of\nself-consciousness. He proposed both a transcendental account,\nstressing the conditions of possibility of religious experiences, and a\nphenomenological sequence of their forms: a legalistic subordination to\nan authoritarian deity in the early books of the Old Testament\nexpressed a merely external relation between God and man, while the\nmessianic consciousness of later books heralded a higher form, the\nimmanence of the universal in the community; but this consciousness\ncould only point up the inadequacy of the law, not yet propose the\neffective overcoming of estrangement. The texts of the 1830s located\nthe logical structure which, for Bauer, defined the religious\nconsciousness: the immediate identity between particularity, whether of\na subject or a community, and the abstract universal, a unity achieved\nwithout self-transformation. By 1839, Bauer deduced the political\nimplications of this view: the religious consciousness asserted this\nimmediate identity as a monopolistic, sectarian claim, excluding other\nparticulars from equivalent status. The essence of religion for Bauer\nwas now a hubristic particularism, which also conferred a transcendent\nstatus on the universal, as a realm divorced from concrete social\nrelationships. This position received its fullest exposition in Bauer’s\nChristianity Revealed (1843). He already sketched this\nargument in Herr Dr. Hengstenberg, of 1839, publicly breaking\nwith orthodox and conservative versions of Christianity, and stressing\nthe discontinuity between Christianity and Judaism. By 1840–41, Bauer\nwould present the emancipated philosophical self-consciousness as\nopposed to all forms of religious representation. His political\nradicalism and republicanism were cemented by his recognition of the\nstructural identity between the private interests fostered by the\nRestoration order, and the monopolistic religious consciousness. \n\nBauer’s political and theoretical radicalization is evidenced in his\nbiblical studies. The series is comprised of Critique of the Gospel\nof John (1840), and the three-volume Critique of the Synoptic\nGospels (1840– 42). Together with his 1838 study of the Old\nTestament, these volumes criticized the stages of revealed religion,\nand forms of self-alienated spirit in history. Bauer’s critique of\nJohn’s gospel demonstrated the opposition between the free\nself-consciousness and the religious spirit. His stated purpose was to\nrestore the Christian principle to its source in creative\nself-consciousness; he did not yet openly oppose the principle itself,\nbut sought to differentiate it, as a rational idea, from ecclesiastical\ndogmatism. The positivity of Christianity derived from the abstract\nunderstanding, rather than from speculative reason, which led religious\nexperience back to its subjective roots. The rational core of\nChristianity was the identity of God and man, but theology had built an\nuntenable doctrinal system on this foundation. Speculation now\nundermined dogma; it was not confirmed by it, as Bauer’s mid-1830s\narticles had maintained. In his correspondence, though not in this text\nitself, Bauer indicated that this restoration of the Christian\nprinciple was also its overthrow, as the unity of universal and\nparticular could now be grasped in more tangible and earthly forms.\nChristianity was a necessary but now transcended stage in the\ndevelopment of the human spirit, to be supplanted by new expressions of\nautonomous self-consciousness. \n\nIn his critique of the Synoptics, Bauer’s object was more openly to\nnegate dogmatic Christianity, mobilized in defence of the absolutist\norder. The incidents described in the gospels were products of the\nreligious consciousness, rather than factual reports. Bauer’s critique\nof John convinced him that the gospel narrative was a purely literary\nproduct, and he now argued that the Synoptics too contained no\nhistorically authentic material. Bauer attempted to establish the\nhistorical priority of Mark, and the specific elaborations undertaken\nsequentially by Luke and Matthew. He depicted miracles as fallaciously\ndisplaying the immediate causality of the universal in nature, and\ncriticized the naturalistic explanations favoured by theological\nrationalism. The third volume of the series denied the historicity of\nChrist. The Christian idea that God and mankind share the same essence\nappeared as the religious representation of a single empirical\nindividual who assumed the universal power of spirit. Like his\ncontemporaries D.F. Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, Bauer understood this\nsynthesis instead as a project immanent in human history. As Bauer’s\npolitical writings from this period show, he proposed that the\nassumption of universality, and the transcendence of particular\ninterest, were historical tasks, undertaken by the state and the\nrepublican citizenry. In the Synoptics texts, Bauer explicitly equated\nChristianity and feudalism, and defended the freedom and equality of\nself-consciousness. Religion and the absolutist state were mutually\nsustaining, sharing the essential features of alienation and\nrepression. Christianity represented the completion of the religious\nconsciousness in pure abstraction, and the dissolution of all genuine ethical\nbonds. Bauer contended that Judaism presupposed the subordination of\nnature to religious interests, but still maintained the natural links\nof kinship and ethnicity. Christianity eliminated this limited\nSittlichkeit in favour of the purely abstract self, thus\nperfecting alienation and requiring its definitive resolution. \n\nThe political application of the doctrine of self-consciousness can be\ntraced through two texts on the state, also dating from\n1840–41. In The Evangelical State Church of Prussia and\nScience, Bauer described the essence of the state as free\ndevelopment. The state was the dialectical agency of historical\nprogress and of the universality of the will, manifesting the capacity\nto abstract from any given content and express itself in ever new\nforms. While signalling empirical tendencies which might limit the\nstate’s progressive function (the prominence of religious\ninterests, and hesitancy before the social question, the emergence of\nnew forms of urban poverty and exclusion), Bauer contended that the\ngenuine state, as the expression of freedom, was in constant\ntransformation. His surface claim was that the Prussian state is such\nan institution, though his contemporary correspondence belied this\nview. He defended the 1817 union of the Lutheran and Reformed churches\nin Prussia as the political overcoming of religious oppositions, whose\nbasis had been eroded by the Enlightenment. Through its (still\nabstract) grasp of the universal concept of man, against religious\nparticularity, the Enlightenment had transformed religious\nconsciousness into self-consciousness. (This process formed one of the\nmajor themes of Bauer’s Christianity Revealed, along\nwith a critique of French materialism for its inadequate grasp of\nfreedom). The churches were now impotent to perpetuate their own\nexistence without the support of the state.  Countering conservative\nhistorians like F.J. Stahl, who championed the independence of the\nchurches, Bauer’s “The Christian State and Our\nTimes,” of 1841, again identified the state as the focus of\nethical life. Stahl’s position implied a derogation of the\nspirituality of the state, presenting it as an agency of external\nconstraint, to uphold the orthodox ecclesiastical and political order\nagainst the flow of history, and to defend a social order governed by\nirrational privileges and immunities. Bauer denounced not only the\nChristian state of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, but also the\nformal Rechtsstaat, or liberal constitutionalism. For Bauer,\nboth these positions defined freedom as private interest, religious or\neconomic; but as particularity, these attitudes had to be purged away\nin the name of a new political order. Bauer maintained that\nHegel’s view of freedom as universality was far in advance of\nliberal views, even if the\nPhilosophy of Right was inconsistent or incomplete. This was\nBauer’s provocative claim at the Welcker banquet of 1841, which\noccasioned his dismissal from the university. The elimination of\negoistic atomism by moral self-consciousness was the pre-requisite for\nthe republic, or the free state. Bauer contended that the existing\nsocial order could not be deemed to be thoroughly rational, nor the\nstate to be the institution of freedom that it ought to be, as long as\nthe social question of urban destitution remained unresolved.  \n\nThe anonymous Trumpet of the Last Judgement, or\nPosaune (November, 1841), and its sequel, Hegel’s\nDoctrine of Religion and Art (1842), interpreted Hegel as\nsounding a call for revolution, to bring this state into being. Bauer\nclaimed that the consequences of Hegel’s system were the overthrow of\nchurch and state; and that Hegel’s conservative critics were right to\nsee him as the most dangerous adversary of the Restoration. Written\nironically as pietistic denunciations, Bauer’s two texts attributed to\nHegel a theory of infinite self-consciousness, in which the concept of\nsubstance and a transcendent absolute were necessary but\nself-annulling illusions.  Recapitulating the issue in his own voice\nin 1845, Bauer identified a tension in Hegel’s thought between Spinoza\nand Fichte, between inert, undifferentiated substance and creative\nform. The Posaune, however, argued that the Spinozist moment,\nthough necessary to Hegel’s dialectic, was fully assimilated to\ninfinite self-consciousness. In absolute spirit, properly understood,\nall religious pretensions dissipated, while the absolute itself\ndissolved into the critical activities of conscious individual\nsubjects. Nothing transcendent remained. Yet, the Posaune\nrecognized, Hegel also stressed the concept of substance. Its role had\nto be accounted for. In its apparent transcendence, substance\ndisciplined the immediate, particular self.  This was necessary\nbecause, as Hegel argued, particularity cannot be the criterion of\ntheoretical or practical reason; rather, individuals must first\ninternalize substance, as a principle of universality, as a stage in\nreaching infinite self-consciousness. The undifferentiated, pure\nuniversal of substance subsumed all particularity, including the\nself. This initial, Spinozist moment created an appearance of\npantheism in Hegel, which misled interpreters like D. F. Strauss. In\nBauer’s depiction, however, Hegel proceeded to dissolve substantiality\nas a power independent of consciousness. This dialectical resolution\nwas not equivalent to renouncing objectivity, but meant that\nsubstance, once it had demonstrated to the particular consciousness\nthe need to transcend itself, might not claim an immediate validity\neither. Disciplining their own immediate interests, individuals could\nthen become the organs through which the universal attained conscious\nform. The dialectical illusion of substance was a necessary stage,\nbecause in it the unity of concept and objectivity could first be\nglimpsed; but this illusion had to be overcome in further historical\nand theoretical development. The subject must appear as potentially\nuniversal, and the objective must show itself as a purposive order,\nresponding to the subject’s striving for rational freedom. This\ndevelopment entailed transforming substance into the record of the\nacts of conscious spirit, an inner relation of self-consciousness to\nitself.  Subjectivity thus assimilated the principle of universality,\nwhich it now contained as its own character, not as something alien to\nit. But this relation was not confined to an inward experience, since,\nas Hegel maintained, reason must realize itself in the world. The\nexternalization of reason produced a historical sequence, including\nthe forms of alienated life.  The stages in this sequence could be\ngrasped as moments in the unfolding unity of thought and being. Bauer\ndescribed self-consciousness, conceived as an immanent and subjective\nuniversality, as the motive force of history, generating historical\ncontent by taking up and transforming the given. As Bauer’s 1829\nmanuscript had also declared, at stake was not only the subjective\nrealisation of the concept, but the fate of the idea, the unity of\nthought and being; and this required that the objectivity of the\nhistorical process be equally emphasized. This historical and critical\nidealism, which the Posaune attributes to Hegel, was politically\nrevolutionary: it affirmed the rights of free self-consciousness\nagainst any positive institution which could not justify its existence\nbefore rational thinking, against state, religion, and social\nhierarchy. \n\nBauer used his central concept of infinite self-consciousness, a\nterm taken from Hegel’s theory of subjective spirit, to reconfigure the\nHegelian absolute, bringing art and philosophy into close proximity,\nand excluding religion as a form of alienated reason, while recognising\nits past historical necessity. Bauer insisted on the immanence of the\nuniversal in history, as the record of struggles for liberation, and of\nalienation, which was necessary to discover the meaning of rational\nautonomy. Bauer’s ethical idealism resembles a doctrine that Kant calls\nperfectionism, or Vollkommenheit, a form of rational\nheteronomy, one of whose meanings is that action is validated by its\ncontribution to historical progress. Bauer equated perfectionism and\nautonomy, as an uncompromising commitment to remodel political and\nsocial relations and institutions. Subjects acquired autonomy by\nfreeing themselves from particular interests, and by repudiating\ntranscendent universals, religious and political institutions which\nclaimed to be underivable from self-consciousness, and exempt from\nhistory. Bauer denounced the ancien régime and its\nRestoration surrogates as a feudal system of tutelage and irrational\nprivileges. Arrogating universality to itself, the authoritarian state\nwhich arose over these exclusive particulars thwarted the self-activity\nof its people, and concealed the source of its authority behind a veil\nof religious sanctification. Bauer maintained that the state, and not\nreligion, was the principal adversary. Against this order of alienated\nspirit, he insisted that the decisive political question was the source\nof the state’s authority, whether in tradition and religious sanction,\nor in the popular will. This question was to be resolved without\ncompromise. Bauer asserted that his objective was not merely political,\nbut social emancipation. The social question, the polarizations and\ncrises of civil society to which Hegel had been alert, could be\nresolved not by direct appeals to the particular interests of one\nclass, but by a common republican struggle against multiform privilege.\nThe result of this combat would be the attainment of justice in all\nspheres of social life. \n\nTwo texts, dating from late 1842 and early 1843, The Jewish\nQuestion, and “The Capacity of Present-Day Jews and\nChristians to Become Free,” elaborate Bauer’s critique of the\nreligious consciousness and of political reformism. The consequence of\ntheir publication, however, was that Bauer forfeited his leading\nposition in the opposition movement, as he challenged one of its\ncentral demands. The question was whether the explicitly Christian\nstate of Prussia could eliminate restrictions on Jewish participation\nin civil institutions. While liberals and republicans advocated\nemancipation, conservative opponents defended the state’s exclusive\nconfessional allegiance. Bauer’s interventions attacked the state for\ndefending privilege, and claimed that it used religion as a mask for\nits interests in maintaining relations of subordination; but he also\ncriticized Jews and their supporters for claiming freedom on the basis\nof a particular religious identity. Political and social freedom required the\nrenunciation of all particularistic ties with the past; thus, as a\nprecondition of juridical equality, Jews must renounce their religious\nallegiance, as must Christians. Christianity demonstrated a\nhistorically higher degree of consciousness, since it cancelled the\nexternality of the deity. But this was not a unilateral progress upon\nJudaism, because Christianity, and especially Protestantism,\ngeneralized alienation to encompass all aspects of life. The\nsuperiority of Christianity consisted in its radical negativity, making\nrequisite a transition to a new and higher form of ethical life. By\nexacerbating the contradiction between self-determination and\nself-abasement, the way was cleared for an epochal resolution. These\ninterventions were censured by Marx, and by leading liberal spokesmen.\nBauer remained adamant that his position was the correct progressive\nstance. \n\nIn his studies of the French Revolution and its impact on Germany,\nBauer traced the emergence of mass society, based on conformity and\ninchoate particularism. The dissolution of the feudal estates by the\nRevolution produced a purely atomistic society, characterized by the\nassertion of individual property right. The attachment to private\neconomic interest made impossible a concerted opposition to privilege\nand to the existing order, and had caused the ultimate defeat of the\nrevolutions that had spawned it. The Jacobinism of the French\nRevolution, which Bauer in many ways endorsed, had been directed\nagainst this attitude, but had failed to overcome it; and this\nproprietary particularism now threatened the republican movement of\nthe Vormärz. The masses, encompassing both the proletariat and\nthe bourgeoisie, represented inertia and stagnation, and formed the\nbulwark of the existing order. Their opposition to this order was\nmerely apparent.  Liberalism unconsciously expressed this development\nof mass society, defining freedom as acquisition. Bauer criticized\nliberal constitutionalism as a vacillating, compromising attitude\ntoward the feudal regime. Even in its most advanced form, that\nendorsed by Hegel, constitutionalism juxtaposed two diametrically\nopposed principles of sovereignty, popular and princely, and was\nunable to resolve the contention between them. Incipient socialism\nshared the same terrain as liberalism, the defence of private\ninterest, but proposed inconsequent and unacceptable solutions to the\nconditions which liberalism simply affirmed. For Bauer, socialism was\nirredeemably heteronomous. The socialist movement, he claimed, sought\nto organize the workers in their immediate, particular existence, and\nnot to transform them. He saw in the proletariat pure particularity,\nand, unlike Marx, denied that this particularity could transform\nitself into a genuine universal unless it first renounced its own\nsectional interests. Bauer also anticipated the negative effects of a\nsocialist organization of labour. While criticizing capitalism for its\nirrational competitive forms, he defended the principle of competition\nitself as a necessary condition for progress, the independence of\npersons, and the possibility of conscious, free\nself-determination. Bauer’s pre-1848 work revived the classical\nrepublican themes of the opposition of commerce and virtue, but gave\nthem a new shape, consistent with his Hegelianism. In 1842–43,\nBauer confidently predicted the triumph of republican principles and\ninstitutions, though this confidence waned as the political crisis\ndeepened. In his two electoral addresses of 1848–49, he defended\npopular sovereignty and the right of revolution, demanding that the\nnew constitution be promulgated as an act of revolutionary will, and\nnot received as a concession from the king. He also intensified his\ncritique of socialism for promoting heteronomy and dependency rather\nthan personal initiative and self-determination, and for appealing to\nthe existing, discredited absolutist state for the redress of social\ngrievances, rather than opposing this state with unbending\nresolution.  \n\nWhile he continued to proclaim the continuity of his thought,\nBauer’s late work was characterized by the definitive abandonment of\nhis Vormärz republicanism. The failure of 1848, he argued,\ndemonstrated the bankruptcy of the European philosophical tradition.\nInstead of the triumph of republics, Bauer now foresaw an age of global\nimperialism. The decisive political question after 1848 was the rise of\nRussia. Bauer predicted that Russian pressure would promote a\npan-European union, as a stage in a movement toward a global\nabsolutism. The revolutionaries of 1848 still presupposed,\nuncritically, that states were independent units. The next historical\nperiod would initiate a genuine continental crisis. Anticipating\nNietzsche, Bauer contended that the impending collapse of European\ncivilisation would make possible a new beginning, a liberation from\ntraditional forms and values, together with their metaphysical and\nreligious sanctions. Bauer’s abiding opposition to liberalism now\ninduced him to collaborate in conservative causes; but his conservatism\nwas unconventional. Like Nietzsche, he continued to repudiate tradition\nand religion. Because of his anti-Semitism, Bauer was claimed as a\nprecursor by some National-Socialist authors, though Ernst Barnikol,\nfor example, disputes a direct connection (Barnikol 1972, pp.\n350–53). \n\nFor Bauer, the revolutions of 1848 were so closely connected with\nthe Enlightenment, Kantian, and Hegelian projects that their failure\nsounded the death-knell of philosophy and its claims to rational\nindividual autonomy. Bauer’s late critique assimilated Hegel with\nSpinoza and the metaphysics of substance, understood as the negation of\nform and subjectivity. Unlike his Vormärz position, he asserted in\ntexts of 1852 and 1853 that Hegel had yielded to the influence of\nSpinoza, effacing individuality, and submerging concrete particulars\nunder illusory, abstract logical categories. Bauer now described the\nHegelian idea as being itself a transcendent illusion. Its inability to admit\nconcrete particulars derived from the substantiality of the system\nitself. The result was that Hegel had discounted individuality in\nfavour of conformity. While prior to 1848 Bauer proclaimed that Hegel\nhad taught “the republic and the revolution,” he now decried the\nabsolutist tendencies of the Hegelian system, whose oppressive unity\nparalleled the historical trend toward an all-encompassing political\ndespotism. Bauer accused philosophy of contributing to an inexorable\nprocess of levelling and uniformity in the post-revolutionary state\n(Bauer, Russland und das Germanenthum, I, pp. 40–54). These\ncriticisms anticipated Rudolph Haym’s polemic in Hegel und seine\nZeit (1857). \n\nIn common with many post-1848 intellectuals, Bauer’s abandonment of\nmetaphysics led him to a new conception of critique as a positive\nscience or empirical investigation. Bauer no longer contended that\nhistory represents an unfolding dialectic of self-consciousness.\nCritique was to permit the observer to examine historical phenomena\nwithout distortion or partiality, and without an a priori systemic\nconcern. Bauer maintained that scientific research must remain\nindependent of ecclesiastical and political tutelage. Its objective\nwas to determine the relation of nature to rights and freedom of the\nwill (concepts which the late Bauer retained, while rejecting their\nmetaphysical foundations); but critique did not enjoin practical\nintervention in political affairs. The correct stance was now\ndisinterested contemplation of the inevitable processes of cultural\ndecay and regeneration, and an attempt to salvage one’s own\nindependence from the general wreckage of philosophical systems and\npolitical life. \n\nThe conclusion of this new critique was that the future belonged not\nto the republican people, or to separate national states, but to a\ntransnational imperialism, involving the confrontation of two\nabsolutist programmes. In one of these, the Western European,\npolitical absolutism arose over modern mass society as its necessary\ncomplement.  Bauer had earlier criticized this configuration as an\noutmoded form of state, to be supplanted by the republic; he now\ndescribed it as the result of an incomplete political development,\nwhich would issue in a contention for world domination. Within the\nWestern European form, Bauer distinguished two variants: Bismarck’s\nstate socialism, imitating eighteenth-century Prussian militarism,\nattempted to subject economic production to political control,\nsuppressing innovation and personal independence; while Disraeli’s\nromantic imperialism sought to level and subordinate English society\nbefore a paternalistic monarchy. In opposition to the west, the second\nmajor absolutist form was that of Russia, a substantial power with\nlimited internal distinctions. Its cohesiveness derived from the\nfusion of political and ecclesiastical power, and the absence of the\nmodern idea of subjectivity. Bauer noted that Hegel had mistakenly\ndiscounted this zone from world history. Like the anarchist Michael\nBakunin, Bauer claimed that Russia owed its original state formation\nto Germany; but Russia had otherwise been impervious to western\nphilosophical influence, adopting only what served its immediate,\nconcrete ends. Animated by hatred and shame of its past\ninsignificance, Russia too was ambivalent. It did not directly provide\nthe solution to the contemporary political crisis, but elicited a\ndecisive struggle with the west. The vigour of an alien adversary\nwould force Europe to transform itself, and offered the only remaining\nprospects of a cultural renewal. Preceding any such renewal would be\nthe extension of imperialism across the continent and the globe, and\nthe clash of rivals for dominance within the new empire. Bauer\nconcluded that world war was inevitable. \n\nBauer’s prognosis anticipated aspects of Karl Kautsky’s 1915 theory\nof ultraimperialism, though without the latter’s optimism that this\ntrend heralded a reduction in conflicts among contenders for hegemony.\nImperialism, moreover, did not stimulate, but hampered economic growth,\nsince insecurity and permanent military mobilization undermined\nproductive activity. The historic function of the globalizing process\nwas to eliminate national identities, laying the basis for an eventual\ncosmopolitan rebirth. Bauer saw nationalism as a dissipated force. The\nemerging world order was framed not by the defence of national\ninterests, but by a struggle for transnational supremacy among elites\nwith no local loyalties. The growing centralization of political power\nwas abetted by the levelling forces of the socialist movement, with its\nown internationalist pretensions. This trend also underlay what Bauer\ncalled political pauperism, a generalised disqualification of\nindividuals from participation in political activity. The conclusion of\nthis process would be to perfect mass society, which Bauer had analyzed\nsince the 1840s. The principle of substance, non-differentiation, and\nconformity would reach its ultimate extension, and could then be\noverthrown. World imperialism would issue in an all-embracing\ncatastrophe, the apocalyptic end of the old, Christian-Germanic order.\nOnly then would new cultural possibilities emerge. Though these could\nnot be predicted in detail, they would involve the emergence of an\nunprecedented creative individuality, freed from religious and\nmetaphysical illusions. \n\nBauer likened the present crisis to the end of the classical world\nin Roman imperialism. His studies in the 1850s located the origins of\nChristianity in the second century CE, concluding that the first\ngospel was written under Hadrian (117–138 CE), though slightly predated\nby some of the Pauline epistles. Bauer traced the evolution of\nChristian ideas from Hellenism and Stoicism, deriving the logos\ndoctrine of John’s gospel from Philo and neo-Platonic sources. As in\nHerr Dr. Hengstenberg, he denied that Christianity had emerged\ndirectly from Judaism. More than in his early work, though, he now\nstressed the revolutionary power of the early Christian religion, as a\nsource of liberation for the excluded and impoverished elements of the\nRoman Empire. His final book described Christianity as the socialist\nculmination of Greek and Roman history. Responding to this argument in\nhis very positive obituary of Bauer, Friedrich Engels acknowledged the\nimportance of Bauer’s late work for the socialist critique of religion\n(Sozialdemokrat, 1882). In 1908, Karl Kautsky’s book, The\nOrigins of Christianity, applied Bauer’s thesis. \n\nBauer’s late writings identified sentiment and pietistic\nfeeling-certainty, rather than autonomous reason, as the principal\nforce in shaping modern subjectivity. His studies of the Quakers and of\npietism described passive inwardness and sentiment as the dominant\ncharacteristics of the German Enlightenment. The practical reason of\nKant and Fichte merely translated the inner voice of pietist conscience\ninto a rationalist idiom. Bauer also described pietism as the end of\nChristianity, since it destroyed dogma in favour of inner illumination\nand personal moral rectitude. Consistent with his Christianity\nRevealed, Bauer continued to define positive or statutory\nreligions by their exclusive dogmas and symbols; and he still saw the\ngeneral course of history as dissipating these dogmas, as mere\nillusions. He discounted the mobilizing potential of religion in the\nmodern imperial order. In the Posaune, he had denounced\nSchleiermacher’s efforts to restore dogmatic Christianity through an\nappeal to feelings of dependency. Now he claimed that the force of\nsentiment, contrary to Schleiermacher’s supposition, was to dissolve\ndogmatic religion into personal conviction. The new world empire would\nend with the inner erosion of religious belief. Not rational\nspeculation, but sentiment, would effect this transformation. \n\nA stringent anti-nationalism and a marked anti-Semitism\ncharacterized Bauer’s later thought. He defended German culture against\nits political appropriation by the Prussian and Austrian regimes, but\ncriticized its insufficiencies, in Goethe, for example, who remained\nenthralled to the metaphysical tradition. Bauer stressed that Germany\nwas not a racial unit, but a historical and cultural artefact,\nreinforced by racial mixing, and not by racial purity (Barnikol 1972,\np. 393). It is clear, however, that some elements were excluded from\nthe mix: unlike his earlier treatment of the Jewish question as\nhistorical, cultural, and religious, he now asserted that a natural\ndistinction of race created an impassable divide between Jews and\nEuropeans (Bauer, “Present Position of the Jews,” 1852).\nHis claim that the political significance of the Jews throughout the\npolitical spectrum was a testimony to the debility of European culture\nand to the approaching crisis was greeted by National-Socialist\nauthors. \n\nBauer’s late work contains prescient observations on globalization\nand world war, and has affinities with a variety of twentieth-century\nideological forms, from socialism to imperialism and anti-Semitism. In\ncontrast, his early work bespeaks an original, Hegelian republicanism,\nand offers cogent analyses of Restoration political thought and the\nrise of mass society. His intellectual legacy is complex and\ncontentious. Bauer’s bicentennary in September 2009 was the occasion for a\nthree-day international conference, held at the\nFriedrich-Schiller-Universität, Jena, and in Bauer’s nearby\nbirthplace of Eisenberg, to examine his problematic legacy for\nphilosophy, theology, and social thought. The conference sought to\nretrieve the complex theoretical debates underlying the collapse of\nthe Hegelian system. Bauer’s reformulation and radicalisation of Hegel\nwere contrasted with the criticisms of Ludwig Feuerbach, Max Stirner,\nand Karl Marx; and the specific character of his Vormärz\nradicalism was underlined, whether in his republicanism or in his\ntheological insights and critique. Disputed issues involved the\ncontent, continuity, and political bearing of Bauer’s pre-1848 works,\nhis relations with his contemporaries in the Hegelian School, the\nquestion of his anti-Semitism, and his attitudes toward imperialism\nand history after 1848. Also highlighted was the later Bauer’s\nreception by twentieth-century conservatives such as Carl Schmitt. The\nProceedings of the conference were published in 2010 (Kodalle and\nReitz, eds., 2010) Another aspect of recent Bauer research is a closer specification\nof his 1840’s perfectionist ethic, through the application to his\nthought of the concept of ‘post-Kantian perfectionism’\n(Moggach 2011). In Leibniz or Christian Wolff, pre-Kantian\nperfectionist doctrines, of Aristotelian inspiration, stressed the\nethical objective of happiness (broadly understood as material,\nintellectual, and spiritual wellbeing) and the complementarity of\nproperly understood individual interests. Post-Kantian perfectionism\nacknowledges Kant’s critique of these earlier eudaemonist forms\n(described by him as ‘rational heteronomy’), with their\nimplications of political tutelage and paternalistic\n‘enlightened despotism’. Unwilling to relinquish the\nterrain of self-fashioning and self-realisation, however, which Kant\ndepoliticises but retains in his doctrine of virtue, post-Kantian\nperfectionists like Schiller, Fichte, or Bauer seek a reformulation\nrather than a complete repudiation of perfectionist ethics, one that\nwould be compatible with modern republican forms of life.  Instead of\nhappiness, these new versions stress the central value of freedom as a\nprocess or a conquest. The end in light of which actions, relations,\nand legal forms and institutions can be assessed is rational\nself-determination and the promotion of the necessary political and\nsocial conditions of its exercise. Whereas the older perfectionism had\nin general envisaged the thriving of a relatively fixed human nature,\nthe post-Kantian versions stress the historical variability of\ncultural experiences and the determinability rather than the fixity of\nthe self, its openness to critique and self-conscious fashioning. In\ncontrast to older views, the harmony and complementarity of interests\nis a problematic task, an aspect of rational self-shaping, rather than\na preconceived given. The diversity and conflictual character of\nmodern life, the culture of diremption as Schiller and Hegel had\ndescribed it, must be taken into account as the material element of a\npost-Kantian perfectionist ethic. Bruno Bauer’s conceptions of history\nand emancipation in the 1840s, it has been argued, are consistent with\nthis approach. A contrasting tendency in recent research is to revive older views\nof the Hegelian School as a whole, or in particular of Bauer, as\nphilosophically vacuous and politically disengaged, or else\npolitically counterproductive. Such a view originated in Marx’s\ndevastating depictions in the Holy Family, in Arnold Ruge’s\npolemics with the Berlin Hegelians known as Die Freien (“The\nFree”) in late 1842–43, and in other contemporary sources\nsuch as Rudolf Haym (1857), who attributed the failures of the\nRevolution of 1848 to the excessive radicalism of Hegel’s\nyouthful followers.  An analogous judgement has recently been made on\nthe Hegelian movement (de Vos, 2012), with the New Hegelians being\ndistanced from Hegel as promoters of mere ideology rather than serious\nengagement with philosophical and political issues. While rejecting\nsuch negative judgements on the Hegelian School as a whole, the editor\nof a recent important documentary collection from the period is highly\ncritical of Bruno Bauer, arguing that both his philosophical\nimportance and his personal prominence in the Hegelian movement have\nbeen inflated in recent research (Hundt 2010, Apparat,\npp. 43–44). In his otherwise very positive review, Michael\nQuante offers a rejoinder to Hundt’s conclusions on Bauer\n(Quante, 2010, 201–02). In other recent work, Sorensen (2011)\nvalidates Bauer’s republican credentials before 1848, and\nexamines his subsequent disillusionment, along with that of his fellow\nLeft-Hegelian radicals after the defeat of the revolutions.  A recent French edition of La trompette du jugement\ndernier (trans. Henri-Alexis Baatsch, with a commentary by\nNicolas Dessaux titled “De Marx comme trompettiste”)\ncontains a translation of Bauer’s anonymous 1841 text, Die\nPosaune des jüngsten Gerichts. This new translation slightly\nrevises Baatsch’s earlier translation of La Trompette du\njugement dernier contre Hegel, l’athée et\nl’antéchrist. Un ultimatum (1841). Dessaux’s\ncommentary revives the authorship debate surrounding Die\nPosaune and its continuation, Hegel’s Lehre der\nReligion und Kunst (1842), by attributing much of the earlier\ntext to Karl Marx, though previous literature has challenged similar\nclaims. The grounds offered by Dessaux are that Marx possessed the\nrequisite philosophical and biblical competence to compose the text\nhimself, and that it contains typically Marxian turns of phrase. The\nissue of Marx’s potential collaboration on these texts had been\nraised previously; for example, the 1967 reissue of Hegels\nLehre by Scientia Verlag, Aalen, had identified Marx as the\npossible author of the section of that text entitled “Hegels\nHaß gegen die heilige Geschichte und die göttliche Kunst\nder heiligen Geschichtsschreibung” (pp. 67–227).  For earlier\nliterature that questions the attribution to Marx, see Moggach 2003\n(p. 222, note 59). The question of possible collaboration is also\ndiscussed in Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe (MEGA), David\nRyazanov and Viktor Adoratsky (eds.), 1929, I/2, p XLIV.
