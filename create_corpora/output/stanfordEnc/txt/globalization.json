In contemporary popular\ndiscourse, globalization often functions as little more than a synonym\nfor one or more of the following phenomena: the pursuit of classical\nliberal (or “free market”) policies in the world economy\n(“economic liberalization”), the growing dominance of\nwestern (or even American) forms of political, economic, and cultural\nlife (“westernization” or “Americanization”),\na global political order built on liberal notions of international law\n(the “global liberal order”), the proliferation of new\ninformation technologies (the “Internet Revolution”), as\nwell as the notion that humanity stands at the threshold of realizing\none single unified community in which major sources of social conflict\nhave vanished (“global integration”). Globalization is a\npolitically-contested phenomenon about which there are significant\ndisagreements and struggles, with a growing number of nationalist and\npopulist movements and leaders worldwide (including Turkey’s Recep\nErdoğan, Poland’s Jaroslaw Kacyzńki, Hungary’s\nViktor Orbán, and US President Donald Trump) pushing back against what\nthey view as its unappealing features. Fortunately, recent social\ntheory has formulated a more precise concept of globalization than\nthose typically offered by politicians and pundits. Although sharp\ndifferences continue to separate participants in the ongoing debate\nabout the term, most contemporary social theorists endorse the view\nthat globalization refers to fundamental changes in the spatial and\ntemporal contours of social existence, according to which the\nsignificance of space or territory undergoes shifts in the face of a\nno less dramatic acceleration in the temporal structure of crucial\nforms of human activity. Geographical distance is typically measured\nin time. As the time necessary to connect distinct geographical\nlocations is reduced, distance or space undergoes compression or\n“annihilation.” The human experience of space is\nintimately connected to the temporal structure of those activities by\nmeans of which we experience space. Changes in the temporality of\nhuman activity inevitably generate altered experiences of space or\nterritory. Theorists of globalization disagree about the precise\nsources of recent shifts in the spatial and temporal contours of human\nlife. Nonetheless, they generally agree that alterations in\nhumanity’s experiences of space and time are working to\nundermine the importance of local and even national boundaries in many\narenas of human endeavor. Since globalization contains far-reaching\nimplications for virtually every facet of human life, it necessarily\nsuggests the need to rethink key questions of normative political\ntheory.\n\n\n\nThe term globalization has only become commonplace in the last three\ndecades, and academic commentators who employed the term as late as the\n1970s accurately recognized the novelty of doing so (Modelski 1972).\nAt least since the advent of industrial capitalism, however,\nintellectual discourse has been replete with allusions to phenomena\nstrikingly akin to those that have garnered the attention of recent\ntheorists of globalization. Nineteenth and twentieth-century\nphilosophy, literature, and social commentary include numerous\nreferences to an inchoate yet widely shared awareness that experiences\nof distance and space are inevitably transformed by the emergence of\nhigh-speed forms of transportation (for example, rail and air travel)\nand communication (the telegraph or telephone) that dramatically\nheighten possibilities for human interaction across existing\ngeographical and political divides (Harvey 1989; Kern 1983). Long\nbefore the introduction of the term globalization into recent popular\nand scholarly debate, the appearance of novel high-speed forms of\nsocial activity generated extensive commentary about the compression of\nspace. \n\nWriting in 1839, an English journalist commented on the implications\nof rail travel by anxiously postulating that as distance was\n“annihilated, the surface of our country would, as it were,\nshrivel in size until it became not much bigger than one immense\ncity” (Harvey 1996, 242). A few years later, Heinrich Heine, the\némigré German-Jewish poet, captured this same experience\nwhen he noted: “space is killed by the railways. I feel as if the\nmountains and forests of all countries were advancing on Paris. Even\nnow, I can smell the German linden trees; the North Sea’s breakers are\nrolling against my door” (Schivelbusch 1978, 34). Another German\némigré, the socialist theorist Karl Marx, in 1848\nformulated the first theoretical explanation of the sense of\nterritorial compression that so fascinated his contemporaries. In\nMarx’s account, the imperatives of capitalist production inevitably\ndrove the bourgeoisie to “nestle everywhere, settle everywhere,\nand establish connections everywhere.” The juggernaut of\nindustrial capitalism constituted the most basic source of technologies\nresulting in the annihilation of space, helping to pave the way for\n“intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of\nnations,” in contrast to a narrow-minded provincialism that had\nplagued humanity for untold eons (Marx 1848, 476). Despite\ntheir ills as instruments of capitalist exploitation, Marx argued, new technologies\nthat increased possibilities for human interaction across borders\nultimately represented a progressive force in history. They provided\nthe necessary infrastructure for a cosmopolitan future socialist\ncivilization, while simultaneously functioning in the present as\nindispensable organizational tools for a working class destined to\nundertake a revolution no less oblivious to traditional territorial\ndivisions than the system of capitalist exploitation it hoped to\ndismantle. \n\nEuropean intellectuals have hardly been alone in their fascination\nwith the experience of territorial compression, as evinced by the key\nrole played by the same theme in early twentieth-century American\nthought. In 1904, the literary figure Henry Adams diagnosed the\nexistence of a “law of acceleration,” fundamental to the\nworkings of social development, in order to make sense of the rapidly\nchanging spatial and temporal contours of human activity. Modern\nsociety could only be properly understood if the seemingly\nirrepressible acceleration of basic technological and social processes\nwas given a central place in social and historical analysis (Adams\n1931 [1904]). John Dewey argued in 1927 that recent economic and\ntechnological trends implied the emergence of a “new world”\nno less noteworthy than the opening up of America to European\nexploration and conquest in 1492. For Dewey, the invention of steam,\nelectricity, and the telephone offered formidable challenges to\nrelatively static and homogeneous forms of local community life that\nhad long represented the main theatre for most human activity. Economic\nactivity increasingly exploded the confines of local communities to a\ndegree that would have stunned our historical predecessors, for\nexample, while the steamship, railroad, automobile, and air travel\nconsiderably intensified rates of geographical mobility. Dewey went\nbeyond previous discussions of the changing temporal and spatial\ncontours of human activity, however, by suggesting that the compression\nof space posed fundamental questions for democracy. Dewey observed that\nsmall-scale political communities (for example, the New England\ntownship), a crucial site for the exercise of effective democratic\nparticipation, seemed ever more peripheral to the great issues of an\ninterconnected world. Increasingly dense networks of social ties across\nborders rendered local forms of self-government ineffective. Dewey\nwondered, “How can a public be organized, we may ask, when\nliterally it does not stay in place?” (Dewey 1927, 140).\nTo the extent that democratic citizenship minimally presupposes the\npossibility of action in concert with others, how might citizenship be\nsustained in a social world subject to ever more astonishing\npossibilities for movement and mobility? New high-speed technologies\nattributed a shifting and unstable character to social life, as\ndemonstrated by increased rates of change and turnover in many arenas\nof activity (most important perhaps, the economy) directly affected by\nthem, and the relative fluidity and inconstancy of social relations\nthere. If citizenship requires some modicum of constancy and stability\nin social life, however, did not recent changes in the temporal and\nspatial conditions of human activity bode poorly for political\nparticipation? How might citizens come together and act in concert when\ncontemporary society’s “mania for motion and speed” made it\ndifficult for them even to get acquainted with one another, let alone\nidentify objects of common concern? (Dewey 1927, 140). \n\nThe unabated proliferation of high-speed technologies is probably the\nmain source of the numerous references in intellectual life since 1950\nto the annihilation of distance. The Canadian cultural critic Marshall\nMcLuhan made the theme of a technologically based “global\nvillage,” generated by social “acceleration at all levels\nof human organization,” the centerpiece of an anxiety-ridden\nanalysis of new media technologies in the 1960s (McLuhan 1964,\n103). Arguing in the 1970s and 1980s that recent shifts in the\nspatial and temporal contours of social life exacerbated authoritarian\npolitical trends, the French social critic Paul Virilio seemed to\nconfirm many of Dewey’s darkest worries about the decay of\ndemocracy. According to his analysis, the high-speed imperatives of\nmodern warfare and weapons systems strengthened the executive and\ndebilitated representative legislatures. The compression of territory\nthereby paved the way for executive-centered emergency government\n(Virilio 1977). But it was probably the German philosopher\nMartin Heidegger who most clearly anticipated contemporary debates\nabout globalization. Heidegger not only described the “abolition\nof distance” as a constitutive feature of our contemporary\ncondition, but he linked recent shifts in spatial experience to no\nless fundamental alterations in the temporality of human activity:\n“All distances in time and space are shrinking. Man now reaches\novernight, by places, places which formerly took weeks and months of\ntravel” (Heidegger 1950, 165). Heidegger also accurately\nprophesied that new communication and information technologies would\nsoon spawn novel possibilities for dramatically extending the scope of\nvirtual reality: “Distant sites of the most ancient\ncultures are shown on film as if they stood this very moment amidst\ntoday’s street traffic…The peak of this abolition of every\npossibility of remoteness is reached by television, which will soon\npervade and dominate the whole machinery of communication”\n(Heidegger 1950, 165). Heidegger’s description of growing\npossibilities for simultaneity and instantaneousness in human\nexperience ultimately proved no less apprehensive than the views of\nmany of his predecessors. In his analysis, the compression of space\nincreasingly meant that from the perspective of human experience\n“everything is equally far and equally near.” Instead of\nopening up new possibilities for rich and multi-faceted interaction\nwith events once distant from the purview of most individuals, the\nabolition of distance tended to generate a “uniform\ndistanceless” in which fundamentally distinct objects became\npart of a bland homogeneous experiential mass (Heidegger 1950,\n166).  The loss of any meaningful distinction between\n“nearness” and “distance” contributed to a\nleveling down of human experience, which in turn spawned an\nindifference that rendered human experience monotonous and\none-dimensional. \n\nSince the mid-1980s, social theorists have moved beyond the\nrelatively underdeveloped character of previous reflections on the\ncompression or annihilation of space to offer a rigorous conception of\nglobalization. To be sure, major disagreements remain about the precise\nnature of the causal forces behind globalization, with David Harvey\n(1989 1996) building directly on Marx’s pioneering explanation of\nglobalization, while others (Giddens 19990; Held, McGrew, Goldblatt\n& Perraton 1999) question the exclusive focus on economic factors\ncharacteristic of the Marxist approach. Nonetheless, a consensus about\nthe basic rudiments of the concept of globalization appears to be\nemerging. \n\nFirst, contemporary analysts associate globalization with\ndeterritorialization, according to which a growing variety of\nsocial activities takes place irrespective of the geographical location\nof participants. As Jan Aart Scholte observes, “global events can\n– via telecommunication, digital computers, audiovisual media,\nrocketry and the like – occur almost simultaneously anywhere and\neverywhere in the world” (Scholte 1996, 45). Globalization\nrefers to increased possibilities for action between and among people\nin situations where latitudinal and longitudinal location seems\nimmaterial to the social activity at hand. Even though geographical\nlocation remains crucial for many undertakings (for example, farming to\nsatisfy the needs of a local market), deterritorialization manifests\nitself in many social spheres. Business people on different continents\nnow engage in electronic commerce; television allows people situated\nanywhere to observe the impact of terrible wars being waged far from\nthe comfort of their living rooms; academics make use of the latest\nvideo conferencing equipment to organize seminars in which participants\nare located at disparate geographical locations; the Internet allows\npeople to communicate instantaneously with each other notwithstanding\nvast geographical distances separating them. Territory in the sense of\na traditional sense of a geographically identifiable location no longer\nconstitutes the whole of “social space” in which\nhuman activity takes places. In this initial sense of the term,\nglobalization refers to the spread of new forms of non-territorial\nsocial activity (Ruggie 1993; Scholte 2000). \n\nSecond, recent theorists conceive of globalization as linked to the\ngrowth of social interconnectedness across existing\ngeographical and political boundaries. In this view,\ndeterritorialization is a crucial facet of globalization. Yet an\nexclusive focus on it would be misleading. Since the vast majority of\nhuman activities is still tied to a concrete geographical location,\nthe more decisive facet of globalization concerns the manner in which\ndistant events and forces impact on local and regional endeavors\n(Tomlinson 1999, 9). For example, this encyclopedia might be seen as\nan example of a deterritorialized social space since it allows for the\nexchange of ideas in cyberspace. The only prerequisite for its use is\naccess to the Internet. Although substantial inequalities in Internet\naccess still exist, use of the encyclopedia is in principle unrelated\nto any specific geographical location. However, the reader may very\nwell be making use of the encyclopedia as a supplement to course work\nundertaken at a school or university. That institution is not only\nlocated at a specific geographical juncture, but its location is\nprobably essential for understanding many of its key attributes: the\nlevel of funding may vary according to the state or region where the\nuniversity is located, or the same academic major might require\ndifferent courses and readings at a university in China, for example,\nthan in Argentina or Norway. Globalization refers to those processes\nwhereby geographically distant events and decisions impact to a\ngrowing degree on “local” university life. For example,\nthe insistence by powerful political leaders in wealthy countries that\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommend to Latin and\nSouth American countries that they commit themselves to a particular set of\neconomic policies might result in poorly paid teachers and researchers\nas well as large, understaffed lecture classes in São Paolo or Lima;\nthe latest innovations in information technology from a computer\nresearch laboratory in India could quickly change the classroom\nexperience of students in British Columbia or Tokyo. Globalization\nrefers “to processes of change which underpin a transformation\nin the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding\nhuman activity across regions and continents” (Held, McGrew,\nGoldblatt & Perraton 1999, 15). Globalization in this sense is a matter\nof degree since any given social activity might influence events more\nor less faraway: even though a growing number of activities seems\nintermeshed with events in distant continents, certain human\nactivities remain primarily local or regional in scope. Also, the\nmagnitude and impact of the activity might vary: geographically\nremoved events could have a relatively minimal or a far more extensive\ninfluence on events at a particular locality. Finally, we might\nconsider the degree to which interconnectedness across frontiers is no\nlonger merely haphazard but instead predictable and regularized (Held,\nMcGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999). \n\nThird, globalization must also include reference to the speed\nor velocity of social activity.  Deterritorialization and\ninterconnectedness initially seem chiefly spatial in nature. Yet it is\neasy to see how these spatial shifts are directly tied to the\nacceleration of crucial forms of social activity.  As we observed\nabove in our discussion of the conceptual forerunners to the\npresent-day debate on globalization, the proliferation of high-speed\ntransportation, communication, and information technologies\nconstitutes the most immediate source for the blurring of geographical\nand territorial boundaries that prescient observers have diagnosed at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century. The compression of space\npresupposes rapid-fire forms of technology; shifts in our experiences\nof territory depend on concomitant changes in the temporality of human\naction. High-speed technology only represents the tip of the iceberg,\nhowever. The linking together and expanding of social activities\nacross borders is predicated on the possibility of relatively fast\nflows and movements of people, information, capital, and\ngoods. Without these fast flows, it is difficult to see how distant\nevents could possibly posses the influence they now enjoy. High-speed\ntechnology plays a pivotal role in the velocity of human affairs. But\nmany other factors contribute to the overall pace and speed of social\nactivity. The organizational structure of the modern capitalist\nfactory offers one example; certain contemporary habits and\ninclinations, including the “mania for motion and speed”\ndescribed by Dewey, represent another. Deterritorialization and the\nexpansion of interconnectedness are intimately tied to the\nacceleration of social life, while social acceleration itself takes\nmany different forms (Eriksen 2001; Rosa 2013). Here as well,\nwe can easily see why globalization is always a matter of degree.  The\nvelocity or speed of flows, movements, and interchanges across borders\ncan vary no less than their magnitude, impact, or\nregularity. \n\nFourth, even though analysts disagree about the causal forces that\ngenerate globalization, most agree that globalization should be\nconceived as a relatively long-term process. The triad of\ndeterritorialization, interconnectedness, and social acceleration\nhardly represents a sudden or recent event in contemporary social life.\nGlobalization is a constitutive feature of the modern world, and modern\nhistory includes many examples of globalization (Giddens 1990). As we\nsaw above, nineteenth-century thinkers captured at least some of its\ncore features; the compression of territoriality composed an important\nelement of their lived experience. Nonetheless, some contemporary\ntheorists believe that globalization has taken a particularly intense\nform in recent decades, as innovations in communication,\ntransportation, and information technologies (for example,\ncomputerization) have generated stunning new possibilities for\nsimultaneity and instantaneousness (Harvey 1989). In this view,\npresent-day intellectual interest in the problem of globalization can\nbe linked directly to the emergence of new high-speed technologies that\ntend to minimize the significance of distance and heighten\npossibilities for deterritorialization and social interconnectedness.\nAlthough the intense sense of territorial compression experienced by so\nmany of our contemporaries is surely reminiscent of the experiences of\nearlier generations, some contemporary writers nonetheless argue that\nit would be mistaken to obscure the countless ways in which ongoing\ntransformations of the spatial and temporal contours of human\nexperience are especially far-reaching. While our nineteenth-century\npredecessors understandably marveled at the railroad or the telegraph,\na comparatively vast array of social activities is now being\ntransformed by innovations that accelerate social activity and\nconsiderably deepen longstanding trends towards deterritorialization\nand social interconnectedness. To be sure, the impact of\ndeterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and social\nacceleration are by no means universal or uniform: migrant workers\nengaging in traditional forms of low-wage agricultural labor in the\nfields of southern California, for example, probably operate in a\ndifferent spatial and temporal context than the Internet entrepreneurs\nof San Francisco or Seattle. Distinct assumptions about space and time\noften coexist uneasily during a specific historical juncture (Gurvitch\n1964). Nonetheless, the impact of recent technological innovations is\nprofound, and even those who do not have a job directly affected by the\nnew technology are shaped by it in innumerable ways as citizens and\nconsumers (Eriksen 2001, 16). \n\nFifth, globalization should be understood as a multi-pronged\nprocess, since deterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and\nacceleration manifest themselves in many different (economic,\npolitical, and cultural) arenas of social activity. Although each\nfacet of globalization is linked to the core components of\nglobalization described above, each consists of a complex and\nrelatively autonomous series of empirical developments, requiring\ncareful examination in order to disclose the causal mechanisms\nspecific to it (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999). Each\nmanifestation of globalization also generates distinct conflicts and\ndislocations. For example, there is substantial empirical evidence\nthat cross-border flows and exchanges (of goods, people, information,\netc.), as well as the emergence of directly transnational forms of\nproduction by means of which a single commodity is manufactured\nsimultaneously in distant corners of the globe, are gaining in\nprominence (Castells 1996). High-speed technologies and organizational\napproaches are employed by transnationally operating firms, the\nso-called “global players,” with great effectiveness. The\nemergence of “around-the-world, around-the-clock”\nfinancial markets, where major cross-border financial transactions are\nmade in cyberspace at the blink of an eye, represents a familiar\nexample of the economic face of globalization.  Global financial\nmarkets also challenge traditional attempts by liberal democratic\nnation-states to rein in the activities of bankers, spawning\nunderstandable anxieties about the growing power and influence of\nfinancial markets over democratically elected representative\ninstitutions. In political life, globalization takes a distinct form,\nthough the general trends towards deterritorialization,\ninterconnectedness across borders, and the acceleration of social\nactivity are fundamental here as well. Transnational movements, in\nwhich activists employ rapid-fire communication technologies to join\nforces across borders in combating ills that seem correspondingly\ntransnational in scope (for example, the depletion of the ozone\nlayer), offer an example of political globalization. Another would be\nthe tendency towards ambitious supranational forms of social and\neconomic lawmaking and regulation, where individual nation-states\ncooperate to pursue regulation whose jurisdiction transcends national\nborders no less than the cross-border economic processes that may\nundermine traditional modes of nation state-based\nregulation. Political scientists typically describe the trend towards\nambitious forms of supranational organization (the European Union, for\nexample, or North America Free Trade Association) as important recent\nmanifestations of political globalization. The proliferation of\nsupranational organizations has been no less conflict-laden than\neconomic globalization, however. Critics insist that local, regional,\nand national forms of self-government are being rapidly supplanted by\ninsufficiently democratic forms of global governance remote from the\nneeds of ordinary citizens (Maus 2006), whereas their defenders\ndescribe new forms of supranational legal and political decision as\nindispensable forerunners to more inclusive and advanced forms of\nself-government. \n\nThe wide-ranging impact of globalization on human existence means\nthat it necessarily touches on many basic philosophical questions. At a\nminimum, globalization suggests that academic philosophers in the rich\ncountries of the West should pay closer attention to the neglected\nvoices and intellectual traditions of peoples with whom our fate is\nintertwined in ever more intimate ways (Dallmayr 1998). In this\nsection, however, we focus exclusively on the immediate challenges\nposed by globalization to normative political theory. \n\nWestern political theory has traditionally presupposed the existence\nof territorially bound communities, whose borders can be more or less\nneatly delineated from those of other communities. The contemporary\nliberal political philosopher John Rawls continues to speak of bounded\ncommunities whose fundamental structure consists of\n“self-sufficient schemes of cooperation for all the essential\npurposes of human life” (Rawls 1993, 301). Although political\nand legal thinkers historically have exerted substantial energy in\nformulating defensible normative models of relations between states\n(Nardin and Mapel 1992), they typically have relied on a clear\ndelineation of “domestic” from “foreign”\naffairs. In addition, they have often argued that the domestic arena\nrepresents a normatively privileged site, since fundamental normative\nideals and principles (for example, liberty or justice) are more\nlikely to be successfully realized in the domestic arena than in\nrelations among states. According to one influential strand within\ninternational relations theory, relations between states are\nfundamentally lawless.  Since the achievement of justice or democracy,\nfor example, presupposes an effective political sovereign, the lacuna\nof sovereignty at the global level means that justice and democracy\nare necessarily incomplete and probably unattainable there. In this\nconventional realist view of international politics, core features of\nthe modern system of sovereign states relegate the pursuit of western\npolitical thought’s most noble normative goals primarily to the\ndomestic arena (Mearsheimer 2003.) Significantly, some prominent\nmid-century proponents of international realism rejected this\nposition, at least in part because they tried to deal seriously with\nthe challenges posed by globalization (Scheuerman 2011). \n\nGlobalization poses a fundamental challenge to each of these\ntraditional assumptions. It is no longer self-evident that\nnation-states can be described as “self-sufficient schemes of\ncooperation for all the essential purposes of human life” in the\ncontext of intense deterritorialization and the spread and\nintensification of social relations across borders. The idea of a\nbounded community seems suspect given recent shifts in the\nspatio-temporal contours of human life. Even the most powerful and\nprivileged political units are now subject to increasingly\ndeterritorialized activities (for example, global financial markets)\nover which they have limited control, and they find themselves nested\nin webs of social relations whose scope explodes the confines of\nnational borders. Of course, in much of human history social relations\nhave transcended existing political divides. However, globalization\nimplies a profound quantitative increase in and intensification of\nsocial relations of this type. While attempts to offer a clear\ndelineation of the “domestic” from the\n“foreign” probably made sense at an earlier juncture in\nhistory, this distinction no longer accords with core developmental\ntrends in many arenas of social activity. As the possibility of a\nclear division between domestic and foreign affairs dissipates, the\ntraditional tendency to picture the domestic arena as a privileged\nsite for the realization of normative ideals and principles becomes\nproblematic as well. As an empirical matter, the decay of the\ndomestic-foreign frontier seems highly ambivalent, since it might\neasily pave the way for the decay of the more attractive attributes of\ndomestic political life: as “foreign” affairs collapse\ninward onto “domestic” political life, the relative\nlawlessness of the former potentially makes disturbing inroads onto\nthe latter (Scheuerman 2004). As a normative matter, however, the\ndisintegration of the domestic-foreign divide probably calls for us to\nconsider, to a greater extent than ever before, how our fundamental\nnormative commitments about political life can be effectively achieved\non a global scale. If we take the principles of justice or democracy\nseriously, for example, it is no longer self-evident that the domestic\narena is the main site for their pursuit, since domestic and foreign\naffairs are now deeply and irrevocably intermeshed. In a globalizing\nworld, the lack of democracy or justice in the global setting\nnecessarily impacts deeply on the pursuit of justice or democracy at\nhome. Indeed, it may no longer be possible to achieve our normative\nideals at home without undertaking to do so transnationally as\nwell. \n\nTo claim, for example, that questions of distributive justice have no\nstanding in the making of foreign affairs represents at best empirical\nnaivete about economic globalization. At worst, it constitutes a\ndisingenuous refusal to grapple with the fact that the material\nexistence of those fortunate enough to live in the rich countries is\ninextricably tied to the material status of the vast majority of\nhumanity residing in poor and underdeveloped regions.  Growing\nmaterial inequality spawned by economic globalization is linked to\ngrowing domestic material inequality in the rich democracies (Falk\n1999). Similarly, in the context of global warming and the destruction\nof the ozone layer, a dogmatic insistence on the sanctity of national\nsovereignty risks constituting a cynical fig leaf for irresponsible\nactivities whose impact extends well beyond the borders of those\ncountries most directly responsible. Global warming and\nozone-depletion cry out for ambitious forms of transnational\ncooperation and regulation, and the refusal by the rich democracies to\naccept this necessity implies a failure to take the process of\nglobalization seriously when doing so conflicts with their immediate\nmaterial interests. Although it might initially seem to be\nillustrative of clever Realpolitik on the part of the\nresponsible nations to ward off strict cross-border environmental\nregulation, their stubbornness is probably short-sighted: global\nwarming and ozone depletion will affect the children of Americans who\ndrive gas-guzzling SUVs or use environmentally unsound\nair-conditioning as well as the future generations of South Africa or\nAfghanistan (Cerutti 2007). If we keep in mind that environmental\ndegradation probably impacts negatively on democratic politics (for\nexample, by undermining its legitimacy and stability), the failure to\npursue effective transnational environmental regulation potentially\nundermines democracy at home as well as abroad. \n\nPhilosophers and political theorists have eagerly addressed the\nnormative and political implications of our globalizing world. A\nlively debate about the possibility of achieving justice at the global\nlevel pits representatives of cosmopolitanism against myriad\ncommunitarians, nationalists, realists, and others who privilege the\nnation-state and moral, political, and social ties resting on it. In\ncontrast, cosmopolitans tend to underscore our universal obligations\nto those who reside faraway and with whom we may share little in the\nway of language, custom, or culture, oftentimes arguing that claims to\n“justice at home” can and should be applied elsewhere as\nwell (Beitz 1999; Caney 2006; Wallace-Brown & Held 2010). In this\nway, cosmopolitanism builds directly on the universalistic impulses of\nmodern moral and political thought. Cosmopolitanism’s critics dispute\nthe view that our obligations to foreigners possess the same status as\nthose to members of particular local and national communities of which\nwe remain very much a part. They by no means deny the need to redress\nglobal inequality, for example, but they often express skepticism in\nthe face of cosmopolitanism’s tendency to defend significant legal and\npolitical reforms as necessary to address the inequities of a planet\nwhere millions of people a year die of starvation or curable diseases\n(Miller 2012; 2013; Nagel 2005; Pogge 2001, 9; Pogge 2002). Nor do\ncosmopolitanism’s critics necessarily deny that the process of\nglobalization is real, though some of them suggest that its impact has\nbeen grossly exaggerated (Kymlicka 1999; Nussbaum et\nal. 1996). Nonetheless, they doubt that humanity has achieved a\nrich or sufficiently articulated sense of a common fate such that\nfar-reaching attempts to achieve greater global justice (for example,\nsubstantial redistribution from the rich to poor) could prove\nsuccessful. Cosmopolitans not only counter with a flurry of\nuniversalist and egalitarian moral arguments, but they also accuse\ntheir opponents of obscuring the threat posed by globalization to the\nparticular forms of national community whose ethical primacy\ncommunitarians, nationalists, and others endorse. From the\ncosmopolitan perspective, the tendency to favor moral and political\nobligations to fellow members of the nation-state represents a\nmisguided and increasingly reactionary nostalgia for a rapidly\ndecaying constellation of political practices and institutions.  A similar divide characterizes the ongoing debate about the\nprospects of democratic institutions at the global level. In a\ncosmopolitan mode, David Held (1995) argues that globalization\nrequires the extension of liberal democratic institutions (including\nthe rule of law and elected representative institutions) to the\ntransnational level. Nation state-based liberal democracy is poorly\nequipped to deal with deleterious side effects of present-day\nglobalization such as ozone depletion or burgeoning material\ninequality. In addition, a growing array of genuinely transnational\nforms of activity calls out for no less intrinsically transnational\nmodes of liberal democratic decision-making. According to this model,\n“local” or “national” matters should remain\nunder the auspices of existing liberal democratic institutions. But in\nthose areas where deterritorialization and social interconnectedness\nacross national borders are especially striking, new transnational\ninstitutions (for example, cross-border referenda), along with a\ndramatic strengthening and further democratization of existing forms\nof supranational authority (in particular, the United Nations), are\nnecessary if we are to assure that popular sovereignty remains an\neffective principle. In the same spirit, cosmopolitans debate whether\na loose system of global “governance” suffices, or instead\ncosmopolitan ideals require something along the lines of a global\n“government” or state (Cabrera 2011; Scheuerman\n2014). Jürgen Habermas, a prominent cosmopolitan-minded theorist,\nhas tried to formulate a defense of the European Union that conceives\nof it as a key steppingstone towards supranational democracy. If the\nEU is to help succeed in salvaging the principle of popular\nsovereignty in a world where the decay of nation state-based democracy\nmakes democracy vulnerable, the EU will need to strengthen its elected\nrepresentative organs and better guarantee the civil, political, and\nsocial and economic rights of all Europeans (Habermas 2001, 58–113;\n2009). Representing a novel form of postnational constitutionalism, it\npotentially offers some broader lessons for those hoping to save\ndemocratic constitutionalism under novel global conditions. Despite\ndire threats to the EU posed by nationalist and populist movements,\nHabermas and other cosmopolitan-minded intellectuals believe that it\ncan be effectively reformed and preserved (Habermas 2012). \n\nIn opposition to Held, Habermas, and other cosmopolitans, skeptics\nunderscore the purportedly utopian character of such proposals,\narguing that democratic politics presupposes deep feelings of trust,\ncommitment, and belonging that remain uncommon at the postnational and\nglobal levels. Largely non-voluntary commonalities of belief, history,\nand custom compose necessary preconditions of any viable democracy,\nand since these commonalities are missing beyond the sphere of the\nnation-state, global or cosmopolitan democracy is doomed to fail\n(Archibugi, Held, and Koehler 1998). Critics inspired by realist\ninternational theory argue that cosmopolitanism obscures the\nfundamentally pluralistic, dynamic, and conflictual nature of\npolitical life on our divided planet.  Notwithstanding its pacific\nself-understanding, cosmopolitan democracy inadvertently opens the\ndoor to new and even more horrible forms of political\nviolence. Cosmpolitanism’s universalistic normative discourse not only\nignores the harsh and unavoidably agonistic character of political\nlife, but it also tends to serve as a convenient ideological cloak for\nterrible wars waged by political blocs no less self-interested than\nthe traditional nation state (Zolo 1997, 24).  Ongoing political developments suggest that such debates are of\nmore than narrow scholarly interest. Until recently, some of\nglobalization’s key prongs seemed destined to transform human\naffairs in seemingly permanent ways: economic globalization, as well\nas the growth of a panoply of international and global political and\nlegal institutions, continued to transpire at a rapid rate. Such\ninstitutional developments, it should be noted, were interpreted by\nsome cosmopolitan theorists as broadly corroborating their overall\nnormative aspirations. With the emergence of resurgent nationalist and\npopulist political movements, many of which diffusely (and sometimes\nmisleadingly) target elements of globalization, globalization’s\nfuture prospects seem increasingly uncertain. For example, with\npowerful political leaders regularly making disdainful remarks about\nthe UN and EU, it seems unclear whether one of globalization’s\nmost striking features, i.e., enhanced political and legal\ndecision-making “beyond the nation state,” will continue\nunabated. Tragically perhaps, the failure to manage economic\nglobalization so as to minimize avoidable inequalities and injustices\nhas opened the door to a nationalist and populist backlash, with many\npeople now ready to embrace politicians and movements promising to\npush back against “free trade,” relatively porous borders\n(for migrants and refugees), and other manifestations of globalization\n(Stiglitz 2018). Even if it seems unlikely that nationalists or\npopulists can succeed in fully halting, let alone reversing,\nstructural trends towards deterritorialization, intensified\ninterconnectedness, and social acceleration, they may manage to\nreshape them in ways that cosmopolitans are likely to find\nalarming. Whether or not nationalists and populists can successfully\nrespond to many fundamental global challenges (e.g., climate change or\nnuclear proliferation), however, remains far less likely.","contact.mail":"wscheuer@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"}]
