Such a broad topic cannot be covered in detail in a\nsingle article, and fortunately there is no need to do so, since other\narticles in this Encyclopedia treat individual medieval\nphilosophers and topics. The present article will confine itself to\narticulating some of the overall contours of medieval philosophy. The\nreader should refer to the items listed under\n Related Entries\n below for more detailed information on narrower subjects.\n\n\n\n‘Medieval philosophy’ refers to philosophy in Western\nEurope during the “medieval” period, the so called\n“Middle Ages.” The notion of a “Middle Age”\n(or plural “Middle Ages”) was introduced in the fifteenth\ncentury for the period between the decline of classical pagan culture\nin Western Europe and what was taken to be its rediscovery during the\nRenaissance. The first known documented use of the expression (in the\nform ‘media tempestas’) is from 1469 (Robinson [1984], p.\n748).[1] \n\nThe originators of the notion of the Middle Ages were thinking\nprimarily of the so called “Latin West,” the area, roughly\nspeaking, of Roman Catholicism. While it is true that this region was\nto some extent a unit, culturally separate from its neighbors, it is\nalso true that medieval philosophy was decisively influenced by ideas\nfrom the Greek East, from the Jewish philosophical tradition, and from\nIslam. If one takes medieval philosophy to include the Patristic\nperiod, as the present author prefers to do, then the area must be\nexpanded to include, at least during the early centuries,\nGreek-speaking eastern Europe, as well as North Africa and parts of\nAsia Minor. \n\nThe chronological limits of medieval philosophy are likewise\nimprecise. Many histories of medieval philosophy (like many syllabi\nfor courses on the subject) begin with St. Augustine (354–430),\nthough some include second- and third-century Christian thinkers (see\nMarenbon [2007], p. 1), whereas Pasnau ([2010], p. 1) speaks of a more\nrecent “consensus on when and where to place the beginnings of\nmedieval philosophy, understood as a project of independent\nphilosophical inquiry: it begins in Baghdad, in the middle of the\neighth century, and in France, in the itinerant court of Charlemagne,\nin the last quarter of the eighth century.” At the other end of\nthe period, things are even more imprecise. Robinson ([1984],\npp. 749–50) amusingly summarizes the\nsituation:[2] \n\nStill, it is perhaps most useful not to think of medieval philosophy\nas defined by the chronological boundaries of its adjacent\nphilosophical periods, but as beginning when thinkers first started to\nmeasure their philosophical speculations against the requirements of\nChristian doctrine and as ending when this was no longer the\npredominant\n practice.[3]\n This view allows late ancient and early medieval philosophy to\noverlap during the Patristic period; thus Proclus (411–85)\nbelongs to the story of ancient philosophy, even though he is later\nthan Saint Augustine (354–430). Again, this view accommodates\nthe fact that late scholasticism survived and flourished even in the\nRenaissance. Thus Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), who can\narguably be regarded as the last chapter in the history of medieval\nphilosophy, was contemporary with Francis Bacon\n(1561–1626). Nevertheless by c. 1450, at the latest, radically\nnew ways of doing philosophy were clearly emerging. \n\nThis perhaps generous interpretation of the chronological limits of\nmedieval philosophy implies that it lasted at least from the Greek\npatristic author Justin Martyr (mid-second century) until well into\nthe fifteenth century—more than half the entire history of\nphilosophy generally. Clearly there is much to be discussed. \n\nHere is a recipe for producing medieval philosophy: Combine classical\npagan philosophy, mainly Greek but also in its Roman versions, with\nthe new Christian religion. Season with a variety of flavorings from\nthe Jewish and Islamic intellectual heritages. Stir and simmer for\n1300 years or more, until done. \n\nThis recipe produces a potent and volatile brew. For in fact many\nfeatures of Christianity do not fit well into classical philosophical\nviews. The notion of the Incarnation and the doctrine of the Trinity\nare obvious cases in point. But even before those doctrines were fully\nformulated, there were difficulties, so that an educated Christian in\nthe early centuries would be hard pressed to know how to accommodate religious views into the only philosophical tradition\navailable. To take just one example, consider pagan philosophical\ntheories of the soul. At first glance, it would appear that the\n Platonic[4]\n tradition would be most appealing to an early Christian. And in fact\nit was. In the first place, the Platonic tradition was very concerned\nwith the moral development of the soul. Again, that tradition saw the\nhighest goal of a human being as some kind of mystical gazing on or\nunion with the Form of the Good or the One; it would be easy to\ninterpret this as the “face to face” encounter with God in the next\nlife that St. Paul describes in 1 Cor. 13:12. Most important of all,\nPlatonism held that the soul could exist apart from the body after\ndeath. This would obviously be appealing to Christians, who believed\nin an afterlife. \n\nOn the other hand, there was another crucial aspect of Christianity\nthat simply made no sense to a Platonist. This was the doctrine of the\nresurrection of the dead at the end of the world. Platonism allowed\nfor reincarnation, so there was no special theoretical problem for a\nPlatonist about the soul’s reentering the body. But for a Christian\nthis resurrection was something to look forward to; it was a\ngood thing. This would be incomprehensible from a Platonic\nviewpoint, for which “the body is the prison of the soul,”\nand for which the task of the philosopher is to “learn how to\ndie” in order to be free from the distracting and\ncorrupting influences of the body. No, for a Platonist it is best for\nthe soul not to be in the\n body.[5] \n\nA Christian would therefore have a hard time being a straightforward\nPlatonist about the soul. But neither could a Christian be a straightforward\nAristotelian. Aristotle’s own views on the immortality of the soul are\nnotoriously obscure, and he was often interpreted as denying it\noutright. All the harder, therefore, to make sense of the view that\nthe resurrection of the dead at the end of the world is something to\nbe joyfully\n expected.[6] \n\nThis problem illustrates the kind of difficulties that emerge from the\nabove “recipe” for medieval philosophy. Educated early Christians, striving to reconcile their religion in terms of the only philosophical traditions they knew, would plainly have a lot of work to\ndo. Such tensions may be regarded as the “motors” that\ndrove much of philosophy throughout the period. In response to them,\nnew concepts, new theories, and new distinctions were developed. Of\ncourse, once developed, these tools remained and indeed still remain\navailable to be used in contexts that have nothing to do with\nChristian doctrine.  Readers of medieval philosophy who go on to study\nJohn Locke, for instance, will find it hard to imagine how his famous\ndiscussion of “personal identity” in the Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding could ever have been written if it\nwere not for the medieval distinction between “person” and\n“nature,” worked out in dealing with the doctrines of the\nIncarnation and the Trinity. \n\nWhile the influence of classical pagan philosophy was crucial for the\ndevelopment of medieval philosophy, it is likewise crucial that until\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries almost all the original Greek\ntexts were lost to the Latin West, so that they exerted their\ninfluence only indirectly. They were “lost” not in the\nsense that the texts were simply unavailable but in the sense that\nvery few people could read them, since they were written in the wrong\nlanguage. As the Western Roman Empire gradually disintegrated, the\nknowledge of Greek all but disappeared. Boethius\n(c. 480–545/526) was still fluent in Greek, but he recognized\nthe need for translations even in his own day; after him Greek was\neffectively a dead language in the West.  There were still some\npockets of Greek literacy, especially around such figures as Isidore\nof Seville and the Venerable Bede, preserving and transmitting ideas\nof ancient learning, but making little impact on medieval\nphilosophical thought. \n\nIn the case of Plato, the Middle Ages for all practical purposes had\nonly the first part of the Timaeus (to 53c), hardly a typical\nPlatonic dialogue, in a translation and commentary by a certain\nCalcidius (or\n Chalcidius).[7]\n The Timaeus contains Plato’s cosmology, his account of the\norigin of the cosmos. \n\nThere were also translations of the Meno and the\nPhaedo made in the twelfth century by a certain Henry\nAristippus of\n Catania,[8]\n but almost no one appears to have read them. They seem to have had\nonly a modest circulation and absolutely no influence at all to speak\n of.[9] \n\nThere had been a few other Latin translations made even much earlier,\nbut these vanished from circulation before the Middle Ages got very\nfar along. Cicero himself had translated the Protagoras and a\nsmall part of the Timaeus, and in the second century Apuleius\ntranslated the Phaedo, but these translations disappeared\nafter the sixth century and had very little effect on\nanyone (Klibansky [1982], pp. 21–22). As Saint Jerome remarks\nin the late-fourth or early-fifth century, in his Commentary on\nthe Epistle to the Galatians, “How many people know Plato’s\nbooks, or his name? Idle old men on the corners hardly recall him”\n(Migne [1844–64], vol. 26, col. 401B). \n\nThis state of affairs lasted until the Renaissance, when Marsilio\nFicino (1433–99) translated and commented on the complete works\nof Plato. Thus, except for roughly the first half of the\nTimaeus, the Middle Ages did not know the actual texts of\nPlato. \n\nAs for Plotinus, matters were even worse. His Enneads (the\ncollection of his writings) were almost completely unavailable. Marius\nVictorinus is said to have translated some of the Enneads\ninto Latin in the fourth century, but his translation, if in fact it\nreally existed, seems to have been lost soon\n afterwards.[10] \n\nFor Aristotle, the Middle Ages were in somewhat better shape. Marius\nVictorinus translated the Categories and On\nInterpretation.  A little over a century later, the logical works\nin general, except perhaps for the Posterior Analytics, were\ntranslated by Boethius, c. 510–12, but only his translations of\nthe Categories and On Interpretation ever got into\ngeneral circulation before the twelfth century. The rest of Aristotle\nwas eventually translated into Latin, but only much later, from about\nthe middle of the twelfth century. First there came the rest of the\nlogical works, and then the Physics, the\nMetaphysics, and so on. Essentially all the works had been\ntranslated by the middle of the thirteenth century (Dod [1982]). This\n“recovery” of Aristotle in the twelfth and thirteenth\ncenturies was a momentous event in the history of medieval\nphilosophy. \n\nStill, while it is important to emphasize this absence of primary texts\nof Greek philosophy in the Latin Middle Ages, it is also important to\nrecognize that the medievals knew a good deal about Greek philosophy\nanyway. They got their information from (1) some of the Latin\npatristic authors, like Tertullian, Ambrose, and Boethius, who wrote\nbefore the knowledge of Greek effectively disappeared in the West, and\nwho often discuss classical Greek doctrines in some detail; and (2)\ncertain Latin pagan authors such as Cicero and Seneca, who give us\n(and gave the medievals) a great deal of information about Greek\nphilosophy. \n\nDuring the first part of the Middle Ages, Platonic and neo-Platonic\ninfluences dominated philosophical thinking. “Plato himself does not\nappear at all, but Platonism is everywhere,” as Gilson has said.\n(Gilson [1955], p.\n 144.[11])\n This situation prevailed until the recovery of Aristotle in the\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. Hence, even though it is sometimes\nstill done, it is quite wrong to think of medieval philosophy as\nmainly just a matter of warmed-over commentaries on Aristotle. For\nmost of the Middle Ages by far, Aristotle was of decidedly secondary\nimportance. This of course is not to deny that when Aristotle did come\nto dominate, he was very dominant indeed and his influence\nwas immense. \n\n“Patrology” or “patristics” is the study of\nthe so called “Fathers (patres) of the Church.”\nIn this sense, ‘fathers’ does not mean priests, although of\ncourse many patristic authors\nwere priests. Neither does it does mean “fathers” in the\nsense of “founding fathers,” although many patristic authors were\nlikewise foundational for everything that came afterward. Rather\n‘fathers’ in this sense means “teachers.” See, for example,\nSt. Paul: “For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ,\nyou do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your\nfather through the gospel” (1 Cor. 4:15 [NRSV]). In early Christian\nusage, the term ‘father’ was applied primarily to the\nbishop, who had preeminent teaching authority within the Church. But\ngradually the word was extended until, much later, it came to include\nall early Christian writers who were taken to represent the authentic\ntradition of the Church (Quasten [1950–86], I, p. 9). The\npatristic period is generally taken to extend from the immediately\npost-Apostolic authors to either Gregory the Great (d. 604) or Isidore\nof Seville (d. 636) in the Latin West, and to John of Damascus\n(d. 749) in the Greek East (Quasten [1950–86], I, 1). \n By no means all patristic authors are of philosophical\nsignificance, but many of them definitely are. By far the most\nimportant is Saint Augustine (354–430) (see the entry on\n Saint Augustine). Augustine is certainly\nthe most important and influential philosopher of the Middle Ages, and\none of the most influential philosophers of any\n time:[12] \n\nYet despite his philosophical preeminence, Augustine was not, and did\nnot think of himself as, a philosopher either by training or by\nprofession. By training he was a rhetorician, by profession first a\nrhetorician and teacher of rhetoric, then later Bishop of Hippo\n(modern Annaba, or French Bône, in what is now northeast\nAlgeria), where his concerns were pastoral and theological.  As a\nresult, few of his writings contain what we would think of as purely\nphilosophical\n discussions.[13]\nWhat we find instead in Augustine is a man who is a\n“philosopher” in the original, etymological sense, a\n“lover a wisdom,” one who is\nsearching for it rather than one who writes as if he has\nfound it and is now presenting it to us in systematic, argumentative\nform. \n\nAfter Augustine, the first thinker of philosophical note was Boethius\n(c. 480–524/525) (see the entry on\n Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius).\nBoethius is no doubt best known today for The Consolation of\nPhilosophy, a dialogue in five books between Boethius and\n“Lady Philosophy,” an allegorical figure who appears to\nhim in a vision while he is languishing in jail under sentence of\ndeath for treason. Boethius had occupied a high station in society and\ngovernment. He was born into a family with an excellent old Roman\npedigree, and rose to a position of immense power and influence in the\nOstrogothic kingdom under Theodoric. Although for a while he was\nconspicuously successful, he nevertheless eventually fell into\ndisfavor, was charged with treasonable conspiracy having to do with\nthe Emperor Justin in Constantinople (Boethius claims he was\ninnocent), was arrested and finally\nexecuted.[14] In\nthe Consolation, Boethius and Lady Philosophy discuss the\nproblem of evil and the fickleness of fortune—a particularly\npressing issue for Boethius, given the circumstances under which the\nwork was written. \n\nBut although the Consolation is justly famous, both in our\nown day and in the Middle Ages, Boethius’s long-term importance\nprobably rests more on his translations and commentary activity. For\nBoethius was well educated, and was one of the increasingly rare\npeople in the West who knew Greek well, not just the language but the\nintellectual culture. He came up with the lofty goal to translate\nPlato and Aristotle into Latin, write commentaries on the whole of\nthat material, and then write another work to show that Plato and\nAristotle essentially said the same thing: \n\nNo doubt this plan would have proved unmanageable even if Boethius had\nnot been executed in his mid-forties. In particular, while the\nConsolation certainly shows a knowledge of the\nTimaeus, Boethius does not appear to have actually translated\nany Plato at all, despite his intentions. He did, however,\ntranslate Aristotle’s Categories and On\nInterpretation, together with Porphyry of Tyre’s\nIsagoge, a kind of “introduction” to Aristotle’s\n Categories.[15]\n He also appears to have translated the other works in Aristotle’s\nOrganon (except perhaps for the Posterior Analytics,\nabout which there is some doubt), but the fate of those translations\nis obscure; they did not circulate widely until much later (Dod\n[1982], pp. 53–54). \n\nIn addition to his translations, Boethius wrote a number of logical\ntreatises of his own. These are, first of all, a commentary on\nAristotle’s Topics, which is no longer extant. Whether or not\nhe translated the Posterior Analytics, there may have been a\ncommentary on it, but if so it has not survived and did not have any\ninfluence (Ebbesen [1973]). The same goes for a possible (incomplete)\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics (Obertello [1974], I, pp.\n230–32).  More important were a series of commentaries (one on\nthe Categories, two each on On Interpretation\nand on Porphyry’s Isagoge, and one on Cicero’s\nTopics) (see the entry on\n medieval theories of categories),\n together with several other works on categorical and\nhypothetical syllogisms, logical “division,” and on the differences\nbetween Aristotle’s and Cicero’s Topics (Chadwick [1981],\nGibson [1981], Obertello [1974]). Together all these logical writings,\nboth the translations and the others, constitute what later came to be\ncalled the “Old Logic” (= logica vetus). Some of the\nworks were more influential than others. But basically, everything the\nMiddle Ages knew about logic up to the middle of the twelfth century\nwas contained in these books. As a result, Boethius is one of the main\nsources for the transmission of ancient Greek philosophy to the Latin\nWest during the first half of the Middle Ages. \n\nBoethius is also important for having introduced the famous “problem\nof universals” in the form in which it was mainly discussed throughout\nthe Middle Ages (see the entry on\n the medieval problem of universals). \n\nHe also proved to be influential in the twelfth century and afterwards\nfor the metaphysical views contained in a series of short studies\nknown collectively as the Theological Tractates. \n\nAfter Boethius, as the classical Greco-Roman world grew ever more\ndistant, philosophy—and to some extent culture\ngenerally—entered a period of relative stagnation, a period that\nlasted until after the year 1000. There was one short-lived bright\nspot, however, the late-eighth and early-ninth century court of\nCharlemagne (768–814) and his successors, the so called\n“Carolingian” period. The major philosophical figure in this period\nwas John Scottus\n Eriugena[16]\n (c. 800–c. 877), an Irish monk who was at the court of Charles\nthe Bald around 850 (see the entry on\n John Scottus Eriugena).\n Curiously, the knowledge of Greek was still not\nquite dead in Ireland even at this late date, and Eriugena brought a\nknowledge of the language with him.  At the Carolingian court,\nEriugena translated several Greek works into Latin, including the very\nimportant writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (more on him\nbelow), a work by Maximus Confessor (also known as Maximus of\nConstantinople, c. 580–662), and Gregory of Nyssa’s (died\nc. 385) On the Making of Man (= De hominis\nopificio). Eriugena also wrote several other works of his\nown. \n\nAmong his translations, the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius are surely\nthe most important and influential (see the entry on\n Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite).[17]\n The true identity of the man we call “Pseudo-Dionysius” is unknown,\nbut he lived probably in the late-fifth century, somewhere in the\nGreek-speaking near East, and was very much influenced by the late\nneo-Platonist Proclus. Whoever he was, he claimed to be a\ncertain Dionysius who is reported to have been among the philosophers\non the Areopagus in Athens when St. Paul went there to preach (Acts\n17:19–34). Most of the audience on that occasion laughed at Paul\nand his novel doctrines. \n\nDamaris and the “others” have disappeared without a trace, but our\nunknown later author pretends to be the Dionysius mentioned\nin this passage. \n\nThe Pseudo-Dionysian writings consist of four treatises and a series\nof ten letters. The most philosophically important of them are the two\ntreatises On the Divine Names and On Mystical\nTheology. Through them the Latin West was introduced to what is\nsometimes called “darkness mysticism,” the tradition that interprets\nmystical experience not in terms of an “intellectual vision” (compare\nPlato’s Allegory of the Cave, where the Form of the Good is described\nas the dazzling sun), but in terms of the will rather than the\nintellect, darkness rather than light. (Compare later mystical\nexpressions such as “dark night of the soul,” “cloud of\nunknowing.”) \n\nIt is also mainly through these two treatises that medieval philosophy\ngot the still familiar view that there are three ways of talking about\nGod, by trying to say what he is like (the via affirmativa),\nby saying instead what he is not (the via negativa),\nand by a kind of “combined” way that speaks of God with affirmative\npredicates, but with some kind of mark of superexcellence (the via\neminentiae, “God is more than good, more than\nwise.”). \n\nAmong Eriugena’s own writings, the two most important ones were surely\nOn the Division of Nature (= De divisione\nnaturae or, under a Greek title, Periphyseon) and On\nPredestination (= De praedestinatione), both very\nstrongly influenced by the neo-Platonic texts Eriugena was\ntranslating. Both works were condemned, On Predestination\nsoon after it was written. On the Division of Nature is a\nlarge, systematic work in four books, presenting a vision of reality\nin strongly neo-Platonic terms. The unfamiliarity of this kind of\nthinking in Western Christendom, which was strongly influenced by\nAugustine, no doubt contributed to his later reputation of being a\nheretic. \n\nAfter its brief “renaissance” during the Carolingian period, education\nand culture declined once again for roughly another 200 years. Then,\nshortly after the turn of the millennium, things began to revive. The\nGermanic “barbarian” tribes that had so disturbed the late Roman\nempire had long since settled down, and the later Viking raiders had\nby this time become respectable “Normans.” Trade began to revive,\ntravel became relatively safe again, at least compared to what it had\nbeen, new cities began to emerge, and along with them new social\narrangements began to develop. Education was part of this general\nrevival, and with it philosophy. The major medieval philosophers\nbefore the year 1000 are probably fewer than five in number (depending\non how generously one wants to take the word ‘major’). But\nafter 1000 their numbers grow exponentially. It is no longer possible\nto treat them individually in chronological order; indeed, it is\ndifficult to keep track of them all. As time goes on, the\ncomplications and the numbers only increase. \n\nSimultaneously, philosophy becomes increasingly technical and\n“academic.” Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) represents a major\ntransitional figure (see the entry on\n Saint Anselm).\n His writings are not yet laden with the\ntechnicalities and jargon that make so much later medieval philosophy\nformidable and inaccessible to the non-specialist. And yet his\nwritings are philosophically “argumentative” in a way much earlier\nmedieval philosophy is not and that looks much more familiar to\npresent-day readers. \n\nAnselm is no doubt best known as the originator of the\nfamous “ontological argument” for the existence of\n God.[18]\n But he wrote much else besides, on many philosophical and theological\ntopics. His writings abound in subtle and sophisticated reasoning;\nindeed, they illustrate the increasing role of “dialectic” in\nphilosophy and theology. In Anselm’s hands, theology begins to develop\ninto an argumentative discipline, less exclusively a matter of\n“scripture studies” and spirituality and increasingly a matter of\nsystematic exploration and presentation of doctrine. This development\ngrows even more pronounced after Anselm. \n\nBy the early twelfth century, the revival of education that had\nbegun shortly after the millennium was in full swing. During the first\nhalf of the century, the most important philosopher by far was\nundoubtedly Peter Abelard (1079–1142) (see the entry on\n Peter Abelard). He was also one of the\nmost colorful figures in the entire history of philosophy. His affair\nwith Héloise and his consequent castration are the stuff of\nlegend, and his controversy with the much more traditional Bernard of\nClairvaux (1090–1153) has only enhanced his reputation among\nthose who have viewed him (with considerable oversimplification) as a\nchampion of reason over authority. His autobiographical Story of My\nAdversities (= Historia calamitatum) is a “good\nread” even today, and is one of the most intensely personal documents\nof the Middle\n Ages.[19] \n\nAbelard represents the full flower of “early medieval philosophy,”\njust before the new translations of Aristotle and others transform\neverything. It is important to realize that, except for the works of\nPseudo-Dionysius, which do not appear to have had an important role in\nAbelard’s thinking, he had access to no more of the original sources\nof philosophy in the ancient world than anyone else in Europe had had\nsince the time of Boethius. Yet his philosophy is strikingly original.\nHis views on logic and what we would call philosophy of language are\nsophisticated and novel; indeed, he is a serious contender for the\ntitle of the greatest logician of the entire medieval period, early or\nlate. He is one of the first nominalists, and certainly the first\nimportant one. His writings on ethics put a new and very strong\nemphasis on the role of the agent’s intention rather than\nexterior actions. He also wrote on theological topics such as\nTrinity. \n\nAbelard’s writings further amplify the tendency, already seen in\nAnselm, to increase the use of reasoning and argumentation in\ntheology. But whereas Anselm had managed to deflect criticisms of this\nnew approach in theology, Abelard’s disputatious personality alarmed\nthose who were more comfortable with the older style. He was subject\nto ecclesiastical censure during his lifetime, a fact that no doubt\ncontributes to the relatively few explicit citations of him in the\nlater Middle Ages. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that his influence\nwas widespread. \n\nThroughout this early medieval period, we find many writers, usually\nof a broadly “Platonic” persuasion, who deal with philosophical topics\nin an unsystematic but far from shallow way that does not clearly\ndistinguish philosophy from theology, or for that matter from “wisdom\nliterature” generally. Frequently their views are presented by\narguments that amount to an appeal to a “vision” of how things are\n(“Look, don’t you\n see?”).[20]\n This is simply a general although not universal observation about\nthese authors, and should not be regarded as a philosophical\nlimitation or defect. After all, some of the world’s most important\nphilosophy has been presented in such a “visionary” way.  Consider the\nrole of “intuition” in twentieth-century phenomenology, for example,\nnot to mention Parmenides’s poem (where the philosophy is presented by\na goddess) and much of Plato’s philosophy, including the Allegory of\nthe Cave. \n\nThere are many exceptions to this generalization.  Boethius’s logical\ncommentaries, for example, are purely philosophical and frequently\ngenuinely argumentative, even if they are often obscure and\ninaccessible to modern readers. Eriugena’s On the Division of\nNature, while definitely “visionary,” is nevertheless quite\nsystematic in its structure. And by the time of Anselm, the role of\nlogical argumentation is beginning to grow. Certainly for Abelard the\nabove generalization fails entirely. \n\nNevertheless, a big change is about to occur. Prior to Abelard,\nphilosophy in the Middle Ages had not been an exclusively academic\naffair. It had been addressed for the most part to any well educated\nreader interested in the topics being discussed. Boethius’s\nConsolation, for instance, or almost any of Augustine’s or\nAnselm’s writings, could profitably be read by any literate person.\nSoon, however, this all changes. Philosophy becomes an increasingly\nspecialized discipline, pursued by and for those whose livelihood is\nfound only in educational institutions. Philosophy and theology become\nmore clearly distinguished from one another; both become more\nsystematic, rigorous and precise. These virtues are accompanied by an\nincreasingly technical jargon, which makes so much late-medieval\nphilosophy intimidating and formidable to non-specialist readers. By\nthe same token, this increasing technicality diminishes the overall\nsense of moral urgency one finds for example in Augustine’s\nConfessions or Boethius’s Consolation. \n\nAs with the previous generalization, this one should not be regarded\nas a philosophical fault of the later authors; it is simply a\ndifferent way of doing philosophy. As David Hume knew, there are two\nstyles of philosophy, each with its own advantages (An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, § 1). What we see in passing\nfrom the earlier to the later Middle Ages is a transition from one to\nthe other. \n\nAs part of the cultural revival described above, and from the\nlate-eleventh century on, there was a new and increasing interest in\nhaving translations of previously unavailable texts, not all of them\nphilosophical by any means. No doubt this new interest was prompted in\npart by Western Europe’s exposure to the Greek and Islamic world\nduring the First Crusade (beginning in 1095). But, for whatever\nreason, new translations soon began to appear from: \n\nThe Spanish translators worked from Arabic texts. In the case of\nAristotle, they used Arabic translations of Aristotle’s Greek,\nsometimes with an earlier Syriac link in between. After such a\ncircuitous route, it is no less than amazing that the Latin Europeans\nwere able to understand anything at all of these newly available\nAristotelian works. Eventually the extensive and thorough commentaries\nby the Moorish Ibn Rushd (in Latin, Averroes, 1126–98) were\ntranslated from Arabic as well. These commentaries were extremely\nimportant in shaping the late medieval understanding of Aristotle,\nalthough some of the views contained in them became highly\ncontroversial. \n\nBy the end of the twelfth century, almost all of Aristotle’s works\navailable today had been translated into Latin and, together with the\ncommentaries and other newly translated texts, gradually began to\ncirculate. By the mid-thirteenth century, they were widely known. The\nfirst things to spread were the remaining logical writings of\nAristotle’s Organon, those not already widely known from\nBoethius’s translations some six hundred years previously. These new\nlogical writings, as distinct from the “Old Logic” (= Logica\nvetus) stemming from Boethius, became known collectively as the\n“New Logic” (= Logica nova). After them, the\nPhysics, Metaphysics and other Aristotelian writings\ngradually became known. \n\nThis relatively sudden injection of so much new and unfamiliar\nmaterial into Western Europe was a stunning shock, nothing less than\nrevolutionary. It was no longer possible for philosophers and\ntheologians to regard their task as simply one of deepening and\nelaborating traditional views that had come mainly from the Church\nFathers and other familiar and approved authorities. It was now a\nmatter of dealing with an entirely unfamiliar framework, with new\nideas, accompanied by powerful arguments for them, some of which ideas\nwere plainly unacceptable to a Christian—for example,\nAristotle’s rejection of anything like divine providence, and his\nviews on the eternity of the world (see the entry on \n William of Auvergne). \n\nAs part of the revival that began after the turn of the millennium,\nnew forms of education began to emerge in Western Europe.  In general,\nwe may distinguish four main types of educational practices in the\nMiddle\n Ages:[22] Monastic schools. These were schools that had\nbeen regularly associated with monasteries ever since the sixth\ncentury.  Much of Anselm’s most important work, for instance,\nincluding the\nProslogion containing his “ontological argument,”\nwas penned at the monastic school of Bec in Normandy. Abelard in\nhis Story of My Adversities describes how, at least according\nto Abelard’s telling, his teacher William of Champeaux\n(c. 1070–1121) was driven out of Paris by Abelard’s superior\ndialectical skills and retired to the abbey of Saint Victor, where he\n“founded” (or at least reorganized) what came to be known\nas the School of Saint Victor. This was another one of these monastic\nschools. The masters of this school became quite well known in their\nown right in the later-twelfth century. They are collectively known as\nthe “Victorines.” The most important of them are: Individual “masters.” Beginning in\nthe mid-eleventh century, individual scholars would occasionally set\nup a “school” of their own and gather students around\nthem. Such schools were sometimes itinerant, and depended entirely on\nthe appeal of the teaching “master.” Perhaps the closest\nanalogue to this arrangement would be the modern “martial\narts” schools one often finds in present-day cities. The\npractice declined after c. 1150. Abelard conducted such a\n“school” at Melun in the very early eleventh century, and\nseems earlier to have attended a similar “school”\nconducted by a certain Roscelin (c. 1045–c. 1120), a\ncontroversial nominalist whose writings have mostly not survived, but\nwho had in effect been accused by Anselm of out-and-out tritheism on\nthe doctrine of the Trinity. Cathedral schools. These were schools associated\nwith the official church of a bishop, and played a role similar to that\nof the monastic schools for monasteries: they trained young clerics and\noccasionally others as well. Before William of Champeaux left Paris as\nthe result of Abelard’s criticisms of his views, he had been teaching\nat the cathedral school of Paris (see the entry on\n William of Champeaux).\n The so-called “School of Chartres”\nmay likewise have been such a cathedral\n school.[23]\n The scholars there were\nespecially interested in that portion of Plato’s Timaeus that\nwas circulating in Calcidius’s translation (see\n above),\n and in the metaphysical implications of\nBoethius’s Theological Tractates. Important figures associated\nwith the School of Chartres include Bernard of Chartres (died c. 1130),\nThierry (= Theodoric) of Chartres (died c. 1150), and Gilbert of\nPoitiers (= Gilbert de la Porrée, Gilbertus Porreta, c.\n1085–1154). John of Salisbury’s (c. 1115–80)\nMetalogicon is an invaluable source of information about all\nthese and many other thinkers from the first half of the twelfth\ncentury (John of Salisbury [1955]; see\n John of Salisbury).[24]\n Cathedral schools flourished c. 1050–c. 1150. Universities. Parliament and the\n“university” are arguably the two great medieval\ninstitutions that have survived more or less intact to the present\nday. (The Church may be counted as a conspicuous third, depending on\none’s views about the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.)\nFrequently, universities grew out of cathedral schools. Thus, the\ncathedral school at Paris developed by the early-thirteenth century\ninto the University of Paris. An important cathedral school drew\nstudents from all over Europe. Such a school became known as\na studium generale. Some of these studia generalia\nsurvived and became known as “universities.” At first, the\nterm ‘universitas’ referred simply to the\n“entirety” or “universality” of scholars, both\nfaculty and students, associated with the school. As the term\ngradually came to be used, a “university” was one of these\nmajor, international schools that was distinguished from others by its\npossessing an official charter (granted by a royal or ecclesiastical\nauthority), a set of statutes, and an established form of governing\nitself. \n\nThe University of Paris was the premier university in Europe in the\nthirteenth century. Its statutes were officially approved by the papal\nlegate Robert de Courçon in 1215. The official founding of the\nUniversity is usually put at this date, although it is clear that the\nstatutes existed earlier. Oxford and Cambridge also date from the\nearly-thirteenth century, although their period of greatest vigor in\nthe Middle Ages came in the late-thirteenth and early-fourteenth\ncentury. Toulouse was founded in 1229 by papal charter. Salamanca was\nfounded by royal charter in 1200. There were also universities in\nItaly; indeed, Bologna was the first university in all of Europe, and\nhad the peculiarity of being a student-run university. \n\nUniversities were divided into “faculties.” The four most common\nones were the faculties of arts, law, medicine, and theology. Most\nuniversities had arts faculties, in addition to one or more of the\nothers. The arts faculty was for the basic training of students, before\nthey proceeded to one of the “higher” faculties. In effect, the arts\nfaculty was the equivalent of the modern undergraduate program. As for\nthe “higher” faculties, Bologna was primarily a university for the\nstudy of law. Others were best known for medicine. Paris had all four\nfaculties, but the faculty of theology was considered the highest of\nthe four. \n\nIn the medieval university, philosophy was cultivated first and\nforemost in the arts faculty. When the newly translated works of\nAristotle first appeared at the University of Paris, for instance, it\nwas in the faculty of arts. The works were clearly not law or\nmedicine.  (Some of them might be stretched a bit to count as\nmedicine, but these were not the ones that were influential first.)\nNeither were they theology in the traditional sense of “Sacred\nDoctrine,” although some of Aristotle’s writings had important\nconsequences for theology. Some of these consequences were thought to\nbe dangerous for Christian doctrine, and they were. In 1210, a\nprovincial synod at Paris ruled that Aristotle’s “natural\ntheology” could not be “read” in the faculty of arts\nat Paris. To “read” in this context means to\n“lecture on.” It did not mean that students and masters\ncouldn’t study and discuss these works in private. In 1215, when\nRobert de Courçon approved the statutes of the University of\nParis, one of them forbade the arts masters from lecturing on\nAristotelian metaphysics and natural science.  In 1231, Pope Gregory\nIX ordered that the works prohibited in 1210 not be used until they\ncould be examined by a theological commission to remove any errors. In\n1245, Innocent IV extended the prohibitions of 1210 and 1215 to the\nUniversity of Toulouse. Despite these bans, study and discussion of\nAristotle could not be stopped. By the 1250s, people were openly\nlecturing on everything they had of Aristotle’s. \n\nWhy were these prohibitions issued? In part it was out of a genuine\nconcern for the purity of the faith. Aristotelianism was thought, and\nrightly so, to be theologically suspect. Besides, European academics\nwere just getting acquainted with most of Aristotle, and at this early\nstage of their acquaintance they weren’t altogether sure just what he\nmeant and what the implications were. A “go slow” approach\nwas not an altogether unreasonable course of action to adopt. On the\nother hand, it cannot be denied that some of the basis for the\nprohibitions was simply a resistance to new ideas. \n\nBy their very nature, universities brought together masters and\nstudents from all over Europe and put them in close proximity. Not\nsurprisingly, the result was a “boom” in academic study, including\nphilosophy. Already in the twelfth century, and certainly by the\nearly-thirteenth, it is futile even to attempt anything like a\nsequential narrative of the history of medieval philosophy. Instead,\nthe remainder of this article will mention only a few of the major\nfigures and describe some of the main topics that were discussed\nthroughout the medieval period. For a more complete picture, readers\nshould consult any of the general histories in the\n Bibliography\n below, and for details on individual authors\nand topics the\n Related Entries\n in this Encyclopedia,\nlisted below. \n\nHistories of medieval philosophy often treat Thomas Aquinas\n(1224/25–74), John Duns Scotus (c. 1265–1308), and William\nof Ockham (c. 1287–1347) as the “big three” figures\nin the later medieval period; a few add Bonaventure (1221–74) as\na fourth.  Although there is certainly ample justification for giving\nspecial emphasis to these authors, it would be misleading if one thought\none could get even a fair overall picture from them\nalone. Nevertheless, the list is instructive and illustrates several\nthings. \n\nFirst of all, not one of these three or four authors was French.\nAquinas and Bonaventure were Italian, Scotus—as his name\nimplies—was a Scot, and Ockham was English. All but Ockham spent\nat least part of their careers at the University of Paris. This\nillustrates both the preeminence of the University of Paris in the\nthirteenth century and the increasing internationalization of education\nin the later Middle Ages in general. But it also illustrates another\nodd fact: the relative absence of Frenchmen as major players on the\nphilosophical scene during this period, even at the premier university\nin France. There are certainly notable exceptions to this perhaps\ncontentious observation (see for example the entries on\n Peter Auriol,\n John Buridan,\n Godfrey of Fontaines,\n Nicholas of Autrecourt,\n Peter John Olivi,\n Philip the Chancellor, and\n William of Auvergne),\n but with the arguable exception of Buridan, surely\nnone of them is of the stature of the four mentioned above. \n\nThe fact that Buridan has not been generally acknowledged in the\nsame rank as the four “greats,” even though he is certainly a\nformidable contender, points to an important feature of the\ntwentieth-century historiography of later medieval philosophy. Buridan\nwas what is known as a “secular master.” That is, although he was a\npriest, he did not belong to any of the religious\n “orders.”[25]\n Beginning in the early-thirteenth century, several new orders were\nfounded, notably the Franciscans (1209) and the Dominicans (1216), both\nof which became very prominent in late medieval universities. Aquinas\nwas a Dominican, while Bonaventure, Scotus, and Ockham were\nFranciscans. \n\nReligious orders tend to keep good records, including the writings\nof their members, so that historians of medieval philosophy typically\nhave more material to work with for authors in the various orders than\nthey do for “secular” figures like Buridan. Besides, other things being\nequal, orders understandably prefer to “champion their own” in academic\nas in other matters, and when the academic champion comes relatively\nearly in the history of his order, he can come to be regarded as\nrepresenting the order’s authentic “position,” thereby influencing the\nviews of later members of the\n order.[26]\n In this way, Aquinas soon\nbecame the semi-“official” philosopher and theologian of the\nDominicans, a status that was enhanced in 1879 in Pope Leo XIII’s\nencyclical Aeterni Patris, which called Aquinas “the chief and\nmaster of all the scholastic doctors,” and urged that preference be\ngiven to Thomistic doctrine in Catholic schools (see the entry on\n Saint Thomas Aquinas). As a result, Aquinas\nenjoyed a far greater authority in the late-nineteenth and the first\nhalf of the twentieth century than perhaps he ever did in the Middle\nAges. To some extent, Bonaventure likewise came to be regarded as\nrepresenting typically Franciscan views (see the entry on\n Saint Bonaventure), and later on Scotus was highly\nrespected and often favored among the Franciscans (see the entry on\n John Duns Scotus). Ockham is a special\ncase. He was a controversial figure, mainly because of political\ndisputes with the Pope that embroiled his later life (see the entry on\n William of Ockham).\n Nevertheless, as one of their own, the Franciscans have\nalways been interested in him and in his writings. \n\nThe upshot of all this is that major late medieval philosophers,\nlike Buridan, who did not belong to a religious order have often\nsuffered from neglect in standard histories of medieval philosophy, at\nleast until fairly recently. Another neglected secular master was Henry\nof Ghent, a very important late-thirteenth century figure who has\nturned out to be crucial for understanding much of Duns Scotus, but\nwhose views have only in the last few decades begun to be seriously\nstudied (see the entry on Henry of Ghent). \n\nFor that matter, even many important and influential late medieval\nphilosophers who did belong to religious orders are still virtually\nunknown or at least woefully understudied today, despite the labors of\ngenerations of scholars. Their works have never been printed and exist\nonly in handwritten manuscripts, written in a devilishly obscure system\nof abbreviation it takes special training to decode. It is probably\nsafe to say that for no other period in the history of European\nphilosophy does so much basic groundwork remain to be done. \n\nMedieval philosophy included all the main areas we think of as part\nof philosophy today. Nevertheless, certain topics stand out as worthy\nof special mention. To begin with, it is only a slight exaggeration to\nsay that medieval philosophy invented the philosophy of religion. To be\nsure, ancient pagan philosophers sometimes talked about the nature of\nthe gods. But a whole host of traditional problems in the philosophy of\nreligion first took on in the Middle Ages the forms in which we still\noften discuss them today: \n\nAs for logic, the great historian of logic I. M. Bocheński\n([1961], pp. 10–18) remarked that the later Middle Ages\nwas—along with the ancient period from roughly 350–200 BCE\nand the recent period from Boole and Peano on—one of the three\ngreat, original periods in the history of logic. Although we have\nlearned much about the history of logic since Bocheński wrote, and\nalthough we can find individual notable figures in logic who fall\noutside any of his three great periods, his observation is still by and\nlarge correct. From the time of Abelard through at least the middle of\nthe fourteenth century, if not later, the peculiarly medieval\ncontributions to logic were developed and cultivated to a very high\ndegree. It was no longer a matter of interpreting Aristotle, or\ncommenting on the works of the “Old Logic” or the “New Logic”; wholly\nnew genres of logical writing sprang up, and entirely new logical and\nsemantic notions were developed. For logical developments in the Middle\nAges, see the articles\n insolubles,\n literary forms of medieval philosophy,\n medieval theories of categories, \n medieval semiotics,\n medieval theories of analogy,\n medieval theories of demonstration,\n medieval theories of modality,\n medieval theories of Obligationes,\n medieval theories: properties of terms,\n medieval theories of singular terms,\n medieval theories of the syllogism,\n and\n sophismata.\n For\ninformation on some contributors to medieval logic, see the articles\n Albert of Saxony,\n Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius,\n John Buridan,\n John Wyclif,\n Johannes Sharpe,\n Paul of Venice,\n Peter Abelard,\n Peter of Spain,\n Richard Kilvington,\n Richard the Sophister,\n Roger Bacon,\n Thomas of Erfurt,\n Walter Burley,\n William Heytesbury,\nand\n William of Ockham. \n\nIn metaphysics, the Middle Ages has a well deserved reputation for\nphilosophical excellence. The problem of universals, for example, was\none of the topics that were discussed at this time with a level of\nprecision and rigor it would be hard to find matched before or since.\nBut it was by no means the only such question. For some of the main\ntopics in metaphysics on which medieval philosophers sharpened their\nwits, see the articles\n binarium famosissimum,\n existence,\n medieval mereology,\n the medieval problem of universals,\n medieval theories of causality,\n medieval theories of haecceity,\n and\n medieval theories of relations.\n For some important contributors to medieval\nmetaphysics, see the articles\n John Buridan,\n John Duns Scotus,\n John Wyclif,\n Saint Augustine,\n Saint Thomas Aquinas,\nand\n William of Ockham. \n\nIn natural philosophy and philosophy of science, medieval philosophy\nwas of course very strongly—but not exclusively—influenced\nby Aristotle. See, for example, the articles\n medieval theories of causality\n and\n Saint Thomas Aquinas.\nParticularly from the fourteenth century on, the increasing use of\nmathematical reasoning in natural philosophy would eventually pave the\nway for the rise of early modern science later on. Important figures in\nthis development include\n William Heytesbury\nand\n William of Ockham.\n Other important contributors to medieval natural philosophy\ninclude Albert of Saxony,\n Dietrich of Freiberg,\n  John Buridan,\n Nicholas of Autrecourt,\n Nicole Oresme,\n Robert Grosseteste, and\n William Crathorn. \n\nMedieval epistemology was not, with some noteworthy exceptions,\nparticularly worried over the problem of skepticism, over\nwhether we have genuine knowledge (see the entry on\n medieval skepticism).\n The tendency was to take it\nfor granted that we do, and instead to ask about how this\ncomes about: what are the mechanisms of cognition, concept formation,\netc. Medieval epistemology, therefore, typically shades into what we\nwould nowadays call philosophical psychology or philosophy of mind;\nafter the recovery of Aristotle’s On the Soul, it was regarded\nas a branch of the philosophy of nature. For some of the important\ntopics discussed in the area of medieval epistemology, see the\n entries \n divine illumination,\n medieval theories of demonstration, and\n mental representation in medieval philosophy.\n For some important medieval\nauthors in this area, see the entries on\n John Buridan,\n John Duns Scotus,\n Nicholas of Autrecourt,\n Saint Augustine,\n Saint Thomas,\n Walter Chatton,\nand\n William of Ockham. \n\nFor details on some important developments in medieval ethics, see\nthe entries on\n medieval theories of conscience,\n medieval theories of practical reason,\n and\n the natural law tradition in ethics.\n For some of the major contributors to medieval\nethics, see the articles\n John Duns Scotus,\n Peter Abelard,\n Peter of Spain\n Saint Anselm,\n Saint Augustine,\n Saint Thomas Aquinas\nand\n William of Ockham,\n elsewhere in this Encyclopedia. For some important\nfigures in medieval political theory, see the articles\n Dante Alighieri,\n John Wyclif,\n John Wyclif’s Political Philosophy and\n William of Ockham. \n\nThe above lists of topics and important figures should be regarded\nas only representative; they are far from exhaustive."}]
