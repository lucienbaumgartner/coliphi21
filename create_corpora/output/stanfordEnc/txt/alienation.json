So understood, it\nappears to play a largely diagnostic role, perhaps showing that\nsomething is awry with liberal societies and liberal political\nphilosophy. Theories of alienation typically pick out a subset of\nthese problematic separations as being of particular importance, and\nthen offer explanatory accounts of the extent of, and prognosis for,\nalienation, so understood. Discussions of alienation are especially,\nbut not uniquely, associated with Hegelian and Marxist intellectual\ntraditions.\n\n\n\nThe present entry clarifies the basic idea of alienation. It\ndistinguishes alienation from some adjacent concepts; in particular,\nfrom ‘fetishism’ and ‘objectification’. And it\nelucidates some conceptual and normative complexities, including: the\ndistinction between subjective and objective alienation; the need for\na criterion by which candidate separations can be identified as\nproblematic; and (some aspects of) the relation between alienation and\nethical value. The empirical difficulties often generated by\nostensibly philosophical accounts of alienation are acknowledged, but\nnot resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are limits to what can usefully be said about the concept of\nalienation in general; that is, what can usefully be said without\ngetting involved in the complexities of particular accounts, advanced\nby particular authors or associated with particular intellectual\ntraditions. However, there is a basic idea here which seems to capture\nmost authors and traditions, and which is not unduly elusive or\ndifficult to understand. \n\nThis basic idea of alienation picks out a range of social and\npsychological ills involving a self and other. More precisely, it\nunderstands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of\na subject and object that properly belong together. \n\nThat formulation of the basic idea is perhaps too abbreviated to be\neasily intelligible, and certainly benefits from a little elaboration.\nThe characterisation of alienation offered here—as a social or\npsychological ill involving the problematic separation of a subject\nand object that properly belong together—involves three\nconstituent elements: a subject, an object, and the relation between\nthem. It will be helpful to say a little more about each of these in\nturn. \n\nFirst, the subject here is a self; typically, but not\nnecessarily, a person, an individual agent. ‘Not\nnecessarily’ because the subject could also be, for instance, a\ngroup of some kind. There seems to be no good reason to deny that a\ncollective as well as an individual agent might be alienated from some\nobject. For instance, as well as Anna being alienated from her\ngovernment, it might be that women or citizens find themselves\nalienated from their government. \n\nSecond, the relevant object can take a variety of forms.\nThese include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or\nsubjects; and oneself. The object here might be an entity which is not\na subject; for example, Beatrice might be alienated from the natural\nworld, from a social practice, from an institution, or from social\nnorms, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any\nkind. In addition, the object might be an entity which is another\nsubject, another person or group; for example, Beatrice might be\nalienated from her childhood friend Cecile, and Beatrice might also be\nalienated from her own family. Lastly, the object here might be the\noriginal subject; that is, there might be reflexive variants of the\nrelation, for example, in which Beatrice is alienated from\nherself. \n\nThird, the relation is one of problematic separation between\na subject and object that properly belong together. On the present\naccount, all of these elements are required: there has to be a\nseparation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain\nbetween a  subject and object that properly belong together. \n\nThe idea of separation is important. Not all problematic\nrelations between relevant entities involve alienation. For instance,\nbeing overly integrated into some other object might also be a\nproblematic or dysfunctional relation but it is not what is typically\nthought of as alienation. Imagine, for instance, that Cecile has no\nlife, no identity, finds no meaning, outside of her family membership.\nIt is tempting, at least for modern individuals, to say that she has\nan ‘unhealthy’ relationship with her family, but it would\nseem odd to say that she was alienated from it. Alienation is\ntypically a problematic separation from something. \n\nWhat I am calling problematic separations might be indicated by a wide\nvariety of words and phrases. No particular vocabulary seems to be\nrequired by the basic idea. The linguistic variety here might include\nwords suggesting: breaks (‘splits’,\n‘ruptures’, ‘bifurcations’,\n‘divisions’, and so on); isolation\n(‘indifference’, ‘meaninglessness’,\n‘powerlessness’, ‘disconnection’, and so on);\nand hostility (‘conflicts’, ‘antagonism’,\n‘domination’, and so on). All these, and more, might be\nways of indicating problematic separations of the relevant kind. Of\ncourse, particular authors may use language more systematically, but\nthere seems little reason to insist that a specific vocabulary is\nrequired by the basic idea. \n\nThe idea of the relevant separation having to be, in some way,\nproblematic, is also important. Separations between a subject\nand object do not appear necessarily problematic. Relations of\nindifference, for example, might or might not be problematic. For an\nunproblematic instance, consider Daniela, a distinguished Spanish\narchitect, who—when it is brought to her\nattention—discovers that she is unconcerned with, and apathetic\ntowards, the complex constitutional relationship between the Pacific\nislands of Niue and New Zealand. Her indifference in this case looks\nunproblematic. Less obviously perhaps, the same might be true of\nrelations of hostility; that is, that hostility also might or might\nnot be problematic. For an unproblematic instance, consider Enid and\nFrancesca, two highly competitive middleweight boxers competing in the\nOlympics for the first time. It may well be that a certain amount of\nantagonism and rancour between these two individual sportswomen is\nentirely appropriate; after all, if Enid identifies too closely with\nFrancesca—imagine her experiencing every blow to\nFrancesca’s desires and interests as a defeat for her\nown—she is not only unlikely to make it to the podium, but is\nalso, in some way, failing qua boxer. \n\nThe suggestion here is that to be appropriately\nproblematic—appropriate, that is, to constitute examples of\nalienation—the separations have to obtain between a subject and\nobject that properly belong together (Wood 2004: 3). More\nprecisely, that the candidate separations have to frustrate or\nconflict with the proper harmony or connectedness between that subject\nand object. Imagine, for instance, that both the indifference of\nDaniela, and the hostility of Enid, also takes appropriately\nproblematic forms. Perhaps we discover that Daniela has become\nincreasingly indifferent to her lifelong vocation, that she no longer\ncares about the design and construction issues over which she had\npreviously always enthused and obsessed; whilst Enid has started\nbullying her domestic partner, not only behaving in an aggressive and\nintolerant way, but on occasion even threatening physical\nviolence. What makes these examples of separation (indifference and\nhostility) appear appropriately problematic is that they violate\nsome baseline condition of harmony or connectedness between the\nrelevant entities. (A baseline condition that does not seem to obtain\nin the earlier examples of unproblematic separation.)\nAlienation obtains when a separation between a subject and object that\nproperly belong together, frustrates or conflicts with that baseline\nconnectedness or harmony. To say that they properly belong together is\nto suggest that the harmonious or connected relation between the\nsubject and object is rational, natural, or good. And, in turn, that\nthe separations frustrating or conflicting with that baseline\ncondition, are correspondingly irrational, unnatural, or bad. Of\ncourse, that is not yet to identify what might establish this baseline\nharmony as, say, rational, natural, or good. Nor is it to claim that\nthe disruption of the baseline harmony is all-things-considered bad,\nthat alienation could never be a justified or positive step. (These\nissues are discussed further in sections 5.1 and 6.2,\nrespectively.) \n\nThis basic idea of alienation appears to give us a diverse but\ndistinct set of social and psychological phenomena; picking out a\nclass of entities which might have little in common other than this\nproblematic separation of subject and object. The problematic\nseparations here are between the self (including individual and\ncollective agents) and other (including other selves, one’s own self, and entities which are not subjects). So understood, the\nbasic idea seems to play largely a diagnostic role; that is, the\nproblematic separations might indicate that something is awry with\nself or social world, but do not, in themselves, offer an explanation\nof, or suggest a solution to, those ills. \n\nOn this account, the basic idea of alienation looks conceptually\nrather modest. In particular, this idea is not necessarily committed\nto certain stronger claims that might sometimes be found in the\nliterature. That all these social and psychological ills are\ncharacterised by a problematic separation, for example, does not make\nalienation a natural kind, anymore than—to borrow an example\nassociated with John Stuart Mill—the class of white objects is a\nnatural kind (Wood 2004: 4). Nor, for instance, need there be any\nsuggestion that the various forms of alienation identified by this\naccount are necessarily related to each other; that, for example, they\nare all explained by the same underlying factor. Of course, particular\ntheorists may have constructed—more or less\nplausible—accounts of alienation that do advance those, or\nsimilar, stronger claims. For instance, the young Karl Marx\n(1818–1883) is often understood to have suggested that one of the\nsystematic forms of alienation somehow explains all the other ones\n(Wood 2004: 4). The claim here is simply that these, and other,\nstronger claims are not required by the basic idea. \n\nThat said, the basic idea appears to require only a few additions in\norder to extend its critical reach significantly. Consider two further\nsuggestions often made in this context: that alienation picks out an\narray of non-trivial social and psychological ills that are prevalent\nin modern liberal societies; and that the idea of\n‘alienation’ is distinct from that of\n‘injustice’ on which much modern liberal political\nphilosophy is focused. These familiar claims are not extravagant, but,\nso understood, the concept of alienation would appear to have some\ncritical purchase on both contemporary liberal societies (for\ncontaining alienation) and contemporary liberal political philosophy\n(for neglecting alienation). The implied critical\nsuggestion—that the concept of alienation reveals that something\nsignificant is awry with both liberal society and liberal\nunderstandings—looks far from trivial. (Of course, establishing\nthat those purported failings reveal fundamental flaws in either\nliberal society, or liberal political philosophy, is rather harder to\naccomplish.) \n\nParticular theories of alienation typically restrict the range of\nproblematic separations that they are interested in, and introduce\nmore explanatory accounts of the extent and prognosis of alienation so\ncharacterised. They might, for instance, focus on social rather than\npsychological ills, and maintain that these are caused by certain\nstructural features—particular aspects of its economic\narrangements, for instance—of the relevant society. Such\nexplanatory claims are of considerable interest. After all,\nunderstanding the cause of a problem looks like a helpful step towards\nworking out whether, and how, it might be alleviated or overcome.\nHowever, these explanatory claims are not readily open to general\ndiscussion, given the significant disagreements between particular\nthinkers and traditions that exist in this context. Note also that\nintroducing these various restrictions of scope, and various competing\nexplanatory claims, increases the complexity of the relevant account.\nHowever, these complexities alone scarcely explain the—somewhat\nundeserved—reputation that the concept of alienation has for\nbeing unduly difficult or elusive. It might be that their impact is\ncompounded—at least in the intellectual traditions with which\nthe concept of alienation is most often associated (Hegelianism and\nMarxism)—by language and argumentative structures that are\nunfamiliar to some readers. \n\nAt this point, two related, and broadly methodological,\ndisclaimers—acknowledging the limitations of this\nentry—may be appropriate. They concern intellectual history and\ntextual exegesis. \n\nAlthough reference is made to past authors and traditions, very little\nis said here about the historical development of the concept of\nalienation. The term is usually thought to have comparatively modern\nEuropean origins. In English, the term had emerged by the early\nfifteenth century, already possessing an interesting cluster of\nassociations. ‘Alienation’, and its cognates, could\nvariously refer: to an individual’s estrangement from God (it\nappears thus in the Wycliffe Bible); to legal transfers of ownership\nrights (initially, especially in land); and to mental derangement (a\nhistorical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage\nof the term ‘alienist’ for a psychiatric doctor). It is\nsometimes said that ‘alienation’ entered the German\nlanguage via English legal usage, although G.W.F. Hegel\n(1770–1831), for one, typically uses\n‘Entäusserung’, and not\n‘Entfremdung’ to refer to property transfer\n(Hegel 1991a: §65). (It is, of course, the latter term which has\nan etymological link to ‘fremd’ or\n‘alien’.) Moreover, perhaps the first philosophical\ndiscussion of alienation, at least of any sophistication, was in\nFrench. In the Second Discourse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712–1778) diagnoses ‘inflamed’ forms of amour\npropre—a love of self (which is sometimes rendered as\n‘pride’ or ‘vanity’ in older English\ntranslations)—whose toxicity is amplified by certain social and\nhistorical developments, as manifesting themselves in alienated forms\nof self; that is, in the actions and lives of individuals who have\nsomehow become divided from their own nature (Rousseau 1997). \n\nSimilarly, despite reference here to various texts, the exegetical\ndimensions of the present discussion are also limited, and might be\ntreated with a certain caution. Not least, the descriptions of the\nviews of particular authors and traditions function, at least in part,\nas somewhat schematic place holders for particular views about\nalienation. Exegetical accuracy is not abandoned lightly, but the messy\nreality of inconsistency, chronology, textual detail, and contested\ninterpretation, is not the focus. Those interested in more accurate and\nsophisticated accounts of the authors and traditions mentioned here\nmight usefully consult, in the first instance, the appropriate entries\nelsewhere in this Encyclopaedia. \n\nIt may be helpful to say something about the relation of alienation to\nwhat can be called ‘adjacent’ concepts. The two examples\ndiscussed here are both drawn from Hegelian and Marxist traditions;\nnamely, the concepts of fetishism and objectification. Disambiguating\nthe relationship between these various concepts can help clarify the\ngeneral shape of alienation. However, they are also discussed because\nparticular accounts of alienation, both within and beyond those two\ntraditions, are sometimes said—more or less plausibly—to\nconflate alienation either with fetishism, or with objectification.\nOn the present account, even if some particular treatments of\nalienation do equate the relevant concepts with each other, alienation\nis better understood as not synonymous with either fetishism or\nobjectification. \n\nThe first of the adjacent ideas discussed here is fetishism.\n‘Fetishism’ refers here to the idea of human creations\nwhich have somehow escaped (inappropriately separated out from) human\ncontrol, achieved the appearance of independence, and come to enslave\nand oppress their creators. (The parenthesis in the previous sentence\nis intended to help identify a suggestive connection with the concept\nof alienation.) \n\nWithin Hegelian and Marxist traditions, a surprisingly wide range of\nsocial phenomena—including religion, the state, and private\nproperty—have been characterised as having the character of a\nfetish. Indeed, Marx sometimes treats the phenomenon of fetishism as a\ndistinguishing feature of modernity; where previous historical epochs\nwere characterised by the rule of persons over persons, capitalist\nsociety is characterised by the rule of things over persons.\n‘Capital’, we might say, has come to replace the feudal\nlord. Consider, for instance, the frequency with which ‘market\nforces’ are understood and represented within modern culture as\nsomething outside of human control, as akin to natural forces which\ndecide our fate. In a famous image—from the\nCommunist Manifesto—Marx portrays modern bourgeois\nsociety as ‘like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control\nthe powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his\nspells’ (Marx and Engels 1976: 489). \n\nIn order to elaborate this idea of fetishism, consider the example\nof Christian religious consciousness, as broadly understood in the\nwritings of Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872). (Feuerbach was a contemporary\nof, and important influence on, the young Marx, amongst others.) The\nfamous, and disarmingly simple, conclusion of Feuerbach’s\nphilosophical analysis of religious consciousness is that, in\nChristianity, individuals are worshipping the predicates of human\nnature, freed of their individual limitations and projected onto an\nideal entity. For Feuerbach, however, this is no purely intellectual\nerror, but is rather ripe with social, political, and psychological\nconsequences, as this ‘deity’ now comes to oppress and\nenslave us. Not least, the Christian God demands real world sacrifices\nfrom individuals, typically in the form of a denial or repression of\ntheir essential human needs. For instance, the Christian idea of\nmarriage is portrayed as operating in a way that represses and\npunishes, rather than hallows and satisfies, the flesh of humankind\n(Leopold 2007: 207–210). \n\nReligious consciousness, on this Feuerbachian account, looks to be a\ncase where alienation takes the form of fetishism. That is, there is\nboth a problematic separation here between subject and object\n(individuals and their own human nature), and it takes the form of a\nhuman creation (the idea of the species embodied in God) escaping our\ncontrol, achieving the appearance of independence, and coming to\nenslave and oppress us. The same looks to be true, on Marx’s\naccount, of production in contemporary capitalist societies. Capital\ntakes on the appearance of an independent social power which determines\nwhat is produced, how it is produced, and the economic (and other)\nrelations between producers. Marx himself was struck by the parallel,\nand in the first volume of Capital, offers the following\nanalogy: ‘As, in religion, man is governed by the products of\nhis own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the\nproducts of his own hand’ (Marx 1996: 616). However, rather than\nequating alienation and fetishism, fetishism is better thought of as a\nparticular form that alienation might take. (To be clear, there looks\nto be no reason to think that Marx would, or should, disagree with this\nclaim.) \n\nNote, in particular, that although Marx’s discussions of\nalienation often utilise the language of fetishism, not all of them\ntake that form. Consider, for instance, the problematic separation\nsometimes said to exist between modern individuals and the natural\nworld, as the former think of themselves and behave as if they were\nisolated, or cut off, or estranged, from the latter. The idea here is\nreflected in the less ‘Promethean’ moments of Marx’s\nwork, for example, in the suggestion that the appropriate relation\nbetween humankind and nature would involve not our instrumental\ndomination of ‘the other’, but rather a sympathetic\nappreciation of our complex interdependence with the natural world of\nwhich we are, in reality, a part. Those moments are perhaps most\nevident in Marx’s discussion of contemporary\n‘ecological’ threats—including deforestation,\npollution, and population growth—and typically involve his\n‘metabolic’ account of the appropriate relation between\nhumankind and nature (Foster 1999). The inappropriate modern relation\nbetween humankind and nature here looks like an example of\nalienation—there is a problematic separation of self and\nother—but certain central characteristics of fetishism would\nappear to be absent. Most obviously, the natural world is not a human\ncreation which has escaped our control; not least, because it is not a\nhuman creation. Moreover, the impact on humankind of this particular\nseparation does not suit very comfortably the language of enslavement\nand oppression. Indeed, if anything, our inappropriate separation from\nthe natural world seems to find expression in our ruthlessly\ninstrumental treatment of nature, rather than in nature’s\ntyranny over us. \n\nThe second of the adjacent ideas discussed here is objectification.\nSome preliminary disambiguation may be helpful here. In particular,\nthe concept in question is not the idea of\nobjectification—familiar from certain feminist and Kantian\ntraditions—which concerns the moral impropriety of\nsystematically treating a human being as if she were an object, thing,\nor commodity (Nussbaum 1995). That is a distinct and important\nphenomenon, but it is not the one that is relevant here. In the\npresent context, objectification refers rather to the role of\nproductive activity in mediating the evolving relationship between\nhumankind and the natural world. This association is most familiar\nfrom certain Hegelian and Marxist traditions, with Marx sometimes\nusing the German term ‘Vergegenständlichung’\nto capture it (e.g., 1975: 272). \n\nHumankind is seen as being part of, and dependent upon, the natural\nworld. However, nature is initially somewhat stingy with its\nblessings; as a result, human beings confront the natural world from\nan original position of scarcity, struggling through productive\nactivity of various kinds, to change the material form of\nnature—typically through making things—in ways that make\nit better reflect and satisfy their own needs and interests. In that\nevolving process, both the natural world and humankind come to be\ntransformed. Through this collective shaping of their material\nsurroundings, and their increasing productivity, the natural world is\nmade to be, and seem, less ‘other’, and human beings\nthereby come to objectify themselves, to express their essential\npowers in concrete form. These world transforming productive\nactivities, we might say, embody the progressive self-realisation of\nhumankind. \n\nOn this account, all productive activity would seem to involve\nobjectification. However, Marx insists that not all productive\nactivity involves alienation. Moreover, some other forms of\nalienation—unrelated to productive activity—have no\nobvious connection with objectification. \n\nMarx maintains that productive activity might or might not take an\nalienated form. For instance, productive activity in capitalist\nsocieties is typically said to take an alienated form; whereas\nproductive activity in communist societies is typically predicted to\ntake an unalienated or meaningful form. Schematically, we might (a)\ncharacterise alienated labour as: being forced; not involving\nself-realisation (not developing and deploying essential human\npowers); not intended to satisfy the needs of others; and not\nappropriately appreciated by those others, while (b) unalienated or\nmeaningful work might be characterised as: being freely chosen;\ninvolving self-realisation (the development and deployment of\nessential human powers); being intended to satisfy the needs of\nothers; and being appropriately appreciated by those others. Productive activity mediates the relationship\nbetween humankind and the natural world in both of these societies,\nbut alienation is found only in the capitalist case. \n\nFor an example of a view which might be said to equate objectification\nwith alienation, consider what is sometimes called the\n‘Christian’ view of work. On this account, work is seen as\na necessary evil, an unpleasant activity unfortunately required for\nour survival. It owes its name to its embrace of the claim that it was\nonly after the Fall that human beings were required to work by the\nsweat of their brows (see Genesis 31:9). On Marx’s account, or\nsomething like it, one might characterise this Christian view as\nmistakenly equating objectification and alienation, confusing\nproductive activity as such with its stunted and inhuman\nforms. Indeed, one might go further and suggest that this kind of\nconfusion reflects the alienated social condition of humankind,\nembodying an emblematic failure to understand that material production\nis a central realm in which human beings can express, in free and\ncreative ways, the kind of creatures that they are. \n\nIn addition, according to the basic idea defended here, equating\nalienation and objectification fails to appreciate that certain forms\nof alienation might have nothing at all to do with productive activity.\nTheir mutual hostility and undisguised contempt confirm that Gillian\nand her sister Hanna are alienated from each other, but there seems\nlittle reason to assume that their estrangement is necessarily related\nto the world of work or their respective place in it. The\nsisters’ engagement in productive activity and the forms that it\ntakes, might well have nothing to do with the problematic separation\nhere. Imagine that the latter arose from a combination of sibling\nrivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of\nfamily crisis involving the death of a parent. This possibility gives\nus another reason not to equate alienation and objectification. (Again,\nfor clarity, there seems to be no obvious reason why Marx would, or\nshould, deny the intelligibility or utility of this suggestion.) \n\nIn short, on the present account, neither fetishism, nor\nobjectification, are identical with alienation. Rather than being\nsynonymous, these concepts only partially overlap. Fetishism can be\nunderstood as picking out only a subset—on some accounts perhaps\na large subset—of cases of alienation. And there are forms of\nobjectification which do not involve alienation (the meaningful work\nin communist societies, for instance), as well as forms of\nalienation—outside of productive activity—with no obvious\nconnection to objectification. \n\nThe concept of alienation may not be unduly elusive or difficult to\nunderstand, but it obviously doesn’t follow that there are no\ncomplexities or slippery issues here. Perhaps especially once we get\nbeyond the basic idea, or venture further into the relevant\nliterature. \n\nThree interesting complexities are introduced here. Respectively,\nthey concern: the distinction between subjective and objective\nalienation; the need for a criterion identifying candidate separations\nas problematic; and the relationship between alienation and value. \n\nThis section provides an introduction to, and some initial\nreflections on, the first of these interesting complexities; namely,\nthe division of alienation into subjective and objective varieties\n(Hardimon 1994: 119–122). Not all theorists or traditions operate with\nthis distinction, but it can be a great help in understanding the\ndiagnosis of particular authors and particular cases. \n\nFirst, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms of how\nsubjects feel, or think about, or otherwise experience, the problematic\nseparation here. This can be called subjective alienation. For\ninstance, Ingrid might be said to be alienated because she feels\nestranged from the world, because she experiences her life as lacking\nmeaning, because she does not feel ‘at home [zu\nHause]’ in it—to adopt the evocative shorthand\nsometimes used by Hegel—and so on (e.g. 1991a: §4A,\n§187A, and §258A). \n\nSecond, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms which make no\nreference to the feelings, thoughts, or experience, of subjects. This\ncan be called objective alienation. For instance, Julieta\nmight be said to be alienated because some separation prevents her from\ndeveloping and deploying her essential human characteristics, prevents\nher from engaging in self-realising activities, and so on. Such claims\nare controversial in a variety of ways, but they assume alienation is\nabout the frustration of that potential, and they make no reference to\nwhether Julieta herself experiences that lack as a loss. Maybe Julieta\ngenuinely enjoys her self-realisation lacking life, and even\nconsciously rejects the goal of self-realisation as involving an overly\ndemanding and unattractive ideal. \n\nSubjective alienation is sometimes disparaged; treated, for example,\nas concerning ‘merely’ how an individual\n‘feels’ about ‘real’ alienation. On the present\naccount, that is a mistake. Subjective alienation is better understood\nas a full-blown, meaningful, variety of alienation, albeit not the only\none. If you genuinely feel alienated, then you really are\n(subjectively) alienated. (‘[G]enuinely’ in order to\ndisallow, not least, certain situations in which individuals might\nsimply be mistaken about what it is that they feel; for example,\nperhaps until very recently Ingrid systematically confused estrangement\nwith indigestion, leading her to misidentify instances of both.) \n\nThis distinction between subjective and objective alienation can give\nus a useful diagnostic schema. Let us assume—no doubt\ncontroversially—that all combinations of these two forms of\nalienation are possible. That gives us four social outcomes to\ndiscuss: Where: ◻ = Absent and ◼ = Present \n\nThese various alternative combinations—numbered (i) to (iv)\nabove—correspond, very roughly, to the ways in which particular\nauthors have characterised particular kinds of social arrangement or\ntypes of society. Consider, for example, the different views of modern\nclass-divided society taken by Hegel and Marx. \n\nMarx can be characterised as diagnosing contemporary capitalist\nsociety as corresponding to situation (i); that is, as being a social\nworld which contains both objective and subjective alienation. On what\nwe might call his standard view, Marx allows that objective and\nsubjective alienation are conceptually distinct, but assumes that in\ncapitalist societies they are typically found together sociologically\n(perhaps with the subjective forms tending to track the objective\nones). However, there are passages where he deviates from that\nstandard view, and—without abandoning the thought that objective\nalienation is, in some sense, more fundamental—appears to allow\nthat, on occasion, subjective and objective alienation can also come\napart sociologically. At least, that is one way of reading a\nwell-known passage in The Holy Family which suggests that\ncapitalists might be objectively but not subjectively alienated. In\nthese remarks, Marx recognises that capitalists do not get to engage\nin self-realising activities of the right kind (hence their objective\nalienation), but observes that—unlike the proletariat—the\ncapitalists are content in their estrangement; they feel\n‘at ease’ in, and even feel ‘strengthened’ by,\nit (Marx and Engels 1975: 36). \n\nIn contrast, Hegel maintains that the modern social world\napproximates to something more like situation (iii); that is, as being\na social world not containing objective alienation, but still\ncontaining its subjective form. That is, for Hegel, the social and\npolitical structures of the modern social world do constitute a home,\nbecause they enable individuals to realise themselves, variously as\nfamily members, economic agents, and citizens. However, those same\nindividuals fail to understand or appreciate that this is the case, and\nrather feel estranged from, and perhaps even consciously reject, the\ninstitutions of the modern social world. The resulting situation has\nbeen characterised as one of ‘pure subjective alienation’\n(Hardimon 1994: 121). \n\nThat Hegel and Marx diagnose modern society in these different ways\nhelps to explain their differing strategic political commitments. They\nboth aim to bring society closer to situation (iv)—that is, a\nsocial world lacking systematic forms of both objective and subjective\nalienation—but, since they disagree about where we are starting\nfrom, they propose different routes to that shared goal. For Marx,\nsince we start from situation (i), this requires that the existing\nworld be overturned; that is, that both institutions and attitudes need\nto be revolutionised (overcoming objective and subjective alienation).\nFor Hegel, since we start from situation (iii), this requires only\nattitudinal change; that is, that we come to recognise that the\nexisting world is already objectively ‘a home’, and in this\nway ‘reconcile’ ourselves to that world, overcoming pure\nsubjective alienation in the process. \n\nSituation (ii) consists of a social world containing objective, but\nnot subjective, alienation; a situation that can be characterised as\none of ‘pure objective alienation’. (Hardimon 1994, 120.)\nIt is perhaps not too much of a stretch to think of this situation as\ncorresponding, very roughly, to one of the Frankfurt School’s\nmore nightmarish visions of contemporary capitalist society. (The\nFrankfurt School is the colloquial label given to several generations\nof philosophers and social theorists, in the Western Marxist tradition,\nassociated—more or less closely—with the Institute\nfor Social Research founded in 1929–1930.) For example, in the\npessimistic diagnosis of Herbert Marcuse (1898–1979), articulated in\nOne-Dimensional Man (1964), individuals in advanced\ncapitalist societies appear happy in their dysfunctional\nrelationships—they ‘identify themselves’ with their\nestranged circumstances and gain ‘satisfaction’ from them\n(2002: 13). Objective alienation still obtains, but no longer\ngenerates social conflict, since the latter is assumed—not\nimplausibly—to require agents who feel, or experience, some form\nof hostility or rebelliousness towards existing social\narrangements. \n\nThat latter assumption raises the wider issue of the relation between\nalienation and, what might be called ‘revolutionary\nmotivation’. Let us assume that radical social change requires,\namongst other conditions, an agent—perhaps a collective\nagent—with both the strength and the desire to bring that change\nabout. The role of alienation in helping to form that latter\npsychological prerequisite—the desire to bring about change on\nthe part of the putative revolutionary agent—looks\ncomplicated. First, it would seem that objective alienation, as such,\ncannot play the motivating role, since it does not involve any\nfeeling, or thinking about, or otherwise experiencing, the problematic\nseparation here. (‘[A]s such’ in order to allow the\npossibility that a subject’s knowledge of that alienation\nmight—depending, not least, on one’s views on the\nconnections between reasons and motivations—provide an\nappropriately psychological incentive to revolt.) Second, the relation\nbetween subjective alienation and motivation looks more complex than\nit might initially seem. Note, in particular, that some of the\nexperiential dimensions of subjective alienation look less likely than\nothers to generate the psychological prerequisites of action\nhere. Feelings of ‘powerlessness’ and\n‘isolation’, for instance, might well generate social\nwithdrawal and individual atomism, rather than radical social\nengagement and cooperative endeavour, on the part of the relevant\nagents. In short, whether subjective alienation is a friend or an\nenemy of revolutionary motivation would seem to depend on the precise\nform that it takes. \n\nInterestingly, situation (ii)—that is, the case of\n‘pure objective alienation’—might also be thought\nto approximate to the social goal of certain thinkers in the tradition\nof existentialism (the tradition of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980),\nAlbert Camus (1913–1960), and others). Some interpretative generosity\nmay be needed here, but I take it that existentialists think of\n(something like) objective alienation as a permanent feature of all\nhuman societies. Rejecting both substantive accounts of essential human\nnature, and the ethical embrace of social relations that facilitate the\ndevelopment and deployment of those human characteristics, they rather\nmaintain that the social world will always remain ‘other’,\ncan never be a ‘home’. However, although this\n‘otherness’ can never be overcome, there do look to be\nbetter and worse ways of dealing with it. What is essential to each\nindividual is what they make of themselves, the ways in which they\nchose to engage with that other. The preferred outcome here seeming to\ninvolve individuals embodying a norm of ‘authenticity’,\nwhich amongst other conditions—such as choosing, or committing,\nto their own projects—may require that they have the\n‘courage’ to ‘grasp, accept, and, perhaps even\naffirm’ the fact that the social world is not a home for them\n(Hardimon 1994: 121). \n\nThis also clarifies that situation (iv)—which contains\nsystematic forms of neither objective or subjective\nalienation—is the social goal of some but not all of these\nauthors (of Hegel and Marx, for instance, but not the\nexistentialists). Of course, (iv) might also be a characterisation of\nthe extant social world according to a hypothetical, and\nover-optimistic, apologist for the present. \n\nThe second of the interesting complexities broached here concerns what\nwe can call the need for a criterion of ‘impropriety’;\nthat is, a criterion by which candidate separations might be assessed\nas problematic or not. Recall the earlier suggestion that accounts of\nalienation require some benchmark condition of harmony or\nconnectedness against which separations might be assessed as\nproblematic or not. \n\nHistorically, this role—identifying whether candidate\nseparations are problematic—has often been played by\naccounts of our essential human nature. However, motivated by suspicion\nof that latter idea, theorists of alienation have sometimes sought\nalternatives to fulfil that role. \n\nTo see how the appeal to human nature works, imagine two hypothetical\ntheorists—Katerina and Laura—seeking to assess whether\nalienation exists in a particular society. We can stipulate that the\ninstitutions and culture of this particular society are\nindividualistic—in the sense that they systematically frustrate\ncooperation and sociability—and that the two theorists share\nmany, but not all, of the same views. In particular, assume that our\ntwo theorists agree: that alienation is a coherent and useful\nconcept; that the account of alienation given here is, broadly\nspeaking, plausible; that the only serious candidate for a problematic\nseparation in this particular society are those arising from its\nindividualism; and that our essential human nature provides the\nbenchmark of ‘propriety’ for assessing separations.\nSimply put, separations are problematic if they frustrate, and\nunproblematic if they facilitate, ‘self-realisation’.\nSelf-realisation being understood here as a central part of the good\nlife, and as consisting in the development and deployment of an\nindividual’s essential human characteristics. However, assume\nalso that Katerina and Laura disagree about what comprises\nhuman nature. In particular, they disagree about whether cooperation\nand sociability are essential human characteristics; with Katerina\ninsisting that they are, and Laura maintaining that they are not. It\nseems to follow that Katerina will conclude, and Laura will deny, that\nthis society is one containing alienation. For Katerina, the\nwidespread lack of cooperation and sociability confirm that the basic\nsocial institutions here frustrate our\nself-realisation. Whereas, for Laura, the very same widespread lack of\ncooperation and sociability confirm that the basic social\ninstitutions facilitate, or at least do not\nfrustrate, our self-realisation. \n\n(Note that in sub-section 1.2, where the basic idea of alienation\nwas elaborated, various relations between subject and object were\ndistinguished, only one of which was characterised as reflexive.\nHowever, in the light of the present discussion, we might now think it\nmore accurate to say that—on this kind of account, using\nessential human nature to identify alienation—only one of\nthem was directly reflexive, because there is some sense in\nwhich all of those dimensions of alienation involve a separation from\nsome aspect of our own human nature. After all, this is precisely what\npicks out the relevant separation as problematic. For example, the\nseparation of individuals from each other is, for Katerina, indirectly\nalso a separation from human nature, from the cooperation and\nsociability that characterises our essential humanity.) \n\nAs already noted, this benchmark—by which candidate separations\nare assessed as problematic or not—is often, but not always,\nplayed by accounts of our essential human nature. Given the widespread\ncontemporary suspicion of such accounts—not least, by those\nopposed to what is sometimes called ‘essentialism’ about\nhuman nature—it might be helpful to sketch an account of\nalienation which is not dependent on such assumptions (or, at least,\nconsciously strives to avoid them). There is also a potential benefit\nhere for those of us who are less suspicious; namely, that such an\nexample might also provide a better sense of the diversity of\navailable theories of alienation. \n\nRahel Jaeggi offers an account of alienation of this kind, and\nsituates it explicitly in the tradition of Critical Theory; that is,\nthe kind of emancipatory theory associated with the Frankfurt School.\nOn this account, the idea of alienation has the potential to help us\nunderstand and change the world, but only if it receives some\nsignificant conceptual reconstruction. Alienation is still associated\nwith the frustration of freedom, with disruptions to something like\n‘self-realisation’. However, this account—unlike its\nforerunners and associates—is said not to be fatally compromised\nby a commitment to either ‘strongly objectivistic’\ntheories of the good life, or ‘essentialist’ conceptions\nof the self (Jaeggi 2014: 40). \n\nThe crucial term of art here is ‘appropriation’, which\nJaeggi uses to refer to the capacity for, and process of, relating to\nour own actions and projects in ways which engage ‘something\nlike self-determination and being the author of one’s own\nlife’  (2014: 39). Appropriation is successful—and\nalienation is absent—when ‘one is present in one’s\nactions, steers one’s life instead of being driven by it,\nindependently appropriates social roles and is able to identify with\none’s desires, and is involved in the world’ (Jaeggi 2014:\n155). In contrast, appropriation is unsuccessful—and alienation\nis present—when there is ‘an inadequate power and a lack\nof presence in what one does, a failure to identify with one’s\nown actions and desires and to take part in one’s own\nlife’ (Jaeggi 2014: 155). Alienation is thus identified with\nsystematic disruptions of the process of appropriation; in particular,\nin those systematic disruptions which lead us to fail to experience\nour actions and projects as our own. These disruptions are said\ntypically to take one of four forms: ‘powerlessness’ or\nthe experience of losing control over one’s own life;\n‘loss of authenticity’ especially when one is unable to\nidentify with one’s own social roles; ‘internal\ndivision’ where one experiences some of one’s own desires\nand impulses as alien; and ‘indifference’ or a detachment\nfrom one’s own previous projects and self-understandings. \n\nThis model fits happily enough with our basic idea of alienation as\nconsisting in a  problematic separation between self and other\nthat properly belong together. However, the conditions for identifying\nthe relevant dysfunctional relation here are intended to be less\ndemanding and controversial than those involving claims about our\nessential human nature. There is a kindred notion of freedom as\nself-realisation, but it is said to be the realisation of a thin kind\nof self-determining agency, and not the actualisation of some thick\n‘pre-given’ identity of an essentialist sort. A normative\ndimension remains, but it is presented as expansive and broadly\nprocedural. It is expansive in that a wide range of actions and\nprojects might be included within its remit. And it is procedural in\nthat the benchmark for judging the success of these various actions and\nprojects is that they were brought about in the right kind of\nself-determination delivering way, and not that their content reflects\na narrow and controversial account of what human beings are ‘in\nessence’. \n\nModern culture is said to recognise and value the kind of freedom at\nthe heart of this picture of appropriation. As a result, this account\nof alienation can be presented as a form of immanent critique;\nthat is, as utilising a standpoint which judges individuals and forms\nof life according to standards that those individuals have themselves\npropounded, or which those forms of life presuppose. At the individual\nlevel, this critique might involve identifying potential tensions\nbetween the conditions for treating people as responsible agents, and\nthe obstructions to such agency that characterise alienated selves; for\ninstance, the feelings of powerlessness that prevent individuals from\ndirecting and embracing their own lives. And at the social level, this\ncritique might involve identifying potential discrepancies between\nmodern ideals of freedom and their actual realisation in the\ncontemporary world; for instance, the existence of social or political\nroles that an individual can never make their own (Jaeggi 2014:\n41–42). \n\nOf course, difficult questions remain. Questions not only about\nwhether the notion of appropriation successfully avoids the perceived\nspectre of perfectionism, but also about the ground of the normativity\nhere. That the kind of subjectivity or self-determination which\nappropriation embodies is recognised and valued in modern culture, does\nnot in itself establish its ethical worth. It is perhaps easier to\ndismiss Hegelian teleology, or Marxist perfectionism, than it is to\nfind satisfactory replacements. \n\nThe third of these interesting complexities concerns the ethical\ndimension of alienation. The connections between alienation and ethics\nare many and diverse, and there is no attempt here to sketch that\nwider landscape in its entirety. Instead, attention is drawn to two\ntopographical features: the claim that alienation is necessarily a\nnegative, but not a wholly negative, phenomenon, is elaborated and\ndefended; and the suggestion that morality itself might encourage or\nembody alienation is briefly outlined. \n\nThe claim that alienation is necessarily a negative, but not a wholly\nnegative, phenomenon, can be addressed in two parts. Defending the\nfirst part of that claim looks straightforward enough. Alienation, on\nthe present account, consists in the separation of certain entities\n– a subject and some object—that properly belong\ntogether. As a result, alienation always involves a loss or lack of\nsomething of value; namely, the loss or lack of the\n‘proper’—rational, natural, or good—harmony or\nconnectedness between the relevant subject and object. (The slightly\nclunky formulation ‘loss or lack’ is required since these\nterms are not synonymous, and alienation can be elaborated in either\nway. One central difference is that having once possessed the proper\nconnectedness seems to be a necessary condition for losing it, but\nnot, of course, for lacking it.) \n\nIt is the second part of the claim which looks less obvious. Namely,\nthat alienation is not a wholly negative phenomena; that is, that the\nloss or lack here may not always be the whole story, ethically\nspeaking. Note, in particular, that some well-known accounts also\nlocate an achievement of value in the moment of alienation. (No\nsuggestion is made here about whether, and how, the resulting ethical\n‘gains’ and ‘losses’ might be weighed and\njudged overall.) \n\nIn order to illustrate this possibility—that alienation can\ninvolve the achievement of something of value—consider the\nnuanced and critical celebration of capitalism found, but not always\nrecognised, in Marx’s writings. One pertinent way of introducing\nthis account involves locating the moment of alienation within a\npattern of development that we might call ‘dialectical’ in\none sense of that slippery term. \n\nThe dialectical pattern here concerns the developing relationship\nbetween a particular subject and object; the individual, on the one\nhand, and their social role and community, on the other. By a\ndialectical progression is meant only a movement from a stage\ncharacterised by a relationship of ‘undifferentiated\nunity’, through a stage characterised by a relationship of\n‘differentiated disunity’, to a stage characterised by a\nrelationship of ‘differentiated unity’.\n‘[O]nly’ in order to clarify that there are no further\nclaims made here about the necessity, the naturalness, or the\nprevalence, of such progressions (Cohen 1974: 237). \n\nThe dialectical progression here involves three historical\nstages: \n\nFirst, past pre-capitalist societies are said to embody the\nstage of undifferentiated unity. Here individuals are buried in their\nsocial role and community, scarcely conceptualising, still less\npromoting, their own identity and interests as distinguishable from\nthose of the wider community. \n\nSecond, present capitalist societies are said to embody the\nstage of differentiated disunity. Here independence and separation\npredominate, and individuals care only for themselves, scarcely\nthinking of the identity and interests of the wider community. Indeed,\nthey are typically isolated from, and indifferent or hostile towards,\nthe latter. \n\nThird, future communist societies are said to embody the\nstage of differentiated unity. Here desirable versions of community and\nindividuality flourish together. Indeed, in their new forms, communal\nand individual identities, and communal and individual interests,\npresuppose and reinforce each other. It is sometimes said that the\ncontents of the first two stages (community and individuality,\nrespectively) have thereby been ‘sublated’—that is,\nelevated, cancelled, and preserved—in this third stage.\n‘Sublated’ being an attempted English translation of the\nGerman verb ‘aufheben’, and its cognates, which\nHegel occasionally uses to suggest this elusive combination of ideas\n(e.g. Hegel 1991b: §24A3, §81A1). \n\nIn the present context, the crucial stage is the second one. This is\nthe stage of alienation, the stage of disunion which emerges from a\nsimple unity before reconciliation in a higher (differentiated) unity\n(Inwood 1992: 36). This is the stage of present capitalist societies\ninvolving the problematic separation of individuals from their social\nrole and community. In the first stage (of past pre-capitalist\nsocieties) there is a problematic relation, but no separation. And in\nthe third stage (of future communist societies) there is a separation\nbut it is a healthy rather than problematic one. In this\nsecond stage of alienation, there is a loss, or lack, of something of\nvalue; roughly speaking, the loss or lack of the individuals’\nattachment to their social role and community. (More precisely, we\nmight say that they have lost a sense of, and connection to, the\ncommunity, and that they lack a healthy sense of, and connection to,\nthe community.) \n\nHowever, this disvalue is not the whole of the story, ethically\nspeaking. In comparison with the first stage, the second stage also\ninvolves a liberation of sorts from the object in which subjects were\npreviously ‘engulfed’ (Cohen 1974: 239). The ‘of\nsorts’ is a way of acknowledging that this is a rather\ndistinctive kind of liberation. The individual here is not necessarily\nrid of the constraints of the other (of their social position and\ncommunity), but they do now at least identify and experience them as\nsuch—that is, as constraints on the individual—whereas\npreviously the individual was engulfed by them, and failed to think of\nthemselves as having any identity and interests outside of their social\nposition. In short, the loss or lack of something of value is not the\nonly feature of the second stage of alienation. There is also an\nimportant gain here; namely, the achievement of what we can call\n‘individuality’. This significant good was missing in the\nfirst pre-capitalist stage, and—freed from its distorting\ncapitalist form—it will be preserved and developed in the\ncommunist future of the third stage. \n\nThis claim goes beyond the familiar suggestion that alienation forms\na necessary stage in certain Hegelian and Marxist developmental\nnarratives. The suggestion here is that internal to the second stage,\nthe stage of alienation, there is both a problematic separation from\ncommunity and a positive liberation from engulfment. Those who see only\nthe negative thread in alienation, and fail to see ‘what is being\nachieved within in and distorted by it’, will miss an important,\nalbeit subtle, thread in Marx’s account of the progressive\ncharacter of capitalism (Cohen 1974: 253). \n\nThere is a lot going on in this schematic discussion of historical\nstages. The point emphasised here is that theorists—even\ncritics—of alienation need not assume that it is a wholly\nnegative phenomena, ethically speaking. Marx, for example, recognises\nthat the moment of alienation, for all its negative features, also\ninvolves the emergence of a good (individuality) which, in due course\n(and freed from the limitations of its historical origins), will be\ncentral to human flourishing in communist society. \n\nThis claim—that alienation might not be a wholly negative\nphenomenon—concerns the normative dimensions of\nalienation. However, it is sometimes suggested that the concept of\nalienation might provide a standpoint from which morality itself, or\nat least some part of it, can be criticised. This looks to be a very\ndifferent kind of thought. \n\nThe broad suggestion is that certain conceptions of morality might\nembody, or encourage, alienation. More precisely, that certain\nconceptions of morality might embody or encourage a problematic\ndivision of self, and a problematic separation from much that is\nvaluable in our lives. Consider, for example, accounts of the moral\nstandpoint as requiring universalisation and equal consideration of\nall persons (Railton 1984: 138). It could seem that adopting such a\nstandpoint requires individuals to disown or downplay the relevance of\ntheir more personal or partial beliefs and feelings. The picture of\npersons divided into cognitive and affective parts, with the partial\nand personal relegated to the downgraded sphere of the latter (perhaps\nconceptualised as something closer to mere sentiment than reason) is a\nfamiliar one. In addition to that problematic bifurcation of the self,\nsuch accounts might seem to cut us off from much that is valuable in\nour lives. If these impersonal kinds of moral consideration are to\ndominate our practical reasoning, then it seems likely that an\nindividual’s particular attachments, loyalties, and commitments,\nwill have, at best, a marginal place (Railton 1984: 139). In aspiring\nto adopt ‘the point of view of the universe’—to use\nthe well-known phrase of the utilitarian Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900)\n– there can sometimes seem to be precious little security or\nspace remaining for, say, friendship, love, and family (Sidgwick 1907:\n382). Morality, so understood, is charged with embodying and\nencouraging alienation, in the form of both a divided self, and the\nseparation of self and world. \n\nThe weight and scope of these kinds of concerns about alienation can\nobviously vary; that is, they might be thought to have more or less\ncritical purchase on a wider or narrower range of targets. First, they\nmight be viewed variously as weaknesses that can be overcome by more\nadequate formulation of the theories in question, or as foundational\nobjections that help render the relevant theories unattractive and\nimplausible. Second, that varied critical weight might be thought to\ncount against a wide range of potential targets, as varied, for\nexample, as—in order of expanding scope—act\nutilitarianism, certain forms of consequentialism, all impartial moral\ntheories, or ‘the peculiar institution’ of morality itself\n(Williams 1985: 174). Given both that variety, and the subject matter\nof this entry, it may not be helpful to generalise much more here.\nHowever, the point is hopefully made that the ethical dimensions of the\ntopic extend beyond the normative assessment of the relevant\nseparations. Indeed, taking alienation seriously might lead us to think\nmore critically about some familiar moral standpoints and theories. \n\nThe above discussion of the concept of alienation—clarifying its\nbasic shape, sketching some of its theoretical forms, and introducing\na few complexities—still leaves many issues unresolved. Those\nissues include many of the empirical dimensions of the topic. Note\nthat the present section is not directly concerned with the extensive\nsocial scientific literature on alienation. That literature is\ntypically interested in ‘operationalising’ the\nconcept—for instance, treating job satisfaction or absenteeism\nas proxies of alienated work—in order to engineer predictive\nmodels in disciplines (including education, psychology, sociology, and\nmanagement studies) dealing with a variety of real world contexts\n(e.g. Chiaburu et al 2014). This section is rather concerned\nwith the various empirical, and quasi-empirical, assumptions and\nclaims that appear in broadly philosophical accounts of alienation of\nthe kind discussed above. \n\nConsider, for example, Marx’s characterisation of alienation\nin terms of separations which frustrate self-realisation, especially\nself-realisation in work. To come to a considered judgement about the\nplausibility of his views on this topic, one would have to be in a\nposition to assess, amongst other issues, whether work in capitalist\nsocieties is necessarily alienated. One would need to judge, not only\nwhether existing work is rightly characterised as alienated (as forced,\nfrustrating self-realisation, not intended to satisfy the needs of\nothers, and not appropriately appreciated by those others), but also,\nif so, whether it could be made meaningful and unalienated without\nundermining the very features which made the relevant society a\ncapitalist one. (There are also, of course, many more normative-looking\nissues here regarding that account of human flourishing; whether, for\nexample, it overemphasises creative and fulfilling work, and\nunderestimates the importance of, say, leisure and intellectual\nexcellence.) Reaching anything like a considered judgment on these\nempirical and quasi-empirical issues would clearly require some\ncomplicated factual assessments of, amongst other issues, the\ncomposition and functioning of human nature and the extant social\nworld. \n\nA range of complex empirical and quasi-empirical issues also look to\nbe woven into Marx’s views about the extent of alienation.\nConsider the various unsystematic claims about the historical location\nand comparative intensity of alienation that can be found in his\nwritings (and, less ambiguously, in certain secondary interpretations\nof those writings). These various claims include: first, that certain\nsystematic forms of alienation—including alienation in\nwork—are not a universal feature of human society (not least,\nthey will not be a feature of a future communist order); second, that\nat least some systematic forms of alienation—presumably\nincluding religious alienation—are widespread in pre-capitalist\nsocieties; and third, that systematic forms of alienation are greater\nin contemporary capitalist societies than in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. \n\nTake the last of these assorted claims; that is, the comparative\nverdict about the extent or intensity of alienation in capitalist\nsocieties. Its plausibility is scarcely incontrovertible, given the\namount of sheer productive drudgery, and worse, in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. Nor is it obvious how one might attempt to substantiate the\nempirical dimensions of the claim. The empirical difficulties of\nmeasuring subjective alienation look considerable enough (especially\ngiven the limitations of historical data), but alienation for Marx is\nfundamentally about the frustration of objective human potentials,\nthose separations that prevent self-realisation, perhaps especially\nself-realisation in work. One suggestion, made in this context, is\nthat the scale of alienation in a particular society might be\nindicated by the gap between the liberating potential of human\nproductive powers, on the one hand, and the extent to which that\npotential is reflected in the lives actually lived by producers, on\nthe other (Wood 2004: 44–48). The appeal of this proposed\nmeasure—not least in the potential support it offers to\nMarx’s comparison between capitalist and pre-capitalist\nsocieties—is clear enough, but the social scientific details of\nhow one might actually apply that kind of measure in particular\nhistorical cases remain obscure. \n\nRelated worries might also apply to claims about the prognosis for\nalienation, in particular, about whether and how alienation might be\novercome. Consider, for instance, Marx’s view that communist\nsociety will be free of certain systematic forms of alienation, such\nas alienation in work. (The reference to ‘systematic’ is\nincluded because there seems no good textual or theoretical reason to\nlumber Marx with the view that the alienation of Gillian from her\nsister Hanna—whose hypothetical estrangement, you will recall,\narose from sibling rivalry, stubbornness, and a chance\nmisunderstanding at a time of family crisis—could never exist\nunder communism.) Marx’s view about communism rests crucially on\nthe judgement that it is the social relations of capitalist society,\nand not its material or technical arrangements, which are the cause of\nsystematic forms of alienation. For instance, he holds that it is not\nthe existence of science, technology, and industrialisation, as such,\nwhich are at the root of the social and psychological ills of\nalienation, but rather how those factors tend to be organised and\noperated in a capitalist society; that is, a society based on a\nparticular class division – in which producers can only access\nmeans of production by selling their labour power—and in which\nproduction, and much else, is driven by a remorseless search for\nprofit. In volume one of Capital, Marx writes approvingly of\nworkers who, through time and experience, had learnt ‘to\ndistinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to\ndirect their attacks, not against the material instruments of\nproduction, but against the mode in which they are used’ (1996:\n432). If this had not been his view, Marx could not have,\nconsistently, also suggested that communist society – which, on\nhis account, is similarly technologically advanced and\nindustrial—could avoid this kind of alienation. This suggestion\nis strikingly sanguine. Marx is confident, for instance, that the\nconsiderable gulf between the gloomy results of adopting machinery in\nthe capitalist present (where it increases the repetitiveness of\ntasks, narrows talents, promotes ‘deskilling’, and so on)\nand the bright promise of its adoption in the communist future (where\nit will liberate us from uncreative tasks, create greater wealth,\ndevelop all-round abilities, and so on) is easily bridged. However,\nMarx’s ‘utopophobia’—his reluctance to say\nvery much, in any serious detail, about the future shape of socialist\nsociety – prevents him from offering any serious discussion\nabout how precisely this might be done (Leopold 2016). As a result,\neven the mildest of sceptics could reasonably worry that a range of\ndifficult empirical, and other, questions, are evaded rather than\nanswered here. \n\n(This issue—whether, and to what extent, alienation can be\novercome—is sometimes conflated with the issue of whether, and\nto what extent, alienation is a historically universal phenomena. To\nsee that they are distinct questions, imagine that alienation only\nemerges in economically developed societies, that it is a necessary\nfeature of economically developed societies, and that economically\ndeveloped societies never revert voluntarily to economically\nundeveloped ones. These are not implausible claims, but together they\nseem to entail that, although only a subset of historical societies are\nscarred by alienation,  if you happen to live in an economically\ndeveloped society, then—involuntary Armageddon apart –\nalienation will be the continuing fate of you and your successors.) \n\nMy aim here is not to make significant progress in resolving any of\nthese empirical issues, but rather to mark their existence and extent.\nSince the concept of alienation diagnoses a complex range of social\nills involving self and other, it is perhaps not surprising that a\nvariety of empirical issues are implicated in these various accounts of\nits proper characterisation, its historical scope, and the\npossibilities for overcoming it. Nonetheless, it remains important to\nacknowledge the existence and complexity of these empirical threads, in\naddition to those conceptual and normative ones discussed above.","contact.mail":"david.leopold@politics.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"politics.ox.ac.uk"}]
