Douglass escaped from slavery in 1838 and rose to become\na principal leader and spokesperson for the U.S. Abolition movement.\nHe would eventually develop into a towering figure for the U.S. Civil\nRights Movement, and his legacy would be claimed by a diverse span of\ngroups, from liberals and integrationists to conservatives to\nnationalists, within and without black America.\n\n\nHe wrote three autobiographies, each one expanding on the details of\nhis life. The first was Narrative of the Life of Frederick\nDouglass, an American Slave, Written By Himself (in\n 1845);[3]\n the second was My Bondage and My Freedom (in 1852a; FDAB:\n 103–452);[4]\n and the third was Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (in\n1881; FDAB: 453–1045). They are now foremost examples of the\nAmerican slave narrative. In addition to being autobiographical, they\nare also, as is standard, explicitly works of political and social\ncriticism and moral suasion; they were aimed at the hearts and minds\nof the readers, and their greater purpose was to attack and to\ncontribute to the abolition of slavery in the United States, and to\nargue for the full inclusion of black Americans into the nation.\n\n\nShortly after escaping from slavery, Douglass began operating as a\nspokesperson, giving numerous speeches about his life and experiences,\nfor William Lloyd Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery Society. To\nspread his story and assist the abolitionist cause, as well as to\ncounter early charges that someone so eloquent as he could not have\nbeen a slave, Douglass wrote and published his first autobiography,\nthe Narrative. The Narrative brought Douglass fame\nin the United States and the United Kingdom, and it provided the funds\nto purchase his freedom.\n\n\nAfter breaking with Garrison, Douglass founded and edited his first\npaper, the North Star, and authored a considerable body of\nletters, editorials, and speeches. These writings have been collected\nin Philip Foner’s multivolume, The Life and Writings of\nFrederick Douglass (1950–1975, hereafter\n FDLW),[5]\n and in John W. Blassingame and John R. McKivigan’s multivolume,\nThe Frederick Douglass Papers (1979–, hereafter FDP).\n\n\n\nDouglass’s life, from slavery to statesman, his writings and\nspeeches, and his national and international work have inspired many\nlines of discussion in debate within the fields of American and\nAfrican American history, political science and theory, sociology, and\nin philosophy. His legacy is claimed, despite his links to ideas of\ncultural and racial assimilationism, by black Nationalists as well as\nby black liberals and black conservatives.\n\n\nDouglass can be linked to the history of American philosophy, through\nhis participation in national discussions about the nature of and\nfuture of the American Republic and its institutions. In that light he\nis linked to his contemporaries who had academic philosophic\nconnections, in particular Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), and\nby the uptake of his political and social legacy and writings by later\nAfrican American philosophers, such as W.E.B. Du Bois\n(1868–1963) and Alain Locke (1884–1954; see Harris 1989).\nFrederick Douglass: A Critical Reader, edited by Bill E.\nLawson and Frank M. Kirkland (1999), is a valuable guide to lines of\ninquiry about Douglass, and the debates he inspired, within philosophy\nin the United States. In contemporary philosophy in the United States,\nDouglass’s work is usually taken up within American philosophy,\nAfrican American philosophy, and moral, social, and political\nphilosophy; in particular, the debates in those areas focus on his\nviews concerning slavery and (later in his career at the dawn of Jim\nCrow segregation) racial exploitation and segregation, natural law,\nthe U.S. constitution, violence and self-respect in the resistance\nagainst slavery, racial integration versus emigration or separation,\ncultural assimilation, racial amalgamation, and women’s\nsuffrage.\n\nIn his three narratives, and his numerous articles, speeches, and\nletters, Douglass vigorously argued against slavery. He sought to\ndemonstrate that it was cruel, unnatural, ungodly, immoral, and\nunjust. He laid out his arguments first in his speeches while he was\nwith Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery Society, and then in his\nfirst autobiography, the Narrative. As the U.S. Civil War\ndrew closer, he expanded his arguments in many speeches, editorials,\nand in his second autobiography, My Bondage and My\nFreedom. \nIn his own words he worked to pour out a “scorching irony”\nto expose the evil of slavery (1852b, FDLW v.2: 192). His rebellion\nagainst slavery began, as he recounted, while he was a slave. In his\nnarratives, this depiction of early recognition, and general\nrecognition among blacks and some whites, of the injustice,\nunnaturalness, and cruelty of slavery is a major element of his\nargument. \nIt marks his first argument against slavery. Some of the apologists\nfor slavery claimed that blacks were beasts, subhuman, or at least a\ndegenerated form of the human species. These arguments go back to at\nleast Sepulveda’s arguments in the fifteenth century, which\nBartolomé de las Casas famously countered (1552; see also,\nFrederickson’s review of the early history of racism [2002]),\nand were common in the American British Colonies and then the United\nStates; for example, Thomas Jefferson famously intimates this point in\nhis Notes on the State of Virginia (1785: Query 14). Douglass\nargued that blacks were fully rational humans, and mocked\nslavery’s apologists for its hypocrisies and contradictions when\nit claimed otherwise. In his Fourth of July Address, he derides the\nvery idea that he would even need to argue this point (1852b).  \nAgainst the claim that blacks were beasts, he argued that rather\nslavery had brutalized them. He pointed to the obviousness of the\nhumanity of blacks, and to the hypocrisy of the apologists for slavery\nin America on this question: why should there be special laws\nprohibiting the free actions of blacks, such as rebelling against the\nmaster or any other white person, if slaves were bestial and incapable\nof independent, responsible behavior? Why, indeed, had slave masters\nencouraged their slaves' Christianization, and then forbade their religious\ngatherings? Along with this hypocrisy, American slaveholders feared\nand banned the education of blacks, while demanding and profiting from\ntheir learning and development in the skilled trades. Thus, Douglass\nargued the accusation that blacks were beasts was predicated on the\nguilty knowledge that they were humans. Additionally, it subverted not\nonly the natural goodness of blacks by brutalizing them, but it also\ndid so to white slaveholders and those otherwise innocent whites\naffected by this wicked institution. Slavery, Douglass pointed out,\nmaking reference to Jefferson’s anxieties in Query 18 of\nthe Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), that slavery was a\npoison in the body of the republic. \nSecond, since blacks were humans, Douglass argued they were entitled\nto the natural rights that natural law mandated and that the United\nStates recognized in its Declaration of Independence and Constitution.\nSlavery subverted the natural rights of blacks by subjugating and\nbrutalizing them: taking men and turning them, against God’s\nwill and nature, into beasts. Third, as an affront to natural law,\nslavery contradicted God’s law. Douglass cited biblical passages\nand interpretations popular with abolitionists. As a witness and\nparticipant of the second Great Awakening, he took seriously the\npoliticized rhetoric of Christian liberation from sin, and, as with\nother abolitionists, saw it intrinsically wrapped up with liberation\nfrom slavery, and indeed national liberation. Fourth, he argued that\nslavery was inconsistent with the idea of America, with its national\nnarrative and highest ideals, and not just with its founding\ndocuments. Fifth, drawing on the ideas of manifest destiny, as well as\nthe idea of natural law realized in historical progress, he argued\nthat slavery was inconsistent with development: moral, political,\neconomic, social, and ultimately historical. America was on the wrong\nside of history on the question of slavery. \nTo defend slavery, some of its apologists drew on the idea of\nhistorical progress to offer the defense that slavery was a benevolent\nand paternal system for the mutual benefit of whites and blacks.\nDouglass countered by drawing on his experiences, and the experiences of\nother slaves, that American slavery was in no way benevolent. It\nbrutalized blacks, subjecting them to debilitating, murderous\nviolence; to rape; to the splitting up of families (another crime\nagainst nature); to denying them education and self-improvement; and\nto the exploitation of their labor and denying them access to their\nnatural right to property. Black slaves were not happy Sambos\nbenefiting from the largesse of kind, gentile white masters—they\nwere brutalized against all justice and reason. Neither were they\nlacking in agency or self-respect, nor were they, for all intents and\npurposes socially and morally dead, subjected to natal\n alienation.[6]\n They were moral beings, fully aware of the rights and capabilities\nthey were unjustly deprived of, and most of all they wanted freedom,\nindependence, the recognition of their full personhood, and their\nrights as U.S. citizens (McGary and Lawson 1992).  \nHoward McGary and Bill E. Lawson’s Between Slavery and\nFreedom: Philosophy and American Slavery (1992), is an\nindispensable source for philosophical analyses of these arguments,\nand the engagement of normative philosophy with historical and\nsociological theories of U.S. slavery, and Nicholas Buccola’s\nThe Political Thought of Frederick Douglass: In Pursuit of\nAmerican Liberty (2012), provides an excellent analysis of how\nDouglass’s critical examination of slavery fits into his\nliberalism and dominant conceptions of liberty of his time. An early,\nkey contributor to the philosophical literature on Douglass, and to\nAmerican philosophical literature on Douglass was Angela Davis, who of\ncourse is a key figure in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and the\nemergence of both the black power movement and black feminism since\nthe 1960s. Her groundbreaking essay on Douglass, “Unfinished\nLecture on Liberation-II”, argued for an active rather than\nstatic conception of liberty, drew on and criticized Rousseau’s\nconception of slavery, and applied her analysis to the Civil Rights\nstruggles she was involved in during the late 1960s and early 1970s\n([1971]\n 1983).[7] \nAs was mentioned in the above section, Douglass drew on the idea of\nnatural rights and the natural law tradition in his argument against\nslavery. Douglass was an Enlightenment thinker and a nineteenth\ncentury modernist (Moses 1978; Martin 1984; Myers 2008). As such, he\nhad a firm faith in the progress of man, civilization, and Western\nChristendom; hence, he saw American slavery as a brutal backwardness\nthat ran counter to the progress of history. God and the forward march\nof history, Douglass believed, would bring the realization of truth,\njustice, and the brotherhood of man. \nHis sources for his belief were many. The obvious sources include\nsources such as the American founding documents, popular\nintellectuals, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and his colleagues and\nacquaintances in the American Abolition movement, and the allies he\nencountered abroad; a particular source of his conception of natural\nlaw theory was George Combe’s The Constitution of Man,\nfrom 1834 (in Van Wyhe 2004). However, given the numerous religious\nreferences in his speeches and writings, and his drawing on the\nlanguage of the King James Bible, and the rhetoric of manifest\ndestiny, a primary source for his employment of the idea of natural\nlaw seems to be his adoption of the American Protestantism of the\nSecond Great Awakening, with its democratic, republican, and generally\nindependent spirit. \nHe believed that there were forces in operation, which must inevitably\nwork the downfall of slavery:  \n“The arm of the Lord is not shortened,” and the doom of\nslavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope.\nWhile drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the\ngreat principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions,\nmy spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age.\n(1852b, FDLW v.2: 203) \nRelying on the deus ex machina, however, was not enough for\nDouglass. His vision of human rights involved action (Myers 2008).\nHere he echoes the civic republican tradition by stressing the need\nfor active participation to claim, or earn one’s rights and\nstatus as a citoyen (Pettit 1997; Gooding-Williams 2009;\nRousseau [SC]). Humans resist providential justice; this could be\nseen in the resistance of the slave-holding states of America to the\nabolition of slavery and the apathy of many other Americans about\nslavery; thus, the end of slavery requires action: agitation, protest,\nand if needed military intervention. Douglass longed for God to cast\nhis thunderbolts at the United States, but he knew that to achieve the\nabolition of slavery in America, action was needed. His view of\nprovidence is on full display at the end of his famous Fourth of July\noration of 1852. Douglass uses Psalm 68:31 and pairs the idea of\nGod’s fiat with the image of Africa and Asia rising: \nThe far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet.\nThe Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat\nof the Almighty, “Let there be Light,” has not yet spent\nits force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice,\ncan now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and\ncrippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa\nmust rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. “Ethiopia shall\nstretch out her hand unto God”. (1852b, \nFDLW v.2: 203)[8] \nThere are many concerns about Douglass’s view of natural law,\nmanifest destiny and providence—these concerns are on display in\nthe last quotation, and it is not merely the supernaturalism, the\nbelief in a historical teleology, driven by cosmological\nontological-theological determination; it is also the costs of the\nassumptions of such a conception of historical development (McCarthy\n2009); namely, his adoption of nineteenth century conceptions of the\nbackwardness (or in kinder terms, underdevelopment) of non-Western\nEuropean groups; thus his relative silence about the United\nStates’s destructive actions against and policies toward Native\nAmerican groups. Douglass’s views have lead Wilson Jeremiah\nMoses to characterize him, along with other early black political\nfigures, as a Moses figure: he is an exodus leader, recipient of the\nnatural law for chosen peoples—African Americans in their\ntravail for freedom as well as the American Republic as a\nwhole—and he (paired eternally with Abraham Lincoln) is a law\ngiver (Moses 1978).  \nHis monumental, world-historical vita aside, Douglass’s\nfaith, much abused as it was, resulted in his inability to understand\nthe extent to which the United States was a racial republic\n(Frederickson 2002). He did not prognosticate, before or after the\nU.S. Civil War, that the progress he believed in would move at a\nglacial pace, and that for many of his black country men there would\nbe no justice all. Nevertheless, Douglass had no time for this\nshortsightedness; which comes only with the luxury of the liberty he\nfought for, and, of course, time. Douglass was not looking behind him;\nhe was fully engaged at every moment since his emancipation working to\nbring and end to slavery. Moreover, his view of natural law led to his\ncritique of American slavery, and undergirded his arguments for active\nresistance to slavery and his interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\nIt is also worth noting, that natural law theorists have not ceded the\nfield; thus Douglass is an important American historical figure in the\nintellectual history of natural law. \nIn 1851 Douglass broke from Garrison’s position that the U.S.\nConstitution was a pro-slavery document, and that the free states\nshould peacefully secede from the union. In a letter to Smith he\nreported that he was “sick and tired of arguing on the\nslaveholder’s side…” (Douglass 1851). Douglass\nsided with Gerrit Smith and the Liberty party’s position that\nthe United States’ founding documents were anti-slavery. \nIn his most famous speech, “What To the Slave Is The Fourth of\nJuly?”, he detailed what would come to be regarded as his\nsignature positions, such as the view that slavery was\nunconstitutional and contrary to natural law, that blacks were\nself-evidently human and entitled to natural rights, and that slavery\nwas contrary to the U.S. Constitution, American Republicanism, and\nChristian doctrine. He also began to defend violent resistance to\nslavery. Douglass’s second autobiography, My Bondage and My\nFreedom, reflected these changes, and his expanding intellectual\nindependence (FDAB; for a stand-alone edition, see the 1987 version\nedited by Andrews).  \nAlthough he initially acknowledges that the intentions of the framers\nwas to allow slavery to continue in the states where it was\nestablished, he reported that he was convinced by Smith’s\nargument that the meaning of the document was not set by the intention\nof the framers but by rules of legal interpretation that focused on\nnatural law. By the following year he even altered his position on the\nframers’s intentions: they meant the U.S. Constitution to be an\nanti-slavery document. \nDouglass depended heavily on the U.S. Declaration of Independence, as\nwell as the documented disagreements and cross-purposes, of the\nfounders. He was guided by his view of natural law, and argued that\nthe general ideas of America’s founding documents, as part of\nthe history of Western democracy and republicanism, pointed toward an\ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution as an evolving document that\ncould potentially be in tune with civilizational development. \nDouglass’s position on original intent, as it evolved through\nhis life, is part of the critical discussion about the assimilationist\ntradition, and whether that tradition, and Douglass, squarely\nrecognized the racialized character of the nation, how deeply embedded\nrace and racism were in its institutions, and that it was in many\nrespects a racial\n state.[9]\n This key critique of Douglass was given by Charles W. Mills, in his\n“Whose Fourth of July? Frederick Douglass and ‘Original\nIntent’” (Mills 1999). In short, Mills argues that\nDouglass fails to apprehend America’s racial contract. The\npractical problems of Douglass’s view aside, which U.S. history\nrevealed in the Great Compromise and the end of Reconstruction after\nthe Civil War, Douglass’s interpretation of the U.S.\nConstitution is reasonable and not blind to the facts; that Americans\ndid not live up to the ideals of their founding documents is another\nmatter. \nAs already noted above, Douglass was active in the years leading up to\nthe U.S. Civil War, vigorously protesting the Dred Scott decision,\nagitating against laws that protected the property rights of\nslaveholders over their slaves in the Free States and the spread of\nslavery into new U.S. territory. He lobbied the newly formed\nRepublican Party (the party of Abraham Lincoln) to support\nabolitionism, and met the militant abolitionist, John Brown. Although\nDouglass declined to join Brown’s militia—he sensed the\ndeadly potential of Brown’s zealotry and the likelihood of its\nfailure—he defended Brown’s ideals and denounced claims\nthat Brown was merely mad. Douglass quickly appropriated Brown’s\nideals, while distancing himself from the particular of Brown’s\nfatal actions, and used the raid at Harper’s Ferry to launch\nfurther criticisms against President Lincoln for his reluctance to\nsupport abolitionism. \nDouglass’s rejection of pacifism and his support for Federal\nmilitary intervention—Civil War—to end slavery was a major\nturning point in his thought, and part of his developing ideas about\nnatural law, divine providence and manifest destiny, and\nconstitutional interpretation. Douglass’s defense of jus ad\nbellum had a tremendous effect, not just on his contemporaries,\nbut also on the resulting debate on slavery, struggle, and\nself-respect. The modern debate in African American philosophy,\ncritical race theory, and black political theory begins with\nDouglass’s narratives, and in particular his famous fight with\nthe “Negro breaker”, Edward Covey. This incident plays a\nmajor role in all of Douglass’s narratives: Covey represents the\nbrutalizing institution of American slavery and Douglass’s fight\nand victory represents the assertion of\n manhood,[10]\n self-respect, dignity and freedom. Douglass’s time with Covey\nand the suffering he endured by Covey’s hand is given a\nlengthier description in My Bondage and My Freedom than in\nthe Narrative; moreover, Douglass adds his own political and\ntheological interpretation to the later account. In My Bondage and\nMy Freedom the fight stresses how Douglass’s struggles\nreflect the struggles of the slaves around him, and that it is an\ninstance of a general phenomenon; lest someone think that Douglass\nnarrative is too particular and peculiar to represent the attitudes of\nother black Americans. Additionally, his fight is given explicit\nnational political connotations (Gooding-Williams 2009; Myers 2008).\nThe scene as Douglass writes it in each version is powerful, and is\nindicative of the narrative (literary, rhetorical, and philosophical)\nbrilliance of Douglass’s narratives, and so deserves to be\nquoted at length. \nIn the Narrative (1845), Douglass wrote:  \nThe battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a\nslave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived\nwithin me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed\nself-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be\nfree. The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full\ncompensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He\nonly can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has\nhimself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never\nfelt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery,\nto the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice\ndeparted, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that,\nhowever long I might remain as slave in form, the day had passed\nforever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it\nbe known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in\nwhipping, must also succeed in killing me. (FDAB: 65) \nIn My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he gives the following\nexpanded interpretation: \nWell, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey,—undignified as\nit was, and as I fear my narration of it is—was the turning\npoint in my “life as a slave.” It rekindled in my\nbreast the smouldering embers of liberty; it brought up my Baltimore\ndreams, and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being\nafter that fight. I was nothing before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It\nrecalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence, and\ninspired me with a renewed determination to be a FREEMAN. A man,\nwithout force, is without the essential dignity of humanity. Human\nnature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a helpless\nman, although it can pity him; and even this it cannot do\nlong, if the signs of power do not arise. (FDAB: 286, original\nemphases) \nThe first passage displays Douglass’s romantic and religious\ninfluences; it swells with the longing for the freedom of the soul.\nThe second passage, written without demands of Garrison’s\npacifist politics directing his pen, screams independence and force,\nit recommends violence—it advocates for the coming U.S. Civil\nWar—to throw off tyranny and to claim, to defend, even fulfill,\none’s honor and humanity. The fight with Covey has inspired a\nnumber of philosophical interpretations about Douglass’s\nintentions and the meaning of his struggle; some have seen it an\nexemplar of conceptions of the state of war within liberal political\ntheory (Davis [1971] 1983; FDN-Davis 2010), as deontological (Boxill 1997,\n1998; see also Boxill 1984 [1992]), as existentialist (Gordon 1999), or as\nfruitfully understand using a number of political and social\ntheoretical positions (Buccola 2012: 14–40; McGary and Lawson\n1992: 163–209; Willett 1998, 2001: 188–202). Across these\napproaches, Douglass’s narrative of his fight with Covey stands\nas a vibrant reference point in debates regarding violence,\nself-respect, and dignity. \nDouglass’s conception of providence, with its American themes of\nindividualism, anti-supernaturalism, and activism, and his view of\nnatural law influenced his view of universal human\n brotherhood.[11]\n This doctrine, with its religious and philosophical roots, was dearly\nheld by Douglass. He argued that the idea of universal human\nbrotherhood was consistent with the high ideals of American\nRepublicanism and Christianity, and it was offered as a response to\nthe rise in the United States of the racial theory of\npolygenesis, supported by the American School of ethnology,\nand argued for originally by Samuel Morton (1799–1851) and\npopularized by Josiah Nott and George Glidden’s Types of\nMankind (1854; Martin 1984; Myers 2008). \nDouglass put considerable effort into countering arguments that blacks\nwere subhuman, intellectually and morally inferior, and fit to be\ndominated as children, forever to be a race in nonage. Although he\nflirted with historical developmental arguments that black\ncivilizations had developed, he saw such arguments as too loosely\nrelated to the conditions of black Americans in his time, so he\nincreasingly turned to his natural law arguments. He argued that by\nthe high standard of Christian theology, blacks, as humans and\ncreation of the divine, were all equally the children of God, no\nmatter their present condition. One of his slogans got to the point:\n“A man’s a man for a’ that”. He used rhetoric\nthat appealed to the piety of the nation that the Christian Bible had\nto be correct on this score, and that—just as the soul of the\nnation depended on emancipation—the authority of the biblical\ntext depended on the affirmation of the unity of the human family: \nWhat, after all, if they are able to show very good reasons for\nbelieving the Negro to have been created precisely as we find him on\nthe Gold Coast—along the Senegal and the Niger—I say, what\nof all this?—“A man’s a man for a’\nthat”. I sincerely believe, that the weight of the argument\nis in favor of the unity of origin of the human race, or\nspecies—that the arguments on the other side are partial,\nsuperficial, utterly subversive of the happiness of man, and insulting\nto the wisdom of God. Yet, what if we grant they are not so? What, if\nwe grant that the case, on our part, is not made out? Does it follow,\nthat the Negro should be held in contempt? Does it follow, that to\nenslave and imbrue him is either just or wise? I\nthink not. Human rights stand upon a common basis; and by all the\nreason that they are supported, maintained and defended, for one\nvariety of the human family, they are supported, maintained and\ndefended for all the human family; because all mankind have\nthe same wants, arising out of a common nature. A diverse origin does\nnot disprove a common nature, nor does it disprove a united destiny.\n(1854; FDP1 v.2: 523) \nDouglass emphasized that not only was slavery against natural law and\nChristian morality, but that the very arguments concerning the\nsubhuman status of blacks that slavery’s apologists used to\njustify attempted slavery, contradicted the Bible and was heretical.\nDouglass, in short, leveraged the Bible, and obviously America’s\nreverence for it, against the rising tide of polygenesis race theory.\nHe stated: \nThe unity of the human race—the brotherhood of man—the\nreciprocal duties of all to each, and of each to all, are too plainly\ntaught in the Bible to admit of cavil.—The credit of the Bible\nis at stake—and if it be too much to say, that it must stand or\nfall, by the decision of this question, it is proper to say,\nthat the value of that sacred Book—as a record of the early\nhistory of mankind—must be materially affected, by the decision\nof the question. (1854, FDP1 v.2: 505) \nThe doctrine of universal human brotherhood for Douglass, and the\nabolitionists, was based on the Bible’s creation story and Acts\n17:26: “And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to\ndwell on all the face of the earth” (King James Version). \nThese words were not mere words for Douglass and the abolitionists;\nthey were not just-so stories. The Christian doctrine of the unity of\nthe human family or human brotherhood (as the sexist language that\nmarked the idea at least since the Enlightenment), contained the world\nhistorical insight of equal human dignity, which\nimplied—unleashed, as was seen in several revolutions in the\n18th and 19th-century—the uncompromising\ndemand for equal rights. \nDouglass’s belief in the evil of slavery, universal human\nbrotherhood, and the inevitability of human development, as well as\nhis observation of the mixing of the so-called races in the United\nStates, led his to support racial amalgamation. It is important to\nnote here that he thought that there were races to amalgamate, and he\naffirmed the basic idea that there were biologically distinct races\n(1854, FDP1 v.2: 497-525). As should be clear from his view of universal human\nbrotherhood, he did not however think that much followed from that\nadmission. The existence of biological race did not in his view negate\nthe theological-philosophical insight of universal human\nbrotherhood. \nDouglass understood that the sexual boundaries between the races were\nthin, and that indeed, the conditions of slavery led to a great deal\nof mixing. Recall that he held that his unacknowledged father was his\nwhite master. Beyond recognizing this condition, he began to promote\namalgamation, although, obviously, between free peoples. He believed\nthat blacks and white ought to be free to intermarry and indeed they\nshould intermarry. Why should they marry? Douglass, sensing the\ntransformation of the black and Native American population in the\nUnited States, believed this process was natural, that it would\ncontinue, and that a new third race, an American race, would emerge in\nthis land. During his time such views were highly inflammatory and\nserved, and continued to serve, as one reason offered against the\nemancipation of black slaves, and later as a justification for\nsegregation (Sundstrom 2008: 11–35 and 93–107).\nNonetheless, in the 1860s he boldly advocated for amalgamation between\nthe races. He remarked to a journalist, the day after his second\nmarriage to Helen Pitts, who was white, \n…there is no division of races. God Almighty made but one race.\nI adopt the theory that in time the varieties of races will be blended\ninto one. Let us look back when the black and the white people were\ndistinct in this country. In two hundred and fifty years there has\ngrown up a million of intermediate. And this will continue. You may\nsay that Frederick Douglass considers himself a member of the one race\nwhich exists. (1884, FDP1 v.5: 147) \nDouglass’s amalgamation is sometimes conflated with his support\nfor assimilation. Amalgamation is conceptually distinct from\nassimilation; one does not have to accept amalgamation to support\nassimilation. Assimilation concerns various degrees of social and\ncultural adoption, adaptation, and absorption. It can theoretically go\nin either direction, say from black to white or white to black, or it\ncan involve a subtle blending. In the United States, the assumption\nhas been that non-whites or white Ethnics would and should enter the\n“melting pot”, and assimilate to dominant white Protestant\nmores (Sundstrom\n 2003).[12] \nDouglass was not exceptional in his support of assimilation. A number\nof Douglass’s contemporaries, and several black leaders that\nfollowed him all supported some degree of assimilation. Some of\nDouglass’s early critics, such as Edward Blyden\n(1832–1912), Martin Delany (1812–1885), and Alexander\nCrummell (1819–1898), who did not support amalgamation, and in\nfact were separatists and racial nationalists, supported the\nassimilation by black Americans of Christianity and many of the\nstandards and values Western civilization (Moses 1978).  \nDouglas, as an advocate of assimilation and amalgamation, was by\nextension a supporter of what would be come known as integration. He\nis considered by some political theorists to be a primary example of\nthe political ideal of integration as distinct from separatism.\nDouglass’s amalgamationist-assimilationist views of the 1860s\nand on are not the integrationist ideas adopted in America of 1950s\nand 1960s; those views were influenced by cultural nationalists, like\nDu Bois, who advocated for social and political integration while the\ngroup maintained its own ethnic-racial ideals and identity. Yet,\nDouglass is a fitting hero for the integrationist impulse in\ngeneral. \nDouglass criticized the creation of separate societies, with distinct\n“negro pews, negro berths in steamboats, negro cars, Sabbath or\nweek-day schools,…churches”, and so on (Douglass\n1848a,b). Separatism, for Douglass, was in the interest of the\ndefenders of slavery, and after the U.S. Civil War, he regarded\nseparatism as a counter-ideal of the abolition movement.\nSelf-separation, according to Douglass, served the interests of whites\nwho wanted to deny blacks their right to integrate into society, to\nimprove and develop, and to enjoy the fruits of their labor. \nFor similar reasons he opposed plans for black American emigration to\nAfrica, the Caribbean, Mexico, or Latin America. He criticized the\nemigrationist visions of the American Colonization Society, founded by\nwhites, and the African Civilization Society, founded by blacks. He\nhad four reasons to oppose emigration schemes: First, for slavery to\nend, Douglass argued that black Americans needed to struggle against\nit in America. Second, Americans had no other home but the United\nStates; they were uniquely American, and products of American history.\nThird, black Americans had a right to the property their labor had\nproduced. By abandoning the United States, they were abandoning the\nland they built. He wrote, \nThe native land of the American Negro is America. His bones, his\nmuscles, his sinews, are all American. His ancestors for two hundred\nand seventy years have lived and laboured and died, on American soil,\nand millions of his posterity have inherited Caucasian blood. It is\npertinent, therefore, to ask, in view of this admixture, as well as in\nview of other facts, where the people of this mixed race are to go,\nfor their ancestors are white and black, and it will be difficult to\nfind their native land anywhere outside of the United States.\n(Douglass 1894b, in Brotz 1992: 329–30) \nFourth and finally, the real solution, according to Douglass, was not\nemigration, and separation, for that was contrary to historical\nprogress, providence, and the emergence of the new American race. All\nthe same, Douglass was not opposed to efforts of blacks in collective\nself-help and self-defense. Nonetheless, his opposition to emigration\ndisplayed the downside of his commitment to his natural law and\nmanifest destiny-inspired principles. He did not understand how\nimmigration might be, in the eyes of the black Americans that wanted\nto flee anti-black oppression and especially life-crushing oppression\nand murderous anti-black violence, a more than reasonable act of\nself-preservation and self-determination (much like his escape from\n slavery).[13]\n His opposition to emigration was such that it extended to the\ninternal migration of black Americans from the south to the\nnorth—the Great Migration or Black Exodus; he initially opposed\nthe individual choice of black Americans to flee the American South\nafter the rise of Black Codes, Jim Crow laws, and the development of\nagricultural peonage, which for all practical purposes reduced the\nlives of black Americans to slavery and certainly devastated their\nlife chances (Wilkerson 2010; Myers 2008). Douglass moderated his\nposition on migration only at the end of his life when his\ndisillusionment with the United States grew (Douglass 1879, 1888,\n1894a). \nThe relation between Douglass and the topic of black political\nleadership is wrapped up with his life, activities, and writing. He\nwas a leader among black Americans, and served as an unelected\nspokesperson for free and enslaved blacks during a monumental time for\nthe\n nation.[14]\n He was presented as a victim of and witness to slavery by the\nGarrisonian abolitionists, but he freed himself from their restraints,\njust as he freed himself from slavery. He wanted to speak for himself,\nto be his own man and to be a leader among men. In his\nself-emancipation from slavery, his efforts to shape his own story,\nand to speak his mind, he stands as an exemplar of leadership and its\nvirtues. \nHis example was quick to be seized and claimed by other prospective\nblack leaders and spokespersons. The most significant example of this\nwas the conflicting claim between W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T.\nWashington (1856–1915) over the meaning of Douglass’s\nlegacy. Indeed both men competed for the opportunity to publish a\nbiography of Douglass with the publishers George W. Jacobs &\nCompany in their series The American Crisis Biographies\n(Sundstrom 2008: 11–35). Du Bois’s bid for this task was\nrejected in favor of Washington’s (Washington 1907). Du Bois\nwas, instead, given the project of writing a biography of John Brown,\nwhich includes large sections on Douglass (Du Bois 1909). \nAfter the death of Douglass, Du Bois published an elegiac poem,\n“The Passing of Douglass” (c. 1895), and incorporated his\nnarrative in The Souls of Black Folk (1903, [1999: xxii),\nJohn Brown (1909), and\nBlack Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois presented\nDouglass as a freedom fighter and a leader of an activist community\nthat demanded full social and political liberty, equality, and\ninclusion. Du Bois’s Douglass was vigorous and fought for\nfreedom through self-assertion. Douglass, according to Du Bois, was no\naccommodationist: he was not given to offering obeisance to white\ndemands to maintain white political, social, and economic superiority\nover blacks. Du Bois made this pointed interpretation very clear in\nhis The Souls of Black Folks. In the second chapter of that\nbook Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington’s\naccomodationism in favor of his and Douglass’s demand for, and\nassertion of, black political and social equality and rights. Economic\nliberty is not enough, and any gains in the economic sphere would be\nhampered and vulnerable without the protections and opportunities\nprovided by social and political liberty and rights. And, of course,\neconomic considerations aside, the fight for equal rights and liberty\nis not solely about economic opportunity—it is about equal\ndignity and one’s full humanity. \nIt is important to note, however, that Du Bois takes on\nDouglass’s mantle of leadership after he argued against\nDouglass’s view of assimilation and amalgamation. Du Bois, in\nthe “The Conservation of Races”, rejects amalgamation,\nwhich Douglass supported, and argues for the conservation of a\ndistinct black identity and community (Du Bois 1897). Here is his\nreduction of the amalgamationist position: \nIt may, however, be objected here that the situation of the our race\nin America renders this attitude impossible; that our sole hope of\nsalvation lies in our being able to lose our race identity in the\ncommingled blood of the nation; and that nay other course would merely\nincrease the friction of races which we call race prejudice, and\nagainst which we have so long and so earnestly fought. (Du Bois 1897,\nin Brotz 1992: 488) \nDu Bois argues that black Americans ought to embrace a “stalwart\noriginality” that follows “Negro Ideals” and not\ndissolve into a general American identity (Du Bois 1897, in Brotz\n1992: 488). His view is sometimes referred to as cultural pluralism,\nand his arguments in that early essay, are important landmarks in\ndebates in African social and political thought over separation versus\nassimilation (Boxill 1992 [1997];\n1984 [1992]: 173–85; 1999; McGary 1999a; Pittman 1999; McGary 1999b:\n43–61), and the conservation of\n race.[15]\n Because of his cultural pluralism, it is tempting to think that Du\nBois rejects Douglass’s view of assimilation and integration;\nthat would be a serious mistake. He rejects Douglass’s vision of\ntotal assimilation in favor of the retention of some black ideals,\nwhich he too easily assumes that all blacks qua blacks share, but his\ncultural pluralism has at its end the creation of a community that are\n“co-workers” in the “kingdom of culture” (Du\nBois 1903 [1997: 39]).  \nIn response to the amalgamationist objection quoted at length above,\nDu Bois offers an early version of his brilliant conception of black\nAmerican double consciousness, and through his rhetorical questions at\nthe end of the passage presages his arguments against Douglass’s\nhopes of amalgamation and for his view of black political, social, and\ncultural solidarity: \nNo Negro who has given earnest thought to the situation of his people\nin America has failed, at some time in life, to find himself at these\ncross-roads; has failed to ask himself at some time: What, after all,\nam I? Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my\nduty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible and be an American? If\nI strive as a Negro, am I not perpetuating the very cleft that\nthreatens and separates Black and White America? Is not my only\npossible aim the subduction of all that is Negro in me to the\nAmerican? Does my black blood place upon me any more obligation to\nassert my nationality than German, or Irish or Italian blood would?\n(Du Bois 1897, in Brotz 1992: 488) \nDu Bois’s answers to these questions directly contradict\nDouglass’s view about amalgamation, though their views about\nassimilation share some similarities, such as the co-production and\nenjoyment of a common American higher culture. In the end, however, Du\nBois’s image of Douglass is skewed toward his own political\nprojects of elite leadership, racial solidarity, and uplift. \nBooker T. Washington’s Douglass is equally a work of art that\nreflects the image of the artist. Washington’s The Life of\nFrederick Douglass presents an image of Douglass that is contrary\nto Du Bois’s, and, unfortunately, clearly contrary to many of\nDouglass’s views (Washington 1907). It is a work of\nself-promotion; although he does accurately and fruitfully point out\nthe similarities between Douglass and himself (they both were born\nslaves, criticized the North’s complicity in slavery, and valued\nindustrial education—however, Douglass did not denigrate higher\neducation for black Americans, as Washington did), he fails to mention\nDouglass’s frequent and scorching demands for equal social and\npolitical rights, skews his relationship to John Brown and the\nHarper’s Ferry raid, and most of all he fails to mention\nDouglass’s view of amalgamation. Washington’s claim over\nDouglass’s legacy of leadership falls short of the facts.\nDouglass was a radical Republican, and demanded full inclusion of\nblack Americans in the life of the nation, and the opening up of all\nopportunities for education and advancement for blacks, and Washington\ndid not. \nDu Bois’s claims over Douglass, however, also fall short.\nDespite Du Bois’s assumption that he has inherited the mantle of\nblack political, social, and (he would add) cultural leadership from\nDouglass, Douglass’s leadership style and politics is markedly\nmore democratic than Du Bois’s. Douglass did not envision\nhimself as the embodiment of the spirit or culture of his people\n(Gooding-Williams 2009: 19–65). Although he probably saw himself\nas an instance of what Emerson called a “representative\nman”, (Emerson 1850: title) and certainly as a self-made man\n(Douglass 1860, 1893; Howe 1997: 137–56)—understood as\nmoral rather than a commercial ideal—he did not envision himself\nas the embodiment of the spirit or culture of his people. He was a\ndemocratic thinker, and understood that particular individuals and\nespecially leaders could fail to follow the guidance of the ideals\nnatural law and civic republicanism.  Douglass’s political activities, however, do provide a model\nof sorts of democratic politics in action. He worked with a variety of\ngroups, some underground while he was a slave, for example, eventually\nafter becoming literate he, unbeknownst to his master, participated in\nat least one Sabbath School, and several other groups after his escape\nand emancipation (Douglass, 1852a, FDAB: 298). Some of these groups\nwere all black, due to the condition of slavery, but as a free man he\nworked with integrated groups as well. These groups would have\ncross-cutting interests, such as in his work with the American Equal\nRights Association, an organization devoted to universal suffrage. At\nno point did he think of himself as the singular spokesman for the\nmovement or a group or his race. His politics were principled, in that\nhis views were strongly directed by his acceptance of a liberal\nconception of natural law, and the related ideas of natural law, human\nliberty and equality, and the wrongness of slavery.  He never shied\naway from pushing or arguing his views, but in terms of his practical\npolitics, he supported active, participatory, and democratic action\n(Douglass 1848a).  \nHis ideal of leadership was heavily influenced by his view of natural\nlaw, and his assumption that the role of heroes should be to stand up\nfor what was mandated by that law. This did not lead him to a view of\nauthoritarian, paternalistic liberalism. The principles of natural law\nand rights must be processed through a participatory democratic\nsystem. However, the role of the hero leadership, the political or\nsocial outsider, the heretic or eccentric, who stands against the\ntyranny of the majority or minority to defend human rights was\nabsolutely valuable. In defense of the actions of John Brown, for\nexample, Douglass wrote, putting him into heroic terms (with overtones\nof Carlyle and Emerson): \nHe believes the Declaration of Independence to be true, and the Bible\nto be a guide to human conduct, and acting upon the doctrines of both,\nhe threw himself against the serried ranks of American oppression, and\ntranslated into heroic deeds the love of liberty and hatred of\ntyrants, with which he was inspired from both these forces acting upon\nhis philanthropic and heroic soul. (Douglass 1859, FDLW v.2: \n 459)[16] \nThus, we see in his elegies to John Brown and Abraham Lincoln\n(Douglass 1876), in particular, the value he places on Emersonian\nrepresentative men and the ideal of the statesman guided by the\nprinciples of American Civic Republicanism, and his belief in natural\nlaw, and the moral progress of the universe. \nThroughout the duration of the Civil War, and in the years that\nfollowed, Douglass remained active in Republican Party politics. He\nwas a staunch supporter of the full, uncompromising Reconstruction of\nthe Union, and advocated for economic and education investment in free\nand newly-freed black Americans. He pressed for the expansion of and\nguarantee of civil rights for blacks, and in particular for the\ndefense of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which the Supreme Court\ndeclared unconstitutional in 1883 (Douglass 1883a).  \nIn keeping with his civil rights efforts, and his view of natural\nrights and the development of the United States into a just Republic,\nhe was was an early advocate of women’s suffrage (FDWR). The\nabolition and women’s suffrage movement, along with the\ntemperance movement, were deeply intertwined. Douglass became involved\nwith the American Equal Rights Association (E. DuBois 1978), and\nsupported its dual platform of racial and sexual equality. He joined\nother prominent leaders in the abolition movement, such as Sojourner\nTruth, and emerging leaders in the suffrage movement, such as Susan B.\nAnthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in these efforts. \nThere were simmering divisions in the American Equal Rights\nAssociation, due to cross-cutting and conflicting interests, and the\nlatent racism within the organization, which was largely lead by\nmiddle-class and wealthy white women. The tensions with the American\nEqual Rights Association, and the suffrage movement generally, erupted\nover the passing of the fifteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nThe 15th amendment franchised all male citizens, although,\nas U.S. history so brutally revealed, it did so in word but not in\ndeed. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony demanded that black\nmen and all women be enfranchised simultaneously, and opposed the\nfifteenth amendment on that principle. Some among the suffrage\nmovement based their arguments for women suffrage, and against the\nenfranchisement of blacks, on racist grounds. Although the white women\nwho lead the association were abolitionists, they also, and not\ninconsequentially, held that blacks, and in particular, black men,\nwere inferior to white women and neither as ready for nor deserving of\nthe vote as themselves. Occasionally even Stanton lowered herself to\ndraw on these claims (Stanton 1997a: 194-99; 1997b: 236-38).\n \nDouglass communicated his sympathy with the cause for the universal\nfranchise; however, he condemned the arguments for women’s\nsuffrage, such as those offered by the likes of Stanton, that were\npredicated on assumptions of black inferiority and degrading claims\nthat black or “Oriental” men, and by extension black and\nAsian women—i.e., Stanton’s nasty references to\n“Sambo” and “Yung Tung”—were not as\ndeserving as white women (Douglass 1869; Stanton 1997a: 194-99).\nDouglass did not want to delay black male suffrage to resolve this\nquestion over suffrage for all women. He believed it a practical\nmatter to quickly get some protections for black Americans while the\nfight for suffrage for black and white women continued. Moreover, he\nargued it was imperative to obtain some measure of political, legal,\nand social rights for blacks to confront the rising level of horrific\nanti-black violence that was sweeping the United States. Douglass\nfirmly made this claim in his speech at the American Equal Rights\nAssociation in 1869: \nI must say that I do not see how any one can pretend that there is the\nsame urgency in giving the ballot to women as to the negro. With us,\nthe matter is a question of life and death. It is a matter of\nexistence, at least in fifteen states of the Union. When women,\nbecause they are women, are hunted down through the cities of New York\nand New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses and hung upon\nlamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, and their\nbrains dashed out upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult\nand outrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their\nhomes burnt down over their heads; when their children are not allowed\nto enter schools; then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot\nequal to our own. (Douglass 1869, FDP1 v.4: 216) \nWhen asked if this did not apply to black women, Douglass replied that\nit did but because they were black and not women (Douglass 1869, FDP1\nv.4: 216). He did not, however, have ready answers to concerns about\nhow well black men, including elite black men, represented and\nprotected the rights and interests of black women. Nor did he fully\nappreciate the need for women to represent themselves and to be fully\nautonomous and independent moral agents and citizens. His\nshortsightedness was repeated by generations of black male leaders. It\nwas Anna Julia Cooper (c. 1859–1964), along with other black\nwomen leaders, who best articulated that argument (see Lemert and Bhan\n1998; for a general history of early black feminism, see Hine\n1994). \nThe controversies around the passage of the fifteenth amendment, and\nthe divisions and the eventual splitting of the American Equal Rights\nAssociation, lead to the famous criticisms of “first wave\nfeminism” by black women leaders such as Mary Church Terrell and\nAnna Julia Cooper, and has continued relevance today in debates about\nrace in feminist and black feminist philosophy (Guy-Sheftall 1995;\nHine 1994). \nDuring and after the Reconstruction, Douglass remained deeply\nconcerned about the prospect that the U.S. would compromise on the\ncivil and human rights of black Americans. He became increasingly\nconcerned about the denial of black civil rights and the rising waves\nof anti-black violence. He, thus, criticized the growing practice of\nblack peonage in agriculture, and over time he expressed sympathy with\nblacks who were fleeing the American South, although he did not\nsupport the black Exodus\n (see Section 6).\n He did not support the Exodus as a policy because he judged it bad\nfor black labor, and that it did not address the institutional\nproblems that caused the Exodus: peonage and exploitation, unequal\njustice, unrestrained violence, lack of resources and opportunities,\nand in particular, education. He received a great deal of criticism\nfor his position for failing to support the individual choices of\nblack Americans who sought to flee the inhospitable, degrading, and\ndeadly conditions in the American South. He also criticized\ninequitable and unfair treatment of blacks in state criminal justice\nsystems, in particular criticizing the Convict-Lease system (Davis\n1999). And he joined with Ida B. Wells (1862–1931) in raising\nalarm over the growing practice of anti-black lynching in the United\nStates (Wells-Barnett 2002; see also Lott’s “Frederick\nDouglass on the Myth of the Black Rapist”, in Lott 1999) He saw\nAmerica’s failure to support the civil rights, and the very\nlives, of black Americans as indicative of its moral and political\nfailure, and as evidence as he provocatively claimed that the\nEmancipation was a stupendous fraud. Douglass’s later-day\nactivities are an important and impressive part of his record and\nlife, and indeed a part of the evolving debates in African American\nphilosophy and critical theory about the carceral society (Davis\n1999). Notably, Angela Davis, who was a pioneer of Douglass research\nin philosophy in the United States, has lead the inquiry in this area;\nher scholarship continues to be ground-breaking, not only in relation\nto Douglass’s early role in this debate, but also on the issue\nof criminal justice, punishment, and incarceration in philosophy.","contact.mail":"rrsundstrom@usfca.edu","contact.domain":"usfca.edu"}]
