Perception\n(pratyakṣa) is etymologically rooted in the\nsense-faculty or the sense-organ (akṣa) and can be\ntranslated as sensory awareness, while pramāṇa, on\nthe other hand, is derived from knowledge (pramā) and,\nliterally means ‘the instrument in the act of knowing’.\nHowever, the standard interpretation of perception accepted by\nclassical Indian philosophers, barring the Buddhists and the\nVedāntins, is that it is a cognition arising within the\nself—the knowing subject—from mental operations following\na sense-object contact. It, therefore, is neither an instrument in the\nact of knowing, nor a mere sensory awareness. Definitions of\nperception from various classical Indian philosophy schools are given\nin section 2 below.\n\n\nThe same is true of concepts. There is no one agreed notion or\ndefinition of concept understood as the meaning of a general term in\nClassical Indian Philosophy. Rather, we have a variety of views\nranging from robust realism about concepts as real properties,\nessences or universals to extreme nominalism which admits only of\nunique particulars with versions of conceptualism in between. The\nrobust realist position is defended by the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṃsā\nschools, the nominalist by the Buddhist schools and the conceptualist\nby the Vedāntins and Jainas. I will not be discussing the\nconceptualist position or their arguments here because ultimately this\nposition ends up collapsing into a version of realism or\nnominalism.\n\nThe etymology of perception in Sanskrit underlines a major and,\nperhaps the most controversial, issue in classical Indian\nepistemology, viz. is the sensory core all there is to the\ncontent of a perceptual experience? Put differently, it is asked\nwhether the content of a perceptual experience is restricted\nto being unconceptualized (nirvikalpaka), or can any part of\nit be conceptualized (savikalpaka) as well? The\nNaiyāyikas generally take perception to be a two-staged process:\nfirst there arises a non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception\nof the object and then a conceptual (savikalpaka) perception,\nboth being valid cognitions. For Buddhists, non-conceptual perceptions\nalone are valid, while Grammarians (Śābdikas) deny their\nvalidity altogether. Sāṃkhya and\nMīmāṃsā agree with the Nyāya position. These\ntwo realist schools, Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā,\ncontest the Grammarian as well as the Buddhist positions. Advaita\nVedānta position on perception seems to agree, in spirit, with\nthe Buddhists, but their reasons for supporting non-conceptual\nperceptions alone as ultimately valid (paramārthika\nsatta) are very different. This debate, on the role of concepts\nin perception, is discussed in detail in section 3. \nYet another debate about the nature of universals and concepts looms\nin the background of this debate. How do we know universals or\nconcepts? The Buddhist introduce the doctrine of apoha to provide the\nresources for constructing concepts from sensory content to further\nthe nominalist project of explaining thought and language in a world\nof particulars. In response to Buddhist nominalism, Nyāya\nphilosophers present a defense of realism in the course of which they\nargue for a theory of real perceivable universals. This debate will be\nthe focus of secion 4. \nA very critical question germane to these epistemological issues is\nraised by the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 4th century CE): how\ndo we distinguish veridical perceptions from the non-veridical ones?\nThis is taken up in the last section. \nBefore we start out with the definitions, the following observation\nmay be noted. It is true that the classical Indian philosophers were\nseriously concerned with the notions of enlightenment, the highest\ngood, freedom from the cycle of rebirth and the attainment of ultimate\nbliss, etc. Therefore, some even question whether they were concerned\nwith any epistemological questions at all, much less the ones raised\nhere? But they were! For Naiyāyikas, in particular, this was a\nmajor focus: the reason offered in the early Nyāya tradition, in\nVātsyāyana’s (c. 450–500 CE) commentary on the\nNyāya-sūtra, is that without knowledge of objects\nthere is no success in practical response to them. Not very\nenlightening, perhaps. However, a much sharper justification comes\nfrom Gaṅgeśa (c. 12th century CE), the founder of the\nNavya-Nyāya school, in the introduction to his great work,\nJewel Of Reflection On The Truth\n(Tattvacintāmaṇi): \nIt should not then be surprising that one of the most sophisticated\nclassical Indian treatises dealing with perception,\nKumārila’s (c. 7th century CE)\nPratyakṣapariccheda (a portion of\nŚlokavārttika pertaining to the fourth\nsūtra of\nMīmāṃsā-sūtra), discusses the\nnature and validity of perception without any consideration of its\nrole in the ascertainment of religious and moral truth; in fact, the\nMīmāṃsā-sūtra itself characterizes\nperception as not being a means of knowing righteousness\n(Dharma). It is true that epistemological debates in\nclassical Indian philosophy arose in the religio-philosophical\ncontext; however, there is plenty of evidence on record to show that\nclassical Indian philosophers were haunted by the very same\nepistemological concerns that have troubled the minds of Western\nphilosophers through the ages. The controversial classical Indian\nepistemology issue—whether perception is conceptualized or\nnot?—continues to be debated in the Western and Indian\nphilosophy journals even today. That said, what makes this historical\ninquiry significant is that the epistemological issues in classical\nIndian philosophy are introduced against the backdrop of radically\ndifferent metaphysical and ethical presuppositions. \nMost classical Indian philosophical schools accept perception as the\nprimary means of knowledge, but differ on the nature, kinds and\nobjects of perceptual knowledge. Here we first survey Buddhist and\northodox Hindu schools’ definitions of perception (excluding\nVaiśeṣika and Yoga schools since they simply take on board\nNyāya and Sāṃkhya ideas, respectively) and note the\nissues raised by these definitions. As mentioned above, the orthodox\nschools generally accept both non-conceptualized (indeterminate) and\nconceptualized (determinate) perceptual states in sharp contrast to\nthe Buddhist view that perception is always non-conceptualized or\nindeterminate awareness. \nThe oldest preserved definition of perception in the Buddhist\ntradition is the one by Vasubandhu (c. 4th century CE),\n“Perception is a cognition [that arises] from that object [which\nis represented therein]” (Frauwallner, 1957, p. 120). However,\nthe more influential and much discussed view is that of later Buddhist\nYogācāra philosopher Diṅnāga (c. 480–540\nCE) for whom perception is simply a cognition “devoid of\nconceptual construction (kalpanāpodhaṃ)”.\nTaber (2005, p. 8) notes two important implications of this\ndefinition. First, perception is non-conceptual in nature; no seeing\nis seeing-as, because that necessarily involves intervention of\nconceptual constructs, which contaminate the pristine given.\nPerception is mere awareness of bare particulars without any\nidentification or association with words for, according to\nDiṅnāga, such association always results in falsification\nof the object. Referents of the words are universals which, for the\nBuddhist, are not real features of the world. Second,\nDiṅnāga’s definition only indicates a\nphenomenological feature of perception; it says nothing about its\norigin and does not imply that it arises from the contact of a sense\nfaculty with the object. Therefore, for the Buddhist idealist, the\nobject that appears in perceptual cognition need not be an external\nphysical object, but a form that arises within consciousness itself.\nBoth these ideas led to vigorous debates in classical Indian\nphilosophy between the Hindus and the Buddhists. The first of these\nideas relates to the notion of non-conceptual perception, the second\nto idealism. Diṅnāga’s philosophy is\nidealist-nominalist in spirit and his epistemological position is in\nsync with the Buddhist metaphysical doctrines of no-self, evanescence\nof all that exists and emptiness which, expectedly, evoke strong\nreaction from the realist Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and\nMīmāṃsā schools. \nIn recent literature, there has been a scholarly debate on whether the\nIndian Yogācāra philosophy is a form of idealism or not.\nThis debate is murky because there are various versions of idealism\ndiscussed in the literature in Buddhist philosophy. At least three\nversions have been discussed in recent literature in Buddhist\nphilosophy: subjective idealism (the view that there are no\nmind-independent objects); metaphysical idealism (the view that\nexternal objects do not exist); and, epistemic idealism (the view that\nwhat we are immediately aware of is intrinsic to cognition). Lusthaus\n(2002) and Coseru (2012) have argued, respectively, for a\n“phenomenological” and “phenomenalist\nnaturalist” interpretation of Yogācāra in opposition\nto the standard idealist interpretation. The main argument for the\nphenomenological reading is that the epistemic claims made by the\nYogācāra philosophers do not commit them to ontological\nclaims. This would avoid the charge of metaphysical idealism but is\nstill open to being interpreted as offering an epistemic or subjective\nidealism. Lusthaus sees Yogācāra philosophers’ denial\nof solipsism and affirmation of other minds as a fatal blow to the\nsubjective idealist interpretation of Yogācāra. Idealism\ndoes not necessitate solipsism as is made clear in Berkeley’s\nversion of subjective idealism and Hegel’s absolute idealism\nwhich explicitly requires other minds. Thus, there is reason to think\nthat the epistemic idealist interpretation of Yogācāra is\nnot threatened by its commitment to other minds. \nKellner and Taber (2014) have argued that Vasubandhu’s argues\nfor a standard metaphysical idealist position, which is to deny the\nexistence of physical objects outside of consciousness.Kellner and\nTaber (2014) also present a new reason for the revival of the standard\nidealist reading of Yogācāra. Their argument for this\nreading is based on Vasubandhu’s argumentative strategy rather\nthan the logical structure of individual proofs. They claim that in\nthe Viṃśikā Vasubandhu uses the argument from\nignorance, according to which, the absence of external objects is\nderived from the absence of evidence for their existence. They also\nnote that Vasubandhu uses the same strategy to refute the existence of\nthe self in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya IX. The\nargument from ignorance seems like a bad strategy. It is often listed\nas a logical fallacy of the general form: since statement P is\nnot known or proved to be true, P is false. But because the\ngeneral form of the argument is bad, it does not necessarily follow\nthat every argument of that form is unsuccessful. It may well succeed\nbecause of other features, for example the semantic meanings of the\nterms or when the arguments are arguments to the best explanation.\nKellner and Taber emphasise that some arguments from ignorance are\nsuccessful when they function as arguments to the best explanation\nespecially in contexts where there are agreed-upon standards of\nverification. For example, the medical community agrees that the most\naccurate and sensitive test for typhoid is testing the bone marrow for\nSalmonella typhi bacteria. If it turns out that it cannot be proven\nthat one has typhoid (because of the lack of Salmonella typhi bacteria\nin one’s bone marrow), then it is false that one has typhoid. No\nmatter how suggestive the symptoms are, if the specific bacteria do\nnot show up in the bone marrow within a specific time period, then one\ndoes not have typhoid. So, then, the question is: Is\nVasubandhu’s argument from ignorance successful for establishing\nidealism? I fear not. That is because there are no universally\nagreed-upon criteria among Classical Indian philosophers (not even\namong fellow-Buddhists) as to what counts as evidence for the\nexistence of external things. \nMore recently in a series of papers on Buddhist idealism, Kellner\n(2017a) revisits Vasubandhu’s argument from ignorance to\nestablish the non-existence of external objects and\nDharmakīrti’s objections to it. Dharmakīrti was among\nthe first Indian logician’s to pay attention to how we can know\nabout non-existence. Dharmakīrti is worried about the validity of\narguments from ignorance in general and was the first to argue that\nthese arguments cannot be used to establish the absence of a class of\nentities. He posits non-apprehension (anupalabdhi) as a\nspecial kind of reason (hetu) to prove non-existence of\nobjects, but is careful to qualify again that non-apprehension can\nonly prove the situationally specific absence of particular objects,\nit cannot prove the non-existence of an entire class of objects.\nArguments from ignorance and non-apprehension cannot prove the\nontological non-existence of objects. Dharmakīrti thus is only\ninterested in supporting the weaker epistemic idealist position that\nexternal objects are imperceptible. As far as his arguments go they\nnever establish anything beyond this conclusion. Some, for example\nRatié (2014, 361) argue that Dharmakīrti does not need to\nadd anything to this to establish the stronger metaphysical idealism.\nThe stronger thesis follows because of his ontological principle\n“to be is to be causally efficacious”\n(arthakriyā). If external objects are completely\nimperceptible in that they cannt even produce the minimal effect of\nperceptual awareness, then they are as good as being non-existent.\nKellner, however, notes that such a conclusion is excluded by\nDharmakīrti’s logical theory which highlights the\nevidential gap between imperceptibility and non-existence. For him,\nabsence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence. \nDharmakīrti’s target is to show that external objects are\nimperceptible, any further conclusion about the existence or otherwise\nis totally irrelevant, only to be oursued by those interested in\nfutile metaphysical arguments. Following Kellner (2017b) his argments\nfor the imperceptibility of external obejcts can be divided into two\ngroups. The first group of arguments point to defects in the realist\ntheory of perception supported by the Hindus and fellow Buddhists. The\nsecond group focuses on positive argument against the imperceptibility\nof external objects based on the nature of cognition. It is this group\nwhich contains Dharmakīrti’s distinctive and novel\ncontribution to the debate and deserve much more attention than they\nhave received in the contemporary philosophical literature. The first\ngroup of arguments leads Dharmakīrti to conclude the\nself-reflexive nature of cognition. Cognition is ‘aware of\nitself’ and of nothing else. The second group of arguments then\ndefends this conclusion by appeal to the nature of cognition. \nDharmakīrti begins by pointing to the well-known fact that there\nis incongruence between the external object and our perception of it.\nVisual perception, for example, is limited to certain aspects or\nfeatures of the object. The external object as a whole is never\nvisually perceived. We do not perceive cups and pots, but only its\ncolour, shape, size and so on. So, he asks, what reason is there to\ncup and pots over and above visual perception of shapes, sizes and\ncolours. This incongruence allows him to conclude that perception does\nnot have the form of the external object or it’s form is\ndeviant. Next he questions whether the realist commitment to causation\nand resemblance between the form (image, impression) and the external\nobject establishes that perception must have external objects.\nCausation cannot work on its own by virtue of the well-known fact that\nour cognitions can and do have internal mental causes. And the notion\nof resemblance is too weak and vague to do any real work in\nindexically linking particular forms to objects in front of\none’s eyes. These two negative arguments suggest the conclusion\nthat there is no external object to be experienced by cognition. This\nconclusion is then supported by two further positive arguments\nreferred to as saṃvedana-argument and the\nsahopalambhaniyama-inference in the literature. The\nsaṃvedana-argument appeals to the nature of cognition\nas that which appears in a certain way. And this\n“appearing-to-in-a-certain-way” highlights the\nintransitive nature of cognition. Cogniton by its nature is\nself-illuminating, it shines forth itself. This argument is no doubt\nterse and can do with further explication but Dharmakīrti does\nnot elaborate. The second argument,\nsahopalambhaniyama-inference is also tersely encapsulated in\na single sentence in the text: “No object [is observed] without\nawareness, nor is an awareness observed being experienced without an\nobject; thus they are not different”\n(Pratyakṣapariccheda, 390). Taber (2010, 292–3)\npresents a useful reconstruction of the argument. The argument draws\non the logical principle of Identity of Indiscernibles: two things\nhaving exactly the same properties are identical. However, the\nargument at issue just points to sharing of one crucial propert: the\nproperty of being perceived at the same time. This crucial property is\nregarded as sufficient evidence to establish that the two things are\n“non-different”. Both these arguments deserve further\nelaboration before we can properly assess whether they are succesful\nin establishing the conclusion. This new literature in ceratinly a\nstart in the right direction and opens up new research questions for\ncontemporary philosophers. \nThe most comprehensive, and the most influential, definition of\nperception in classical Indian philosophy is offered in\nGautama’s Nyāya-sūtra 1.1.4: \nExpectedly, each part of this definition has raised controversy and\ncriticism. If perception is a cognition (and non-erroneous), then it\nis a state of knowledge, rather than a means to knowing! How does that\nconstitute a primary means of knowledge? Some Naiyāyika\ncommentators, Vācaspati Miśra (c. 900–980 CE) and\nJayanta Bhaṭṭa (c. 9th century CE) among them, suggest\nthat the sūtra is to be understood by adding to it the\nterm ‘from which (yataḥ),’ since the\npreceding sūtra-s indicates that Gautama’s\nformulation of this sūtra was intended to define an\ninstrument of knowledge. Another issue has been the interpretation of\nthe word ‘contact’. In what sense are the eye and the ear,\nthe sense organs for vision and auditory perception, respectively, in\ncontact with their objects? Here a careful look at the term\n‘sannikarṣa,’ generally translated as\ncontact, helps resolve the issue;\n‘Sannikarṣa’ literally means ‘drawing\nnear,’ and can be interpreted as being in close\nconnection with or in the vicinity of. Thus perception is\nthat which arises out of a close connection between the sense organ\nand its object. \nMore substantial debates on the nature of perception focus on the\nadjectives in the latter part of the sūtra, viz.,\nnon-verbal (avyapadeśyam), non-erroneous or\nnon-deviating (avyabhichāri), and well-ascertained or\nfree from doubt (vyavasāyātmaka). There is some\ndisagreement among the Naiyāyika commentators about the\ninterpretations of the adjectives non-verbal and well-ascertained.\nVātsyāyana, in his commentary on the\nNyāya-sūtra, argues that the adjectives non-verbal\nand well-ascertained are really part of the definition; non-verbal to\npoint out that perceptual knowledge is not associated with words\n(Bhartṛhari, the famous Grammarian, on the other hand, holds\nthat awareness is necessarily constituted by words and apprehended\nthrough them) and well-ascertained to affirm that perceptual knowledge\nis only of a definite particular and specifically excludes situations\nin which the perceiver may be in doubt whether a perceived object\n‘a’ is an F or a G. Vācaspati\nMiśra, argues that the adjective well-ascertained need not be\nused to exclude the so-called perception in the form of doubt, as\ndoubtful knowledge, being invalid, is already excluded by the\nadjective non-erroneous. Rather, the term\nvyavasāyātmaka stands for determinate perceptual\njudgment. Thus understood, the adjectives non-verbal and\ndeterminate seem to be complementary; a piece of\nnon-verbal perceptual knowledge cannot be said to be, at the\nsame time, determinate. Vācaspati Miśra posits that\nthese two adjectives indicate two different forms of perceptual\ncognition and are not to be regarded as its defining characteristics.\nAccording to him, Gautama included these adjectives to identify two\nkinds of perceptual knowledge: avyapadeśyam\nindicates non-conceptual or non-verbal perception and\nvyavasāyātmaka indicates conceptual or determinate\nperceptions. He contends that by the term non-verbal, Gautama refutes\nthe Grammarian view and includes non-conceptual perception and, by the\nterm well-ascertained, he refutes the Buddhist view and includes\nconceptual or judgemental perceptions as valid. Pradyot Mondal (1982)\ntraces the history of this controversy among Naiyāyikas. He\noffers overwhelming scholarly evidence in favor of the view that\nNaiyāyikas mostly regard the adjectives as part of the definition\nof perception and do not agree with Vācaspati’s\ninterpretation. For most Naiyāyikas “non-verbal” is\nincluded to deny the causal role of words in origination of perceptual\ncognition and, therefore, it applies to non-conceptual and conceptual\nperceptions both, the difference being that the former is\ninexpressible in language, while the latter is not. Thus Mondal claims\nthat the adjective “non-verbal” is sufficient on its own\nto reject the Grammarian and the Buddhist views of perception. The\nNyāya pphilosophers seek the middle ground between these\npositions to defend their thoroughly realist view. They argue that\ntheir is some mental shaping in almost all perceptual events, memory\ndispositions acquired on account of previous experiences are among the\ncausal factors contributing to the current perception. Perceptual\nexperience in this sense is laden with or infused by concepts. This,\nhowever, does not compromise the realism, since the concepts\nthemselves are repeatable features of real objects and are\nperceptually acquired in past encounters with these features. For\nperception to be a source of knowledge it must be concept-laden, such\nthat it is verbalizable and determinate (Phillips, 2019). The exact\nrole of concepts in perception—in dispute in the\nNyāya/Buddhist debate—will be discussed in the next\nsection. \nThe early Naiyāyikas held that perception is determinate, but\nunder pressure from the the Buddhists opponents Vācaspati\nMiśra (in about the 10century AD) conceeds that there is also\nconcept-free indeterminate perception. In his commenatry on the\nNyāyasutra 1.1.4, Vācaspati interprets the\nqualifiers non-verbal (avyapadeśyam) and\nwell-ascertained or free from doubt\n(vyavasāyātmaka) as indicating two types of\nperception: indeterminate and determinate. Indeterminate perception is\nthus conceived as the first stage of sensory processing without any\nmental shaping. The indeterminate sensory percept generated at this\nstage is then classified by the mind resulting in a determinate\nperception of a whole object qualified by its parts (or features).\nThis idea is later taken up by the Navya-Naiyāyika\nGaṅgeśa, according to whom, indetreminate perception is\nindispensible for explaining how our concepts originate in reality.\nDeterminate perception of a thing as qualified by its features, e.g.,\nThat’s a cow, requires a prior grasp of the qualifier\n‘cowness’. The usual explanation will turn to memory\ndispositions acquired by previous encounters with cow. This\nexplanation however cannot be extended to a child’s perception\nof a cow for the first time. In the first instance, Gaṅgeśa\nclaims, the ‘cowness’ is grasped indeterminately in that\ncowness is grasped but not as related to a particular cow. \nGaṅgeśa also objects to the notion ‘sensory\nconnection’ in the classical Nyāyasutra definition\nof perception, arguing that this makes the definition too wide and too\nnarrow at the same time: too wide because it implies that\nevery awareness is perceptual being produced by virtue of a\nconnection with the ‘inner’ sense faculty or mind\n(manas); too narrow because it fails to include divine\nperception, which involves no sensory connection. Gaṅgeśa\noffers a simpler definition of perception as an awareness which has no\nother awareness as its chief instrumental cause. Being concerned that\nhis definition may be interpreted as ruling out conceptualized or\ndeterminate perception that may have non-conceptual or indeterminate\nperception as one of it causes, he argues that indeterminate\nperception can never be the chief instrumental cause of\ndeterminate perception, although it is a cause, since it\nsupplies the qualifier or the concept for determinate perception. This\nsimpler definition has other problems. Perception is a source of\nknowledge so Gaṅgeśa must explain how this definition rules\nout non-veridical perceptions. So, he spends the longest Section in\nthe Chapter on Perception in his Tattvacintāmaṇi Jewel\nof Reflection on the Truth about Epistemology on giving a general\naccount of illusion as “appearance of something other than it\nis”. \nThe Purva Mīmāṃsā-sūtra\n(MS) were originally composed by Jamini around 200 BCE. The fourth MS\n1.1.4 says: \nThere is no consensus among Mīmāṃsā commentators\non whether this is intended as a definition of perception, even while\nan initial reading of it suggests that it may be. Kumārila, the\nnoted Mīmāṃsā commentator argues that the first\npart of the sūtra is not intended as a\ndefinition because of the context in which it figures; the\nsūtra-s preceding it are concerned with an inquiry into\nrighteousness (Dharma). Moreover, the sūtra\nconstrued as a definition of perception, results in too wide, and not\ntoo accurate, a definition, because it only says that perception\narises from a connection between the sense faculty and an existing\nobject and does not exclude perceptual error or inferential cognition.\nTaber (2005, 16), on the other hand, suggests that it is possible to\nconstrue MS 1.1.4 as a valid definition, and indeed such a construal\nwas proposed by an earlier commentator, the so-called\nVṛttikāra quoted at length by Śābara in\nhis Śābarabhāṣyam. This, the most\nextensive commentary on the\nMīmāṃsā-sūtra, suggests that the\nwords of the sūtra (tat = ‘that’\nand sat = ‘existing’) be switched around for a\ndifferent reading for the first part of the sūtra, which\nwould then state that, “a cognition that results from connection\nof the sense faculties of a person with that (tat) [same\nobject that appears in the cognition] is true (sat)\nperception”. This switch rules out perceptual error and\ninference; both these present objects other than those that are the\ncause of the perception. \nIn the oldest Sāṃkhya tradition, perception is the\nfunctioning of a sense organ. This is clearly inadequate, as the\nancient skeptic Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (c. 8th century\nCE) is quick to point out. Perception in this sense cannot be a means\nof knowledge (pramāṇa) as it does not distinguish\nbetween proper and improper functioning of sense organs and,\ntherefore, between valid and erroneous perceptions. A more\nsophisticated definition is later devised wherein perception is\n“an ascertainment [of buddhi or intellect] in regard to\na sense faculty (Sāṃkhyakārikā 5 in\nYuktīdipikā)”. This implies that perception\nis a modification of the intellect in the form of selective\nascertainment of an object, brought about by the activity or\nfunctioning of a sense faculty. In some respects, this\ncharacterization of perception as an “ascertainment” of\nthe intellect neatly captures the idea that perception, being an\ninstrument of knowledge, is the primary means of knowledge.\nAscertainment residing in the intellect is regarded as the instrument\nof perception, while residing in the self it is regarded as the result\nof the process of perception. Furthermore, the\nSāṃkhyakārikā states that the function\nof the senses with regard to the objects is “a mere\nseeing” (Sāṃkhyakārikā, 28b), and\nthe function of the intellect, referred to as ascertainment, can be\nthought of as “identification” of the object as in\n“this is a cow”, etc.\n(Sāṃkhyakārikā 5ab). This suggests a\ntwo-stage process: first the functioning of the sense faculty results\nin “mere seeing” of the object (non-conceptualized\nawareness) and, later this mere seeing is acted upon by the intellect\nor mind and results in a conceptual identification of the object. This\ntwo-stage process is very similar to the detailed account of\nconceptual (savikalpaka) perception offered by the\nMīmāṃsakas and the Naiyāyikas. \nAccording to Advaita Vedānta the defining characteristic of\nperception is the directness of knowledge acquired through perception\n(Bilimoria, 1980:35). In highlighting the directness of the perceptual\nprocess, the Advaitin differs from Nyāya and\nMīmāṃsā proponents for whom the contact of the\nsense faculty with its object is central to the perceptual process.\nVedānta Paribhāṣā (ed. 1972: 30) cites pleasure\nand pain as instances of perception that are directly intuited without\nany sense object contact. For the Advaitin perception is simply the\nimmediacy of consciousness; knowledge not mediated by any instrument\n(Gupta et. al., 1991, p. 40). It is worth noting that this definition\nis very close to that accepted by Navya-Naiyāyikas. Like the\nlatter, the Advaitins regard the role of the sensory connection as\naccidental, rather than essential, to the perceptual process. The\nNeo-Advaitins accept the distinction between conceptual or determinate\nperception (they refer to it as viṣayagata\npratyakṣa) and non-conceptual or indeterminate perception\n(nirvikaplapka pratyakṣa), but do not think of\nnon-conceptual perception as simply a prior stage of conceptualized\nperception, as other Hindu schools do.\n \n  \nThe Sanskrit term kalpanā is variously translated as\nimagination or conceptual construction and is meant to be the source\nof ‘vikalpa’, roughly translated as concepts, but\nwhich may stand for anything that the mind adds to the\n‘given’. The time-honored differentiation of perception\ninto conception-free perception (nir-vikalpa pratyakṣa)\nand conception-loaded perception (sa-vikalpa\npratyakṣa) is made on the basis of concepts\n(vikalpa) (Matilal, 1986: 313). \nThe distinction between non-conceptual and conceptual was first drawn\nby Diṅnāga who contended that all perception is\nnon-conceptual because what constitutes seeing things as they really\nare must be free from any conceptual construction. The claim\nis that a verbal report of proper perception is strictly impossible,\nfor such a report requires conceptualization, which is not perceptual\nin character; the objects of conceptual awareness are spontaneous\nconstructions of our mind and are essentially linguistic in character.\nOn the other hand, what is seen, ‘the given’, does not\ncarry a word or a name as its label and neither is such a label\ngrasped along with the object, nor inherent in it, nor even produced\nby it; objects-as-such, the real particulars\n(svalakṣaṇas), do not, as Quine would say, wear\ntheir names on their sleeves. Furthermore, the sense faculty cannot\ngrasp a concept or a name; if I have never smelt garlic before I first\nencounter it, I cannot smell it as garlic, though I can smell\nIT; an olfactory awareness can only grasp a smell present in\nthe olfactory field. The Buddhists argue that a perceiver apprehends\nonly the real particulars, arbitrarily imposes concepts/words\non them and believes, mistakenly, that these are really there\nin the objects and integral to them. The conceptual awareness conceals\nits own imaginative quality and, because it results directly from\nexperience, the perceiver takes it to be a perceptual experience. The\nperceiver fails to notice that imagination is involved and mistakenly\nthinks that he really perceives the constructed world. From the\nBuddhists standpoint, therefore, a perceiver can only perceive real\nparticulars so that any perceptual experience is always and only at\nthe non-conceptual level. \nThe Nyāya view evolves in response to Buddhist account of\nperception. They regard perception as a cognitive episode triggered by\ncausal interaction between a sense faculty and an object. This\ninteraction first results in a sensory impression, nothing more than\nmere physiological change. This preliminary awareness, non-conceptual\nperception, is a necessary first step in the process of perception and\nis invariably followed by a structured awareness leading to conceptual\nperception. A cognition that is independent of preliminary sensory\nawareness cannot result in a perceptual judgment. The first awareness\ndoes not destroy the perceptual character of the second; rather, it\nfacilitates this subsequent awareness. Non-conceptual perception is an\nindispensable causal factor for generation of conceptual perception,\nalthough memory, concepts and collateral information may also be\nrequired. It is important to note that the Nyāya notion of\nvikalpa (in their distinction of nir-vikalpa and\nsa-vikalpa) is different from that of the Buddhists. Unlike\nthe latter, the Naiyāyikas do not think of vikalpa-s as\nmental creations or imaginative constructions but as objectively real\nproperties and features of objects. Vikalpa in this sense\nindicates the operation of judging and synthesizing rather than\nimagining or constructing. Thus conceptual perceptions truly\nrepresent the structure of reality. Of the five types of concepts\n(vikalpa-s) recognized by the Buddhists, viz.\nnāma (word), jāti (universal),\nguṇa (quality), kriyā (action) and\ndravya (substance), the Naiyāyikas, regard all but the\nfirst vikalpa as categories of reality (Mondal, 1982, p.\n364). Unlike the Grammarians, the Nyāya schools do not accept the\nobjective reality of words; words are not inherent to the object\npresented in perception. Rather, the Naiyāyikas hold that the\nrelation between word and object is created by convention in a\nlinguistic community. Although a concept is associated with a word\n(nāma-vikalpa) by means of a convention, it is not\nmerely a fabrication. For example, when someone brings garlic clove\nnear my nose and teaches me by pointing to it that it is called\ngarlic, then subsequently confronted with the garlicky odor and a\nsimilar clove, I can see it and smell it as garlic. Thus\nperceptual awareness includes knowledge of words but, insofar as it is\nperceptual awareness, it is brought about by sensory contact with the\nobject and, its properties which exists independently of words. \nThe Buddhists reject this argument on the basis that the conventional\nmeaning of a word relates the word with the concept or the universal.\nUniversals or concepts cannot be objects of our perception; they\ncannot be sensed. Universals, attributes and concepts are theoretical\nconstructs for the Buddhists; what is sensed is the actual object, the\nexclusive particular, the ultimate existent. The Buddhists offer two\narguments in favor of the claim that only particulars are real. First,\nknowledge by means of words or verbal testimony is very different from\nperceptual knowledge, for what we are aware of when we hear the words\n“garlic is pungent” is very different from what we are\nphenomenologically aware of when we smell garlic; words do not denote\nor stand-in for actual objects and can be uttered in the absence of\nany objects, but perception cannot arise in the absence of objects.\nSecond, the particulars are real or existent because they have causal\nefficacy (arthakriyāsāmarthya). Only particular\nreal garlic can flavor one’s food or ruin it, but the universal\ngarlichood cannot do any of these; in this sense, only the particulars\nare real for they fulfill the purposes (artha) of humans. \nThe foregoing discussion shows that the epistemological debate between\nthe Buddhists and the Naiyāyikas regarding the nature of\nperception rests on, and brings to the fore, their metaphysical\ndisagreement about the nature of universals. The Naiyāyikas are\nrealists about universals; universals are objective features of the\nworld that impress themselves upon minds; they are not mere figments\nof our imagination. The Naiyāyikas hold that particulars are\nqualified propertied wholes and we directly perceive them as they\nare, without any kind of manipulation or imposition; we do not\nimpose universals on property-less real particulars, rather we find\nstable, durable, relational wholes in reality that do not require any\nimposition or manipulation. They argue that there is no evidence of a\nworld of bare particulars, as claimed by the Buddhists. Therefore\nconceptual or determinate perception does not involve distortion of\nreality; rather it presents things as they really are. To see a piece\nof sandalwood as it really is, we do not need to see the\nsandalwood as a colorless, odorless pure particular; indeed, since the\npiece of sandalwood is really brown and really\nfragrant, to see it as a propertied whole is to see it as it\nreally is. \nThe idea that the world consists of propertied particulars seems to\nput pressure on the notion of non-conceptual perception. If there are\nno indeterminate particulars, what is the object of indeterminate\nperception? Indeed some Navya-Nyāya thinkers hold that the raw\ndata of perception (‘real particulars’ in the Buddhists\nsense) is too inchoate and elusive to count as objects of knowledge.\nRecently, Arindam Chakrabarti (2000), a prominent contemporary\nNavya-Nyāya thinker offered seven reasons for altogether\neliminating non-conceptual, or immaculate perceptions as he calls\nthem, from Nyāya epistemology in an attempt to understand the\n“deeper relation between direct realism and concept-enriched\nperception”. Chakrabarti’s skepticism about non-conceptual\nperception as a cognitive state stems from the fact that we cannot\nassign an intentional role to the object of indeterminate perception\nbecause the object of non-conceptual perception is incapable of being\napperceived or directly intuited in any fashion. Chakrabarti’s\ngauntlet has been picked by several Nyāya enthusiasts (Phillips,\n2001 and 2004; Chadha, 2001, 2004 and 2006) and defenders of Buddhist\ndoctrine (Siderits, 2004). This debate brings to the fore an important\nfeature of non-conceptual perception first highlighted by\nGaṅgeśa, suggesting that while there is no direct,\napperceptive evidence for non-conceptual perception, it is posited as\nthe best explanation for the availability of the qualifier (property,\nfeature), since the cognizing subject is not immediately aware of the\nobject of non-conceptual perception. Phillips (2001: 105) presents\nGaṅgeśa’s argument for the inclusion of\nnon-conceptual perception as an essential part of Nyāya\nepistemology: \nThe Navya-Nyāya notion of non-conceptual perception differs from\nthat of the Buddhists in many respects, two of which are very\nimportant. First, according to Navya-Naiyāyikas, there is no\napperceptive evidence for non-conceptual perception, unlike the\nBuddhists who contend that conception-free awareness is necessarily\nself-aware. The Navya-Naiyāyikas, as is obvious from the quote\nabove, emphasize that the evidence for a non-conceptual sensory grasp\nof universals comes in the form of an inference. Second, according to\nNavya-Nyāya, the object of non-conceptual perception is a\nqualifier (concept), although not given as that in the first instance,\nbut not a bare particular as the Buddhists hypothesize. It is, as the\nabove quote explains, posited by the force of an inference; the\n‘bare object’ of non-conceptual perception\nbecomes the qualifier in a resultant determinate perception.\nWhile this does not satisfactorily address Chakrabarti’s concern\nthat lack of apperceptive evidence implies that the subject cannot\nassign an intentional role to the object of non-conceptual perception,\nChadha (2006) argues that the subject’s not being in a position\nto assign an intentional role to the object of non-conceptual\nperception is no hindrance to the intentionality of non-conceptual\nperception itself. Non-conceptual perception is awareness of\na “non-particular individual” (Chakrabarti, 1995) and can\nbe assigned the intentional role of a qualifier in virtue of the\nrecognitional abilities acquired by the subject on the basis of the\nperceptual episode. The subject sees a non-particular\nindividual but, since there is no apperceptive or conscious awareness,\nthe subject does not see it as an instance of a universal or\na qualifier. Chadha explicates Gaṅgeśa’s insight that\na qualifier is given as a non-particular individual, neither divorced\nfrom nor joined to the qualificandum and, therefore it is\nwrong to suggest that lack of apperceptive evidence implies that\nnon-conceptual perception is not an intentional perceptual state. \nMore recently, Chaturvedi (2020) analyses counter-arguments against\nGaṅgeśa’s defense of non-conceptual perception\noffered by the sixteenth century Dvāita Vedanta scholar\nVyāsatīrtha. Chaturvedi argues that\nVyāsatīrtha’s objection undermine\nGaṅgeśa’s main inferential proof of non-conceptual\nperception to show that it has a necessary role to play in generating\nconcept-laden determinate perception. In addition,\nVyāsatīrtha’s questions the internal consistency of\nGaṅgeśa’s that the contents of indeterminate\nperception is not available for introspection. Despite all the\nproblems pointed out by the Vedantin, Chaturvedi argues that there is\nstill hope to reconstruct Gaṅgeśa’s account of\nindeterminate perception with some help from recent empirical science\ncan help to restore the overall plausibility of the view. \nKumārila argued against the Buddhist position to show that\nperception is not always devoid of concepts. In\nPratyakṣapariccheda, he principally targets\nDiṅnāga’s theory, while simultaneously addressing\nsome of Dharmakīrti’s ideas and arguments. Kumārila,\nlike Naiyāyikas, holds both the two kinds of perception as valid.\nFor him the initial non-conceptualized perception is borne of the\nundifferentiated pure object (śuddhavastu) and is\ncomparable to the perception of an infant and others who lack a\nlanguage. The ‘pure object’ is the substratum for the\ngeneric and specific features of the object, but the subject is not\ndistinctly aware of any of these and simply cognizes the object as an\nindeterminate particular, as “this” or\n“something”. Although Kumārila agrees with the\nBuddhists that the object of immediate perception is inexpressible in\nlanguage, he maintains that it is different, in at least one respect,\nfrom the real particular (svalakṣaṇa) of the\nBuddhists; the latter being a structure-less unitary whole, whereas\nthe former is non-unitary and grasps both the particular and the\nuniversal aspects of the object. Otherwise, Kumārila argues, it\ncould not give rise to conceptual awareness, which explicitly\nidentifies such features. Diṅnāga’s counterpoint to\nthis is that conceptual awareness at second stage cannot be a\nperception, since it involves application of concepts and words which,\nin turn, requires memory. If we admit conceptual awareness as\nperception, we are forced to accept that a sense faculty is capable of\nremembering (since perception is a cognition brought about by the\nfunctioning of the sense faculty) but that cannot be the case because\na sense faculty, being a mere instrument of cognition, is in itself\nunconscious and cannot remember anything. Kumārila admits that\nconceptual awareness is aided by memory and concepts, but argues that\nthat does not rob it of its perceptual character for the sense faculty\nis still functioning while in contact with the very same object. He\nfurther suggests that we should not expect a perceptual cognition to\narise as soon as there is contact between a sense faculty and its\nobject. He uses the analogy of entering a dimly lit room after walking\nin the blazing sun; even though the contents of the room are directly\navailable to the sense faculties of the subject who has just walked\nin, he does not immediately apprehend the objects in front of him.\nHowever, the subject may become distinctly aware of the objects in the\nroom and their features in the following moments. The perceptual\ncharacter of the latter awareness is maintained so long as the\nconnection between the sense faculty and the object is intact, even\nwhen other conceptual awarenesses or memories intervene between the\ninitial contact with the object and the subsequent awareness. A\nconceptual awareness can be referred to as a perception even though\nthe mind, qua memory, is involved because the functioning of\nthe sense faculty is the factor responsible for arising of the\nawareness. Furthermore, he insists that the mind must be involved in\nall perceptions since it functions as a link between the sense faculty\nand the self; the sense faculty is turned on or activated by a\nconnection with the self and, the self as the subject of knowledge is\ninvolved in all cognitions. He points out that even Buddhists do not\ndeny this, since they hold that self-reflexive awareness accompanies\nevery cognition. He contends that the Buddhists are wrong to insist\nthat only a cognition arising directly from the functioning of a sense\nfaculty is perception; they agree that we perceive inner states, e.g.,\npleasure and pain, and if the mind is accepted as the operative sense\nfaculty in the self-reflexive awareness of such cognitions, it follows\nthat they should admit that the mind is also the sense faculty that\ngives rise to conceptualized cognitions. He, however, clarifies that\nnot every cognition that follows a contact between a sense faculty and\nan object is a perception, for if one were to open one’s eyes\nmomentarily (in the above analogy) and construct a judgment such as\n“that was table” with eyes closed again, it would not be a\nperceptual cognition since it solely depends on the memory of a\nfleeting sensory contact. \nLater, Dharmakīrti, using a methodology very different (and akin\nto proof by contradiction) from his predecessor Diṅnāga,\nraises new problems for the Nyāya-Mīmāṃsā\nview. Assuming, he says, for the sake of the argument, that universals\nare real. Then the judgments “This is a cow,” “It is\nan animal,” relate two distinct entities, namely a particular\n(or object) and a universal (or concept) arguably via a non-relational\ntie as in being substratum and superstratum, with the proviso that the\nsubstratum object has the power to let the universal reside in it.\nThis leads to all the universals (such as cowness, animalhood, etc)\nthen being tied to the object by this simple and single power. In such\na scenario, any perceptual judgment involving the universal cowhood as\nin the case of “This is a cow” makes subsequent judgments\n“This is an animal,” “This is a substance,”\netc., superfluous. For, if one perceives an object along with its\npower to let any one universal reside in it, one must be able to\nperceive its power to attract all other universals that reside in it.\nThus, there would be no distinction between “This is a\ncow” and “This is a substance”; clearly an\nunacceptable thesis. Matilal (1986, 326) notes two points in\nconnection with this argument. First, Dharmakīrti assumes that an\nobject, or a unique particular, is perceived in its entirety and no\npart of it is left unperceived. Second, the realist has objectified\nall the universals including the relation-universal. If, as the\nrealist believes, the object of perception—the\nparticular—has the power to accommodate all universals in it,\nthen the onus is on him to show why only a single universal manifests\nitself in a perceptual judgment. This concern is pertinent, especially\nagainst the Nyāya philosophers who admit only one single\nrelation-universal: inherence, which supposedly unites all nesting\nuniversals with the object. The Naiyāyikas readily respond to\nthis argument by pointing out that the redundancy objection rests on\nDharmakirti’s assumption that an object is grasped in its\nentirety in perception. This assumption is false; perception is\nperspectival, we never see all sides of an ordinary three-dimensional\nobject, but we still see it. \nFurthermore, Dharmakīrti’s argues that conceptual or\njudgmental awareness is phenomenologically distinct from\nnon-conceptual awareness. In the latter we are confronted with the\nobject of perception which is vivid and immediate, while in the former\nno object is present. In the judgment “this is a cow”,\neven the ‘subject’ of the judgment does not refer to the\nobject of perception, since words do not refer to perceived\nparticulars but to universals which extend across space and time.\nDharmakīrti admits that the words we apply to things have some\nobjective basis in those things; we call something a cow because it\nhas a certain effect, it gives milk, is gentle, or it calls forth a\ncertain cognition, etc. This effect, in turn, inclines us to associate\nthe word ‘cow’ with other things that have the same effect\nand we do that by jointly dissociating them from things that lack that\neffect. Universals, according to the Buddhists are arbitrarily\nconstructed “exclusions” (apoha); words serve the\npurpose of separating things off from other objects. For example, the\nword ‘cow’ singles out a class of things by excluding them\nfrom things they are not, all things assembled together under the\nconcept ‘cow’ are distinct from each other and do not\nshare a single nature that the word ‘cow’ names. A\nconceptual awareness insofar as it imputes a word to a particular\nobject and, therefore a universal nature it shares with all others of\nthe same universal-kind, essentially falsifies the object.\nKumārila objects to the Buddhists theory of universals\n(apoha) on the grounds that it is counterintuitive and\ncircular. The theory of universals (apoha) contradicts our\nintuition that meaning of a positive word is positive; there is\nnothing negative about the word ‘cow’. A negative entity\ncan be the meaning of a word only where something is negated.\nMoreover, if we accept that understanding x requires\neliminating non-x, then in turn we presuppose knowledge of\nnon-x, which entails an understanding of non-non-x,\nand so on (Drefyus, 1997, 215). The Mīmāṃsakas also\ntake on board the concerns raised by the Naiyāyika philosopher\nUddyotakara (c. 7th century CE), who questions the theory of\nexclusions on the specific grounds that it fails to offer an adequate\ntheory of reference and relation between concepts and reality. He\nargues if the word ‘cow’ primarily designates a negative\nentity, either this entity is a cow in disguise or is different from a\ncow. If it is a cow in disguise then the Buddhist view of universals\nis no different from the Nyāya common sense realism that words\nare used to single out phenomena in the world. If the negative entity\nis different from a cow, then the word ‘cow’ does not\nrefer to real cows, making it difficult to explain how any word can\nrefer to real objects or classes thereof. This last point begs the\nquestion because the Buddhist denies that words refer to the objects\nin the real world. For him words refer to universals, and that is\nprecisely what the world does not contain. The onus is put\nback on the realists to show that universals, which serve as meanings\nof words, are real properties of objects rather than imagined or\nmentally constructed features. This challenge is taken up by the\nNaiyāyikas and their position against the nominalist stand of\nboth the Buddhists and the Grammarians is presented later below. \nBhartṛhari, the most notable Grammarian, highlights the intimate\nrelation between language, thought, and knowledge. Two aspects of his\ntheory have important implications for the nature of perceptual\nexperience. First, there is no non-linguistic cognition in the world;\nall knowledge appears permeated by words. Though\nBhartṛhari’s theory may leave room for extraordinary, or\nother-worldly, cognitions, there is no scope for pure\nnon-conceptualized perception in this world. The essence of his theory\nis: words do not designate objects in the external world directly, but\nthrough the intervention of universals, which are inherent in words.\nThus universals constitute the basis of our knowledge of the external\nworld, since they are intimately connected with language and mind on\nthe one hand, and the world on the other. Given this, the Grammarians\nquestion the very possibility of non-conceptual perception? The second\naspect is underscored by Kumārila who ascribes the so-called\nSuperimposition Theory to Bhartṛhari (Taber, 2005, 27),\naccording to which, a word has its “own form” superimposed\nupon its meaning. This has implications for determinate conceptual\nperception, which (for the pluralists and direct realists of\nMīmāṃsā and Nyāya persuasions) arises purely\nout of the object itself and involves discrimination and determination\nof its nature. \nBhartṛhari’s argument can be thought of as an attack, on\nthe adjective ‘non-verbal’ (avyapadeśyam) in\nthe Nyāya definition of perception, aimed at their belief that\nfor cognitive comprehension language is an inessential detail. For\nhim, bare sense-impressions cannot count as awarenesses because they\nare nor effective enough, nothing is accomplished by them and, they do\nnot result in appreciable mental activity. Bhartṛhari gives an\nexample: a man walking along a village path to approach his house\nwould invariably touch some grass on the road, and in some sense this\nwould be tactile awareness at a pre-linguistic level\n(Vākyapadīya, Ch.1, verse 123). But this would not\ncount as an awareness unless combined with the further ability to sort\nit out or verbalize it; consciousness cannot reveal an object to us\nunless we discriminate it, and the process of discrimination requires\nverbalization. What about a baby’s awareness, or that of a mute\nperson, asks Vātsyāyana? Bhartṛhari points out that a\nbaby’s sensations or a mute person’s awarenesses may still\ncount as cognitive because they are linguistically potent. A\npre-linguistic state of an infant can be cognitive if and only if it\nhas speech potency, which is the cause of verbal language. So also, in\nthe non-conceptual perceptual awareness (in adults and even some\nanimals) speech-potency is latent; it is an essential trait of human\nconsciousness and the defining characteristic of cognitive awareness\n(Vākyapadīya, Ch.1, verse 126). All knowledge of\nwhat is to be done in this world depends on speech-potential; even an\ninfant has such knowledge due to residual traces from previous births\n(Vākyapadīya, Ch.1, verse 121). The initial sensory\nawareness of external objects which does not grasp any special\nfeatures of them, nonetheless illuminates them in a non-specific\nmanner as mere things by such expressions as ‘this’ or\n‘that’ (Bhartṛhari; 123 and 124). Thus, insofar as\nthe initial sensation is an awareness, it can be verbalized. The\nfollowing analogy is offered as an argument for positing the presence\nof speech-seed (verbal disposition, as some modern philosophers call\nit) in pre-linguistic awareness: think about the experience of trying,\nbut failing, to remember a verse heard before. Bhartṛhari claims\nthat the entire verse exists in the cognitive faculty as\nspeech-potency but because of lack of other contributory factors there\nis no verbalization. Similarly, a non-linguistic experience of a\nmute-person is an awareness because of the presence of verbal\ndisposition or speech-seed even though there is no actualization of\nspeech. There are no non-conceptual perceptions, because ordinary\nobjects are not given to us without a concept (vikalpa) or\nsome mode of presentation; verbalization makes the concept explicit.\nThere are infinite concepts associated with an object, none integral\nto it. However, we always perceive an object in a concept as\nan instantiation of a universal; it is a cow, white, bovine,\nfour-legged, etc. The point to note is that concepts or universals\n(vikalpa-s) are word-generated and superimposed on the\nobjects; there are no ‘thing-universals’ or real\nuniversals over and above these. Bhartṛhari’s defends\nlinguistic nominalism, according to which, words are the only\nuniversals that exist; thing-universals are word-generated illusions.\nAs Matilal remarks, for Bhartṛhari there is not much of a\ndistinction between words and concepts, they are two sides of the same\ncoin (Matilal, 1986, 396). \nNaiyāyikas and Mīmāṃsakas, the common sense\nrealists, raise specific objections to the Grammarian view on the\ngrounds that it is not borne by experience. We have separate\nawarenesses of words and universals. While we may not perceive\nsomething as a cow prior to acquiring the word ‘cow,’ we\nare surely aware of cowness before we acquire the linguistic\nexpression, just as we are aware of and can discriminate shades of red\neven before we acquire the names of some of those shades. A\nnon-conceptual awareness of the object is implied by the subsequent\noccurrence of a conceptual awareness with determinate content.\nKumārila also points to other phenomena which indicate that the\nawareness of the meaning of a word (the object) is independent and\ndistinct from the word itself. Furthermore, awareness of the meaning\nand that of the word are usually different kinds of representations;\nthere is no possibility of confusing or conflating these.\nKumārila brings to attention linguistic phenomena that reinforce\nthe point that words and meanings must be distinct representations,\ne.g., homonymy, synonymy, categorizing and recognizing grammatical\nparts of speech, etc. The ability to distinguish and discriminate\ntypes is perhaps enhanced by knowledge of language and concepts, but\nis not completely dependent on it. Those who are not trained in music\ncan certainly hear the difference between distinct notes, even though\nthey are unable to identify them by name. Vātsyāyana also\nappeals to the ordinary experience of people who are conversant with\nwords. Ordinarily, words are apprehended as names of objects. The\nknowledge of the word-object association comes after the perceptual\nknowledge derived through sense-object contact. Such contact results\nin a perceptual awareness which, in turn, provides the occasion for\nrecalling the appropriate word, if indeed the appropriate word exists\nin the experiencer’s linguistic repertoire. Perceptual knowledge\nis antecedent to verbal knowledge and cannot owe its existence to\nwords. Vācaspati Miśra specifically objects to\nBhartṛhari’s claim that infants and adults who lack a\nlanguage perceive objects by memory impressions of their names from\nprevious births. Objects are vividly and clearly given to us in\nperception, but the memory-impressions of previous births are at best\nvague and indistinct. Vācaspati Miśra asks, “How can\nsuch a vague and unclear thing be identified with a clear and distinct\nperception?”\n(Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā,\n127). His other argument against Bhartṛhari is the obvious point\nthat words do not necessarily refer to their objects, for example\nwords in quotation marks do not refer to objects, only to themselves.\nMoreover, if the word and its denotation were identical, a blind man\nwould grasp red or redness when he grasps the word ‘red’\nand a deaf person would grasp the word ‘red’ when he\ngrasps a red thing\n(Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā,\n129). \nThe Naiyāyikas also have a general response to\nnominalists—Buddhists as well as Grammarians. They posit monadic\nuniversals that correspond to natural and metaphysical kinds and one\ndyadic universal, viz. inherence. The main nominalist objection is\nthat once we accept real universals in our ontology we risk\noverpopulating the world with entities corresponding to every\nexpression that designates a property. For example, if we accept\nhorsehood and cowhood as universals, we also need to accept\nuniversalhood as another universal. The Naiyāyikas propose that\nnot every expression which designates a property generates an\nobjective universal (jāti); some property-expressions\ncorrespond to subjectively constructed categories\n(upādhi), which though useful for analysis, are not\nontologically real. Uddyotakara argues that to correspond to a real\nuniversal a general term must meet two conditions: (i) a general term\nshould be based on a ground, which accounts for the common awareness\nof a number of different objects, that makes the application of the\nterm possible, and (ii) that ground should be a simple (non-compound),\nunitary property or entity that cannot be analyzed or explained away\notherwise (Commentary on Nyāya-sūtra, 2.2.65).\nUniversalhood is a bogus universal; it violates the second\ncondition. There is no simple basis or ground for universalhood as\nopposed to universals such as cowhood and horsehood; the ground of\nbeing one-in-many can be analyzed in terms of inherence. The same\napplies to universals like ‘barefooted’,\n‘cook’, ‘reader’ etc.; the basis for their\napplication is presence of compound features such as bare feet, etc.\nHowever, this stratagem forces the Naiyāyikas to admit that many\ngeneral terms designate bogus universals and, consequently, they start\nsuccumbing to the nominalist pressure. Matilal (1986, 420–421)\nnotes that there is another way in which it happens to\nNavya-Nyāya: A real universal must partake of the nature\nof ‘one-in-many’. The Navya-Naiyāyika, Udayana (c.\n10th century CE), lists a third necessary condition for disqualifying\na property from being regarded as a real universal. Under this\ncondition, an abstract property that belongs only to one individual is\nalso a bogus universal even though it is simple and unanalyzable;\nskyness in the sky is bogus because it is only a nominal attribute.\nHowever, since both cowhood and skyness are simple properties, they\nare grasped as such in perception without further\nqualification. In this sense, Naiyāyikas maintain that some real\nuniversals are directly perceptible. When we see a cow, we do not\nnecessarily see ‘it’ as a ‘cow’, the cow and\nthe cowness are not given as separate entities in our awareness,\nrather they appear fused. This leads to the peculiar Nyāya view\nthat real universals and basic properties are grasped in our awareness\nas ‘epistemic firsts’ or ultimates (Matilal, 1986, 421).\nGaṅgeśa calls such perception, in which universals are\ngrasped as such, non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka)\nperception. \nThe Advaita Vedānta theory compromises on the realism of earlier\nclassical Hindu philosophy. Their early view on perception is akin to\nthe Buddhists, although arrived at from a different perspective.\nMaṇḍana Miśra says: \nHe draws a distinction between perceptual cognition and constructive\ncognition, but is careful to use vikalpa-buddhi, rather than\nsavikalpaka pratyakṣa, for the latter cognition. For\nhim perception is always non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka)\nperception and it is of a universal, indeed of the highest universal,\nBeing (sat). According to early Vedāntins, the real is\nbereft of all character since its nature is non-differentiated\nconsciousness or Brahman. Therefore, perceptual cognition, which\npresents the real, must be non-conceptual or indeterminate for it is\nthe knowledge of the existence of a thing without any qualifications\nor predications. Maṇḍana Miśra also denies the thesis\nthat non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception is non-verbal.\nThis surprising claim is clearly owed to Bhartṛhari’s\ninfluence, as is evidenced by the example used by Maṇḍana\nMiśra in the argument. Confronted by an opponent with the claim\nthat verbal knowledge involves duality and relation, and therefore\nmust involve concepts, Maṇḍana Miśra replies that\nverbal knowledge is not necessarily relational: a baby’s\nnon-verbal knowledge of its mother’s breast, grasps it merely as\n‘this’ (of course we do not assume that the baby\narticulates the word ‘this’; the word, as in\nBhartṛhari’s account, has a more subtle form in the\nbaby’s mind) and, therefore, the highest knowledge of the\nUltimate reality (Brahman) in which there is no duality, no\nrelations, no concepts, may still be verbal. \nNeo Advaita-Vedāntins, however, accept a distinction between\nnon-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception and conceptual\n(nirvikalpaka) perceptions from empirical or practical\n(vyāvahārika) standpoint; from ultimate\n(paramārthika) standpoint such distinction is untenable.\nA brief description of conceptual (viṣayagata,\nAdvaita-Vedānta term for savikalpaka) perception will\nhelp put in perspective Applebaum’s (1982) reconstruction of\ntheir notion of non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception\nlater. Determinate perception is the result of the activity of mind\n(manas) or antaḥkaraṇa (literally\ntranslated as ‘inner vehicle’)—the terms are\nfrequently used interchangeably. Advaitins maintain that the mind\n(antaḥkaraṇa) ‘goes out’ through the\nrespective sense organ (the eye, say) and pervades the object of\nattention. As a result of this contact, the object presents itself as\ndata to the receptive mind (antaḥkaraṇa) which,\nin turn, transforms into mental state (vṛtti)\n(Bilimoria, 1980, 38). As soon as the data are presented to inner\nfaculty, there is an identification of consciousness associated with\nthe mental state (antaḥkaraṇa-vṛtti) with\nthe consciousness associated with the object. To say that vṛtti\nand data are identified is to say that the form of the mental state,\nif all goes well, corresponds one-to-one with the form of the object;\nthe mental state is a reflection of the object of perception, and as\nsuch is non-different from the object. Thus results a determinate\njudgment (vṛttijñāna) of the form\n“this is a jar”. Furthermore, according to them, we do not\nperceive our mental states; we directly perceive the objects\nthemselves. Bilimora explains, \nThe initial mental state subsides and the subject becomes directly\naware of the object itself; the cognition is self-evident to the\nsubject, just like the cognition of pleasure and pain. In this\nreflective stage, the mind (antaḥkaraṇa)\nintegrates the mental contents corresponding to the object with\nfamiliar or recognized percepts. Determinate perception of the\ntotality of the object occurs with the completion of the assimilative\nprocess. \nDavid Applebaum (1982) notes that Bilimoria’s discussion of the\nAdvaitin’s notion of perception focuses on the necessary\nconditions or criteria for valid or veridical perceptions. According\nto him, this approach while justified in the light of\nperception’s inclusion among the means of knowledge\n(pramāṇa-s) is mistaken because it only focuses on\nsensation as a species of mental state (vṛtti). For the\nAdvaitin, sensation is not a mode exhausted by the judgmental content\nof a mental state (vṛtti), it has epistemic value\nindependently of its role in judgmental perception. Applebaum quotes\nfrom the Upanisadic texts to support this view: \nNon-conceptual perception furnishes us with knowledge of pure\nexistence (sanmātra) rather than with protodata to\nconstruct imagined particulars. Therefore, it is not simply a prior\nstage of conceptual perception and so also not necessarily a mental\nstate produced in cooperation with the object. Applebaum (1982, 204)\nsuggests that non-conceptual perception in this sense focuses\nattention on sensing, in which consciousness turns its attention\ninwards to the activity of the sense-organs resulting in deepening and\nbroadening their proprioceptive content. Proprioception, he claims,\npoints the way to the soul or self (ātman); mind\n(antaḥkaraṇa) returns to its presentational\nactivity, its function of monitoring and unfolding the sensory\nmanifold to create conditions for the emergence of self\n(ātman), which according to the Advaitin, is identical\nwith the Ultimate reality (Brahman). In non-conceptual\n(nirvikalpaka) perception, consciousness is returned to\nitself and opens up the possibility of manifesting or seeing the\nSeer (ātman) or knowing the Ultimate reality\n(Brahman). \nThe problem of universals, as we have seen, is at the epicentre of the\ndebate between Hindu philosophers and their Buddhist opponents. The\ndoctrine of exclusion (apoha) is the Buddhist attempt to\naccount for the relation between concepts and sensory content. The\ndoctrine of apoha basically claims that the term ‘cow’\ndoes not refer to the universal ‘cowness’ or\n‘cowhood’ because there is no such general entity; rather,\nthe term refers to every individual that is not a non-cow. The\napoha theory of meaning is originally propounded by\nDignāga and his followers is an attempt to explain the\nfunctioning of language, conceptual thought and inference without\nappeal to real universals. For these Buddhists, universals are merely\nimaginary constructs which lack causal efficacy and the awarenesses\nthat they produce are faint (asphuṭābha). The\nunique particulars alone are ultimately real, but they do not have any\ncommon properties, and thus cannot be brought under any concept, nor\ncan they be expressed by words. They are inexpressible. Dignāga\nexplains that language functions through what is known as\n“exclusion of the other”\n(anyāpoha/apoha). This claim needs to be\nunpacked. Matilal explains, \nThe idea is that the meaning of the word ‘cow’ is a\nnegation: not non-cow. If you exclude all the things that are not\ncows, you have the reference of the word ‘cow’. The\nHindus, in particular the Nyāya philosopher Uddyotakara and the\nMīmāṃsā philosopher Kumārila raise many\nepistemological and metaphysical objections to Dignāga’s\napohavada. The basic problem metaphysical problem is how to\nunderstand apoha as a non-existence. Both the Hindu schools\nregard non-existence as a real property of a thing (absence of a pot\nin a room) and therefore are not convinced that by introducing\napohas the Buddhist will be able to ultimately avoid reference\nto universals. The epistemological issues concern how it is possible\nto know apohas as they cannot be known by perception and any\nappeal to inference would be circular. These philosophers also raise\nlinguistic concerns that are important because the apoha doctrine does\ndouble duty as a Buddhist theory of meaning. First, since apoha\nis basically an absence, the meanings of all words would be\nsynonymous. Second, how is it possible to learn which apoha a\nword refers to? \nMore recently, two new annotated translations of primary texts, the\nfirst by Eltschinger et al. (2018) and the second by Taber and Kataoka\n(forthcoming) have become available. These translations\noffernew insights into the debates between the Hindus and Buddhists.\nIn the text Kumārila takes up the linguistic concerns raised\nabove. He notes that if the relation between a word and a meaning is\nestablished by not observing that the word is applied to certain\nthings, and one never observes what the word is applied to, then the\nword simply would have no meaning at all (Apohavāda, 75).\nKumārila developed this concern into what is known as the mutual\npresupposition argument. The objection goes: If someone is taught the\nmeaning of the word ‘cow’ by being told, “The word\n‘cow’ refers to what is not non-cow,” then one must\nknow what a non-cow is. But how can one comprehend what a non-cow is\nif one does not already know what ‘cow’ means. The meaning\nof ‘cow,’ it seems, presupposes the meaning of\n‘non-cow,’ while the meaning of ‘non-cow’\npresupposes the meaning of ‘cow’ (Apohavāda,\n83–85ab, reprinted in Taber). The apoha theory, as we can see\nin the examples, is introduced using general terms like cow, white and\nso on. The theory may seem to work in the case of general terms\nbecause there are entities that are cow and others that are not cow,\nthere are entities that are white and others that are not white and so\non. But such a dichotomy does not hold in the case of every word. Sen\n(2011) offers the example of the word ‘all’\n(sarva). There is no entity called ‘not all’\n(asarva), which may be obtained by negating the meaning of the\nword ‘all’. Nor can it be suggested that the expression\n‘not all’ is applicable to unity, duality, etc., because\nthe word ‘all’ stands for a collection, the components or\nconstituents of which may be things that are one, two, and so on in\nnumber; and once all the constituents of this collection are negated,\nthe word ‘all’ will become an empty expression (Sen, 2011,\n182). Kumārila also argues that the Apohavāda is unable to\naccount for words which designate actions, connectives like\n‘and’, ‘or’ ‘not’ and\n‘but’, verbal prefixes and prepositions, adjectives like\n‘knowable’ and ‘cognizable’ and so on (Taber\nand Kataoka forthcoming). \nThe Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti (a follower of Dignāga)\ntakes up these concerns on behalf of the Buddhist in his\nPramāṇavārttikasvavṛtti (PV(SV) heceforth).\nDharmakīrti responds to this concern but rather than addressing\nall the categories separately; he offers a general argument. He claims\nthat all meaningful discourse serves to rule things out: “an\nutterance is inseparably related to delimitation” (PV(SV)\n122–123). The point is illustrated by using examples of commands\n(PVSV61, 20–26). If one desires only water and does not care how it is\nbrought one says “Bring water”, but if one desires a pot\nof water, one would have to say, ‘Bring water in a pot’.\nSimilarly, one mentions ‘water’ to rule out other\nsubstances, ‘bringing’ to rule out other actions. Taber\nand Kataoka (forthcoming) summarise it thus: “a word is only\nuttered when certain things are to be excluded by uttering it, not\notherwise, and presumably this would be true of all parts of\nspeech”. Dharmakīrti adds two other conditions. First,\nwords are uttered only when there is some doubt. Second, words are\nalmost always uttered in a sentence and their excluding function is\nspecified by the context and relation to other words in the context.\nDharmakīrti’s also responds to the first concern raised\nabove: aren’t all words synonymous on the Buddhist view? No,\nsays Dharmakīrti, because apohas are not real properties,\nrather they are “differences”. Apohas are contrasts\nthat distinct individuals share by differing from the same (more\nexactly, qualitatively similar) other things. They are not properties\nthat things in themselves have by virtue of belonging to a class (say\nof cows). Rather, they are absences things have in virtue of not\nhaving certain properties. So, for example, a certain individual\n–say a spotted cow—has one absence (that of being a not\nnon-cow) insofar as it is viewed, together with certain other\nindividuals as different from non-cows, and has another absence (that\nof being not non-spotted) insofar as it is viewed together with\ncertain other not non-spotted individuals which may include cows,\nhorses, humans. Different words that are applied to the same object\n– cow and spotted – have different meanings depending on\nthe corresponding differences or exclusions from other things.\nExplaining these stanzas in his PV(SV) Dharmakīrti\nsays, \nThere is an unusual view of the nature of particulars expressed in\nthis passage. Dharmakīrti, following Dignāga, holds that\nthe nature of a particular is one, unified. Sometimes he expresses\nthis misleadingly by saying that a thing is “without\nparts” or “without aspects”, when what he probably\nmeans is that the different aspects of its nature are fused into one;\nthey are inseparable, completely integrated. If one apprehends any\npart of the nature of a thing one must apprehend the thing in its\nentirety, because its nature is undivided. This is exactly what\nhappens in perception, a thing is grasped completely. It is only\ninference (and other conceptual cognitions) we ascertain apohas\nwhich are not intrinsic properties of the thing nor aspects of their\nnatures. Perception is always veridical owing to its direct link with\nreal thing, provided that all of its causes are in place. Conceptual\ncognition or inference is characteristically erroneous insofar as it\nmistakes the general features that it abstracts from and superimposes\non a particular for the thing in itself. Still, some conceptual\ncognitions are ‘correct’ in a sense. Kellner clarifies the\nsense in which they are correct is that they identify things correctly\nand can serve as a solid basis for successful action, whereas others\nare incorrect because they misidentify things and lead people astray –\nidentifying a mirage as a reflection caused by sun’s rays is in\nthis sense correct, whereas identifying it as a water body is false\n(2004, 2). In addition, Kellner clarifies that there is a kind of\nperceptual ascertainment, over and above sensory perception, which\nenables us to superimpose or ascribe features/properties of the\nobject. We may superimpose them correctly or incorrectly depending on\nthe environmental factors (lighting, distance, etc.) as well as the\ncognisor’s mind being focussed in ascertaining certain aspects\nof perceived reality (Kellner, 2004, 42). Concepts, in this Buddhist\nsense, are well-formed rules for identifying exclusions. Even though\nthe Buddhists talks about the awareness produced by concepts as faint\nimpressions, it is not meant to be taken in the sense of Hume’s\nideas which are a blurry expression of the real thing. Rather, the\npoint is that the concepts are constructed from abstracting general\nfeatures of objects and then superimposing them back on the objects.\nGeneral features or properties cannot be known in sensory perception\nas the Nyāya and the Mīmāṃsā opponets\nbelieve. Rather, as we see, general features can be correctly or\nincorrectly superimposed on the particulars in the perceptual or\ninferential ascertainments. They are correctly ascertained when they\nlead to successful action, incorrectly ascertained when they lead us\nastray. \nIn the secondary literaure discussing the apoha theory, Tillemans\n(2011) draws a useful distinction between the two versions of the\napoha doctrine offerd by Diṅnāga and Dharmakīrti: the\ntop-down approach and the bottom-up approach. The former is presented\nby Diṅnāga. According to the top-down version, the negation\noperator in the exclusion, the apoha somehow manages pick out\nreal particulars in the world while avoiding any commitment to\nuniversals. Apoha, in this sense functions like a sense or\nmeaning, a not-non X expressed by the word X, which enables us to pick\nout real particulars while at the same time avoiding a commitment to\nreal universals in virtue of the special features of double negation.\nThe latter is presented by Dharmakīrti who uses the causal\napproach to link language and the world. According to this version of\nthe doctrine, apoha provides a way to bridge the gap between\nsensory perception of particulars and expressions of belief and\njudgement in thought and language. The top-down version of the apoha\ndoctrine was subjected to various criticisms from the Hindu realists,\nespecially by Kumārila who criticised the doctrine on grounds of\ncircularity. The thought is that in order to understand the exclusion\nclass of non-cows, we have to first have an idea that some particulars\nare cows. In other words, one must be able to refer to cows before one\ncan refer to non-cows. The bottom-up approach developed by\nDharmakīrti was basically a response to this circularity worry.\nHis version of the apoha doctrine is developed as a strategy to bridge\nthe gap between non-conceptual perceptual content and conceptual\ncontent. Dreyfus (2011) develops Dharmakīrti’s naturalized\naccount of concept formation by elucidating the mediating role of\nrepresentations that link reality to conceptuality. Representations,\nin this sense, stand for agreed-upon fictional commonalties and are\nprojected on to discrete individuals (Dreyfus, 2011, 216). \nThe top-down approach is promising but there is a concern that a\nbottom-up account might not succeed in offering a completely reductive\nstory about concepts. In response to this concern, Ganeri (2011)\ndevelops a hybrid account that combines the resources of the top-down\nand bottom-up approaches. The idea is that we work up from basic\nsentience and down from the language of reference and predication to\nmeet at the middle-ground of feature-placing in the formation of\nproto-concepts (Ganeri, 2011, 244). These proto-concepts show that\nsense experience can normatively constrain belief and judgement,\nthough it does not give us a full-blown reductive account of concepts\nin non-conceptual terms. \nThe doctrine of apoha and Ganeri’s hybrid version may\nwell be ingenious, but it is a far cry from what would satisfy the\nHindu realist. According to Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika,\nuniversals exist in this very world of ours. We do not need to\nconstruct concepts from sensory content, rather universals are part\nand parcel of this sensory content. Chadha (2014, 289) explains that\naccording to Nyāya, for a universal to exist all that is required\nis that it be exemplified; in a Quinean twist – to be is to be\nexemplified. There is no further requirement that it exist\nindependently as an abstract entity or in Plato’s heaven;\nuniversals are given directly in perception insofar as their loci are\nperceived. Taber (2017) develops the Mīmāṃsa views\nabout how universals are cognised. In the first verse of his\nĀkṛtivāda, the Kumarila explains what is at stake for\nthe Mīmāṃsakas in the debate about universals. Unlike\nthe Naiyāyikas, the Mīmāṃsa philosophers are not\nmotivated merely by epistemological requirements, their main aim is to\ndefend the eternality of the Vedas. This requires that the language,\nand in turn the words and their meanings are eternal. Therefore, the\nmeaning of a word cannot be a particular which is perishable. It must\nbe a universal that exists eternally. But like the Naiyāyikas,\nthe Mīmāṃsa philosophers believe that universals are\nnot merely inferred, but are directly perceived. Kumarila’s\nargument for the perceptibilty of universals s developed in response\nto the Buddhist doctrine of apoha. To the Buddhist who says that we\ncannot perceive universals distinct from particulars, because\nperception can only cognise particulars. Kumarila replies by offering\nexample. When we perceive a man at a distance and wonder whether he is\na Brahmin or some other kind of man, we do so because we perceive the\nuniversal humanity directly. This would be possibble if at least some\nuniversals were not directly given in perception. \nIt is useful to think of a universal in this sense as a non-particular\nindividual (Chakrabarti, 1995). Examples abound: Dusky is what many\nparticulars are, though they may be spatiotemporally separated by many\nmiles and years; rainy is what several days of the year can be at the\nsame time in different places and at different times in the same\nplace. If we are not thinking of universals as abstract entities in\nPlatonic heaven or in the mind, but as individuals out there in the\nworld, it is easier to grasp the idea that they can be perceived. The\nNyāya equation of universals and properties might tempt one to\nthink that Nyāya conceives of universals as natural properties in\nDavid Lewis’ sense of the term (Lewis, 1983), but such is not\nthe case. Nyāya universals are as robust as Armstrong’s\nuniversals: they capture facts of resemblance and the causal powers of\nthings. Naiyāyikas will happily endorse Armstrong’s\n‘One over Many’ argument as the main reason for including\nuniversals in their ontology (Armstrong, 1978). Udayana puts the point\nthus: “Causality is regulated by universals, so is effect-hood.\nIt is a natural universal if there is no obstruction [in establishing\nit]; it is a conditional [nominal] universal when we have to establish\nit through effort [construction?]”\n(Kiraṇāvālī, in Praśastapāda\n1971, 23). \nAlthough Gautama mentions universals in the\nNyāyasūtras as the meaning of general terms,there is\nno explanation in these original sūtras as to how they\nmight be known. Praśastapāda was the first to argue that\nuniversals are sensorily given. He argues that universals, when they\ninhere in perceptible loci (e.g., ‘cowness’ in an\nindividual cow), are perceived by the same sense organs that also\nperceive those loci (Padārthadharmasaṃgraha, 99).\nThis thesis is explicated in detail by Jayanta Bhaṭṭa in\nNyāyamañjarī where he argues against the\nBuddhist nominalists as well as the holistic monist pan-linguist\nBhartṛhari and his followers. Jayanta makes an allusion to the\nview that universals are given in indeterminate perception, a view\nlater developed in detail by Gaṅgeśa in\nTattvacintāmaṇi (the chapter on\n“Perception,” the section on “Indeterminate\nPerception”). Most of Jayanta’s arguments against the\nBuddhist nominalist are discussed in detail in Chakrabarti (2006),\nhowever, he does not discuss the issue about universals being given in\nindeterminate perception. This is, as we have mentioned in the above\nsections, because Chakrabarti is sceptical about the coherence of the\nnotion of indeterminate perception. Chadha (2014) argues that\nGaṅgeśa makes a unique contribution to this debate in\nproposing the idea that universals or qualifiers are given as objects\nin indeterminate perception. He spells out his argument in terms of\nqualifiers rather than real universals, because the logical and\nepistemological role of a real universal is the same as that of a\nsimple nominal property. Gaṅgeśa is concerned with basic,\nunanalyzable properties that can be grasped as such in our awareness.\nBasic properties in this sense are simple; they can be grasped without\nfurther qualification. They are, according to Nyāya, the\n‘epistemic firsts’ comparable to non-conceptual perception\nin Buddhist epistemology. Gaṅgeśa’s argument is\npresented by Bhattacharya (1993, 10–11) using a specific form of\ninference (parārthānumāna) developed in\nNyāya for convincing others. It has a five-proposition\nstructure: \nThe weight of the argument rests on the third sentence.\nGaṅgeśa supports it offering various examples of\nqualificative cognition, namely inference, recognition, analogy,\nverbal testimony, and so on. The point is that unless some awareness\nof dung is present in a person, (s)he cannot infer that there is dung\non the hill on the basis of seeing some animals grazing on the hill.\nUniversals like fireness and dungness are given directly in\nindeterminate perception. Gaṅgeśa’s argument\nmaintains a causal uniformity among pramāna-generated cognitions\nof an entity as qualified (Phillips and Tatacharya 2004, p. 398).\nHowever, there is a problem: if anything that is known through a\nqualifier requires a prior cognition of the qualifier, there will be a\nregress of cognitions. Gaṅgeśa’s answer is that an\nindeterminate perception blocks the threat of such a regress, because\nthe qualifier is then grasped directly rather than through another\nqualifier. In other words, the object is perceived through the\nproperty, but the property itself is perceived directly rather than\nthrough another property. The indeterminate perception, which precedes\nthe determinate perception of an object through a mode, that is, as\npossessing a certain property, is not itself a perception through a\nmode. Simply put, we need to grasp the universal cowness in order to\nhave an awareness of a particular as qualified by cowness. Chadha\n(2014) argues that Gaṅgeśa’s argument thus shows that\nthe postulate of indeterminate perception of universals is a necessary\nrequirement for realism. \nThe skeptics challenge strikes at the claim made by the\nNaiyāyikas that perception should be non-erroneous\n(avyabhichāri) and well-ascertained or free from doubt\n(vyavasāyātmaka). They ask: how do we distinguish\nbetween veridical perceptions and the non-veridical ones? In case of a\nperceptual doubt, say, seeing something at a distance which looks like\na pole or an old tree-trunk, we are uncertain which it is but are\na priori sure it cannot be both. In case of perceptual\nillusion, I see a snake but I misperceive as there is only a rope in\nfront of me. Illusoriness of the experience (seeing a snake) is\nexposed with reference to another veridical experience (seeing a\nrope), but again, we are a priori sure that both cannot be\ntrue together. Then, the Buddhist skeptic, Vasubandhu, raises the ante\nwith the question: could they not both be false simultaneously? The\nskeptical argument is premised on a denial of the realist thesis that\nexperiences refer to a mind-independent reality. Vasubandhu’s\nargument for idealism appears right at the beginning of\nVimśatikā, when he states: \nVasubandhu offers many other examples of dreams, delusions,\nhallucinations, etc., where we are aware of non-existent objects that\nare products of our imagination and not objects external to the mind.\nIf it is possible for awareness to create its own object and then\ngrasp it (as in a dream) then, Vasubandhu argues, everything that we\nseem to be aware of could be a making of awareness. \nThe standard reply to this view appeals to the intuition that illusory\nexperience is parasitic on veridical experience. The Naiyāyika,\nVātsyāyana explains that an erroneous cognition depends on a\nprincipal cognition as its basis. “This is a man” for a\ntree-trunk, which is not a man, has for its basis a principal\ncognition of a man. If a man has never been perceived in the past, an\nerroneous cognition of a man, in what is not a man, can never be\nproduced (Nyāya-Sūtra-Bhāṣya, 4.2.35). A\nsimilar argument is put forth by the Advaita-Vedanta founder\nŚankara. He challenges Vasubandhu’s view on the ground that\nit is incoherent; when the Buddhists say “that which is the\ncontent of an internal awareness appears as though\nexternal,” they are \nFeldman (2005, p. 534) argues that this does not suffice to defeat\nVasubandhu’s idealism. The illusory experience of x, no\ndoubt requires a memory impression which can be produced by a previous\ncognition, but there is no further requirement that the previous\nexperience be veridical, because such impressions can be produced by\nillusory experiences. Feldman uses the case of someone who has only\nexperienced snakes in dreams. He can mistake a rope for a snake,\nbecause the previous dream experience provides the necessary memory\nimpression. Feldman’s argument ignores the gravity of the\nconcern raised by Vātsyāyana and Śankara, however. They\nreject Vasubandhu’s argument on the grounds that we cannot\nimagine (dream, hallucinate, etc) an absolutely unreal thing, like a\nbarren woman’s son. The Nyāya theory of imagination,\nworking in the background here, says that to imagine something is to\nsuperimpose or attribute properties belonging to one kind of thing to\na thing of different kind, provided that there is some resemblance\nbetween the two kinds of objects (Uddyotakara’s\nNyāya-Sūtra-Bhāṣya, 3.1.1). For example,\nto imagine a centaur is to attribute a property belonging to the\nhuman-kind to a thing of the horse-kind. There is some general\nresemblance between the two kinds: both are animals and have legs.\nHowever, an ‘absolutely unreal’ thing can have no\nproperties, and hence a fortiori no properties in common with\nan existing thing. They, therefore, cannot be an object of\nimagination. \nUddyotakara presents an even stronger argument against the skeptics.\nIn his Nyāya-Vārttika he turns Vasubandhu’s\nown argument against him. Uddyotakara asks: how do we know that the\nobject of a dream experience is non-existent? Vasubandhu accepts that\nthe dreamer does not know that he is dreaming; the knowledge that the\nobject is non-existent occurs only when he awakens and no longer\napprehends the object. If non-apprehension of an object in the waking\nstate is required to support the claim that the objects of dream\nexperience do not really exist out there, then apprehension in the\nwaking state must be an indicator of their existence, otherwise there\nwould be no contrast between what is apprehended and what is not\n(Nyāya-Vārttika, 4.2.33). If there is no such\ncontrast, then Vasubandhu’s argument fails because there is no\nsupport for the claim that objects of dream experiences do not exist\nin the external world. And, if there is such a contrast between\napprehension and non-apprehension, then at least some external objects\nmust exist. Clearly, Vasubandhu’s argument for thesis of\nuniversal delusion (or idealism) does not succeed completely, nor are\nthe realists totally defeated. \nWe close this entry on the note that Sūtra-s were\nprimarily composed in the seven centuries from 5th BCE to\n2nd CE and, thereafter, for the next millennium and more,\nthe philosophical work was carried forward by Sūtra\ncommentators (tikākār-s) from respective schools.\nThis latter period saw these epistemological debates rage among\nscholars from these schools. Note also that there is no consensus on\nthe dates given here; most Western scholars accept these, while Indian\nschools place them further back in antiquity.","contact.mail":"Monima.Chadha@arts.monash.edu.au","contact.domain":"arts.monash.edu.au"}]
