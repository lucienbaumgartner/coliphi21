What follows is\na discussion of one familiar and quite fundamental topic in this area:\nfictional entities (both the issue of what such entities might be like\nand whether there really are such entities).\n\n\nA familiar characteristic of works of fiction is that they feature\nfictional characters: individuals whose exploits are written about in\nworks of fiction and who make their first appearance in a work of\nfiction. Shakespeare’s Hamlet, for example, features\nthe fictional character Hamlet, Doyle’s The Hound of the\nBaskervilles features Sherlock Holmes, Tolstoy’s Anna\nKarenina features Anna Karenina, and so on. All of these works\nfeature numerous other fictional characters, of course (Ophelia and Dr\nWatson, for example); indeed, some works of fiction are characterized\nby the sheer abundance of their characters (Russian novels are often\nsaid to have this characteristic). Fictional characters belong to the\nclass of entities variously known as fictional entities or\nfictional objects or ficta, a class that includes\nnot just animate objects of fiction (fictional persons, animals,\nmonsters, and so on) but also inanimate objects of fiction such as\nfictional places (Anthony Trollope’s cathedral town of\nBarchester and Tolkien’s home of the elves, Rivendell, for\nexample). As stated, however, it doesn’t include entities\nlocated in the real world, although real entities do have an important\nrole to play in works of fiction. Thus, neither London nor Napoleon\nare fictional entities, although the first is the quite essential\nbackdrop to what goes on in the Holmes stories while the second plays\nan important role in the events described in War and Peace.\n(While London and Napoleon are not fictional entities, some have\nthought that the London of the Holmes stories and the Napoleon of\nWar and Peace should be classed as special fictional\nentities. This view has recently gained some popularity: cf. Landini\n1990, Bonomi 2008, Voltolini 2006, 2013, Motoarca 2014.)\n\n\nThe above characterization suggests that fictional entities constitute\na special type of entity. Not surprisingly, then, one fundamental\nphilosophical question we can ask about fictional entities is a\nquestion about their nature: what kind of thing is a\nfictional entity? This question is separate from what seems an even\nmore fundamental question: why suppose that there are any\nfictional entities in the first place? After all, our world never\ncontained a Sherlock Holmes or a Rivendell—these alleged\nentities make their appearance in works of fiction, not works\nof fact. Following the division in Thomasson 1999, we shall\ncall the first question the metaphysical question, and the\nsecond the ontological question.\n\nAs Thomasson (1999: 5) puts it, the first question amounts to asking:\nwhat would fictional entities be, if there were any? To this question\ndifferent answers have been proposed. But however much they differ,\nthey all try to accommodate in some way or other what seems to be an\nintuitive datum facing philosophers who theorize about fictional\nentities: these entities lack existence, or at least existence as\nordinary physical objects. According to this datum—call it\nthe nonexistence datum—paradigmatic objects of fiction\nlike Hamlet and Holmes do not exist. In support of this datum, note\nthat the layperson would almost certainly answer “No” to\nthe question of whether such objects exist, although she might qualify\nthis answer by adding “there is at least some sense in which\nthey don’t.” We also appeal to nonexistence in this sense\nwhen we want to dispute the view that some alleged individual is a\ngenuine historical figure; we might say, for example, that King Arthur\ndoes not exist, thereby underlining our view that a search for a\nhistorical King Arthur would be in vain. \nThose who do not believe that there are any fictional entities\n(fictional antirealists, as we shall call them) will claim\nthat the nonexistence datum has an ontological reading only:\nto say that fictional entities do not exist amounts to saying that in\nthe overall domain of what there is there are no such things as\nfictional entities. As they see it, fictional realists (those\nwho do believe that there are fictional entities) are the only ones to\ngive the datum a certain metaphysical reading, namely that\nfictional entities have the property of not existing (in some\nsense or other). They might also insist that fictional realists are\nthe only ones to think that the nonexistence of fictional entities is\ndetermined by their nature as fictional entities. But this overstates\nthe case. Because they hold that there are no such things as fictional\nentities, even antirealists are likely to admit that the fact that\nthere is no such thing as some alleged entity X follows from\nthe fact that X has been shown to be fictional. That is what\nhappened in the case of King Arthur and many other legendary or\nmythological entities (fictional entities in the broad sense). People\noriginally supposed (cf. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia\nRegum Britanniae) that King Arthur was a real person, a British\nleader who ruled England after the departure of the Romans, until it\nwas discovered that King Arthur is merely a figure of legend, a\nfictional entity. It was this discovery that licensed the conclusion\nthat King Arthur doesn’t exist. So it seems that even\nantirealists have a stake in the answer to the metaphysical question\n“What would it take for something to be a fictional\nentity?” \nOne further comment about the nonexistence datum before we turn to\nvarious accounts of fictional objects and the ways in which such\naccounts cope with the datum. As we have already seen, it is natural\nwhen discussing the datum to use quantifiers such as “Some\nthings are …” (“There are things that are\n…”), and “Everything is…”, whose\ndomain appears to include both existent and nonexistent objects. We do\nso when we say, for example, that there are objects, such as\nfictional objects, that don’t exist. Fictional antirealists will\ntake such talk with a grain of salt, since they do not acknowledge a\nsense in which there really are any fictional objects. Fictional\nrealists, on the other hand, will think that a sentence like\n“There are objects, among them Hamlet and Holmes, that\ndon’t exist” is either literally true or at least it\nconveys a truth. They typically acknowledge a distinction between\nunrestricted quantifiers, whose domain includes even nonexistent\nobjects, and restricted quantifiers, whose domain includes only\nexistent objects (cf., e.g., Berto 2013). \nOne way to account for the nonexistence datum is the possibilist\ntheory of fictional entities, which holds that fictional entities\ndo not exist in the actual world but only in some other\npossible worlds. In this respect, fictional entities are thought to be\nlike other merely possible entities such as talking donkeys. According\nto standard versions of the possible worlds framework, some things not\npresent at the actual world exist as talking donkeys at some merely\npossible worlds. Similarly, the possibilist theory holds that Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist in the actual world, although he does exist at\nsome merely possible worlds: worlds in which the Holmes stories are\nfact. \nSuch a possibilist theory is faced with a problem of ontological\nindeterminacy. For there is more than one possible world in which\nConan Doyle’s Holmes stories are fact, and in which there is a\nwitty, cocaine-addicted detective called “Holmes” who\nlives at 221B Baker St., has a friend called “Watson”, and\ndoes the things recorded of him in the Holmes stories. Not all of\nthese Holmes-candidates are the same; while they all match each other\nin terms of what the stories say about Holmes, they may be very\ndifferent in other crucial ways—they may have had very different\nchildhoods, including different parents, and so on. (Indeed, when\ncharacters are underdescribed in a story, a single possible world may\ncontain many individuals who fit exactly what the story says about the\ncharacter.) We can now ask: which of these different witty,\ncocaine-addicted detectives is Holmes? (cf. Kaplan 1973: 505–6;\nKripke 1972 [1980: 156–8]). There seems to be no principled way\nof deciding. \nKripke suggests that this indeterminacy shows that none of these\npossible entities is Holmes, “[f]or if so, which one?”\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 157–8]). But suppose, for argument’s\nsake, that this indeterminacy could somehow be resolved, perhaps by\nthe story including details of certain properties that, arguably, only\nHolmes could have, such as his being the only person to have\noriginated from certain gametes. Even in that case, there would be\nstrong reason not to identify Holmes with a merely possible entity.\nTake a different case, that of the mythical sword Excalibur extracted\nfrom a rock by King Arthur. As everyone knows, this sword does not\nexist. Its nonexistence would not be threatened by someone’s\ndiscovering an object with all the properties that the Breton cycle\nascribes to Excalibur. No matter how similar, an actual object that\nresembles a fictional object would not be that fictional object\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 157–8]). Now, moving from the actual world\nto merely possible worlds does not change things: why should Excalibur\nbe identified even with a merely possible entity? Had a\nmerely possible entity exactly matching Excalibur in its properties\nbeen actual, it would not have been the fictional Excalibur, by the\nKripkean argument rehearsed above. So how are things different if this\nmerely possible Excalibur-like sword remains merely possible? In a\nnutshell, if there is a gap between fiction and reality, there is also\na gap between fiction and possibility. \nThese difficulties for possibilism do not equally affect all versions\nof the doctrine. Consider David Lewis’s version of the doctrine,\nwhich is embedded in his realist account of possible objects (Lewis\n1986). Roughly speaking, Lewis takes a possible individual to be a\nHolmes-candidate if it has Holmes’s properties in a possible\nworld in which the Holmes stories are told as known fact (Lewis 1978).\nFor Lewis, each such individual is a part of one world and not part of\nany other world (possible individuals are in a sense\n‘world-bound’ on Lewis’s view); no Holmes-candidate\nis therefore identical to any other Holmes-candidate. But unlike more\ndoctrinaire possibilists, Lewis can use his counterpart theory (Lewis\n1986) to offer a principled way of counting each such Holmes-candidate\nas being Holmes. Suppose you are a reader of the Holmes stories. Each\nHolmes-candidate is a counterpart for you of every other\nHolmes-candidate. For even if they should differ substantially in\nterms of overall qualitative similarity, the various Holmes-candidates\nare all counterparts by acquaintance for you (or, as Lewis\nseems to have thought, for your community of\nfellow-readers)—they are all, in their respective worlds, the\nperson called “Holmes” whom you or your community (or\nrather, your counterparts) learn about by reading the Holmes stories,\ntold as known fact (cf. Lewis 1983b; Currie 1990: 137–9; Kroon 1994). In short, the fact\nthat there are so many distinct Holmes-candidates is less embarrassing\nfor Lewis than it is for other possibilists. (See also the suggestion\nin Sainsbury 2010 (pp. 82–3) that Lewis could have accommodated\na plurality of possible Holmes-candidates by refusing to identify\nHolmes with any of them, instead modeling the relation between talk of\nHolmes and talk of these possible Holmes-candidates on the model of\nthe notion of precisification used in Lewis’s semantics of\nvagueness.) \nLewis’s counterpart theory is not widely accepted, however. In\ngeneral, Kripkean objections against possibilism about fictional\nentities have been more influential. Some have argued, however, that\nsuch objections only succeed if we use a ‘variable domain’\nconception of what there is to quantify over at any particular world,\na conception that allows the set of objects available at one world to\ndiffer from the set of objects available at another world\n(Kripke’s preferred semantics for modal logic is of this kind.)\nSuppose instead that one adopts a version of a ‘fixed\ndomain’ conception of quantification on which one has a\nfictional individual at one’s disposal as a nonexistent entity\nin the actual world and as an existent entity in other possible worlds\n(Priest 2005, Berto 2011). If so, the indeterminacy problem may not\narise. As Priest (2005: 119–20) puts it, we first of all have\nDoyle’s conception of Sherlock Holmes; this Sherlock\nHolmes—the Holmes that Doyle conceives of—is an individual\nin the actual world but it does not exist there; it exists\nonly in other worlds. For Priest, then, Doyle doesn’t\narbitrarily pick one Holmes candidate from among all possible Holmes\ncandidates, each located in its own possible world. Rather, Doyle\nintends a particular individual that does not exist in the\nactual world but which instead realizes the Holmes stories in some\nother possible worlds. Trivially, this individual is Holmes. (Doyle\nmanages this even though the actual world contains many other possible\nindividuals that don’t exist there but realize the Holmes\nstories in other possible worlds (Priest 2005: 93–4).) Of\ncourse, one might still wonder how it is that Doyle is acquainted with\nthis individual via the intentionality of his thought, as Priest\nclaims, rather than with any of the other Holmes candidates. Is\nauthorial intending a creative act, perhaps, one that first\nbrings it about that there is an object of the right kind, as\nThomasson (1999: 90) suggests? All the indications are that Priest\nrejects such a view: “an act of pure intention can intend an\nobject even when there are other indiscriminable objects” (2005:\n142). \nSuch a possibilism also faces another problem. For Priest, as for\nother possibilists, fictional entities do not actually\npossess the properties in terms of which they are characterized in the\nrelevant stories; they only have these properties in (some of) the\nworlds in which they exist. Sherlock Holmes, for instance, is not\nactually a detective since he does not exist. Rather, Holmes is only\npossibly a detective; he is only a detective in possible\nworlds in which he exists. (Note that he is not a detective in\nall the worlds in which he exists, since it is presumably a\ntruth about Holmes that he might not have had the career that he ended\nup with; in some possible worlds, Holmes therefore exists without\nbeing a detective.) Now, it is admittedly strange to say that a\nfictional object like Holmes is a detective in the very same sense in\nwhich, say, a certain actual member of the New York police force is a\ndetective. But retreating to the possibilist view that Holmes has such\nproperties only in merely possible worlds carries its own costs; for\none thing, it seems to underestimate the role of the actual world in\nvarious familiar relational claims we can make about fictional\nobjects. Consider cases in which we compare such objects with actual\nconcrete individuals. Suppose we say: \nWe seem to be saying that Holmes actually has such\ncomparative features, that is, has them in the actual world, not\nmerely in some possible world or other. Suppose that we read (1)\ninstead as saying, à la Priest: \n(More precisely, relative to worlds in which Holmes is as he is\ndescribed to be in the Holmes stories, Holmes has a greater degree of\ncleverness than that possessed by any detective in the actual world;\ncf. Priest 2005: 123.) But no such cross-world way of reading (1)\nmatches the way we would read any other sentence involving a\ncomparison between individuals. Take: \nIt would clearly be incorrect to read (2) as: \n(say, in the sense that, relative to worlds in which Stalin fits the\northodox account of his activities, Stalin is crueler than any other\ndictator in the actual world). (2) is intended to be a substantive\nclaim about how Stalin actually was, not a claim about how he might\nhave been. In addition, a possibilist reading like (1P) makes it hard\nto make sense of the attitudes we hold towards fictional characters\n(Kroon 2008: 201, 2012). Our belief in Holmes’s great cleverness\nexplains our admiration for Holmes, just as our belief in Anna\nKarenina’s suffering explains our pity for Anna Karenina. It is\nhard to see how our belief in Holmes’s possible\ncleverness could do this. In reply, Priest has insisted that this is\nprecisely how we should understand such claims: Holmes is admired for\nthe things he does in the Holmes worlds, while a real individual such\nas Mandela is admired for what he actually did (2016: 217). But this\nseems to beg the question. Surely the mere fact that there are\npossible worlds in which Stalin dedicates his life to rescuing\nmigrants from death in the Mediterranean sea, say, does not make him\nworthy of admiration in the actual world, although it may make him an\nobject of admiration to people in these other worlds. Why should it be\nany different with Holmes? \nThe next approach to fictional entities to be discussed (the (neo-)\nMeinongian approach) is able to avoid such problems. But before we\ndescribe this approach, we should note that Priest himself subscribes\nto a broader theory than possibilism. As many philosophers have noted,\nfictional narratives are often inconsistent. The Holmes stories, for\nexample, characterize Dr Watson as having a war wound on a single\nshoulder, variously given as his left and his right shoulder. Lewis\n(1983a: 277–8) suggests that, typically, impossible fictions can\nbe dealt with by invoking only possible worlds (on Lewis’s\npreferred view, both φ and not-φ can be true in such an\nimpossible fiction, but not their conjunction). But there are\ndifficulties with this suggestion when extended to certain deeply\nentrenched contradictions. Thus consider certain time-travel stories.\nPriest himself concocts a story that wouldn’t make sense unless\na particular fictional box—Sylvan’s box—was an\nimpossible object (Priest 2005: 125ff.). Philosophers like Priest\ninvoke impossible worlds to deal with such stories, and argue that\nsome fictional objects are impossible objects to the extent that the\nonly worlds in which the stories that characterize them are true are\nimpossible worlds. \nAccording to possibilism (perhaps extended to allow some fictional\nobjects to be impossible objects), fictional objects are just like\nactual objects, except that they exist only in various non-actual\nworlds. Like actual objects, they are determinate down to the last\ndetail in worlds in which they exist (so long as the stories that\ncharacterize them represent the world as being determinate down to the\nlast detail). This is so even if the stories do not themselves fill in\nthese details. For example, in worlds in which the Holmes stories are\ntrue, Holmes is left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous, even\nthough the stories themselves do not tell us which (all that is true\nin the Holmes stories is that, having hands, he is\none of these). \nThe view that fictional objects are Meinongian objects\nconstitutes a very different metaphysical option. Meinong (1904)\nthought that over and above the concrete entities that exist\nspatiotemporally and the ideal or abstract entities that exist\nnon-spatiotemporally, there are entities that neither exist\nspatiotemporally nor exist non-spatiotemporally: these are the\nparadigmatic Meinongian objects that lack any kind of being. Meinong\nhimself used “[mere] subsistence” (Bestehen) for\nthe non-spatiotemporal kind of being, reserving\n“existence” (Existenz) for the spatiotemporal\nkind. “Sein” was his word for the most general kind of\nbeing, which includes both subsistence and existence. We will continue\nto use ”exists” for the most general mode of being, i.e.,\nMeinong’s Sein. \nEven though Meinongian objects do not exist, they do have properties.\nIn particular, Meinong thought that their being such-and-so (their\nSosein) is independent of their being or Sein. These\nSosein-specifying properties, moreover, are precisely the\nproperties in terms of which the objects are descriptively given. This\nclaim is captured by the so-called Characterization\nPrinciple, whose explicit formulation is due to Routley (1980:\n46) but which is already implicit in Meinong 1904 (1960: 82).\nAccording to this Principle, objects, whether they exist or not, have\nthe properties in terms of which they are given or characterized;\nschematically, the thing that is characterized as being F is in\nfact F. Take, for instance, the golden mountain or the round\nsquare. The golden mountain does not exist, yet we can say that it is\nboth golden and a mountain since these are the properties in terms of\nwhich the object is characterized; similarly, the round square is both\nround and square, even though it cannot exist. \nIt is commonly assumed that for Meinong fictional objects are just a\nsubset of his Meinongian objects—they are Meinongian objects\nthat are given in terms of the properties they have in the stories\nthat feature them. Note that the problem for possibilism mentioned\ntowards the end of the last section disappears on this account. For,\nso conceived, fictional entities do in fact possess the properties in\nterms of which they are characterized in the relevant narratives:\nHolmes really does have a high degree of cleverness, higher, perhaps,\nthan that possessed by any actual detective, and so\n (1)\n might well be true. Note also that fictional entities so conceived\nare not completely determined with respect to their properties, unlike\nfictional entities conceived on the model of possibilism. Because\nConan Doyle’s stories are quiet on these matters, Holmes on the\nMeinongian model is not right-handed; nor is he left-handed; nor is he\nambidextrous. He does, however, have the property of being one of\nthese. (One caution. Although this is the usual understanding of\nMeinong’s conception of fictional objects, Meinong may not have\nendorsed it in precisely this form: his most complete account of\nfictional objects suggests that they are higher-order entities, that\nis, entities that are constructed out of simpler entities, in the same\nsense in which, for instance, a melody is an entity constructed out of\nits constituent sounds (cf. Raspa 2001 and Marek 2008 [2013]). \nModern versions of Meinongianism accept much of what Meinong has to\nsay on the topic of nonexistent objects, but depart from his account\nat various points. Suppose we restrict our attention to properties\nappropriate to physical, spatiotemporal objects (for example,\nbeing a mountain or being a detective). What we\nmight call orthodox neo-Meinongians (Parsons 1980, Routley\n1980, Jacquette 1996) maintain that Meinongian objects characterized\nin terms of such properties are concrete correlates of sets of such\nproperties (concrete in the sense that the objects have the properties\nin exactly the same sense as ordinary objects have the properties).\nCorresponding to a set S of such properties, there is a\nconcrete object that has (at least) the properties contained in\nS. Corresponding to {being golden, being a\nmountain}, for example, there is the golden mountain, which has\nthe properties of being a mountain and being golden\n(as well, perhaps, as all properties P such that necessarily,\nwhatever is a golden mountain is P). These properties\nconstitute the nature or essence of the golden mountain. But the\ngolden mountain also has other properties, in particular properties\nthat reflect its relationship to actual objects in the world\n(being often thought about by Meinong, for example). \nFictional objects can similarly be regarded as concrete correlates of\nsets of properties on such a view. Consider Holmes, a cocaine-addicted\ndetective who lives (lived) in London at 221B Baker Street, solves\nmany baffling crimes, has a friend called “Watson”, and so\non (where the “and so on” includes all the properties\nP such that it is true in the Holmes stories that Holmes has\nP). For orthodox neo-Meinongians, Holmes is a concrete, albeit\nnonexistent, correlate of the set having those properties as members.\n(An interesting variant of these neo-Meinongian views is\nCastañeda’s guise-theory, according to which an existent\nindividual is a bundle of guises—particulars formed\nfrom sets of properties by a special concretizing\noperation—related by a relation of consubstantiation.\nAn object like the golden mountain is a guise that is not\nconsubstantiated with any guise, not even itself, and so doesn’t\nexist. Castañeda takes fictional objects to be bundles of\nguises related by a special relation of consociation; see\nCastañeda 1989: ch.11.) \nWhile agreeing that fictional objects form a subset of Meinongian\nobjects, unorthodox neo-Meinongians (see especially Zalta\n1983) maintain that Meinongian objects in general should be conceived\nof as objects that have a non-spatiotemporal mode of existence, and\nhence as abstract rather than concrete objects. And while they agree\nwith the idea that for any collection of properties there is an\nindividual that has all these properties, they do not take Meinongian\nobjects to be correlates of sets of properties in anything like the\nway described by orthodox neo-Meinongians. Instead, they take them to\nbe something like generic objects or roles, along the model of\nPlatonic attributes. (Indeed, Zalta and others have used his theory to\nmodel a range of philosophical notions, including Platonic forms; see\nZalta 1983: 41–7, and Pelletier & Zalta 2000.) Consider the\ngolden mountain again. For unorthodox neo-Meinongians, this object is\nnot a mountain in the same sense that Mt Taranaki, for example, is a\nmountain. The golden mountain is an abstract object, after all, and\nmountains are not abstract objects. It is more akin to the object\nreferred to as the U.S. President in the following statement: \nwhere the subject is not a particular US President like George W. Bush\nor Barack Obama, but rather the role or office of US President. (While\nZalta is the clearest example of an unorthodox neo-Meinongian in our\nsense, others come close. For example, Rapaport (1978) considers\nM-objects (his version of Meinongian objects) to be akin to\nplans rather than concrete individuals, although unlike Zalta he does\nnot explicitly take them to be abstract, non-spatiotemporal\nobjects.) \nThere are other realist positions which, although admittedly not\nMeinongian, come close to this non-orthodox form of Meinongianism.\nSome realist positions take fictional objects to be types\n(Wolterstorff 1980), thereby sharing with non-orthodox Meinongianism a\nform of Platonism about fictional objects; others take them to be\nwork-bound roles (Currie 1990), thereby holding a form of\nabstractionism that leads to a conception of fictional objects as\ndependent entities, like the conception explicitly defended by\ncreationists (see below). \nThe distinction between orthodox and unorthodox neo-Meinongians is\ndrawn at the metaphysical level. It is closely linked to another\ndistinction relevant to Meinongian objects, and so to fictional\nobjects conceived of as Meinongian objects: the distinction between\nkinds of properties and modes of predication. Recall that on the one\nhand it seems natural to say that fictional objects have the\nproperties in terms of which stories characterize them (for instance,\nAnna Karenina was a woman driven to suicide by her failed affair, and\nSherlock Holmes a cocaine-addicted detective living in London), and on\nthe other hand not in the least natural (Anna Karenina may have\ncommitted suicide, but it is no use looking for news of her suicide in\nthe newspapers of the day). Now, all neo-Meinongians accept\nMeinong’s view that a Meinongian object possesses the properties\nin terms of which it is characterized. Following what Meinong (1972\n[1916]) himself came to say on the basis of a suggestion by his\nstudent Ernst Mally, some neo-Meinongians (for example, Parsons 1980,\nJacquette 1996) take these properties to be the object’s nuclear\nproperties, where, in general, if M is the Meinongian object\ncorrelated with a set of properties S, the members of S\nare the object’s nuclear properties. On this view, being a\ndetective, for example, is a nuclear property of Holmes, while\nbeing a king is a nuclear property of King Arthur. (Routley\nsimilarly talks of an object’s characterizing\nproperties; cf. Routley 1980: 507–10.) But a Meinongian object\nalso has other properties on this view: its extranuclear\nproperties are those of its properties that are not among its\nnuclear or characterizing properties. In the case of fictional\nobjects, these are the properties that a fictional object has outside\nthe scope of the story in which it appears—properties, we might\nsay, that it has in virtue of the way the world really is,\nnot properties that it has from the point of view of that story.\nConsider, for example, the following two sentences: \nThese sentences involve properties—being a pop culture\nicon, being a fictional character—that are being\nascribed to Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina even though the properties\ndo not characterize these characters in the stories in which they\nappear. Mickey Mouse has the first property because of the effects of\nhis enormous popularity on pop culture, not because he is depicted as\na pop culture icon in the Mickey Mouse stories. Anna Karenina has the\nsecond property because of her status as the product of creative\nfiction, not because of what Tolstoy’s story says about her\n(according to Tolstoy’s story she is a woman, not a fictional\ncharacter). These two properties are typical instances of extranuclear\nproperties. \n(A cautionary comment. In light of what we have just said, the claim\nthat the properties true of a fictional object in a work count as the\nobject’s nuclear properties needs qualification. It is true in\nthe Holmes stories, for example, that Holmes exists, even though\nHolmes doesn’t actually exist. So non-existence is one of\nHolmes’s (extranuclear) properties despite the fact that in the\nstories Holmes is as much an existent object as he is a detective\nliving in London. One way of dealing with this apparent tension is to\ninsist that Holmes does have a property like existence, but that this\nproperty should be understood as a weaker, ‘watered-down’,\nversion of its extranuclear counterpart, a notion first advanced by\nMeinong (cf. Parsons 1980: 44, 184–6). We return to the notion\nof watered-down versions of extranuclear properties below.) \nSome other neo-Meinongians claim instead that fictional and other\nMeinongian objects possess the very same kind of properties that\nordinary individuals possess, but possess them in a very different\nway. (This suggestion was first made by Mally (1912), but not adopted\nby Meinong.) When, for example, we say that Anna Karenina was a woman\nand Holmes an inhabitant of London, we use a different mode of\npredication from the one we use when we say that Marilyn Monroe was a\nwoman or Tony Blair an inhabitant of London. On Zalta’s familiar\nformulation of this idea (Zalta 1983), fictional entities\nencode such properties while ordinary individuals simply\nexemplify them. Similarly, Castañeda (1989) appeals to\nan internal as well as external mode of predication\nof properties, while Rapaport (1978) talks of properties that are\nconstituents of objects and properties that are exemplified by\nobjects. Both Anna Karenina and Marilyn Monroe, we might say, have the\nproperty of being a woman, but the former encodes the\nproperty (the property is predicated of Anna internally, or Anna has\nit as a constituent), while the latter exemplifies the property (she\nhas it externally). \nBut fictional objects also exemplify properties, perhaps some of the\nvery same properties they encode or have internally (this happens\nwhenever these properties are predicated of the objects in the stories\nin which they appear). Thus, what makes both\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n true is that the properties of being a pop culture icon and\nbeing a fictional character are exemplified, or possessed\nexternally, by Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina respectively. Anna\nKarenina therefore turns out to be internally non-fictional (since it\nis true in the novel that she is a woman, not a fictional character),\nand externally fictional. \nThat said, note that there are important differences between the ways\nin which Zalta, on the one hand, and Castañeda and Rapaport, on\nthe other, formulate these distinctions. For Zalta (1983: 12),\nencoding is a primitive notion which he embeds in a rigorous\nhigher-order modal theory that is then used to prove the existence,\nand derive the properties, of abstract objects, including fictional\nobjects. For both Castañeda (1989: 200) and Rapaport (1978:\n162), on the other hand, internal predication applies to\nset-correlates, and so this mode of predication can be defined in\nterms of set-membership: a (fictional) entity F has P\ninternally (or: has P as a constituent) if and only if P\nbelongs to the property set that is correlated with F. \nOn the surface, the ‘modes of predication’ distinction\nappears to be in a better position to handle the data than the\n‘kinds of properties’ distinction (for more on these\ndistinctions, see the exchange between Jacquette (1989) and Zalta\n(1992)). For one thing, there seems to be no workable criterion for\ndistinguishing nuclear and extranuclear properties: some properties\nseem to be both. Consider the property of being a fictional\ncharacter. Being a fictional character may seem to be\nthe prototypical candidate of an extranuclear property, as the case of\n(5) above testifies, but there may well be ‘metafictional’\nnarratives whose protagonists are not characterized in the usual way\nas flesh and blood individuals, but instead as fictional characters.\n(The fictional character The Father in Pirandello’s Six\nCharacters in Search of an Author is a famous case in point.) So\nbeing a fictional character seems to qualify as both a\nnuclear and an extranuclear property. Defenders of the ‘modes of\npredication’ distinction have no problem here: they hold that we\ncan externally predicate being a fictional character\nof both Anna Karenina and Pirandello’s The Father, while we can\nalso internally predicate this property of The Father. (It\nshould be pointed out that defenders of the ‘kinds of\nproperties’-distinction have their own way of responding to this\nproblem: they say that in such cases the nuclear property in question\nis the ‘watered-down’ counterpart of the corresponding\nextranuclear property. On this view, Pirandello’s The Father has\nthe extranuclear property of being a fictional character as\nwell as its nuclear ‘watered-down’ correlate. But apart\nfrom the seemingly ad hoc character of this response, it is\nfaced by a more serious problem: it threatens to expose the\ndistinction to an endless regress of ever more ‘watered-\ndown’ nuclear properties (cf. Voltolini 2006).) \nIt is probably fair to say that at the current stage of the debate the\n‘modes of predication’ distinction is more widely\naccepted, although as far as fictional entities at least are\nconcerned, both distinctions are taken to be problematic (Everett\n2013). We should remember, however, that this debate is internal to\nneo-Meinongianism, and that neo-Meinongianism as a theory of fictional\nobjects has important virtues that owe nothing to the outcome of this\ndebate. One such virtue is that the theory can account for the idea\nthat fictional entities necessarily have the properties that\nthey are characterized as having in the relevant stories. It is hard\nto see how Holmes could not have been a detective, for\nexample. Of course, Doyle might have written a story in which someone\ncalled ‘Holmes’ was a film director, but it is hard not to\ninterpret this thought as simply meaning that Doyle might have created\nanother character with the same name. At the same time, it is a plain\ntruth of the Holmes stories that Holmes might never have become a\ndetective, that this was a purely contingent choice on Holmes’s\npart. No matter how it is formulated, neo-Meinongianism has a way of\ncapturing both these intuitions. On Zalta’s formulation of the\n‘modes of predication’ distinction, for example, Holmes\nexemplifies the property of being necessarily such that he encodes\nboth being a detective and being someone who might not have been a\ndetective. A neo-Meinongian advocating the ‘types of\nproperty’ distinction would say that Holmes has the extranuclear\nproperty of being necessarily such that he has the (nuclear)\nproperty of being a detective, but that he also has the\n(watered-down) nuclear property of being someone who might not\nhave been a detective. \nOn the basis of the essentialist idea that fictional objects\nnecessarily have the properties that they are characterized as having\nin the relevant stories, neo-Meinongians have suggested a simple\ncriterion for the identity of fictional entities, one which can be\ntraced back to the criterion for the identity of Meinongian objects in\ngeneral: If x has all the same nuclear properties as y\n(alternatively, if x and y internally possess the same\nproperties), then \\(x = y\\) (cf., for example, Parsons 1980: 28,\n188). \nDespite the apparent attractions of such a view, there is an evident\nproblem facing the underlying thought that once you have a certain\ncollection of properties you ipso facto have a fictional\nentity. (Note that (most) neo-Meinongians accept this thought, since\nthey take fictional objects to be a subset of the class of objects\ngenerated on the basis of something like Meinong’s Principle of\nthe Freedom of Assumption (cf. Meinong 1916 [1972: 282]), the\nprinciple that for any collection of (nuclear) properties there is a\nMeinongian object that has those properties.) But generating fictional\nentities is surely not quite that easy. Take an arbitrary\ncollection of properties, say {weighing more than 10kgs,\nbearing the name “Oscar”, having a passion\nfor garden gloves, being a devotee of the number 17}.\nThe mere existence of this set of properties is not enough to generate\na fictional object, Oscar, with these properties. More has to happen.\n(Kripke (2013: 70–1) mentions the historical case of the\nBiblical term ‘Moloch’, which interpreters of the Bible\ntook to be a name for a mythical pagan god, whereas modern philology\nsuggests it was in fact used as a common noun either for kings or for\nhuman sacrifices. If modern philology is right and Bible-interpreters\nwere confused, there is no mythical god Moloch. This is so even though\nwe can agree that there is a collection of properties that past\ninterpreters mistakenly understood the Bible to assign to such a\ngod.) \nNeo-Meinongians have tried to circumvent this problem by stressing\nthat Meinongian objects, including fictional objects, are not sets of\nproperties, but correlates of such sets. Whether this move\nenables neo-Meinongians to avoid admitting objects like Oscar and\nMoloch into the overall domain of fictional objects will depend on how\nthis move is understood. (In Castañeda’s variant of\nneo-Meinongianism, fictional objects are systems of set-correlates,\nbuilt up, or put together, by a fiction maker (cf. Castañeda\n1989: ch.11). But if this implies that the activity of fiction making\nis essential to the identity of fictional objects, we no longer have a\npure neo-Meinongianism but a view that is closer to the\n‘creationist’ view described in the next section.) \nEven if the idea of a set-correlate helps to solve this particular\nproblem, it seems that no neo-Meinongian theory is able to block\nanother problem that stems from letting the identity of such an object\ndepend on the properties in terms of which it is characterized. Take\nJorge Luis Borges’s famous story of a man called Pierre Menard\nwho happens to write a text that is word for word identical with\nMiguel Cervantes’s Don Quixote. Assume, in this variant\nof Borges’s story, that Menard and Cervantes are unknown to each\nother, even though they live in the very same town; one can even\nsuppose that they are neighbors. In that case, the Borges story\ndescribes a situation in which one and the same set of properties\ncorresponds to different fictional objects: Cervantes’s Don\nQuixote and Pierre Menard’s Don Quixote are two distinct\nfictional characters who, nonetheless, share all the properties they\nhave in the respective works. (The ‘Menard’ case was first\nmentioned in this context by Lewis (1978: 39). As a problem for the\nidentity of fictional objects, it was then exploited by Fine (1982:\n107); see also Thomasson (1999: 7, 56).) In this case, claiming that\nfictional objects are set-correlates rather than mere property sets\ndoes not solve the problem, for we have only one set-correlate, yet\ntwo distinct objects. \nIntuitively speaking, the problem is clear. Neo-Meinongianism in all\nits varieties tends to sketch a Platonistic picture of a fictional\nentity, either as something akin to a Platonic attribute, or as a\ncorrelate of something else that we tend to describe in Platonic\nterms—a set of properties. Neo-Meinongianism thus sees a\nfictional object as something that pre-dates the story-telling\nactivities that intuitively bring fictional objects into being. To see\nthe tension between these conceptions, note that we often speak of\nfictional objects as the creations of story-tellers or of the\nhuman mind more generally. Neo-Meinongianism, so it seems, leaves no\nsuch room for story-tellers. \nThe intuition that story-tellers have some kind of creative role to\nplay is accounted for by so called artifactualist, or\ncreationist, accounts of fictional entities (see Searle 1979,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999, Voltolini 2006; the position was also\ndefended in Kripke 2013, and elements of the position are found in van\nInwagen’s (1977) theory of fictional objects as posits of\nliterary criticism; Ingarden 1931 is a significant historical\nforerunner). According to such accounts, fictional objects are\nartifacts since they come into being once they are conceived by their\nauthors; to that extent, they are authorial creations. Moreover, they\nare abstract entities, just as unorthodox neo-Meinongians believe.\nUnlike Platonic abstracta, however, they not only have a\nbeginning in time, but they are also dependent entities since\nthey depend on other entities for their existence. (Roughly speaking,\nan entity O existentially depends on another entity\nO′ just if O couldn’t exist without\nO′ existing (cf. Thomasson 1999). For a more\ndiscriminating account, one that avoids the consequence that\neverything existentially depends on necessary existents like natural\nnumbers, see Fine 1994.) More specifically, fictional objects depend\nhistorically rigidly on the authors who create them (necessarily, if\nO comes into being at t, then the author(s) who\ncreates O exists at some time t′ before\nt) and constantly generically on the literary works that\nfeature them (necessarily, if O goes on existing, then some\nliterary work W or other featuring O exists during\nO’s time of existence) (see Thomasson 1999 for an\nextended discussion of such dependencies). While historical rigid\ndependence accounts for a fictional object’s coming into being,\nconstant generic dependence accounts for its continued existence or\npersistence. Such an account of the persistence of fictional objects\nseems as intuitive as the account of their generation. Not only do we\nsay that some given fictional object was created at a certain point of\ntime, but we might also describe it as having a certain age\n(Hamlet, we might point out, is now over 400 years old). \nNote that creationism thus characterized earns its keep from the\n‘obviousness’ of the thought that authors somehow create\nfictional characters through the creation of fictional works in which\nthey appear. Language seems to support this thought: we routinely hear\nstatements like “Hamlet is one of Shakespeare’s most\ncomplex creations”. It is on the basis of this thought that\ncreationists then hypothesize that fictional objects literally are the\ncreations of their authors: not concrete creations, clearly, so\ntherefore non-concrete, abstract creations. But this move is far from\ninnocent. Yagisawa (2001), for example, argues that creationism\nconflicts sharply with other seemingly obvious thoughts, for example\nthe nonexistence datum that fictional characters like Hamlet\ndon’t exist (for a response, see Goodman 2004). At an even more\nfundamental level, Brock (2010) argues that the creationist’s\nappeal to creation is explanatorily void, leaving more questions than\nanswers. \nCreationists themselves claim that the appeal to creation does solve a\nnumber of significant problems that afflict other metaphysical\ntheories. There is, for example, no mythical god Moloch, for nobody\nhas created such an object by gathering various properties and\nembedding them in a certain narrative. And although they share all the\nproperties attributed to them in the respective renditions of Don\nQuixote, there are two Don Quixotes, Cervantes’s\nand Menard’s, not just one, because there were two utterly\nindependent acts of authorial generation (cf. Voltolini 2006: 32ff.).\nIt is not clear, however, how creationists can deal with a related\nproblem that affects their theory, the problem of indiscriminable\nfictional objects (Kroon 2015). Intuitively, there were thousands of\nfictional dwarves who took part in Tolkien’s War between the\nDwarves and Orcs, without Tolkien’s engaging in thousands of\nacts of dwarf-creation. (In response to this worry, some creationists\nhave denied that there are such characters; see, for example,\nVoltolini 2006: 209–11.) \nIt is evident, then, that creationism is not without its problems.\nPerhaps the most significant ones have to do with the nature of the\ncreative process and the relation between the creative process and the\nidentity of fictional objects. It seems, for example, that what comes\ninto existence on the above account of the generating process (which\ntalks of authors’ conceiving of their literary\ncreations) is not a fictional object as such, but rather a (mere)\nintentional object, the target of a certain authorial thought. A mere\nintentional object is not yet a fictional object, as Thomasson (1999:\n89) agrees, so what makes it one? Does it become one by being able to\nbe ‘shared’ by more than one person through appearing in a\ntext (maybe not a physical copy but one stored in memory)? Or is there\na more discriminating criterion to single out which intentional\nobjects are fictional objects? \nThis question is perhaps best answered by giving a somewhat different\naccount of the generating process. Thus, some creationists (Schiffer\n1996, 2003; Thomasson 2003a,b) say that a fictional object comes into\nbeing as an abstract artifact not when an author first conceives of\nit, but only once a certain make-believe process has come to an end,\nnamely, the process in which someone—typically, a\nstory-teller—pretends that there is an individual who is\nsuch-and-such and does so-and-so. It is disputable whether this\nprovides a sufficient condition for ficta generation; perhaps\nsomething else is needed, such as a reflexive stance on the very\nmake-believe process itself (Voltolini 2006, 2015a). But whatever the\nright account, another question remains: even if we agree on the\nnature of the process-type that gives rise to a fictional object,\nwhat is the thing that is purportedly generated in this way?\nWhat are the identity conditions for fictional objects? Creationists\ntypically do not think that a fictional object possesses the\nproperties that characterize it in the story in which it appears. A\nfictional object simply has those properties according to the\nstory. It is not true of Holmes, for instance, that\n‘he’ (or it) is a detective—only physical objects,\nnot an abstract artifact, can be a detective. What is true of Holmes\nis that ’he’ is a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (equally, Holmes is male according to those stories, and so\ndeserving of the masculine pronoun “he”). In general, for\ncreationists the only properties that fictional objects genuinely\npossess are the properties that neo-Meinongians would call\nextranuclear or take to be externally predicated: properties like\nbeing a fictional detective or being Doyle’s\ncreation or even being a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (cf. Thomasson 1999). The approach thus fails to account\nfor the idea, mentioned earlier, that there must be a sense in which\nfictional objects actually have the properties that\ncharacterize them in the relevant stories. \nIn addition, the restricted nature of such properties makes it hard to\nsee how to individuate a fictional entity. Thomasson gives sufficient\nidentity conditions for fictional entities within a literary\nwork: x and y are the same fictional object F if\nx and y are ascribed exactly the same properties in the\nwork (1999: 63). But what do we say in the case of fictional objects\nthat appear in different works? Thomasson admits that in this case one\ncan only provide a necessary condition: x and y are the\nsame fictional object only if the author of the second work\n\\(W’\\) is competently acquainted with x of the previous\nwork \\(W\\), and intends to import x into \\(W’\\) as\ny (1999: 67). The reason why she thinks this cannot be a\nsufficient condition is that, no matter what the author’s\nintentions are, he does not succeed in importing x (an entity\nthat appears in W) into \\(W’\\) as y if he\nattributes properties to y that are too radically different\nfrom the properties that were attributed to x in W\n(1999: 68). (There are other cases that show even more clearly how\nauthorial intention can be thwarted. Thus, consider a case of a\nfusion of characters, in which an author intends to import\ninto \\(W’\\) two characters x and y from a previous\nwork W as a single character z. Clearly, given the\ntransitivity of identity, z is not identical with either\nx or y, so the author fails in her attempt. Analogous\nproblems arise in the converse situation of character\nfission: cf. Voltolini 2012.) \nTo conclude this discussion of the metaphysics of fictional objects,\nit is worth noting that neo-Meinongian and creationist theories seem\nto suffer from complementary defects. On the one hand, neo-Meinongians\nprovide exact identity criteria for fictional objects, but these\ncriteria are clearly insufficient in that they do not take into\naccount the fact that such objects are products of the human mind. On\nthe other hand, creationists do account for this fact, but they only\nprovide relatively non-specific identity criteria for such entities.\nThose theories are normally taken to be incompatible, for they appeal\nto different metaphysical models—broadly speaking, a Platonic\nmodel as opposed to a constructivist one. This claim of\nincompatibility should not be taken as definitive, however; there may\nwell be ways in which the two theories, or perhaps the most promising\nelements of each theory, can somehow be combined (for recent attempts\nto go in such a direction, cf. Zalta 2000, Voltolini 2006). \nThe metaphysical question about fictional entities asked what such\nentities are like, should there be any. We now turn to the ontological\nquestion, which simply asks whether there are any such entities. \nObviously the important division at the ontological level lies between\nthose who believe that there are fictional\nentities—fictional realists—and those who believe\nthat there no such entities—fictional antirealists. For\na long time, the battlefield between those two parties has been\nordinary language. Realists have always been fascinated by the fact\nthat there are sentences in language that seem to commit one to\nfictional entities. Antirealists have instead insisted that such\nappearances are deceptive: whenever a sentence seems to commit one to\nfictional entities, one can always provide a paraphrase which has the\nsame truth-conditions as the original sentence but is not so\ncommitted. Realists in turn try to show either that those paraphrases\nare inadequate or that there are still further sentences for which no\nadequate paraphrases can be found. Antirealists will reply that,\ndespite appearances, these sentences can also be paraphrased in\nnoncommittal terms; and so the game goes on. \nFrege (1892) is often taken to be the first champion of fictional\nantirealism within analytic philosophy, in so far as he held that in\ndirect (gerade) contexts such as “Odysseus came\nashore” the fictional name “Odysseus“ has a sense but no reference. But Frege\nalso held that in oblique (ungerade) contexts such as\n“John believed that Odysseus came ashore” and “The\nauthor of the Odyssey says that Odysseus came ashore”\nthis sense becomes the new referent of the fictional name. If senses\nof this type can model the notion of a fictional entity, then Frege\ncan be construed as a kind of fictional realist (Künne 1990);\notherwise, he can’t. (Parsons (1982) is doubtful; Zalta may be\nmore sympathetic, since he thinks his abstract objects can model both\nthe notion of sense (Zalta 2001) and the idea of a fictional\nobject.) \nThe modern form of the realism-antirealism debate, however, did not\noriginate with anything Frege said on the matter, but with a dispute\nbetween Meinong (1904) and Russell (1905a). Consider a sentence\nlike: \nAccording to Meinong, considered here as the paradigmatic realist, the\nvery meaningfulness of this statement commits one to a (broadly)\nfictional entity—the deity of the Greek myths—on the\ngrounds, roughly, that the thought expressed by the statement is\ndirected at this entity, and so requires there to be such an entity.\nThe statement itself expresses a truth rather than a falsehood about\nthis entity. For Russell, however, appearances in this case were\ndeceptive. First of all, he thought that “Apollo”, like\nany other ordinary proper name, is short-hand for a definite\ndescription—say, “the sun-god”. Secondly, following\nhis discovery of the theory of definite descriptions Russell held that\na sentence containing a definite description has to be analyzed in\nterms of another sentence in which the description is eliminated in\nfavor of quantifiers, predicates, logical connectives, and genuine\nproper names. What (6) says on this account is given by a paraphrase\nin which the definite description for which “Apollo” is\nshort-hand, namely “the sun-god”, has disappeared on\nanalysis: \n(Put more simply: There is a unique sun-god, and he is young.) \nThirdly, there is no longer even the appearance of a singular term\n(“Apollo”) that must designate something for the\nparaphrase to be meaningful. In fact, Russell saw that this result\nshowed the original statement to be both meaningful (because able to\nbe analyzed in this way) and false (given obvious facts). Say that a\ndefinite description has a Russellian denotation when the\nRussellian conditions for the description to have a denotation are\nfulfilled; that is, when there is at least one individual satisfying\nthe relevant predicate, but no more than one. Then we can say that the\ndefinite description for which “Apollo” is short-hand does\nnot have a Russellian denotation since (6R)’s first conjunct,\nnamely: \nis false. Far from making\n (6)\n meaningless, the absence of a denotation in this Russellian sense\nwhen taken in conjunction with Russell’s eliminative strategy\nshows (6) to be false. Russell thought that his theory of definite\ndescriptions allowed him to show that all fictional names lacked\ndenotation in this way, and that sentences containing fictional names\nwere therefore true or false rather than meaningless. \nLet us accept, for argument’s sake, that the adoption of\nRussell’s theory of descriptions allows us to avoid ontological\ncommitment to such ‘bizarre’ entities as nonexistent\nfictional and mythological entities. (Although this is a widely\naccepted view, there is in fact reason to doubt it: David Kaplan\nargues that it is “one of [the] virtues” of\nRussell’s theory that the theory is “essentially neutral\nwith respect to ontological commitment”, that it permits\ndescriptions to denote nonexistent entities if there are such entities\n(Kaplan 2005: 975–6; cf. also Voltolini 2006: 139ff.). Even if\nRussell’s theory is ontologically potent in this way, however,\nthe theory as formulated faces a simple and seemingly devastating\nobjection: many intuitively true sentences come out as false\non their Russellian paraphrases. Consider sentence\n (6)\n again. If we use Russell’s theory to dispense with an entity\nlike Apollo, it follows that (6) is false, insofar as its Russellian\nparaphrase is false. This is widely acknowledged to be\ncounterintuitive. Presented with (6), most would say that it is\nintuitively true, unlike, say: \nAs it turns out, the antirealist who follows Russell has an easy way\nof circumventing this problem. She will point out that the reason why\n (6),\n but not (8), seems to be true is that in the Greek myth\nthings are exactly as (6) says. The impression that (6) is true can\nthen easily be accommodated by taking (6) to be elliptical for a\nlonger sentence, namely: \nHere the locution “according to the Greek myth” works as\nan intensional operator, whereas the sentence following that operator,\nwhich is nothing but (6) itself, has to be analyzed in Russellian\nfashion: \n(A caveat. It would be more proper to say that it is a use of\n (6)\n that is taken to be elliptical for (6IR), rather than (6) itself. For\n(6) is a case of a fictional sentence, namely a sentence that\ncould easily occur in the body of a narrative (a myth, in this case).\nSuch sentences have a use on which they have merely fictional\ntruth-conditions, that is, truth-conditions from the stand-point of\nthe narrative or work of fiction, and on this kind of use even their\ntruth-values are merely fictional. Following Evans (1982), who here\nborrows a Quinean terminology, we may call this the conniving\nuse of such sentences: the use on which the utterer is engaged in\npretense or make-believe. But there is another use of the same\nsentences—what Evans calls the non-conniving\nuse—on which we take them to have real truth-conditions, hence\nreal truth-values: the kind of use on which we take\n (8),\n unlike (6), to express a real falsehood. A case in point would be an\nutterance of (8) in response to a request for information about Apollo\nin an exam on Greek mythology. We shall call sentences of the form\n (6I),\n even reshaped as (6IR), internal metafictional sentences,\nfor they purport to say how things stand in, or according to, a\ncertain fiction. They are meant as sentences that capture the\nnon-conniving use of fictional sentences like (6).) \nLet us now go back to the amendment to Russellianism we were\nconsidering. On the view being discussed, an expression like\n“according to the Greek myth” is, qua intensional\noperator, a circumstance-shifting operator, one that shifts the\ncircumstance of evaluation of the sentence following it. Suppose, for\nthe sake of argument, that a sentence of the form “According to\nstory S, p” is true in the actual world if and\nonly if “p” is true at the closest possible worlds\nto the actual world in which S is true (cf. Lewis 1978). Now,\nany sentence that this operator embeds has to be analyzed in\nRussellian terms if it contains a singular term. In that case, a\nsentence like\n (6I)\n is true in the actual world if and only if\n (6),\n i.e.,\n (6R),\n is true at the closest possible worlds in which the Apollo-myth is\ntrue. Insofar as (6R) is indeed true at such worlds, the singular term\nin question—“Apollo”, that is, “the\nsun-god”—has a (Russellian) denotation in those worlds,\neven though it lacks a denotation in the actual world. Hence, we again\nget the result Russell desired: the whole sentence is true although\nthe relevant singular term has no actual denotation but only a\npossible one. Thus, no commitment to fictional entities arises out of\nthe truth of that sentence. \nOr rather, no such commitment arises from Russell’s theory on\nits own. If we assume Lewis’s modal realism, then saying as we\ndid that a description has a possible denotation entails an\nontological commitment to fictional objects as possibilia.\nNormally, however, this intensionalist approach is taken in an\nantirealist sense (cf., e.g., Lamarque & Olsen 1994; Orenstein\n2003; Rorty 1982). For the Russellian, central to this antirealist\nunderstanding is the fact that a sentence like\n (6I)\n should be given a de dicto, not a de re, reading:\nwhat is said to be true in the fiction is a certain dictum or\nproposition, not the claim, about some given thing or res\nx, that x has a certain property. On Russell’s way\nof understanding this distinction, the description “the\nsun-god” for which “Apollo” is short-hand should be\ninterpreted as having a secondary, not a primary, occurrence in the\nsentence, or, which is the same, the existential quantifier occurring\nin the Russellian paraphrase of the sentence should be assigned\nnarrow, not wide, scope. (6I), that is, should be read as:\n“According to the Apollo-myth, there is exactly one sun-god, and\nhe is young” rather than as “There is a unique sun-god,\nand according to the myth he is young”. The reason for this is\nevident. If we adopt the wide-scope reading of the quantifier, the\nsentence turns out to be false, not true (given that there is no\nsun-god); and it is the truth of a sentence like (6I) that the\nRussellian aims to capture. \nSuppose that the Russellian amendment works for fictional sentences on\ntheir non-conniving use. Intuitively, however, there are many\nsentences that talk of fictional characters even though they do not\neven implicitly mention stories. Let us call these\nexternal metafictional sentences (some other commentators\ntalk of “transfictive” or “critical”\nsentences).\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n above are typical examples. Clearly, (4) and (5) cannot be taken as\nelliptical for internal metafictional sentences such as: \nFor unlike\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n the latter sentences are simply false even on their de dicto\nreading (a point already stressed by Lewis (1978: 38)): Mickey Mouse\nhas the status of a pop culture icon in the actual world, not in the\nDisney stories; and according to Anna Karenina, Anna is a\nwoman, not a fictional character. Many realists, especially\ncreationists, have concluded that sentences of this kind really do\nestablish that we are committed to fictional characters. They argue\nthat even though fictional sentences on their non-conniving use can be\nparaphrased as internal metafictional sentences on their de\ndicto reading and thus do not commit us to fictional characters,\nexternal metafictional sentences cannot be paraphrased in this way,\nand their truth really does commit us to fictional characters (see,\nfor example, Schiffer 1996 and Thomasson 2003b). \nOne possible antirealist solution to this problem—although not\none that Russellians themselves have promoted—is to invoke a\nkind of fictionalism about fictional characters. On this strategy,\nsentences like (4) and (5) should be thought of as implicitly prefixed\nby another intensional “in the fiction” operator,\nso that even in this case the impression of reference to a fictional\nentity would turn out to be baseless. In cases of this type, the\noperator would appeal not to a story but rather to the realist\npresumption that such an impression seems to support. The suggestion,\nthen, is that external metafictional sentences are to be read as\nimplicitly prefixed by an operator like “according to the\nfiction of realism” or “according to the realist’s\nhypothesis”: \nOnce external metafictional sentences are read this way, any apparent\ncommitment to fictional entities seems to disappear, provided once\nagain that the resulting complex sentences are read de dicto\n(for such a move, see Brock 2002, Phillips 2000). \nThe appeal to intensional “in the fiction” operators is a\nwell-known strategy for dealing with the apparent truth of statements\nlike\n (6),\n and because it is available to Russell this may seem like good news\nfor Russell’s antirealism, especially given the way the strategy\nmight be extended to external meta-fictional statements like\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n But such an amended version of Russellianism faces a problem already\nfaced by the unamended version of Russell’s view. If such a\nRussellianism is to provide the correct analysis of sentences like\n(6), one has to assume that proper names are synonymous with definite\ndescriptions. This is because the strategy used in arriving at a\nsentence like (6IR) involves replacing a proper name\n(“Apollo”) with an equivalent definite description\n(“the sun-god”). But there are well-known, and widely\naccepted, arguments against such a descriptivist view of proper names\n(Donnellan 1972, Kripke 1972 [1980], 2013). In particular,\ndescriptions of the sort that speakers or communities standardly\nassociate with a name might simply fail to fit what the name really\nrefers to (in the actual world and relative to other possible worlds).\nOne response to this objection as far as fictional names like\n“Apollo”, “Holmes”, etc., are concerned is to\nreject descriptivism about ordinary names but endorse it for fictional\nnames (see, for example, Currie 1990: 158–162). On the surface,\nhowever, this looks like an unpromising move: for one thing, it is\npossible to attempt to engage in conversation about Apollo, believing\nhe is real, before coming to the realization that he is merely a\nmythological figure, a possibility that is hard to explain if ordinary\nnames and fictional names have entirely different sorts of\nmeanings. \nThis descriptivist problem presents itself as a potential challenge to\nany antirealist view that endorses a de dicto reading of\nsentences like\n (6I)\n and\n (4F)\n /\n (5F).\n For how else, if not in terms of some kind of descriptivist view of\nnames like Russell’s, are we to understand such de\ndicto readings? If names are instead taken to be directly\nreferential—that is, if they are taken to be terms that do not\nsecure their reference by means of descriptive meanings—there\nseems to be no room left for a de dicto as opposed to a\nde re reading of such sentences, and, consequently, no room\nfor the thought that sentences containing (allegedly) empty names like\n“Apollo” even have truth-conditions. \nA particularly stark form of this dilemma is faced by what is perhaps\nthe most widely accepted post-Kripkean alternative to descriptivism,\nnamely Millianism, which holds that what a name contributes\nsemantically to the propositions expressed through the use of\nsentences containing the name is just the name’s referent. The\ncombination of Millianism and the antirealist view that fictional\nnames like “Apollo” lack reference (and so make no\ncontribution to the expression of propositions) appears to imply that\nsentences like\n (6I)\n don’t express any proposition, let alone true propositions.\nThere is now a lively industry devoted to finding Millianism-friendly\nsolutions to this quandary. Some Millians argue that what we see as\nmeaningful and even true concerns what is implicated rather than\nsemantically expressed by such sentences (e.g., Taylor 2000). Others\nappeal to gappy or unfilled propositions. These are proposition-like\nentities expressed by sentences containing empty names that can fail\nto be true because of the gaps (see Braun 1993, 2005; Adams et al.\n1997). Both Braun and Adams et al. argue that such gappiness\ndoesn’t prevent internal metafictional sentences such as\n“In the Holmes stories, Holmes is a detective” from\nexpressing truths. But they disagree about external metafictional\nsentences like “Holmes is a fictional character”, with\nAdams et al. insisting that these too can be true despite the names\nbeing non-referring, and Braun (2005) arguing that such statements\ncall for a creationist position on which the names in such sentences\nrefer to genuine, created fictional entities. \nMillians are not the only ones to have grappled with the implications\nthat the Kripke-Donnellan attack on descriptivism has for the\nsemantics of fictional names. Michael Devitt, for example, another\nearly critic of descriptivism, has used the problem of fictional and\nother empty names to argue against Millianism and in favor of his\nversion of a causal-historical theory of reference (cf. Devitt 1989).\nAnd Mark Sainsbury argues in Sainsbury 2005 that names, including\nfictional names, have singular but non-descriptive meanings that can\nbe specified in a Davidson-style truth theory whose background logic\nis a Negative Free Logic (that is, a logic that counts simple or\natomic sentences containing empty names as false). Given the role\nassigned to Negative Free Logic, it is scarcely surprising that the\ngreatest challenge for such a framework is again the problem of\nexternal metafictional sentences such as\n (4): \nThe latter has the appearance of an atomic sentence and so should,\nimplausibly, count as false on such a logic. In Sainsbury 2009 and\n2010, Sainsbury uses the idea of presupposition- / acceptance-relative\ntruth to deal with such problems, an idea that is related to ideas\nfound in the popular pretense-theoretic approach to fictional names.\nThat is the approach we turn to next. \nFor the antirealist, the semantics of names presents an important\nhurdle to attempts to accommodate the truth of internal and external\nmetafictional sentences featuring fictional names. Such difficulties\nhave suggested the need to look in a completely different direction.\nAs we saw before, it is important to acknowledge the role of pretense\nin fictional talk and writing. A fictional sentence has a conniving\nuse when it is uttered within the context of a certain pretense\ninvolving the telling of a story. Call such a context a\nfictional context. Note that a sentence considered as uttered\nin such a context does in a sense carry ontological commitments: it\ncarries pretend ontological commitments. For within the\ncontext of the relevant pretense, the singular terms involved do refer\nto things. For instance, to utter\n (6)\n in the context of telling the Greek myth is to utter a sentence in\nwhich, from the perspective of the relevant pretense, the name\n“Apollo” refers to a god. Consequently, the sentence has\nfictional truth-conditions in that context (the sentence is\ntrue in the world of that context just if the entity referred to as\n“Apollo” in that context is young in that world) and has\nalso a fictional truth-value (considered as uttered in that\ncontext, the sentence is true, for in the world of that\ncontext—the world of the Greek myth—there is a god,\nApollo, who is indeed young). Outside that context,\nhowever—that is, in a real context where there is no\npretense that the Greek myth is fact—a name like\n“Apollo” refers to nothing. No endorsement of\ndescriptivism is here required. Quite simply, if the singular terms in\nquestion are directly referential (currently the most popular view of\nnames), then a sentence containing a fictional proper name\nwill have no real truth-conditions, hence no real truth-value, since\nany such term is really empty. Take the case of “Apollo”,\nwhich on this view has no referent when uttered in a real,\nnon-fictional context of utterance. Assuming it is a directly\nreferential term, it makes no truth-conditional contribution to\nsentences that contain it. Hence, when uttered in a real context (6)\nwill have no truth-conditions, hence no truth-value. (The kernel of\nthis proposal is in Walton 1990; see Recanati 2000 and Everett 2013\nfor refinements.) \nSo far, so good. Remember, however, that the intuition that a sentence\nlike\n (6)\n is really, not just fictionally, true—hence, that it has real,\nnot just fictional, truth-conditions—is a powerful one. How can\na pretense antirealist account for this intuition? \nAs a first attempt, a pretense antirealist may try to combine the\nvirtues of the pretense account with the virtues of the intensionalist\napproach. That is, she may first stick to the idea that on its\nnon-conniving use a sentence like (6) has to be taken as elliptical\nfor an internal metafictional sentence like\n (6I).\n But she may also insist that the “according to the story”\noperator should be taken as a context-shifting operator, not\nsimply (like the familiar intensional operator “It is necessary\nthat”) as a circumstance-shifting operator. That is, she may\ninsist that it is an operator that shifts not only the circumstances\nof evaluation of the sentence it embeds, but also the context relevant\nfor the interpretation of such sentence—typically, the context\nof its utterance. More precisely, if we take a fictional sentence\n“p” on its non-conniving use as elliptical for\n“According to the story S, p”, then\n“p” so understood is true in the actual world if\nand only if “p”, taken as uttered in the context of\nthe story S (that is, a fictional context), is true in the\nworld of that context. \nThe antirealist merits of this account are clear. It allows a proper\nname like “Apollo” to be both genuinely empty, carrying no\ncommitment to any fictional entity, but also genuinely\nnon-descriptive. The embedded sentence containing the name ((6), say)\nis understood as being uttered in a fictional context, and in that\ncontext the name directly refers to an individual, the individual\nexisting in the world of the relevant pretense. Since this reference\noccurs only in that fictional context, not in a real context, the name\nreally does remain empty. (This proposal can be traced back to Walton\n1990; see also Adams et al. 1997.) \nDespite these virtues, the suggestion faces a well-known criticism.\nKaplan calls such context-shifting operators ‘monsters’,\nand claims that “none can be expressed in English (without\nsneaking in a quotation device)” (1989a: 511). In the case of\nindexicals, for example, “no operator can control … the\nindexicals within its scope, because they will simply leap out of its\nscope to the front of the operator” (1989a: 510). To see how\nthis worry applies to a fictional sentence containing an indexical,\nconsider the famous first line of Proust’s In Search of Lost\nTime: \nWithin the fictional context mobilized by Proust’s telling his\nstory, the first person pronoun “I” refers to the person\nnarrating the events that constitute the imaginary world of\nProust’s Recherche—an individual who exists only\nin that world, not the actual world. Now, suppose we want to capture\nthe sense in which (9) is really true by reporting that the claim\nexpressed by (9) is true according to In Search of Lost Time.\nOn the above pretense-intensionalist approach, we might formulate this\nsuggestion as: \nHowever, this equivalence clearly does not work. Assuming that you are\nthe person who utters (9PI), the sentence says that you used to go to\nbed early for a long time in the imaginary world of Proust’s\nRecherche. But this is false, since you are not an inhabitant\nof this world. \nIt may be possible to obviate Kaplan’s problem in some way, for\ninstance by claiming that the context-shift affects the whole\nsentence, not just the embedded one (Recanati 2000); but then one has\nto show how such sentences may nonetheless have real truth-conditions,\nand not merely fictional ones. Or the problem may turn out to be\nrestricted to the case of embedded indexicals, or even certain types\nof indexicals. Predelli, for example, has argued that there are\nexamples of discourse about fiction using modal and temporal\nindexicals that are best analyzed in terms of such context-shifting\nKaplanesque ‘monsters’ (Predelli 2008). \nBe that as it may, one might try to simplify the pretense-theoretical\nproposal by reversing the order of explanation. Rather than taking the\nfictional sentence on its non-conniving use as elliptical for an\ninternal metafictional sentence, we might take the internal\nmetafictional sentence to be really true just when the fictional\nsentence (on its non-conniving use) is really true. We might, that is,\nfollow Walton in treating the fictional sentence as\n“primary”; cf. 1990: 401–2). It is in fact\nrelatively easy to discern the sense in which the fictional sentence\non its non-conniving use is really true. It is really true just in\ncase there is a pretense of a certain kind relative to which the\nsentence on its conniving use is fictionally true. In short, the\nfictional sentence is really true on its non-conniving use if and only\nif it is fictionally true (for this formulation, see Crimmins 1998:\n2–8). (Walton’s 1990 own formulation of the point is\nweaker, for it gives the proposal a pragmatic twist: by being\nfictionally true, a sentence may be taken to assert, or to\nconvey, a real truth. See also Everett 2013.) \nOne advantage of such an antirealist move is that it can be used for\nboth fictional sentences and external metafictional sentences. For\nWalton, what distinguishes the two cases is simply the kind of\npretense that makes the relevant sentence fictionally true. In the\nformer case, the game of make-believe that the relevant fictional\ncontext singles out is an authorized one; that is, it is a\ngame authorized by what serves as a prop in that game (in the case of\na literary game of make-believe, the text written or narrated by the\nstoryteller); the prop dictates how things go in the world of that\ngame. In the latter case, the relevant game of make-believe is an\nunofficial, albeit standard, one (1990: 417); in this case,\nthere may be no constraints—none, at least, provided by the\nprop—that dictate how things stand in the world of that game\n(cf. Walton 1990: 51, 406, 409). \nTake\n (6)\n again. In order for (6) to be fictionally true, and hence for it to\nbe really true on its non-conniving use, the world of the Greek myth\nmust contain a god (Apollo) who is young. This is a consequence of the\nfact that this is the way the myth is told. The myth-telling functions\nas a prop constraining how the “Apollo” game of\nmake-believe has to be played; a person who makes believe that Apollo\nis a rock-star is not playing the game correctly, or is perhaps\nplaying another game. But now consider\n (4).\n In order for an utterance of (4) to be fictionally true, hence for it\nto be really true on its non-conniving use, it must allude to a game\nin which there is a fictional character named “Mickey\nMouse” who has the special property of being a pop culture\nicon—a ‘Meinongian’ pretense, as Recanati\n(2000) calls it. Now, such a game is not constrained by any text;\nthere is no Mickey Mouse story that describes Mickey Mouse in these\nterms. The game in question is instead one where facts about the\nimportant place occupied in popular culture by the Mickey Mouse\nstories are what make it fictionally true in the game that Mickey\nMouse has the special property of being a pop culture icon.\nTo that extent the game is an unofficial one. \nOn this account, then, external metafictional sentences enjoy no\nspecial status; in particular, they don’t provide us with a\nreason for assuming the existence of fictional entities. Our final\nexample returns us to Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search\nof an Author. Consider an utterance of: \nOn the one hand, this is an external metafictional sentence of the\nvery same kind as (5), a sentence that the speaker uses to describe\nthe metaphysical status of one of the protagonists of\nPirandello’s work. On the other hand, (10) may also be taken as\na fictional sentence, since Pirandello’s play is characterized\nby the fact that its protagonists are not ordinary concrete\nindividuals but fictional characters. In such a case, the sentence has\ntwo distinct non-conniving uses. On its use as a fictional sentence it\nis allegedly equivalent to: \nIn this case,\n (10)\n is really true in so far as it is fictionally true relative to a game\nauthorized by the work Six Characters in Search of an Author.\nIn the other case, it is really true in so far as it is fictionally\ntrue relative to an unofficial game in which some entities count as\n‘real people’ and some as ‘fictional\ncharacters’, with the Father correctly singled out as one of the\nlatter because ‘he’ originated in a work of fiction. \nWalton’s pretense-based version of antirealism has been very\ninfluential (for a development of the view, see Everett 2013), but it\nhas also attracted a great deal of criticism. Some have doubted that a\nsentence’s fictional truth on its conniving use can ground a\nsense in which it is really true on its non-conniving use (cf.\nVoltolini 2006), a move that is crucial to his antirealism. Others\nhave doubted that Walton’s appeal to unofficial games of\nmake-believe can yield appropriate antirealist paraphrases for\nmetafictional sentences in general, perhaps because these critics deny\nthat such sentences involve either explicit or implicit appeals to\npretense (Thomasson 1999, van Inwagen 2003). \nOf course, to show that some antirealist paraphrases of\nfictional sentences do not work does not mean that no such\nparaphrases will work. Perhaps it is always possible to find new\nparaphrases that do not raise any of the problems hitherto pointed\nout, whether such paraphrases are based on a new version of the\npretense-theoretic approach or on some other approach. To take this\npoint into account, some realists have pursued a different\nlinguistically-based strategy. To be, as Quine said, is to be the\nvalue of a variable (Quine 1948). Hence if we can locate existentially\nquantified discourse involving quantification over fictional\nentities—either directly, as external metafictional sentences\nthat can themselves be used as premises to derive other metafictional\nsentences, or indirectly, as a result of a valid inference from\nexternal metafictional sentences—then it seems that such\nontological commitment is unavoidable. In this connection, consider\nthe sentence: \nNot only can such a sentence be inferred from, say: \nbut it also legitimizes an inference to: \n(cf. van Inwagen 2000: 243–4). \nNow, it is certainly true that insisting on the need to preserve the\nvalidity of the above inferences in any account of external\nmetafictional sentences is a good antidote to the antirealist\n‘paraphrase’ strategy. For there is no guarantee that\nvalidity is preserved once the above sentences are paraphrased (say,\nin a pretense-theoretic manner à la Walton). This\nsuggests that such antirealist paraphrases may not capture the meaning\nof the original sentences, leaving the field to realist construals of\nsuch sentences (cf. again van Inwagen (ibid.); for\nWalton’s response, see Walton 1990: 416ff.). \nStill, this may not be enough to show that antirealism should be\nrejected. For while existential sentences like (11) that quantify over\nfictional characters are common enough, there are other existential\nclaims with the same logical features as (11) that philosophers are\nfar less likely to take as evidence of realism. Thus consider: \nThis sentence is suggested by Nathan Salmon’s account of\nallegedly empty names in Salmon 1998. Salmon suggests that while\nfictional names in general stand for abstract created fictional\nentities, certain other terms are thoroughly non-referring or empty.\nIn this connection, he contemplates the possibility of there being an\narmed fanatic who has just taken over the government of France by\ndeclaring himself emperor, and then stipulates that the name\n“Nappy” is to refer to whoever is the present emperor of\nFrance if there is such a person (as there would be if this\nimaginative scenario were actual), and to nothing if there\nisn’t. Such a name, he thinks, is clearly empty. Note, however,\nthat in Salmon’s imaginative scenario, \nis true, but that there is no similar scenario involving a present\nemperor of Canada. A sentence like\n (14)\n is a natural way of recording this fact. But now we face a problem.\nAs Caplan (2004) points out, taking\n (11)\n as an evidence for the genuine existence of what van Inwagen calls\ncreatures of fiction suggests that we should, by parity of\nreasoning, take (14) as evidence for the genuine existence of sui\ngeneris creatures of the imagination. Or, to put the point the\nother way round, if we don’t think that linguistically-based\nreasons such as the availability of an (apparently) true quantified\nsentence like (14) commit us to bizarre entities like Nappy, we should\nnot think that such reasons commit us to fictional entities either.\nFor variants of the problem and complications, see Kroon (2011, 2013,\n2015). \nNote that we do not even need quantificational locutions to see the\nproblem. If one thinks that the truth of the external metafictional\nsentence (5) commits us to the existence of a fictional character,\nAnna Karenina, then it is hard to resist the thought that the truth of\nthe non-quantified sentence: \nuttered by someone who wants to describe the mistake made by those\naround him who think that they see a little green man, similarly\ncommits us to the existence of a certain creature of the imagination,\none who has the property of being a trick of the light (cf.\nKroon 1996: 186). Many would resist such an easy road to realism about\ncreatures of the imagination. \nThe problems that one thus encounters in trying to let\nsemantic-linguistic arguments ground a commitment to fictional objects\ngive one reason to think that there is no semantical shortcut\navailable to the realist. That is to say, if a realist wants to claim\nthat our prima facie commitment to fictional entities is\njustified, she has to provide a genuine ontological argument to that\neffect. \nIn her 1999 book, Thomasson tried to provide just such an argument.\nHer argument claims that we cannot reject fictional objects if we\nadmit fictional works: given that fictional objects and fictional\nworks belong to the same genus of entities (the genus of created,\nartifactual objects) it would be false parsimony to accept the one and\nreject the other. \nThis argument has several problems. For one thing, it postulates an\nidentity of kind between fictional works and fictional entities that\nis far from intuitively clear. As Thomasson herself seems to admit\n(1999: 65), fictional works are syntactical-semantic entities, unlike\nfictional entities. But there is a similar argument that does not rely\non a parallelism between fictional works and fictional characters, but\non the fact that the identity conditions of the fictional works refer\nto fictional characters. In brief: if we admit a certain kind of\nentity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that\nfigure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit\nfictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because\nthey figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf.\nVoltolini 2003, 2006). \nIf the antirealist wants to challenge the realist on directly\nontological grounds, she has to discredit such arguments, and, better\nstill, provide an argument for the conclusion that there\ncannot be any fictional entities. Curiously enough, Russell,\nwho is usually remembered for having originated the\n‘paraphrase’ strategy for eliminating apparent reference\nto nonexistent entities (see 2.1.1 above), also used non-linguistically-based ontological\narguments against admitting such entities. In fact, there is good\nreason to believe that he took his main argument against\nMeinong to be that Meinongian entities are apt to violate the law of\nnoncontradiction (cf. Russell 1905a,b). In his 2005 and 2013 works,\nEverett reprises and extends Russell’s ontological criticisms so\nthat they become a critique of fictional entities in particular. He\nprovides a number of arguments that are intended to show that, first,\nsuch entities may violate some basic logical laws—not only the\nlaw of noncontradiction, but also the symmetry of identity—and,\nsecond, they may be problematically indeterminate with respect to both\ntheir existence and identity. These arguments are based on odd but\nintelligible stories in which, for example, one individual is both\nidentical to and distinct from another, or in which it is\nindeterminate whether a certain individual exists. The link to\nfictional characters is provided through the bridging principles (more\nrefined versions of such principles are provided in his 2013): \nEverett’s line of attack is interesting and innovative, and\n(given the worries expressed about language-focused arguments) in some\nways a model of how an antirealist should really pursue the battle\nagainst what she believes are ontological illusions. But the debate is\nnot likely to end there. Although at least one influential (erstwhile)\nrealist has conceded the power of Everett’s argument, proposing\nan antirealist notion of assumption-relative truth (Howell 2011, 2015)\nin place of the realist absolute notion he championed earlier (Howell\n1979), other realists are likely to think that Everett underestimates\nthe conceptual resources available to them. One may, for example,\nthink that the bridging principles as stated are too simple to be\napplied across the board, and that they can be precisified in a way\nthat is no longer ontologically problematic (Thomasson 2010). Or one\nmay say that a distinction between ontic indeterminacy in a\nstory and ontic indeterminacy with respect to, or\nout of, a story allows one to rebut the\nindeterminacy part of the critique (cf. Schneider & von Solodkoff\n2009 and Voltolini 2010). Alternatively, one may be able to rebut the\ncritique in its entirety by appealing to more or less familiar\nneo-Meinongian distinctions between (i) predicative and propositional\nnegation and (ii) modes of predication (alternatively, kinds of\nproperty) (cf. Voltolini 2010). Of course, antirealists take such\ndistinctions to be poorly understood and part of what makes realism an\nunattractive option in the first place (in addition, they may unusable\nin complex fiction-involving sentences (see again Everett 2013; for a\nreply, cf. Voltolini 2015b)), so even if such rebuttals are successful\non their own terms this is not likely to settle the\nrealism-antirealism debate.","contact.mail":"f.kroon@auckland.ac.nz","contact.domain":"auckland.ac.nz"},{"date.published":"2018-11-06","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictional-entities/","author1":"Fred Kroon","author1.info":"http://artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/staff/?UPI=fkro002","author2.info":"http://www.lettere.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=avoltoli","entry":"fictional-entities","body.text":"\n\n\nPhilosophical issues surrounding fiction have attracted increasing\nattention from philosophers over the past few decades. What follows is\na discussion of one familiar and quite fundamental topic in this area:\nfictional entities (both the issue of what such entities might be like\nand whether there really are such entities).\n\n\nA familiar characteristic of works of fiction is that they feature\nfictional characters: individuals whose exploits are written about in\nworks of fiction and who make their first appearance in a work of\nfiction. Shakespeare’s Hamlet, for example, features\nthe fictional character Hamlet, Doyle’s The Hound of the\nBaskervilles features Sherlock Holmes, Tolstoy’s Anna\nKarenina features Anna Karenina, and so on. All of these works\nfeature numerous other fictional characters, of course (Ophelia and Dr\nWatson, for example); indeed, some works of fiction are characterized\nby the sheer abundance of their characters (Russian novels are often\nsaid to have this characteristic). Fictional characters belong to the\nclass of entities variously known as fictional entities or\nfictional objects or ficta, a class that includes\nnot just animate objects of fiction (fictional persons, animals,\nmonsters, and so on) but also inanimate objects of fiction such as\nfictional places (Anthony Trollope’s cathedral town of\nBarchester and Tolkien’s home of the elves, Rivendell, for\nexample). As stated, however, it doesn’t include entities\nlocated in the real world, although real entities do have an important\nrole to play in works of fiction. Thus, neither London nor Napoleon\nare fictional entities, although the first is the quite essential\nbackdrop to what goes on in the Holmes stories while the second plays\nan important role in the events described in War and Peace.\n(While London and Napoleon are not fictional entities, some have\nthought that the London of the Holmes stories and the Napoleon of\nWar and Peace should be classed as special fictional\nentities. This view has recently gained some popularity: cf. Landini\n1990, Bonomi 2008, Voltolini 2006, 2013, Motoarca 2014.)\n\n\nThe above characterization suggests that fictional entities constitute\na special type of entity. Not surprisingly, then, one fundamental\nphilosophical question we can ask about fictional entities is a\nquestion about their nature: what kind of thing is a\nfictional entity? This question is separate from what seems an even\nmore fundamental question: why suppose that there are any\nfictional entities in the first place? After all, our world never\ncontained a Sherlock Holmes or a Rivendell—these alleged\nentities make their appearance in works of fiction, not works\nof fact. Following the division in Thomasson 1999, we shall\ncall the first question the metaphysical question, and the\nsecond the ontological question.\n\nAs Thomasson (1999: 5) puts it, the first question amounts to asking:\nwhat would fictional entities be, if there were any? To this question\ndifferent answers have been proposed. But however much they differ,\nthey all try to accommodate in some way or other what seems to be an\nintuitive datum facing philosophers who theorize about fictional\nentities: these entities lack existence, or at least existence as\nordinary physical objects. According to this datum—call it\nthe nonexistence datum—paradigmatic objects of fiction\nlike Hamlet and Holmes do not exist. In support of this datum, note\nthat the layperson would almost certainly answer “No” to\nthe question of whether such objects exist, although she might qualify\nthis answer by adding “there is at least some sense in which\nthey don’t.” We also appeal to nonexistence in this sense\nwhen we want to dispute the view that some alleged individual is a\ngenuine historical figure; we might say, for example, that King Arthur\ndoes not exist, thereby underlining our view that a search for a\nhistorical King Arthur would be in vain. \nThose who do not believe that there are any fictional entities\n(fictional antirealists, as we shall call them) will claim\nthat the nonexistence datum has an ontological reading only:\nto say that fictional entities do not exist amounts to saying that in\nthe overall domain of what there is there are no such things as\nfictional entities. As they see it, fictional realists (those\nwho do believe that there are fictional entities) are the only ones to\ngive the datum a certain metaphysical reading, namely that\nfictional entities have the property of not existing (in some\nsense or other). They might also insist that fictional realists are\nthe only ones to think that the nonexistence of fictional entities is\ndetermined by their nature as fictional entities. But this overstates\nthe case. Because they hold that there are no such things as fictional\nentities, even antirealists are likely to admit that the fact that\nthere is no such thing as some alleged entity X follows from\nthe fact that X has been shown to be fictional. That is what\nhappened in the case of King Arthur and many other legendary or\nmythological entities (fictional entities in the broad sense). People\noriginally supposed (cf. Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia\nRegum Britanniae) that King Arthur was a real person, a British\nleader who ruled England after the departure of the Romans, until it\nwas discovered that King Arthur is merely a figure of legend, a\nfictional entity. It was this discovery that licensed the conclusion\nthat King Arthur doesn’t exist. So it seems that even\nantirealists have a stake in the answer to the metaphysical question\n“What would it take for something to be a fictional\nentity?” \nOne further comment about the nonexistence datum before we turn to\nvarious accounts of fictional objects and the ways in which such\naccounts cope with the datum. As we have already seen, it is natural\nwhen discussing the datum to use quantifiers such as “Some\nthings are …” (“There are things that are\n…”), and “Everything is…”, whose\ndomain appears to include both existent and nonexistent objects. We do\nso when we say, for example, that there are objects, such as\nfictional objects, that don’t exist. Fictional antirealists will\ntake such talk with a grain of salt, since they do not acknowledge a\nsense in which there really are any fictional objects. Fictional\nrealists, on the other hand, will think that a sentence like\n“There are objects, among them Hamlet and Holmes, that\ndon’t exist” is either literally true or at least it\nconveys a truth. They typically acknowledge a distinction between\nunrestricted quantifiers, whose domain includes even nonexistent\nobjects, and restricted quantifiers, whose domain includes only\nexistent objects (cf., e.g., Berto 2013). \nOne way to account for the nonexistence datum is the possibilist\ntheory of fictional entities, which holds that fictional entities\ndo not exist in the actual world but only in some other\npossible worlds. In this respect, fictional entities are thought to be\nlike other merely possible entities such as talking donkeys. According\nto standard versions of the possible worlds framework, some things not\npresent at the actual world exist as talking donkeys at some merely\npossible worlds. Similarly, the possibilist theory holds that Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist in the actual world, although he does exist at\nsome merely possible worlds: worlds in which the Holmes stories are\nfact. \nSuch a possibilist theory is faced with a problem of ontological\nindeterminacy. For there is more than one possible world in which\nConan Doyle’s Holmes stories are fact, and in which there is a\nwitty, cocaine-addicted detective called “Holmes” who\nlives at 221B Baker St., has a friend called “Watson”, and\ndoes the things recorded of him in the Holmes stories. Not all of\nthese Holmes-candidates are the same; while they all match each other\nin terms of what the stories say about Holmes, they may be very\ndifferent in other crucial ways—they may have had very different\nchildhoods, including different parents, and so on. (Indeed, when\ncharacters are underdescribed in a story, a single possible world may\ncontain many individuals who fit exactly what the story says about the\ncharacter.) We can now ask: which of these different witty,\ncocaine-addicted detectives is Holmes? (cf. Kaplan 1973: 505–6;\nKripke 1972 [1980: 156–8]). There seems to be no principled way\nof deciding. \nKripke suggests that this indeterminacy shows that none of these\npossible entities is Holmes, “[f]or if so, which one?”\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 157–8]). But suppose, for argument’s\nsake, that this indeterminacy could somehow be resolved, perhaps by\nthe story including details of certain properties that, arguably, only\nHolmes could have, such as his being the only person to have\noriginated from certain gametes. Even in that case, there would be\nstrong reason not to identify Holmes with a merely possible entity.\nTake a different case, that of the mythical sword Excalibur extracted\nfrom a rock by King Arthur. As everyone knows, this sword does not\nexist. Its nonexistence would not be threatened by someone’s\ndiscovering an object with all the properties that the Breton cycle\nascribes to Excalibur. No matter how similar, an actual object that\nresembles a fictional object would not be that fictional object\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 157–8]). Now, moving from the actual world\nto merely possible worlds does not change things: why should Excalibur\nbe identified even with a merely possible entity? Had a\nmerely possible entity exactly matching Excalibur in its properties\nbeen actual, it would not have been the fictional Excalibur, by the\nKripkean argument rehearsed above. So how are things different if this\nmerely possible Excalibur-like sword remains merely possible? In a\nnutshell, if there is a gap between fiction and reality, there is also\na gap between fiction and possibility. \nThese difficulties for possibilism do not equally affect all versions\nof the doctrine. Consider David Lewis’s version of the doctrine,\nwhich is embedded in his realist account of possible objects (Lewis\n1986). Roughly speaking, Lewis takes a possible individual to be a\nHolmes-candidate if it has Holmes’s properties in a possible\nworld in which the Holmes stories are told as known fact (Lewis 1978).\nFor Lewis, each such individual is a part of one world and not part of\nany other world (possible individuals are in a sense\n‘world-bound’ on Lewis’s view); no Holmes-candidate\nis therefore identical to any other Holmes-candidate. But unlike more\ndoctrinaire possibilists, Lewis can use his counterpart theory (Lewis\n1986) to offer a principled way of counting each such Holmes-candidate\nas being Holmes. Suppose you are a reader of the Holmes stories. Each\nHolmes-candidate is a counterpart for you of every other\nHolmes-candidate. For even if they should differ substantially in\nterms of overall qualitative similarity, the various Holmes-candidates\nare all counterparts by acquaintance for you (or, as Lewis\nseems to have thought, for your community of\nfellow-readers)—they are all, in their respective worlds, the\nperson called “Holmes” whom you or your community (or\nrather, your counterparts) learn about by reading the Holmes stories,\ntold as known fact (cf. Lewis 1983b; Currie 1990: 137–9; Kroon 1994). In short, the fact\nthat there are so many distinct Holmes-candidates is less embarrassing\nfor Lewis than it is for other possibilists. (See also the suggestion\nin Sainsbury 2010 (pp. 82–3) that Lewis could have accommodated\na plurality of possible Holmes-candidates by refusing to identify\nHolmes with any of them, instead modeling the relation between talk of\nHolmes and talk of these possible Holmes-candidates on the model of\nthe notion of precisification used in Lewis’s semantics of\nvagueness.) \nLewis’s counterpart theory is not widely accepted, however. In\ngeneral, Kripkean objections against possibilism about fictional\nentities have been more influential. Some have argued, however, that\nsuch objections only succeed if we use a ‘variable domain’\nconception of what there is to quantify over at any particular world,\na conception that allows the set of objects available at one world to\ndiffer from the set of objects available at another world\n(Kripke’s preferred semantics for modal logic is of this kind.)\nSuppose instead that one adopts a version of a ‘fixed\ndomain’ conception of quantification on which one has a\nfictional individual at one’s disposal as a nonexistent entity\nin the actual world and as an existent entity in other possible worlds\n(Priest 2005, Berto 2011). If so, the indeterminacy problem may not\narise. As Priest (2005: 119–20) puts it, we first of all have\nDoyle’s conception of Sherlock Holmes; this Sherlock\nHolmes—the Holmes that Doyle conceives of—is an individual\nin the actual world but it does not exist there; it exists\nonly in other worlds. For Priest, then, Doyle doesn’t\narbitrarily pick one Holmes candidate from among all possible Holmes\ncandidates, each located in its own possible world. Rather, Doyle\nintends a particular individual that does not exist in the\nactual world but which instead realizes the Holmes stories in some\nother possible worlds. Trivially, this individual is Holmes. (Doyle\nmanages this even though the actual world contains many other possible\nindividuals that don’t exist there but realize the Holmes\nstories in other possible worlds (Priest 2005: 93–4).) Of\ncourse, one might still wonder how it is that Doyle is acquainted with\nthis individual via the intentionality of his thought, as Priest\nclaims, rather than with any of the other Holmes candidates. Is\nauthorial intending a creative act, perhaps, one that first\nbrings it about that there is an object of the right kind, as\nThomasson (1999: 90) suggests? All the indications are that Priest\nrejects such a view: “an act of pure intention can intend an\nobject even when there are other indiscriminable objects” (2005:\n142). \nSuch a possibilism also faces another problem. For Priest, as for\nother possibilists, fictional entities do not actually\npossess the properties in terms of which they are characterized in the\nrelevant stories; they only have these properties in (some of) the\nworlds in which they exist. Sherlock Holmes, for instance, is not\nactually a detective since he does not exist. Rather, Holmes is only\npossibly a detective; he is only a detective in possible\nworlds in which he exists. (Note that he is not a detective in\nall the worlds in which he exists, since it is presumably a\ntruth about Holmes that he might not have had the career that he ended\nup with; in some possible worlds, Holmes therefore exists without\nbeing a detective.) Now, it is admittedly strange to say that a\nfictional object like Holmes is a detective in the very same sense in\nwhich, say, a certain actual member of the New York police force is a\ndetective. But retreating to the possibilist view that Holmes has such\nproperties only in merely possible worlds carries its own costs; for\none thing, it seems to underestimate the role of the actual world in\nvarious familiar relational claims we can make about fictional\nobjects. Consider cases in which we compare such objects with actual\nconcrete individuals. Suppose we say: \nWe seem to be saying that Holmes actually has such\ncomparative features, that is, has them in the actual world, not\nmerely in some possible world or other. Suppose that we read (1)\ninstead as saying, à la Priest: \n(More precisely, relative to worlds in which Holmes is as he is\ndescribed to be in the Holmes stories, Holmes has a greater degree of\ncleverness than that possessed by any detective in the actual world;\ncf. Priest 2005: 123.) But no such cross-world way of reading (1)\nmatches the way we would read any other sentence involving a\ncomparison between individuals. Take: \nIt would clearly be incorrect to read (2) as: \n(say, in the sense that, relative to worlds in which Stalin fits the\northodox account of his activities, Stalin is crueler than any other\ndictator in the actual world). (2) is intended to be a substantive\nclaim about how Stalin actually was, not a claim about how he might\nhave been. In addition, a possibilist reading like (1P) makes it hard\nto make sense of the attitudes we hold towards fictional characters\n(Kroon 2008: 201, 2012). Our belief in Holmes’s great cleverness\nexplains our admiration for Holmes, just as our belief in Anna\nKarenina’s suffering explains our pity for Anna Karenina. It is\nhard to see how our belief in Holmes’s possible\ncleverness could do this. In reply, Priest has insisted that this is\nprecisely how we should understand such claims: Holmes is admired for\nthe things he does in the Holmes worlds, while a real individual such\nas Mandela is admired for what he actually did (2016: 217). But this\nseems to beg the question. Surely the mere fact that there are\npossible worlds in which Stalin dedicates his life to rescuing\nmigrants from death in the Mediterranean sea, say, does not make him\nworthy of admiration in the actual world, although it may make him an\nobject of admiration to people in these other worlds. Why should it be\nany different with Holmes? \nThe next approach to fictional entities to be discussed (the (neo-)\nMeinongian approach) is able to avoid such problems. But before we\ndescribe this approach, we should note that Priest himself subscribes\nto a broader theory than possibilism. As many philosophers have noted,\nfictional narratives are often inconsistent. The Holmes stories, for\nexample, characterize Dr Watson as having a war wound on a single\nshoulder, variously given as his left and his right shoulder. Lewis\n(1983a: 277–8) suggests that, typically, impossible fictions can\nbe dealt with by invoking only possible worlds (on Lewis’s\npreferred view, both φ and not-φ can be true in such an\nimpossible fiction, but not their conjunction). But there are\ndifficulties with this suggestion when extended to certain deeply\nentrenched contradictions. Thus consider certain time-travel stories.\nPriest himself concocts a story that wouldn’t make sense unless\na particular fictional box—Sylvan’s box—was an\nimpossible object (Priest 2005: 125ff.). Philosophers like Priest\ninvoke impossible worlds to deal with such stories, and argue that\nsome fictional objects are impossible objects to the extent that the\nonly worlds in which the stories that characterize them are true are\nimpossible worlds. \nAccording to possibilism (perhaps extended to allow some fictional\nobjects to be impossible objects), fictional objects are just like\nactual objects, except that they exist only in various non-actual\nworlds. Like actual objects, they are determinate down to the last\ndetail in worlds in which they exist (so long as the stories that\ncharacterize them represent the world as being determinate down to the\nlast detail). This is so even if the stories do not themselves fill in\nthese details. For example, in worlds in which the Holmes stories are\ntrue, Holmes is left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous, even\nthough the stories themselves do not tell us which (all that is true\nin the Holmes stories is that, having hands, he is\none of these). \nThe view that fictional objects are Meinongian objects\nconstitutes a very different metaphysical option. Meinong (1904)\nthought that over and above the concrete entities that exist\nspatiotemporally and the ideal or abstract entities that exist\nnon-spatiotemporally, there are entities that neither exist\nspatiotemporally nor exist non-spatiotemporally: these are the\nparadigmatic Meinongian objects that lack any kind of being. Meinong\nhimself used “[mere] subsistence” (Bestehen) for\nthe non-spatiotemporal kind of being, reserving\n“existence” (Existenz) for the spatiotemporal\nkind. “Sein” was his word for the most general kind of\nbeing, which includes both subsistence and existence. We will continue\nto use ”exists” for the most general mode of being, i.e.,\nMeinong’s Sein. \nEven though Meinongian objects do not exist, they do have properties.\nIn particular, Meinong thought that their being such-and-so (their\nSosein) is independent of their being or Sein. These\nSosein-specifying properties, moreover, are precisely the\nproperties in terms of which the objects are descriptively given. This\nclaim is captured by the so-called Characterization\nPrinciple, whose explicit formulation is due to Routley (1980:\n46) but which is already implicit in Meinong 1904 (1960: 82).\nAccording to this Principle, objects, whether they exist or not, have\nthe properties in terms of which they are given or characterized;\nschematically, the thing that is characterized as being F is in\nfact F. Take, for instance, the golden mountain or the round\nsquare. The golden mountain does not exist, yet we can say that it is\nboth golden and a mountain since these are the properties in terms of\nwhich the object is characterized; similarly, the round square is both\nround and square, even though it cannot exist. \nIt is commonly assumed that for Meinong fictional objects are just a\nsubset of his Meinongian objects—they are Meinongian objects\nthat are given in terms of the properties they have in the stories\nthat feature them. Note that the problem for possibilism mentioned\ntowards the end of the last section disappears on this account. For,\nso conceived, fictional entities do in fact possess the properties in\nterms of which they are characterized in the relevant narratives:\nHolmes really does have a high degree of cleverness, higher, perhaps,\nthan that possessed by any actual detective, and so\n (1)\n might well be true. Note also that fictional entities so conceived\nare not completely determined with respect to their properties, unlike\nfictional entities conceived on the model of possibilism. Because\nConan Doyle’s stories are quiet on these matters, Holmes on the\nMeinongian model is not right-handed; nor is he left-handed; nor is he\nambidextrous. He does, however, have the property of being one of\nthese. (One caution. Although this is the usual understanding of\nMeinong’s conception of fictional objects, Meinong may not have\nendorsed it in precisely this form: his most complete account of\nfictional objects suggests that they are higher-order entities, that\nis, entities that are constructed out of simpler entities, in the same\nsense in which, for instance, a melody is an entity constructed out of\nits constituent sounds (cf. Raspa 2001 and Marek 2008 [2013]). \nModern versions of Meinongianism accept much of what Meinong has to\nsay on the topic of nonexistent objects, but depart from his account\nat various points. Suppose we restrict our attention to properties\nappropriate to physical, spatiotemporal objects (for example,\nbeing a mountain or being a detective). What we\nmight call orthodox neo-Meinongians (Parsons 1980, Routley\n1980, Jacquette 1996) maintain that Meinongian objects characterized\nin terms of such properties are concrete correlates of sets of such\nproperties (concrete in the sense that the objects have the properties\nin exactly the same sense as ordinary objects have the properties).\nCorresponding to a set S of such properties, there is a\nconcrete object that has (at least) the properties contained in\nS. Corresponding to {being golden, being a\nmountain}, for example, there is the golden mountain, which has\nthe properties of being a mountain and being golden\n(as well, perhaps, as all properties P such that necessarily,\nwhatever is a golden mountain is P). These properties\nconstitute the nature or essence of the golden mountain. But the\ngolden mountain also has other properties, in particular properties\nthat reflect its relationship to actual objects in the world\n(being often thought about by Meinong, for example). \nFictional objects can similarly be regarded as concrete correlates of\nsets of properties on such a view. Consider Holmes, a cocaine-addicted\ndetective who lives (lived) in London at 221B Baker Street, solves\nmany baffling crimes, has a friend called “Watson”, and so\non (where the “and so on” includes all the properties\nP such that it is true in the Holmes stories that Holmes has\nP). For orthodox neo-Meinongians, Holmes is a concrete, albeit\nnonexistent, correlate of the set having those properties as members.\n(An interesting variant of these neo-Meinongian views is\nCastañeda’s guise-theory, according to which an existent\nindividual is a bundle of guises—particulars formed\nfrom sets of properties by a special concretizing\noperation—related by a relation of consubstantiation.\nAn object like the golden mountain is a guise that is not\nconsubstantiated with any guise, not even itself, and so doesn’t\nexist. Castañeda takes fictional objects to be bundles of\nguises related by a special relation of consociation; see\nCastañeda 1989: ch.11.) \nWhile agreeing that fictional objects form a subset of Meinongian\nobjects, unorthodox neo-Meinongians (see especially Zalta\n1983) maintain that Meinongian objects in general should be conceived\nof as objects that have a non-spatiotemporal mode of existence, and\nhence as abstract rather than concrete objects. And while they agree\nwith the idea that for any collection of properties there is an\nindividual that has all these properties, they do not take Meinongian\nobjects to be correlates of sets of properties in anything like the\nway described by orthodox neo-Meinongians. Instead, they take them to\nbe something like generic objects or roles, along the model of\nPlatonic attributes. (Indeed, Zalta and others have used his theory to\nmodel a range of philosophical notions, including Platonic forms; see\nZalta 1983: 41–7, and Pelletier & Zalta 2000.) Consider the\ngolden mountain again. For unorthodox neo-Meinongians, this object is\nnot a mountain in the same sense that Mt Taranaki, for example, is a\nmountain. The golden mountain is an abstract object, after all, and\nmountains are not abstract objects. It is more akin to the object\nreferred to as the U.S. President in the following statement: \nwhere the subject is not a particular US President like George W. Bush\nor Barack Obama, but rather the role or office of US President. (While\nZalta is the clearest example of an unorthodox neo-Meinongian in our\nsense, others come close. For example, Rapaport (1978) considers\nM-objects (his version of Meinongian objects) to be akin to\nplans rather than concrete individuals, although unlike Zalta he does\nnot explicitly take them to be abstract, non-spatiotemporal\nobjects.) \nThere are other realist positions which, although admittedly not\nMeinongian, come close to this non-orthodox form of Meinongianism.\nSome realist positions take fictional objects to be types\n(Wolterstorff 1980), thereby sharing with non-orthodox Meinongianism a\nform of Platonism about fictional objects; others take them to be\nwork-bound roles (Currie 1990), thereby holding a form of\nabstractionism that leads to a conception of fictional objects as\ndependent entities, like the conception explicitly defended by\ncreationists (see below). \nThe distinction between orthodox and unorthodox neo-Meinongians is\ndrawn at the metaphysical level. It is closely linked to another\ndistinction relevant to Meinongian objects, and so to fictional\nobjects conceived of as Meinongian objects: the distinction between\nkinds of properties and modes of predication. Recall that on the one\nhand it seems natural to say that fictional objects have the\nproperties in terms of which stories characterize them (for instance,\nAnna Karenina was a woman driven to suicide by her failed affair, and\nSherlock Holmes a cocaine-addicted detective living in London), and on\nthe other hand not in the least natural (Anna Karenina may have\ncommitted suicide, but it is no use looking for news of her suicide in\nthe newspapers of the day). Now, all neo-Meinongians accept\nMeinong’s view that a Meinongian object possesses the properties\nin terms of which it is characterized. Following what Meinong (1972\n[1916]) himself came to say on the basis of a suggestion by his\nstudent Ernst Mally, some neo-Meinongians (for example, Parsons 1980,\nJacquette 1996) take these properties to be the object’s nuclear\nproperties, where, in general, if M is the Meinongian object\ncorrelated with a set of properties S, the members of S\nare the object’s nuclear properties. On this view, being a\ndetective, for example, is a nuclear property of Holmes, while\nbeing a king is a nuclear property of King Arthur. (Routley\nsimilarly talks of an object’s characterizing\nproperties; cf. Routley 1980: 507–10.) But a Meinongian object\nalso has other properties on this view: its extranuclear\nproperties are those of its properties that are not among its\nnuclear or characterizing properties. In the case of fictional\nobjects, these are the properties that a fictional object has outside\nthe scope of the story in which it appears—properties, we might\nsay, that it has in virtue of the way the world really is,\nnot properties that it has from the point of view of that story.\nConsider, for example, the following two sentences: \nThese sentences involve properties—being a pop culture\nicon, being a fictional character—that are being\nascribed to Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina even though the properties\ndo not characterize these characters in the stories in which they\nappear. Mickey Mouse has the first property because of the effects of\nhis enormous popularity on pop culture, not because he is depicted as\na pop culture icon in the Mickey Mouse stories. Anna Karenina has the\nsecond property because of her status as the product of creative\nfiction, not because of what Tolstoy’s story says about her\n(according to Tolstoy’s story she is a woman, not a fictional\ncharacter). These two properties are typical instances of extranuclear\nproperties. \n(A cautionary comment. In light of what we have just said, the claim\nthat the properties true of a fictional object in a work count as the\nobject’s nuclear properties needs qualification. It is true in\nthe Holmes stories, for example, that Holmes exists, even though\nHolmes doesn’t actually exist. So non-existence is one of\nHolmes’s (extranuclear) properties despite the fact that in the\nstories Holmes is as much an existent object as he is a detective\nliving in London. One way of dealing with this apparent tension is to\ninsist that Holmes does have a property like existence, but that this\nproperty should be understood as a weaker, ‘watered-down’,\nversion of its extranuclear counterpart, a notion first advanced by\nMeinong (cf. Parsons 1980: 44, 184–6). We return to the notion\nof watered-down versions of extranuclear properties below.) \nSome other neo-Meinongians claim instead that fictional and other\nMeinongian objects possess the very same kind of properties that\nordinary individuals possess, but possess them in a very different\nway. (This suggestion was first made by Mally (1912), but not adopted\nby Meinong.) When, for example, we say that Anna Karenina was a woman\nand Holmes an inhabitant of London, we use a different mode of\npredication from the one we use when we say that Marilyn Monroe was a\nwoman or Tony Blair an inhabitant of London. On Zalta’s familiar\nformulation of this idea (Zalta 1983), fictional entities\nencode such properties while ordinary individuals simply\nexemplify them. Similarly, Castañeda (1989) appeals to\nan internal as well as external mode of predication\nof properties, while Rapaport (1978) talks of properties that are\nconstituents of objects and properties that are exemplified by\nobjects. Both Anna Karenina and Marilyn Monroe, we might say, have the\nproperty of being a woman, but the former encodes the\nproperty (the property is predicated of Anna internally, or Anna has\nit as a constituent), while the latter exemplifies the property (she\nhas it externally). \nBut fictional objects also exemplify properties, perhaps some of the\nvery same properties they encode or have internally (this happens\nwhenever these properties are predicated of the objects in the stories\nin which they appear). Thus, what makes both\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n true is that the properties of being a pop culture icon and\nbeing a fictional character are exemplified, or possessed\nexternally, by Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina respectively. Anna\nKarenina therefore turns out to be internally non-fictional (since it\nis true in the novel that she is a woman, not a fictional character),\nand externally fictional. \nThat said, note that there are important differences between the ways\nin which Zalta, on the one hand, and Castañeda and Rapaport, on\nthe other, formulate these distinctions. For Zalta (1983: 12),\nencoding is a primitive notion which he embeds in a rigorous\nhigher-order modal theory that is then used to prove the existence,\nand derive the properties, of abstract objects, including fictional\nobjects. For both Castañeda (1989: 200) and Rapaport (1978:\n162), on the other hand, internal predication applies to\nset-correlates, and so this mode of predication can be defined in\nterms of set-membership: a (fictional) entity F has P\ninternally (or: has P as a constituent) if and only if P\nbelongs to the property set that is correlated with F. \nOn the surface, the ‘modes of predication’ distinction\nappears to be in a better position to handle the data than the\n‘kinds of properties’ distinction (for more on these\ndistinctions, see the exchange between Jacquette (1989) and Zalta\n(1992)). For one thing, there seems to be no workable criterion for\ndistinguishing nuclear and extranuclear properties: some properties\nseem to be both. Consider the property of being a fictional\ncharacter. Being a fictional character may seem to be\nthe prototypical candidate of an extranuclear property, as the case of\n(5) above testifies, but there may well be ‘metafictional’\nnarratives whose protagonists are not characterized in the usual way\nas flesh and blood individuals, but instead as fictional characters.\n(The fictional character The Father in Pirandello’s Six\nCharacters in Search of an Author is a famous case in point.) So\nbeing a fictional character seems to qualify as both a\nnuclear and an extranuclear property. Defenders of the ‘modes of\npredication’ distinction have no problem here: they hold that we\ncan externally predicate being a fictional character\nof both Anna Karenina and Pirandello’s The Father, while we can\nalso internally predicate this property of The Father. (It\nshould be pointed out that defenders of the ‘kinds of\nproperties’-distinction have their own way of responding to this\nproblem: they say that in such cases the nuclear property in question\nis the ‘watered-down’ counterpart of the corresponding\nextranuclear property. On this view, Pirandello’s The Father has\nthe extranuclear property of being a fictional character as\nwell as its nuclear ‘watered-down’ correlate. But apart\nfrom the seemingly ad hoc character of this response, it is\nfaced by a more serious problem: it threatens to expose the\ndistinction to an endless regress of ever more ‘watered-\ndown’ nuclear properties (cf. Voltolini 2006).) \nIt is probably fair to say that at the current stage of the debate the\n‘modes of predication’ distinction is more widely\naccepted, although as far as fictional entities at least are\nconcerned, both distinctions are taken to be problematic (Everett\n2013). We should remember, however, that this debate is internal to\nneo-Meinongianism, and that neo-Meinongianism as a theory of fictional\nobjects has important virtues that owe nothing to the outcome of this\ndebate. One such virtue is that the theory can account for the idea\nthat fictional entities necessarily have the properties that\nthey are characterized as having in the relevant stories. It is hard\nto see how Holmes could not have been a detective, for\nexample. Of course, Doyle might have written a story in which someone\ncalled ‘Holmes’ was a film director, but it is hard not to\ninterpret this thought as simply meaning that Doyle might have created\nanother character with the same name. At the same time, it is a plain\ntruth of the Holmes stories that Holmes might never have become a\ndetective, that this was a purely contingent choice on Holmes’s\npart. No matter how it is formulated, neo-Meinongianism has a way of\ncapturing both these intuitions. On Zalta’s formulation of the\n‘modes of predication’ distinction, for example, Holmes\nexemplifies the property of being necessarily such that he encodes\nboth being a detective and being someone who might not have been a\ndetective. A neo-Meinongian advocating the ‘types of\nproperty’ distinction would say that Holmes has the extranuclear\nproperty of being necessarily such that he has the (nuclear)\nproperty of being a detective, but that he also has the\n(watered-down) nuclear property of being someone who might not\nhave been a detective. \nOn the basis of the essentialist idea that fictional objects\nnecessarily have the properties that they are characterized as having\nin the relevant stories, neo-Meinongians have suggested a simple\ncriterion for the identity of fictional entities, one which can be\ntraced back to the criterion for the identity of Meinongian objects in\ngeneral: If x has all the same nuclear properties as y\n(alternatively, if x and y internally possess the same\nproperties), then \\(x = y\\) (cf., for example, Parsons 1980: 28,\n188). \nDespite the apparent attractions of such a view, there is an evident\nproblem facing the underlying thought that once you have a certain\ncollection of properties you ipso facto have a fictional\nentity. (Note that (most) neo-Meinongians accept this thought, since\nthey take fictional objects to be a subset of the class of objects\ngenerated on the basis of something like Meinong’s Principle of\nthe Freedom of Assumption (cf. Meinong 1916 [1972: 282]), the\nprinciple that for any collection of (nuclear) properties there is a\nMeinongian object that has those properties.) But generating fictional\nentities is surely not quite that easy. Take an arbitrary\ncollection of properties, say {weighing more than 10kgs,\nbearing the name “Oscar”, having a passion\nfor garden gloves, being a devotee of the number 17}.\nThe mere existence of this set of properties is not enough to generate\na fictional object, Oscar, with these properties. More has to happen.\n(Kripke (2013: 70–1) mentions the historical case of the\nBiblical term ‘Moloch’, which interpreters of the Bible\ntook to be a name for a mythical pagan god, whereas modern philology\nsuggests it was in fact used as a common noun either for kings or for\nhuman sacrifices. If modern philology is right and Bible-interpreters\nwere confused, there is no mythical god Moloch. This is so even though\nwe can agree that there is a collection of properties that past\ninterpreters mistakenly understood the Bible to assign to such a\ngod.) \nNeo-Meinongians have tried to circumvent this problem by stressing\nthat Meinongian objects, including fictional objects, are not sets of\nproperties, but correlates of such sets. Whether this move\nenables neo-Meinongians to avoid admitting objects like Oscar and\nMoloch into the overall domain of fictional objects will depend on how\nthis move is understood. (In Castañeda’s variant of\nneo-Meinongianism, fictional objects are systems of set-correlates,\nbuilt up, or put together, by a fiction maker (cf. Castañeda\n1989: ch.11). But if this implies that the activity of fiction making\nis essential to the identity of fictional objects, we no longer have a\npure neo-Meinongianism but a view that is closer to the\n‘creationist’ view described in the next section.) \nEven if the idea of a set-correlate helps to solve this particular\nproblem, it seems that no neo-Meinongian theory is able to block\nanother problem that stems from letting the identity of such an object\ndepend on the properties in terms of which it is characterized. Take\nJorge Luis Borges’s famous story of a man called Pierre Menard\nwho happens to write a text that is word for word identical with\nMiguel Cervantes’s Don Quixote. Assume, in this variant\nof Borges’s story, that Menard and Cervantes are unknown to each\nother, even though they live in the very same town; one can even\nsuppose that they are neighbors. In that case, the Borges story\ndescribes a situation in which one and the same set of properties\ncorresponds to different fictional objects: Cervantes’s Don\nQuixote and Pierre Menard’s Don Quixote are two distinct\nfictional characters who, nonetheless, share all the properties they\nhave in the respective works. (The ‘Menard’ case was first\nmentioned in this context by Lewis (1978: 39). As a problem for the\nidentity of fictional objects, it was then exploited by Fine (1982:\n107); see also Thomasson (1999: 7, 56).) In this case, claiming that\nfictional objects are set-correlates rather than mere property sets\ndoes not solve the problem, for we have only one set-correlate, yet\ntwo distinct objects. \nIntuitively speaking, the problem is clear. Neo-Meinongianism in all\nits varieties tends to sketch a Platonistic picture of a fictional\nentity, either as something akin to a Platonic attribute, or as a\ncorrelate of something else that we tend to describe in Platonic\nterms—a set of properties. Neo-Meinongianism thus sees a\nfictional object as something that pre-dates the story-telling\nactivities that intuitively bring fictional objects into being. To see\nthe tension between these conceptions, note that we often speak of\nfictional objects as the creations of story-tellers or of the\nhuman mind more generally. Neo-Meinongianism, so it seems, leaves no\nsuch room for story-tellers. \nThe intuition that story-tellers have some kind of creative role to\nplay is accounted for by so called artifactualist, or\ncreationist, accounts of fictional entities (see Searle 1979,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999, Voltolini 2006; the position was also\ndefended in Kripke 2013, and elements of the position are found in van\nInwagen’s (1977) theory of fictional objects as posits of\nliterary criticism; Ingarden 1931 is a significant historical\nforerunner). According to such accounts, fictional objects are\nartifacts since they come into being once they are conceived by their\nauthors; to that extent, they are authorial creations. Moreover, they\nare abstract entities, just as unorthodox neo-Meinongians believe.\nUnlike Platonic abstracta, however, they not only have a\nbeginning in time, but they are also dependent entities since\nthey depend on other entities for their existence. (Roughly speaking,\nan entity O existentially depends on another entity\nO′ just if O couldn’t exist without\nO′ existing (cf. Thomasson 1999). For a more\ndiscriminating account, one that avoids the consequence that\neverything existentially depends on necessary existents like natural\nnumbers, see Fine 1994.) More specifically, fictional objects depend\nhistorically rigidly on the authors who create them (necessarily, if\nO comes into being at t, then the author(s) who\ncreates O exists at some time t′ before\nt) and constantly generically on the literary works that\nfeature them (necessarily, if O goes on existing, then some\nliterary work W or other featuring O exists during\nO’s time of existence) (see Thomasson 1999 for an\nextended discussion of such dependencies). While historical rigid\ndependence accounts for a fictional object’s coming into being,\nconstant generic dependence accounts for its continued existence or\npersistence. Such an account of the persistence of fictional objects\nseems as intuitive as the account of their generation. Not only do we\nsay that some given fictional object was created at a certain point of\ntime, but we might also describe it as having a certain age\n(Hamlet, we might point out, is now over 400 years old). \nNote that creationism thus characterized earns its keep from the\n‘obviousness’ of the thought that authors somehow create\nfictional characters through the creation of fictional works in which\nthey appear. Language seems to support this thought: we routinely hear\nstatements like “Hamlet is one of Shakespeare’s most\ncomplex creations”. It is on the basis of this thought that\ncreationists then hypothesize that fictional objects literally are the\ncreations of their authors: not concrete creations, clearly, so\ntherefore non-concrete, abstract creations. But this move is far from\ninnocent. Yagisawa (2001), for example, argues that creationism\nconflicts sharply with other seemingly obvious thoughts, for example\nthe nonexistence datum that fictional characters like Hamlet\ndon’t exist (for a response, see Goodman 2004). At an even more\nfundamental level, Brock (2010) argues that the creationist’s\nappeal to creation is explanatorily void, leaving more questions than\nanswers. \nCreationists themselves claim that the appeal to creation does solve a\nnumber of significant problems that afflict other metaphysical\ntheories. There is, for example, no mythical god Moloch, for nobody\nhas created such an object by gathering various properties and\nembedding them in a certain narrative. And although they share all the\nproperties attributed to them in the respective renditions of Don\nQuixote, there are two Don Quixotes, Cervantes’s\nand Menard’s, not just one, because there were two utterly\nindependent acts of authorial generation (cf. Voltolini 2006: 32ff.).\nIt is not clear, however, how creationists can deal with a related\nproblem that affects their theory, the problem of indiscriminable\nfictional objects (Kroon 2015). Intuitively, there were thousands of\nfictional dwarves who took part in Tolkien’s War between the\nDwarves and Orcs, without Tolkien’s engaging in thousands of\nacts of dwarf-creation. (In response to this worry, some creationists\nhave denied that there are such characters; see, for example,\nVoltolini 2006: 209–11.) \nIt is evident, then, that creationism is not without its problems.\nPerhaps the most significant ones have to do with the nature of the\ncreative process and the relation between the creative process and the\nidentity of fictional objects. It seems, for example, that what comes\ninto existence on the above account of the generating process (which\ntalks of authors’ conceiving of their literary\ncreations) is not a fictional object as such, but rather a (mere)\nintentional object, the target of a certain authorial thought. A mere\nintentional object is not yet a fictional object, as Thomasson (1999:\n89) agrees, so what makes it one? Does it become one by being able to\nbe ‘shared’ by more than one person through appearing in a\ntext (maybe not a physical copy but one stored in memory)? Or is there\na more discriminating criterion to single out which intentional\nobjects are fictional objects? \nThis question is perhaps best answered by giving a somewhat different\naccount of the generating process. Thus, some creationists (Schiffer\n1996, 2003; Thomasson 2003a,b) say that a fictional object comes into\nbeing as an abstract artifact not when an author first conceives of\nit, but only once a certain make-believe process has come to an end,\nnamely, the process in which someone—typically, a\nstory-teller—pretends that there is an individual who is\nsuch-and-such and does so-and-so. It is disputable whether this\nprovides a sufficient condition for ficta generation; perhaps\nsomething else is needed, such as a reflexive stance on the very\nmake-believe process itself (Voltolini 2006, 2015a). But whatever the\nright account, another question remains: even if we agree on the\nnature of the process-type that gives rise to a fictional object,\nwhat is the thing that is purportedly generated in this way?\nWhat are the identity conditions for fictional objects? Creationists\ntypically do not think that a fictional object possesses the\nproperties that characterize it in the story in which it appears. A\nfictional object simply has those properties according to the\nstory. It is not true of Holmes, for instance, that\n‘he’ (or it) is a detective—only physical objects,\nnot an abstract artifact, can be a detective. What is true of Holmes\nis that ’he’ is a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (equally, Holmes is male according to those stories, and so\ndeserving of the masculine pronoun “he”). In general, for\ncreationists the only properties that fictional objects genuinely\npossess are the properties that neo-Meinongians would call\nextranuclear or take to be externally predicated: properties like\nbeing a fictional detective or being Doyle’s\ncreation or even being a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (cf. Thomasson 1999). The approach thus fails to account\nfor the idea, mentioned earlier, that there must be a sense in which\nfictional objects actually have the properties that\ncharacterize them in the relevant stories. \nIn addition, the restricted nature of such properties makes it hard to\nsee how to individuate a fictional entity. Thomasson gives sufficient\nidentity conditions for fictional entities within a literary\nwork: x and y are the same fictional object F if\nx and y are ascribed exactly the same properties in the\nwork (1999: 63). But what do we say in the case of fictional objects\nthat appear in different works? Thomasson admits that in this case one\ncan only provide a necessary condition: x and y are the\nsame fictional object only if the author of the second work\n\\(W’\\) is competently acquainted with x of the previous\nwork \\(W\\), and intends to import x into \\(W’\\) as\ny (1999: 67). The reason why she thinks this cannot be a\nsufficient condition is that, no matter what the author’s\nintentions are, he does not succeed in importing x (an entity\nthat appears in W) into \\(W’\\) as y if he\nattributes properties to y that are too radically different\nfrom the properties that were attributed to x in W\n(1999: 68). (There are other cases that show even more clearly how\nauthorial intention can be thwarted. Thus, consider a case of a\nfusion of characters, in which an author intends to import\ninto \\(W’\\) two characters x and y from a previous\nwork W as a single character z. Clearly, given the\ntransitivity of identity, z is not identical with either\nx or y, so the author fails in her attempt. Analogous\nproblems arise in the converse situation of character\nfission: cf. Voltolini 2012.) \nTo conclude this discussion of the metaphysics of fictional objects,\nit is worth noting that neo-Meinongian and creationist theories seem\nto suffer from complementary defects. On the one hand, neo-Meinongians\nprovide exact identity criteria for fictional objects, but these\ncriteria are clearly insufficient in that they do not take into\naccount the fact that such objects are products of the human mind. On\nthe other hand, creationists do account for this fact, but they only\nprovide relatively non-specific identity criteria for such entities.\nThose theories are normally taken to be incompatible, for they appeal\nto different metaphysical models—broadly speaking, a Platonic\nmodel as opposed to a constructivist one. This claim of\nincompatibility should not be taken as definitive, however; there may\nwell be ways in which the two theories, or perhaps the most promising\nelements of each theory, can somehow be combined (for recent attempts\nto go in such a direction, cf. Zalta 2000, Voltolini 2006). \nThe metaphysical question about fictional entities asked what such\nentities are like, should there be any. We now turn to the ontological\nquestion, which simply asks whether there are any such entities. \nObviously the important division at the ontological level lies between\nthose who believe that there are fictional\nentities—fictional realists—and those who believe\nthat there no such entities—fictional antirealists. For\na long time, the battlefield between those two parties has been\nordinary language. Realists have always been fascinated by the fact\nthat there are sentences in language that seem to commit one to\nfictional entities. Antirealists have instead insisted that such\nappearances are deceptive: whenever a sentence seems to commit one to\nfictional entities, one can always provide a paraphrase which has the\nsame truth-conditions as the original sentence but is not so\ncommitted. Realists in turn try to show either that those paraphrases\nare inadequate or that there are still further sentences for which no\nadequate paraphrases can be found. Antirealists will reply that,\ndespite appearances, these sentences can also be paraphrased in\nnoncommittal terms; and so the game goes on. \nFrege (1892) is often taken to be the first champion of fictional\nantirealism within analytic philosophy, in so far as he held that in\ndirect (gerade) contexts such as “Odysseus came\nashore” the fictional name “Odysseus“ has a sense but no reference. But Frege\nalso held that in oblique (ungerade) contexts such as\n“John believed that Odysseus came ashore” and “The\nauthor of the Odyssey says that Odysseus came ashore”\nthis sense becomes the new referent of the fictional name. If senses\nof this type can model the notion of a fictional entity, then Frege\ncan be construed as a kind of fictional realist (Künne 1990);\notherwise, he can’t. (Parsons (1982) is doubtful; Zalta may be\nmore sympathetic, since he thinks his abstract objects can model both\nthe notion of sense (Zalta 2001) and the idea of a fictional\nobject.) \nThe modern form of the realism-antirealism debate, however, did not\noriginate with anything Frege said on the matter, but with a dispute\nbetween Meinong (1904) and Russell (1905a). Consider a sentence\nlike: \nAccording to Meinong, considered here as the paradigmatic realist, the\nvery meaningfulness of this statement commits one to a (broadly)\nfictional entity—the deity of the Greek myths—on the\ngrounds, roughly, that the thought expressed by the statement is\ndirected at this entity, and so requires there to be such an entity.\nThe statement itself expresses a truth rather than a falsehood about\nthis entity. For Russell, however, appearances in this case were\ndeceptive. First of all, he thought that “Apollo”, like\nany other ordinary proper name, is short-hand for a definite\ndescription—say, “the sun-god”. Secondly, following\nhis discovery of the theory of definite descriptions Russell held that\na sentence containing a definite description has to be analyzed in\nterms of another sentence in which the description is eliminated in\nfavor of quantifiers, predicates, logical connectives, and genuine\nproper names. What (6) says on this account is given by a paraphrase\nin which the definite description for which “Apollo” is\nshort-hand, namely “the sun-god”, has disappeared on\nanalysis: \n(Put more simply: There is a unique sun-god, and he is young.) \nThirdly, there is no longer even the appearance of a singular term\n(“Apollo”) that must designate something for the\nparaphrase to be meaningful. In fact, Russell saw that this result\nshowed the original statement to be both meaningful (because able to\nbe analyzed in this way) and false (given obvious facts). Say that a\ndefinite description has a Russellian denotation when the\nRussellian conditions for the description to have a denotation are\nfulfilled; that is, when there is at least one individual satisfying\nthe relevant predicate, but no more than one. Then we can say that the\ndefinite description for which “Apollo” is short-hand does\nnot have a Russellian denotation since (6R)’s first conjunct,\nnamely: \nis false. Far from making\n (6)\n meaningless, the absence of a denotation in this Russellian sense\nwhen taken in conjunction with Russell’s eliminative strategy\nshows (6) to be false. Russell thought that his theory of definite\ndescriptions allowed him to show that all fictional names lacked\ndenotation in this way, and that sentences containing fictional names\nwere therefore true or false rather than meaningless. \nLet us accept, for argument’s sake, that the adoption of\nRussell’s theory of descriptions allows us to avoid ontological\ncommitment to such ‘bizarre’ entities as nonexistent\nfictional and mythological entities. (Although this is a widely\naccepted view, there is in fact reason to doubt it: David Kaplan\nargues that it is “one of [the] virtues” of\nRussell’s theory that the theory is “essentially neutral\nwith respect to ontological commitment”, that it permits\ndescriptions to denote nonexistent entities if there are such entities\n(Kaplan 2005: 975–6; cf. also Voltolini 2006: 139ff.). Even if\nRussell’s theory is ontologically potent in this way, however,\nthe theory as formulated faces a simple and seemingly devastating\nobjection: many intuitively true sentences come out as false\non their Russellian paraphrases. Consider sentence\n (6)\n again. If we use Russell’s theory to dispense with an entity\nlike Apollo, it follows that (6) is false, insofar as its Russellian\nparaphrase is false. This is widely acknowledged to be\ncounterintuitive. Presented with (6), most would say that it is\nintuitively true, unlike, say: \nAs it turns out, the antirealist who follows Russell has an easy way\nof circumventing this problem. She will point out that the reason why\n (6),\n but not (8), seems to be true is that in the Greek myth\nthings are exactly as (6) says. The impression that (6) is true can\nthen easily be accommodated by taking (6) to be elliptical for a\nlonger sentence, namely: \nHere the locution “according to the Greek myth” works as\nan intensional operator, whereas the sentence following that operator,\nwhich is nothing but (6) itself, has to be analyzed in Russellian\nfashion: \n(A caveat. It would be more proper to say that it is a use of\n (6)\n that is taken to be elliptical for (6IR), rather than (6) itself. For\n(6) is a case of a fictional sentence, namely a sentence that\ncould easily occur in the body of a narrative (a myth, in this case).\nSuch sentences have a use on which they have merely fictional\ntruth-conditions, that is, truth-conditions from the stand-point of\nthe narrative or work of fiction, and on this kind of use even their\ntruth-values are merely fictional. Following Evans (1982), who here\nborrows a Quinean terminology, we may call this the conniving\nuse of such sentences: the use on which the utterer is engaged in\npretense or make-believe. But there is another use of the same\nsentences—what Evans calls the non-conniving\nuse—on which we take them to have real truth-conditions, hence\nreal truth-values: the kind of use on which we take\n (8),\n unlike (6), to express a real falsehood. A case in point would be an\nutterance of (8) in response to a request for information about Apollo\nin an exam on Greek mythology. We shall call sentences of the form\n (6I),\n even reshaped as (6IR), internal metafictional sentences,\nfor they purport to say how things stand in, or according to, a\ncertain fiction. They are meant as sentences that capture the\nnon-conniving use of fictional sentences like (6).) \nLet us now go back to the amendment to Russellianism we were\nconsidering. On the view being discussed, an expression like\n“according to the Greek myth” is, qua intensional\noperator, a circumstance-shifting operator, one that shifts the\ncircumstance of evaluation of the sentence following it. Suppose, for\nthe sake of argument, that a sentence of the form “According to\nstory S, p” is true in the actual world if and\nonly if “p” is true at the closest possible worlds\nto the actual world in which S is true (cf. Lewis 1978). Now,\nany sentence that this operator embeds has to be analyzed in\nRussellian terms if it contains a singular term. In that case, a\nsentence like\n (6I)\n is true in the actual world if and only if\n (6),\n i.e.,\n (6R),\n is true at the closest possible worlds in which the Apollo-myth is\ntrue. Insofar as (6R) is indeed true at such worlds, the singular term\nin question—“Apollo”, that is, “the\nsun-god”—has a (Russellian) denotation in those worlds,\neven though it lacks a denotation in the actual world. Hence, we again\nget the result Russell desired: the whole sentence is true although\nthe relevant singular term has no actual denotation but only a\npossible one. Thus, no commitment to fictional entities arises out of\nthe truth of that sentence. \nOr rather, no such commitment arises from Russell’s theory on\nits own. If we assume Lewis’s modal realism, then saying as we\ndid that a description has a possible denotation entails an\nontological commitment to fictional objects as possibilia.\nNormally, however, this intensionalist approach is taken in an\nantirealist sense (cf., e.g., Lamarque & Olsen 1994; Orenstein\n2003; Rorty 1982). For the Russellian, central to this antirealist\nunderstanding is the fact that a sentence like\n (6I)\n should be given a de dicto, not a de re, reading:\nwhat is said to be true in the fiction is a certain dictum or\nproposition, not the claim, about some given thing or res\nx, that x has a certain property. On Russell’s way\nof understanding this distinction, the description “the\nsun-god” for which “Apollo” is short-hand should be\ninterpreted as having a secondary, not a primary, occurrence in the\nsentence, or, which is the same, the existential quantifier occurring\nin the Russellian paraphrase of the sentence should be assigned\nnarrow, not wide, scope. (6I), that is, should be read as:\n“According to the Apollo-myth, there is exactly one sun-god, and\nhe is young” rather than as “There is a unique sun-god,\nand according to the myth he is young”. The reason for this is\nevident. If we adopt the wide-scope reading of the quantifier, the\nsentence turns out to be false, not true (given that there is no\nsun-god); and it is the truth of a sentence like (6I) that the\nRussellian aims to capture. \nSuppose that the Russellian amendment works for fictional sentences on\ntheir non-conniving use. Intuitively, however, there are many\nsentences that talk of fictional characters even though they do not\neven implicitly mention stories. Let us call these\nexternal metafictional sentences (some other commentators\ntalk of “transfictive” or “critical”\nsentences).\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n above are typical examples. Clearly, (4) and (5) cannot be taken as\nelliptical for internal metafictional sentences such as: \nFor unlike\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n the latter sentences are simply false even on their de dicto\nreading (a point already stressed by Lewis (1978: 38)): Mickey Mouse\nhas the status of a pop culture icon in the actual world, not in the\nDisney stories; and according to Anna Karenina, Anna is a\nwoman, not a fictional character. Many realists, especially\ncreationists, have concluded that sentences of this kind really do\nestablish that we are committed to fictional characters. They argue\nthat even though fictional sentences on their non-conniving use can be\nparaphrased as internal metafictional sentences on their de\ndicto reading and thus do not commit us to fictional characters,\nexternal metafictional sentences cannot be paraphrased in this way,\nand their truth really does commit us to fictional characters (see,\nfor example, Schiffer 1996 and Thomasson 2003b). \nOne possible antirealist solution to this problem—although not\none that Russellians themselves have promoted—is to invoke a\nkind of fictionalism about fictional characters. On this strategy,\nsentences like (4) and (5) should be thought of as implicitly prefixed\nby another intensional “in the fiction” operator,\nso that even in this case the impression of reference to a fictional\nentity would turn out to be baseless. In cases of this type, the\noperator would appeal not to a story but rather to the realist\npresumption that such an impression seems to support. The suggestion,\nthen, is that external metafictional sentences are to be read as\nimplicitly prefixed by an operator like “according to the\nfiction of realism” or “according to the realist’s\nhypothesis”: \nOnce external metafictional sentences are read this way, any apparent\ncommitment to fictional entities seems to disappear, provided once\nagain that the resulting complex sentences are read de dicto\n(for such a move, see Brock 2002, Phillips 2000). \nThe appeal to intensional “in the fiction” operators is a\nwell-known strategy for dealing with the apparent truth of statements\nlike\n (6),\n and because it is available to Russell this may seem like good news\nfor Russell’s antirealism, especially given the way the strategy\nmight be extended to external meta-fictional statements like\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n But such an amended version of Russellianism faces a problem already\nfaced by the unamended version of Russell’s view. If such a\nRussellianism is to provide the correct analysis of sentences like\n(6), one has to assume that proper names are synonymous with definite\ndescriptions. This is because the strategy used in arriving at a\nsentence like (6IR) involves replacing a proper name\n(“Apollo”) with an equivalent definite description\n(“the sun-god”). But there are well-known, and widely\naccepted, arguments against such a descriptivist view of proper names\n(Donnellan 1972, Kripke 1972 [1980], 2013). In particular,\ndescriptions of the sort that speakers or communities standardly\nassociate with a name might simply fail to fit what the name really\nrefers to (in the actual world and relative to other possible worlds).\nOne response to this objection as far as fictional names like\n“Apollo”, “Holmes”, etc., are concerned is to\nreject descriptivism about ordinary names but endorse it for fictional\nnames (see, for example, Currie 1990: 158–162). On the surface,\nhowever, this looks like an unpromising move: for one thing, it is\npossible to attempt to engage in conversation about Apollo, believing\nhe is real, before coming to the realization that he is merely a\nmythological figure, a possibility that is hard to explain if ordinary\nnames and fictional names have entirely different sorts of\nmeanings. \nThis descriptivist problem presents itself as a potential challenge to\nany antirealist view that endorses a de dicto reading of\nsentences like\n (6I)\n and\n (4F)\n /\n (5F).\n For how else, if not in terms of some kind of descriptivist view of\nnames like Russell’s, are we to understand such de\ndicto readings? If names are instead taken to be directly\nreferential—that is, if they are taken to be terms that do not\nsecure their reference by means of descriptive meanings—there\nseems to be no room left for a de dicto as opposed to a\nde re reading of such sentences, and, consequently, no room\nfor the thought that sentences containing (allegedly) empty names like\n“Apollo” even have truth-conditions. \nA particularly stark form of this dilemma is faced by what is perhaps\nthe most widely accepted post-Kripkean alternative to descriptivism,\nnamely Millianism, which holds that what a name contributes\nsemantically to the propositions expressed through the use of\nsentences containing the name is just the name’s referent. The\ncombination of Millianism and the antirealist view that fictional\nnames like “Apollo” lack reference (and so make no\ncontribution to the expression of propositions) appears to imply that\nsentences like\n (6I)\n don’t express any proposition, let alone true propositions.\nThere is now a lively industry devoted to finding Millianism-friendly\nsolutions to this quandary. Some Millians argue that what we see as\nmeaningful and even true concerns what is implicated rather than\nsemantically expressed by such sentences (e.g., Taylor 2000). Others\nappeal to gappy or unfilled propositions. These are proposition-like\nentities expressed by sentences containing empty names that can fail\nto be true because of the gaps (see Braun 1993, 2005; Adams et al.\n1997). Both Braun and Adams et al. argue that such gappiness\ndoesn’t prevent internal metafictional sentences such as\n“In the Holmes stories, Holmes is a detective” from\nexpressing truths. But they disagree about external metafictional\nsentences like “Holmes is a fictional character”, with\nAdams et al. insisting that these too can be true despite the names\nbeing non-referring, and Braun (2005) arguing that such statements\ncall for a creationist position on which the names in such sentences\nrefer to genuine, created fictional entities. \nMillians are not the only ones to have grappled with the implications\nthat the Kripke-Donnellan attack on descriptivism has for the\nsemantics of fictional names. Michael Devitt, for example, another\nearly critic of descriptivism, has used the problem of fictional and\nother empty names to argue against Millianism and in favor of his\nversion of a causal-historical theory of reference (cf. Devitt 1989).\nAnd Mark Sainsbury argues in Sainsbury 2005 that names, including\nfictional names, have singular but non-descriptive meanings that can\nbe specified in a Davidson-style truth theory whose background logic\nis a Negative Free Logic (that is, a logic that counts simple or\natomic sentences containing empty names as false). Given the role\nassigned to Negative Free Logic, it is scarcely surprising that the\ngreatest challenge for such a framework is again the problem of\nexternal metafictional sentences such as\n (4): \nThe latter has the appearance of an atomic sentence and so should,\nimplausibly, count as false on such a logic. In Sainsbury 2009 and\n2010, Sainsbury uses the idea of presupposition- / acceptance-relative\ntruth to deal with such problems, an idea that is related to ideas\nfound in the popular pretense-theoretic approach to fictional names.\nThat is the approach we turn to next. \nFor the antirealist, the semantics of names presents an important\nhurdle to attempts to accommodate the truth of internal and external\nmetafictional sentences featuring fictional names. Such difficulties\nhave suggested the need to look in a completely different direction.\nAs we saw before, it is important to acknowledge the role of pretense\nin fictional talk and writing. A fictional sentence has a conniving\nuse when it is uttered within the context of a certain pretense\ninvolving the telling of a story. Call such a context a\nfictional context. Note that a sentence considered as uttered\nin such a context does in a sense carry ontological commitments: it\ncarries pretend ontological commitments. For within the\ncontext of the relevant pretense, the singular terms involved do refer\nto things. For instance, to utter\n (6)\n in the context of telling the Greek myth is to utter a sentence in\nwhich, from the perspective of the relevant pretense, the name\n“Apollo” refers to a god. Consequently, the sentence has\nfictional truth-conditions in that context (the sentence is\ntrue in the world of that context just if the entity referred to as\n“Apollo” in that context is young in that world) and has\nalso a fictional truth-value (considered as uttered in that\ncontext, the sentence is true, for in the world of that\ncontext—the world of the Greek myth—there is a god,\nApollo, who is indeed young). Outside that context,\nhowever—that is, in a real context where there is no\npretense that the Greek myth is fact—a name like\n“Apollo” refers to nothing. No endorsement of\ndescriptivism is here required. Quite simply, if the singular terms in\nquestion are directly referential (currently the most popular view of\nnames), then a sentence containing a fictional proper name\nwill have no real truth-conditions, hence no real truth-value, since\nany such term is really empty. Take the case of “Apollo”,\nwhich on this view has no referent when uttered in a real,\nnon-fictional context of utterance. Assuming it is a directly\nreferential term, it makes no truth-conditional contribution to\nsentences that contain it. Hence, when uttered in a real context (6)\nwill have no truth-conditions, hence no truth-value. (The kernel of\nthis proposal is in Walton 1990; see Recanati 2000 and Everett 2013\nfor refinements.) \nSo far, so good. Remember, however, that the intuition that a sentence\nlike\n (6)\n is really, not just fictionally, true—hence, that it has real,\nnot just fictional, truth-conditions—is a powerful one. How can\na pretense antirealist account for this intuition? \nAs a first attempt, a pretense antirealist may try to combine the\nvirtues of the pretense account with the virtues of the intensionalist\napproach. That is, she may first stick to the idea that on its\nnon-conniving use a sentence like (6) has to be taken as elliptical\nfor an internal metafictional sentence like\n (6I).\n But she may also insist that the “according to the story”\noperator should be taken as a context-shifting operator, not\nsimply (like the familiar intensional operator “It is necessary\nthat”) as a circumstance-shifting operator. That is, she may\ninsist that it is an operator that shifts not only the circumstances\nof evaluation of the sentence it embeds, but also the context relevant\nfor the interpretation of such sentence—typically, the context\nof its utterance. More precisely, if we take a fictional sentence\n“p” on its non-conniving use as elliptical for\n“According to the story S, p”, then\n“p” so understood is true in the actual world if\nand only if “p”, taken as uttered in the context of\nthe story S (that is, a fictional context), is true in the\nworld of that context. \nThe antirealist merits of this account are clear. It allows a proper\nname like “Apollo” to be both genuinely empty, carrying no\ncommitment to any fictional entity, but also genuinely\nnon-descriptive. The embedded sentence containing the name ((6), say)\nis understood as being uttered in a fictional context, and in that\ncontext the name directly refers to an individual, the individual\nexisting in the world of the relevant pretense. Since this reference\noccurs only in that fictional context, not in a real context, the name\nreally does remain empty. (This proposal can be traced back to Walton\n1990; see also Adams et al. 1997.) \nDespite these virtues, the suggestion faces a well-known criticism.\nKaplan calls such context-shifting operators ‘monsters’,\nand claims that “none can be expressed in English (without\nsneaking in a quotation device)” (1989a: 511). In the case of\nindexicals, for example, “no operator can control … the\nindexicals within its scope, because they will simply leap out of its\nscope to the front of the operator” (1989a: 510). To see how\nthis worry applies to a fictional sentence containing an indexical,\nconsider the famous first line of Proust’s In Search of Lost\nTime: \nWithin the fictional context mobilized by Proust’s telling his\nstory, the first person pronoun “I” refers to the person\nnarrating the events that constitute the imaginary world of\nProust’s Recherche—an individual who exists only\nin that world, not the actual world. Now, suppose we want to capture\nthe sense in which (9) is really true by reporting that the claim\nexpressed by (9) is true according to In Search of Lost Time.\nOn the above pretense-intensionalist approach, we might formulate this\nsuggestion as: \nHowever, this equivalence clearly does not work. Assuming that you are\nthe person who utters (9PI), the sentence says that you used to go to\nbed early for a long time in the imaginary world of Proust’s\nRecherche. But this is false, since you are not an inhabitant\nof this world. \nIt may be possible to obviate Kaplan’s problem in some way, for\ninstance by claiming that the context-shift affects the whole\nsentence, not just the embedded one (Recanati 2000); but then one has\nto show how such sentences may nonetheless have real truth-conditions,\nand not merely fictional ones. Or the problem may turn out to be\nrestricted to the case of embedded indexicals, or even certain types\nof indexicals. Predelli, for example, has argued that there are\nexamples of discourse about fiction using modal and temporal\nindexicals that are best analyzed in terms of such context-shifting\nKaplanesque ‘monsters’ (Predelli 2008). \nBe that as it may, one might try to simplify the pretense-theoretical\nproposal by reversing the order of explanation. Rather than taking the\nfictional sentence on its non-conniving use as elliptical for an\ninternal metafictional sentence, we might take the internal\nmetafictional sentence to be really true just when the fictional\nsentence (on its non-conniving use) is really true. We might, that is,\nfollow Walton in treating the fictional sentence as\n“primary”; cf. 1990: 401–2). It is in fact\nrelatively easy to discern the sense in which the fictional sentence\non its non-conniving use is really true. It is really true just in\ncase there is a pretense of a certain kind relative to which the\nsentence on its conniving use is fictionally true. In short, the\nfictional sentence is really true on its non-conniving use if and only\nif it is fictionally true (for this formulation, see Crimmins 1998:\n2–8). (Walton’s 1990 own formulation of the point is\nweaker, for it gives the proposal a pragmatic twist: by being\nfictionally true, a sentence may be taken to assert, or to\nconvey, a real truth. See also Everett 2013.) \nOne advantage of such an antirealist move is that it can be used for\nboth fictional sentences and external metafictional sentences. For\nWalton, what distinguishes the two cases is simply the kind of\npretense that makes the relevant sentence fictionally true. In the\nformer case, the game of make-believe that the relevant fictional\ncontext singles out is an authorized one; that is, it is a\ngame authorized by what serves as a prop in that game (in the case of\na literary game of make-believe, the text written or narrated by the\nstoryteller); the prop dictates how things go in the world of that\ngame. In the latter case, the relevant game of make-believe is an\nunofficial, albeit standard, one (1990: 417); in this case,\nthere may be no constraints—none, at least, provided by the\nprop—that dictate how things stand in the world of that game\n(cf. Walton 1990: 51, 406, 409). \nTake\n (6)\n again. In order for (6) to be fictionally true, and hence for it to\nbe really true on its non-conniving use, the world of the Greek myth\nmust contain a god (Apollo) who is young. This is a consequence of the\nfact that this is the way the myth is told. The myth-telling functions\nas a prop constraining how the “Apollo” game of\nmake-believe has to be played; a person who makes believe that Apollo\nis a rock-star is not playing the game correctly, or is perhaps\nplaying another game. But now consider\n (4).\n In order for an utterance of (4) to be fictionally true, hence for it\nto be really true on its non-conniving use, it must allude to a game\nin which there is a fictional character named “Mickey\nMouse” who has the special property of being a pop culture\nicon—a ‘Meinongian’ pretense, as Recanati\n(2000) calls it. Now, such a game is not constrained by any text;\nthere is no Mickey Mouse story that describes Mickey Mouse in these\nterms. The game in question is instead one where facts about the\nimportant place occupied in popular culture by the Mickey Mouse\nstories are what make it fictionally true in the game that Mickey\nMouse has the special property of being a pop culture icon.\nTo that extent the game is an unofficial one. \nOn this account, then, external metafictional sentences enjoy no\nspecial status; in particular, they don’t provide us with a\nreason for assuming the existence of fictional entities. Our final\nexample returns us to Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search\nof an Author. Consider an utterance of: \nOn the one hand, this is an external metafictional sentence of the\nvery same kind as (5), a sentence that the speaker uses to describe\nthe metaphysical status of one of the protagonists of\nPirandello’s work. On the other hand, (10) may also be taken as\na fictional sentence, since Pirandello’s play is characterized\nby the fact that its protagonists are not ordinary concrete\nindividuals but fictional characters. In such a case, the sentence has\ntwo distinct non-conniving uses. On its use as a fictional sentence it\nis allegedly equivalent to: \nIn this case,\n (10)\n is really true in so far as it is fictionally true relative to a game\nauthorized by the work Six Characters in Search of an Author.\nIn the other case, it is really true in so far as it is fictionally\ntrue relative to an unofficial game in which some entities count as\n‘real people’ and some as ‘fictional\ncharacters’, with the Father correctly singled out as one of the\nlatter because ‘he’ originated in a work of fiction. \nWalton’s pretense-based version of antirealism has been very\ninfluential (for a development of the view, see Everett 2013), but it\nhas also attracted a great deal of criticism. Some have doubted that a\nsentence’s fictional truth on its conniving use can ground a\nsense in which it is really true on its non-conniving use (cf.\nVoltolini 2006), a move that is crucial to his antirealism. Others\nhave doubted that Walton’s appeal to unofficial games of\nmake-believe can yield appropriate antirealist paraphrases for\nmetafictional sentences in general, perhaps because these critics deny\nthat such sentences involve either explicit or implicit appeals to\npretense (Thomasson 1999, van Inwagen 2003). \nOf course, to show that some antirealist paraphrases of\nfictional sentences do not work does not mean that no such\nparaphrases will work. Perhaps it is always possible to find new\nparaphrases that do not raise any of the problems hitherto pointed\nout, whether such paraphrases are based on a new version of the\npretense-theoretic approach or on some other approach. To take this\npoint into account, some realists have pursued a different\nlinguistically-based strategy. To be, as Quine said, is to be the\nvalue of a variable (Quine 1948). Hence if we can locate existentially\nquantified discourse involving quantification over fictional\nentities—either directly, as external metafictional sentences\nthat can themselves be used as premises to derive other metafictional\nsentences, or indirectly, as a result of a valid inference from\nexternal metafictional sentences—then it seems that such\nontological commitment is unavoidable. In this connection, consider\nthe sentence: \nNot only can such a sentence be inferred from, say: \nbut it also legitimizes an inference to: \n(cf. van Inwagen 2000: 243–4). \nNow, it is certainly true that insisting on the need to preserve the\nvalidity of the above inferences in any account of external\nmetafictional sentences is a good antidote to the antirealist\n‘paraphrase’ strategy. For there is no guarantee that\nvalidity is preserved once the above sentences are paraphrased (say,\nin a pretense-theoretic manner à la Walton). This\nsuggests that such antirealist paraphrases may not capture the meaning\nof the original sentences, leaving the field to realist construals of\nsuch sentences (cf. again van Inwagen (ibid.); for\nWalton’s response, see Walton 1990: 416ff.). \nStill, this may not be enough to show that antirealism should be\nrejected. For while existential sentences like (11) that quantify over\nfictional characters are common enough, there are other existential\nclaims with the same logical features as (11) that philosophers are\nfar less likely to take as evidence of realism. Thus consider: \nThis sentence is suggested by Nathan Salmon’s account of\nallegedly empty names in Salmon 1998. Salmon suggests that while\nfictional names in general stand for abstract created fictional\nentities, certain other terms are thoroughly non-referring or empty.\nIn this connection, he contemplates the possibility of there being an\narmed fanatic who has just taken over the government of France by\ndeclaring himself emperor, and then stipulates that the name\n“Nappy” is to refer to whoever is the present emperor of\nFrance if there is such a person (as there would be if this\nimaginative scenario were actual), and to nothing if there\nisn’t. Such a name, he thinks, is clearly empty. Note, however,\nthat in Salmon’s imaginative scenario, \nis true, but that there is no similar scenario involving a present\nemperor of Canada. A sentence like\n (14)\n is a natural way of recording this fact. But now we face a problem.\nAs Caplan (2004) points out, taking\n (11)\n as an evidence for the genuine existence of what van Inwagen calls\ncreatures of fiction suggests that we should, by parity of\nreasoning, take (14) as evidence for the genuine existence of sui\ngeneris creatures of the imagination. Or, to put the point the\nother way round, if we don’t think that linguistically-based\nreasons such as the availability of an (apparently) true quantified\nsentence like (14) commit us to bizarre entities like Nappy, we should\nnot think that such reasons commit us to fictional entities either.\nFor variants of the problem and complications, see Kroon (2011, 2013,\n2015). \nNote that we do not even need quantificational locutions to see the\nproblem. If one thinks that the truth of the external metafictional\nsentence (5) commits us to the existence of a fictional character,\nAnna Karenina, then it is hard to resist the thought that the truth of\nthe non-quantified sentence: \nuttered by someone who wants to describe the mistake made by those\naround him who think that they see a little green man, similarly\ncommits us to the existence of a certain creature of the imagination,\none who has the property of being a trick of the light (cf.\nKroon 1996: 186). Many would resist such an easy road to realism about\ncreatures of the imagination. \nThe problems that one thus encounters in trying to let\nsemantic-linguistic arguments ground a commitment to fictional objects\ngive one reason to think that there is no semantical shortcut\navailable to the realist. That is to say, if a realist wants to claim\nthat our prima facie commitment to fictional entities is\njustified, she has to provide a genuine ontological argument to that\neffect. \nIn her 1999 book, Thomasson tried to provide just such an argument.\nHer argument claims that we cannot reject fictional objects if we\nadmit fictional works: given that fictional objects and fictional\nworks belong to the same genus of entities (the genus of created,\nartifactual objects) it would be false parsimony to accept the one and\nreject the other. \nThis argument has several problems. For one thing, it postulates an\nidentity of kind between fictional works and fictional entities that\nis far from intuitively clear. As Thomasson herself seems to admit\n(1999: 65), fictional works are syntactical-semantic entities, unlike\nfictional entities. But there is a similar argument that does not rely\non a parallelism between fictional works and fictional characters, but\non the fact that the identity conditions of the fictional works refer\nto fictional characters. In brief: if we admit a certain kind of\nentity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that\nfigure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit\nfictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because\nthey figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf.\nVoltolini 2003, 2006). \nIf the antirealist wants to challenge the realist on directly\nontological grounds, she has to discredit such arguments, and, better\nstill, provide an argument for the conclusion that there\ncannot be any fictional entities. Curiously enough, Russell,\nwho is usually remembered for having originated the\n‘paraphrase’ strategy for eliminating apparent reference\nto nonexistent entities (see 2.1.1 above), also used non-linguistically-based ontological\narguments against admitting such entities. In fact, there is good\nreason to believe that he took his main argument against\nMeinong to be that Meinongian entities are apt to violate the law of\nnoncontradiction (cf. Russell 1905a,b). In his 2005 and 2013 works,\nEverett reprises and extends Russell’s ontological criticisms so\nthat they become a critique of fictional entities in particular. He\nprovides a number of arguments that are intended to show that, first,\nsuch entities may violate some basic logical laws—not only the\nlaw of noncontradiction, but also the symmetry of identity—and,\nsecond, they may be problematically indeterminate with respect to both\ntheir existence and identity. These arguments are based on odd but\nintelligible stories in which, for example, one individual is both\nidentical to and distinct from another, or in which it is\nindeterminate whether a certain individual exists. The link to\nfictional characters is provided through the bridging principles (more\nrefined versions of such principles are provided in his 2013): \nEverett’s line of attack is interesting and innovative, and\n(given the worries expressed about language-focused arguments) in some\nways a model of how an antirealist should really pursue the battle\nagainst what she believes are ontological illusions. But the debate is\nnot likely to end there. Although at least one influential (erstwhile)\nrealist has conceded the power of Everett’s argument, proposing\nan antirealist notion of assumption-relative truth (Howell 2011, 2015)\nin place of the realist absolute notion he championed earlier (Howell\n1979), other realists are likely to think that Everett underestimates\nthe conceptual resources available to them. One may, for example,\nthink that the bridging principles as stated are too simple to be\napplied across the board, and that they can be precisified in a way\nthat is no longer ontologically problematic (Thomasson 2010). Or one\nmay say that a distinction between ontic indeterminacy in a\nstory and ontic indeterminacy with respect to, or\nout of, a story allows one to rebut the\nindeterminacy part of the critique (cf. Schneider & von Solodkoff\n2009 and Voltolini 2010). Alternatively, one may be able to rebut the\ncritique in its entirety by appealing to more or less familiar\nneo-Meinongian distinctions between (i) predicative and propositional\nnegation and (ii) modes of predication (alternatively, kinds of\nproperty) (cf. Voltolini 2010). Of course, antirealists take such\ndistinctions to be poorly understood and part of what makes realism an\nunattractive option in the first place (in addition, they may unusable\nin complex fiction-involving sentences (see again Everett 2013; for a\nreply, cf. Voltolini 2015b)), so even if such rebuttals are successful\non their own terms this is not likely to settle the\nrealism-antirealism debate.","contact.mail":"alberto.voltolini@unito.it","contact.domain":"unito.it"}]
