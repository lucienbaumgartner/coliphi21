Sometimes referred to as “the French\nFreud,” he is an important figure in the history of\npsychoanalysis. His teachings and writings explore the significance of\nFreud’s discovery of the unconscious both within the theory and\npractice of analysis itself as well as in connection with a wide range\nof other disciplines.  Particularly for those interested in the\nphilosophical dimensions of Freudian thought, Lacan’s oeuvre\nis invaluable.  Over the course of the past fifty-plus years, Lacanian\nideas have become central to the various receptions of things\npsychoanalytic in Continental philosophical circles especially.\n\n\n\nMedically trained as a psychiatrist, Lacan’s first texts\nstarted appearing in the late 1920s (during the course of his\npsychiatric studies), with his publishing activity really taking off in\nthe subsequent decade. The 1930s see several early Lacanian\nmilestones: the publication, in 1932, of his doctoral thesis in\npsychiatry, De la psychose paranoïaque dans ses rapports avec\nla personnalité (On Paranoid Psychosis in its Relations\nwith the Personality); collaborations with the Surrealist and\nDadaist artistic movements in whose midsts he circulated as a familiar\nfellow traveler; entry into analytic training, including a\ndidactic analysis with Rudolph Lowenstein; attendance at\nAlexandre Kojève’s renowned seminars on G.W.F.\nHegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit; the first\npresentation of the now-famous theory of the “mirror stage”\nat the International Psychoanalytic Association (IPA) conference at\nMarienbad in 1936 (a presentation truncated by Freud’s friend and\nbiographer, then-IPA President Ernest Jones); and, the\nappearance, in the Encyclopédie française in\n1938, of a substantial essay on a sizable swathe of analytic topics\nentitled Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de\nl’individu: Essai d’analyse d’une fonction en\npsychologie (“The Family Complexes in the Formation of the\nIndividual: Attempt at an Analysis of a Function in\nPsychology”). This crucial period of Lacan’s development, as\nthe immediately preceding already indicates, was marked by the\ncollision of interests and influences related to psychoanalysis,\npsychiatry, philosophy, art, and literature, among other areas.\nMore specifically, the robustly interdisciplinary combination that came\ntogether for Lacan at this time of Freudian analysis, Hegelian\ndialectics, Kojèvian pedagogy, and different experiences of\n“madness” from numerous perspectives indelibly colors and\npermanently inflects the entire rest of Lacan’s intellectual\nitinerary. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the Second World War was, for Lacan (and, of course,\nfor history generally), a period of disruption and upheaval. His\npsychoanalytic activities were interrupted, including his training\nanalysis (Lowenstein and Lacan did not concur about whether this\nanalysis was well and truly completed, with Lacan deciding it was over\nand, somewhat controversially, never returning to Lowenstein’s\ncouch). The War provided Lacan with an exposure to military psychiatry\nin both France and England, with his five-week visit to the latter\nacquainting him with aspects of the British psychoanalytic world\n(features of this visit are recounted in “British Psychiatry and\nthe War” [1947]). A handful of important texts were composed\nduring and after the War, all of which eventually got reprinted in\nLacan’s magnum opus, Écrits (1966):\n“Logical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty: A New\nSophism” (1945); “Presentation on Psychical\nCausality” (1946); “Aggressiveness in\nPsychoanalysis” (1948); and “The Mirror Stage as Formative\nof the I Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic\nExperience” (delivered in 1949 at the IPA conference in\nZurich—whereas the 1936 version from Marienbad is lost, this\nversion is the surviving one made canonical through its inclusion\nin Écrits). \n\nThe next decade was pivotal in Lacan’s trajectory, the time\nwhen he fully came into his own as a leading analytic thinker of great\noriginality and immense import. A veritable explosion of Lacanian\nmaterial was unleashed during this period, including seven annual\nseminars and many of the most celebrated essays subsequently collected\nin the nine-hundred-page Écrits (a number of these were\nhyper-condensed distillations of the results of the annual\nseminars). At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s,\nLacan became initiated into and conversant with the structuralism of\nFerdinand de Saussure and his inheritors such as Claude\nLévi-Strauss and Roman Jakobson.\nLévi-Strauss’s 1949 book The Elementary Structures of\nKinship helped launch the French structuralist movement that\nflourished during the 1950s and 1960s, an orientation that challenged\nthe theoretical primacy of existentialism in France.\nLévi-Strauss “structuralized” anthropology, as\nRoland Barthes did for literary-cultural studies and Louis Althusser\nfor Marxism. Up through the end of the 1950s—in 1959–1960,\na fundamental reorienting shift arguably occurred in Lacan’s\nthinking—Lacan fairly can be portrayed as likewise\nstructuralizing Freudian psychoanalysis. He did so under the\nbanner of a “return to Freud” according to which, as his\nmost famous dictum has it, “the unconscious is structured like a\nlanguage” (l’inconscient est structuré comme un\nlangage). Lacan portrayed himself as the lone defender of a\nFreudian orthodoxy in danger of being eclipsed by its alleged\nabandonment and betrayal in the post-Freudian analytic universe,\nparticularly Anglo-American ego psychology as consolidated by the\ntroika of Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, and Lacan’s former analyst\nLowenstein. Lacan adamantly maintained that a Saussurian-assisted\nrecovery of the overriding significance of language for analysis both\nclinical and metapsychological is the key to faithfully carrying\nforward Freud’s revolutionary approach to psychical\nsubjectivity. All of this was announced in detail in the lengthy\nfounding manifesto of Lacanianism, the 1953 écrit\n“The Function and Field of Speech and Language in\nPsychoanalysis” (often referred to as the “Rome\nDiscourse” because of where it was delivered). This\nmanifesto coincided with Lacan’s participation in an exodus from\nhis former analytic institute, the Société Parisienne de\nPsychanalyse (SPP), and the founding of a new institute, the\nSociété Française de Psychanalyse (SFP). The\nSPP’s move to a medicalized model of analytic training (as per\nthe scientistic psychiatric paradigm that was dominant in the\ninstitutes of the English-speaking world) was one of the main\nprecipitators of the departure of the breakaway faction that founded\nthe SFP. \n\nAlso in 1953, Lacan conducted his first annual seminar addressing\nFreud’s Papers on Technique (1953–1954). Lacan\ncontinued giving these right up until shortly before his death, with\nle Séminaire running continuously for twenty-seven\nyears. As was the case with Kojève, Lacan exerted\nhis influence primarily through his oral teachings. The first\ndecade of le Séminaire (1953–1963) was taught at the\nHôpital Sainte-Anne and had an audience consisting mostly of\npsychoanalysts. For reasons I will explain shortly, Lacan, in\n1964, moved his seminar first to the École Normale\nSupérieure (1964–1969) and then to the Faculty of Law across\nfrom the Panthéon (1969–1980). From 1964 onwards,\nLacan’s audience startlingly increased in both sheer numbers and\nbreadth of backgrounds, with artists and academics from various\ndisciplines across academia joining the more clinically-minded\nattendees. Le Séminaire became a nodal Parisian\nintellectual institution, a kind of hub attracting some of the\nbrightest stars of the post-War French cultural firmament. For\ninstance, such philosophers as Jean Hyppolite, Michel Foucault, Gilles\nDeleuze, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva spent time in Lacan’s\naudience. In his seminars, Lacan deftly maneuvered within and\nbetween a multitude of theoretical currents, putting psychoanalysis\ninto conversation with the history of philosophy, phenomenology,\nexistentialism, structuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, and, as\nalready indicated, just about every discipline represented in the\nuniversity. All of the major French philosophers of the\ngeneration that came of age in the 1960s and 1970s engaged with\nFreudian analysis in one way or another, and all of them did so in\nfashions varyingly informed by Lacan’s teachings. \n\nThe 1960s were a highly productive and equally tumultuous era in\nLacan’s history. In his seventh seminar on The Ethics\nof Psychoanalysis (1959–1960), Lacan took a sort of turn fateful\nfor the direction of his later trajectory, initiating an interrogation\nof the ways in which language was privileged by his 1950s “return\nto Freud.” The immediately prior years tirelessly\nemphasized the essential role of the register of the Symbolic, namely,\nthe pride of place of analytically modified versions of Saussurian\nsignifiers in the structures and dynamics of the unconscious and\nspeaking subjectivity (in the 1930s and 1940s, the phenomenal-visual\nregister of the Imaginary was to the fore thanks to the focus on the\nmirror stage). At the end of the 1950s, with the rise of the Real\nas the register of a new focus of Lacan’s thinking—I will\nsay more about Lacan’s tripartite register theory subsequently\n(see 2.1 below)—things and phenomena escaping, resisting, or\nthwarting the signifying powers of the socio-linguistic symbolic order\nbecame ever more central in Lacanian theory. These things and\nphenomena include Otherness, drives, jouissance, and objet\npetit a, among other Lacanian concepts\n (see 2.3,\n 2.4.2, and\n2.4.3 below).\n This 1959–1960 seminar defensibly can be depicted\nas a prescient post-structuralist text avant la lettre. \n\nAn earthquake in Lacan’s professional and personal histories hit him\nin 1963. For ten years (1953–1963), the SFP, following its\ncreation after the defections from the SPP, was being scrutinized at\nlength by the IPA as a training institute applying for IPA\nmembership. To cut a long story short, the IPA ended up offering the\nSFP an ultimatum: It could be admitted only if Lacan was struck from\nits list of training analysts. Lacan’s non-standard\n“variable-length sessions,” deviating from the\nfixed-length session rules of IPA orthodoxy, was the main reason for\nthe IPA’s withholding of its recognition from him. The SFP accepted\nthis condition, stripping Lacan of his standing within it. In the\naftermath of what he understandably experienced as a deeply wounding\nbetrayal, he abandoned his original plans for a 1963–1964\nseminar on The Names-of-the-Father (only its opening session\nof November 20, 1963 was given), relocated his teaching from the\nHôpital Sainte-Anne to the École Normale\nSupérieure, and conducted his deservedly renowned eleventh\nseminar of 1964, The Four Fundamental Concepts of\nPsychoanalysis (with Lacan identifying these four concepts as the\nunconscious, repetition, the transference, and the drive). This\nseminar’s opening session involved Lacan discussing his SFP-brokered\n“excommunication” from the IPA, with him comparing himself\nto Baruch Spinoza and the latter’s expulsion from the Jewish community\nfor being a heretic. However traumatic this blow, it seemed to prompt\nLacan to come even more into his own, to forge a distinctly Lacanian\nbattery of ideas and terms—and this by contrast with the more\nfamiliar Freudian language and apparatus of the first decade of le\nSéminaire (1953–1963).  Although not without many\nprecedents in his prior work, a Lacanianism distinct from Freudianism\nbegan to emerge clearly into view in the mid-1960s. In the shadow of\nhis rejection by the IPA and departure from the SFP, Lacan founded his\nown analytic organization, the École freudienne de Paris. This\nnew institutional framework (and freedom) provided him with a setting\nin which to experiment with novel approaches to analytic teaching and\ntraining. \n\nIn 1966, Lacan’s hulking tome Écrits was\npublished by Éditions du Seuil. Prior to this, Lacan had\npublished only a single book, his thesis in psychiatry (1932).\nThe nine-hundred-page Écrits gathered together many of\nLacan’s most important articles and essays into a single volume,\ncovering a thirty-year stretch from 1936 to 1966. These\n“writings” provide very daunting and demanding paths of\nentry into Lacanian thinking (the annual seminars are comparatively\nmore reader-friendly and transparent). Although the\nÉcrits bear no small portion of responsibility for\nLacan’s reputation as a “difficult” (if not\ndeliberately obscurantist) thinker, this book became a bestseller upon\nits initial release in France. Its success elevated Lacan into\nhis fame as the French Freud in the eyes of France’s reading\npublic. During this time, Lacan’s audience for le\nSéminaire continued to swell, with his influence growing to\ncover ever-wider circles of Paris-centered intellectual and cultural\nlife. \n\nThroughout his career, Lacan exhibited a serious interest in various\nbranches of mathematical and formal disciplines. This goes as far\nback as the 1940s, with the recourse to game theory in “Logical\nTime and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty.” The turn\nto structuralism at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s\nreinforced these formalistic tendencies, with Lacan, in the 1950s,\nalready drawing upon not only game theory, Lévi-Straussian\nanthropology, and Jakobsonian phonology, but also the history of\nmathematics and topology. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, more\nand more diagrams, graphs, and symbolizations appeared peppered\nthroughout Lacan’s lectures and writings, testifying to a\nsteadily intensifying trend toward formalization. By the late\n1960s and, especially, the 1970s, discussions of logic, topology, and\nknot theory were prominent (sometimes even dominant) features of\nLacanian discourse. In relation to Lacan, the 1970s could be\ncharacterized as the decade of the “matheme,” Lacan’s\nneologism for a unit of formalization (qua a\nmathematical-style symbolization) distilling and fixing the core\nsignificance of a specific Lacanian analytic concept-term. Lacan\nhoped thereby to avoid being misinterpreted in the ways that\nFreud’s deceptively accessible employments of natural language\nallegedly allowed most non-Lacanian post-Freudians to perpetrate.\nAdditionally, topology, as a science of surfaces, provided Lacan with\nresources for his regular assaults on the crude, popular images of\npsychoanalysis as a “depth psychology,” with these images\nrelying upon the simplistic two- and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces\nof spontaneous picture thinking. Topological figures and\nconstructions undermining the intuitions of this picture thinking\nassisted Lacan in recasting the unconscious as an ensemble of\ncontortions, curvings, folding, inflections, twists, and turns immanent\nand internal to a single plane of minded subjectivity accessible to\nrigorous, rational (psycho)analysis. \n\nIn addition to the pursuit of formalization via mathemes, the seminars\nof the final decade of Lacan’s teachings also were preoccupied with\nreflections on his register theory, especially the register of the\nReal, and sexual difference (reflections often intertwined with each\nother). The program of formalization ostensibly enabled Lacan to\nreveal with exactitude the precise limits of the sayable and the\nrepresentable, thereby touching upon the Real through showing what is\nnot pinned down fully and adequately within the coordinates of the\naccessible, familiar “reality” co-constituted through the\nother two registers of the Imaginary and the Symbolic\n(see 2.1 below). Various aspects and facets of\nthings sexual came to be associated by the later Lacan with the\nenigmatic evasiveness of the Real, including sexual difference. In one\nof his most famous seminars, the twentieth (Encore,\n1972–1973), he theorized sexual difference as\n“sexuation,” depicting the non-biological, denaturalized\nsubject-positions of masculinity and femininity in terms of formal\nlogic. Therein, he purported to uncover an inherent, ineliminable\nstructural discrepancy/gap separating the sexes, an inescapable\ncondemnation of sexed subjects to being essentially, necessarily\nout-of-sync with each other (and even with themselves as split\nsubjects). Lacan summarized this with an infamous one-liner:\n“Il n’y a pas de rapport sexuel” (There is no\nsexual relationship). This declaration scandalized many at the\ntime. Moreover, the twentieth seminar in particular as well as\nconnected portions of Lacan’s corpus from this same period served as\npowerful catalysts for crucial developments in French feminist\nthinking during the 1970s. \n\nIn 1980, near the end of his life, Lacan saw fit to disband his\nschool, the École freudienne. This decision was\ncontroversial and triggered factional infighting amongst his\nfollowers. Lacan died in 1981. His son-in-law and editor of\nle Séminaire, Jacques-Alain Miller—when he was a\nstudent of Althusser’s at the ENS, Miller met Lacan for the first\ntime in 1964 as an attendee of Lacan’s eleventh\nseminar—founded the École de la Cause freudienne as a\nsuccessor to the École freudienne on the heels of the\nlatter’s “dissolution.” Miller has since\nretained publishing control over Lacan’s texts, editing the Champ\nfreudien book series in which official “established”\nversions of the annual seminars and other Lacanian writings appear. \n\nThe theory of the three registers of the Imaginary, the Symbolic,\nand the Real forms the skeletal framework for the various concepts and\nphases of most of Lacan’s intellectual itinerary. His\ncharacterizations of each of the three registers, as well as of their\nrelations with each other, undergo multiple revisions and shifts over\nthe many years of his labors. As will become increasingly evident\nin what follows, the majority of Lacanian concepts are defined in\nconnection with all three registers. By the 1970s, with his\nmeditations on the topological figure of the Borromean knot—this\nknotting of three rings, pictured on the coat of arms of the Borromeo\nfamily, is arranged such that if one ring is broken, all three are set\nfree in disconnection—Lacan emphasizes the mutual dependence of\nthe registers on one another. Hence, loosely speaking, the\nImaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real can be thought of as the three\nfundamental dimensions of psychical subjectivity à la\nLacan. Furthermore, scholars sometimes segment Lacan’s\nevolution into three main periods, with each period being distinguished\nby the priority of one of the registers: the early Lacan of the\nImaginary (1930s and 1940s), the middle Lacan of the Symbolic (1950s),\nand the late Lacan of the Real (1960s and 1970s). However, such a\nneat and clean periodization should be taken with several grains of\nsalt, since intricate continuities and discontinuities not conforming\nto this early-middle-late schema are to be found across the entire\nlengthy span of Lacan’s teachings. \n\nLacan tends to associate (albeit not exclusively) the Imaginary with\nthe restricted spheres of consciousness and self-awareness. It is\nthe register with the closest links to what people experience as\nnon-psychoanalytic quotidian reality. Who and what one\n“imagines” other persons to be, what one thereby\n“imagines” they mean when communicatively interacting, who\nand what one “imagines” oneself to be, including from the\nimagined perspectives of others—all of the preceding is\nencompassed under the heading of this register. Such a\ndescription indicates the ways in which the Imaginary points to core\nanalytic ideas like transference, fantasy, and the ego. In\nparticular, the Imaginary is central to Lacan’s account(s) of\nego-formation (as per the mirror\n stage—see 2.2 below). \n\nAs Lacan integrates his early work of the 1930s and 1940s with his\nstructuralism-informed theories of the 1950s, he comes to emphasize the\ndependence of the Imaginary on the Symbolic. This dependency\nmeans that more sensory-perceptual phenomena (images and experiences of\none’s body, affects as consciously lived emotions, envisionings\nof the thoughts and feelings of others, etc.) are shaped, steered, and\n(over)determined by socio-linguistic structures and dynamics.\nWith the growing importance of the Real in the 1960s and the Borromean\nknots of the 1970s, it becomes clear that Lacan conceives of the\nImaginary as bound up with both of the other two registers\n(incidentally, the Imaginary and the Symbolic, when taken together as\nmutually integrated, constitute the field of “reality,”\nitself contrasted with the Real). In fact, it could be maintained\nthat the Imaginary invariably involves category mistakes. More\nspecifically, it is the register in which the other two registers are\nmistaken for each other: What is Real is misrecognized as\nSymbolic (for example, as in particular sorts of obsessional-neurotic\nand paranoid-psychotic symptoms, certain meaningless contingent\noccurrences at the level of the material world of non-human objects are\nviewed as though they were meaningful signs full of deep significance\nto be deciphered and interpreted) and what is Symbolic is misrecognized\nas Real (for example, as in psychosomatic-type “conversion\nsymptoms,” unconscious mental conflicts encoded in language and\nideas are suffered as bodily afflictions and ailments). \n\nWith his choice of the word “imaginary,” Lacan indeed\nintends to designate that which is fictional, simulated, virtual, and\nthe like. However, the phenomena of the Imaginary are necessary\nillusions (to put it in Kantian locution) or real abstractions (to put\nit in Marxian parlance). This signals two points. First, as\none of Lacan’s three basic, essential registers, the Imaginary is\nan intrinsic, unavoidable dimension of the existences of speaking\npsychical subjects; just as an analysis cannot (and should not\ntry to) rid the analysand of his/her unconscious, so too is it neither\npossible nor desirable to liquidate the illusions of this\nregister. Second, the fictional abstractions of the Imaginary,\nfar from being merely “unreal” as ineffective,\ninconsequential epiphenomena, are integral to and have very concrete\neffects upon actual, factual human realities. \n\nThe Lacanian Symbolic initially is theorized on the basis of\nresources provided by structuralism. Tied to natural languages as\ncharacterized by Saussure and specific post-Saussurians, this register\nalso refers to the customs, institutions, laws, mores, norms,\npractices, rituals, rules, traditions, and so on of cultures and\nsocieties (with these things being entwined in various ways with\nlanguage). Lacan’s phrase “symbolic order,”\nwhich encompasses all of the preceding, can be understood as roughly\nequivalent to what Hegel designates as “objective\nspirit.” This non-natural universe is an elaborate set of\ninter-subjective and trans-subjective contexts into which individual\nhuman beings are thrown at birth (along the lines of Heideggerian\nGeworfenheit), a pre-existing order preparing places for them\nin advance and influencing the vicissitudes of their ensuing lives. \n\nAccording to Lacan, one of the (if not the) most significant and\nindispensable conditions of possibility for singular subjectivity is\nthe collective symbolic order (sometimes named “the big\nOther,” a phrase to be unpacked further\nshortly—see 2.3 below). Individual\nsubjects are what they are in and through the mediation of the\nsocio-linguistic arrangements and constellations of the register of\nthe Symbolic. Especially during the period of the “return to\nFreud,” the analytic unconscious (qua “structured\nlike a language”) is depicted as kinetic networks of interlinked\nsignifiers (i.e., “signifying chains”). Rendered thusly,\nthe unconscious, being of a Symbolic (anti-)nature in and of itself,\nis to be interpretively engaged with via the Symbolic medium of\nspeech, namely, the very substance of the being-in-itself of the\nspeaking subject (parlêtre) of the\nunconscious. Furthermore, the Lacanian unconscious is structured like\n“un langage” and not “une\nlangue.” Although both French words translate into English\nas “language,” the former (langage) refers to\nlogics and structures of syntax and semantics not necessarily specific\nto particular natural languages, whereas the latter (langue),\nwhich also could be translated into English as “tongue,”\ndoes refer to the notion of a natural language. Hence, Lacan is not\nsaying that the unconscious is structured like French, German,\nEnglish, Spanish, or any other particular natural language. \n\nAlthough the register of the Symbolic comes to the fore only with\nLacan’s structuralist phase of the 1950s, it arguably is not\nwithout its precursors in his earlier texts. Already in 1938, the\nidea of the “complex” in the encyclopedia article on\n“The Family Complexes” anticipates how Lacan recasts the\nFreudian Oedipus complex via Lévi-Straussian structural\nanthropology. Similarly, the prisoners’ dilemma scenario\nnarrated in 1945’s “Logical Time and the Assertion of\nAnticipated Certainty” illustrates how a formal, game-theoretic\napparatus governs the lived experiences of subjects inserted into\nit. Moreover, the 1949 écrit on “The Mirror\nStage” hints at the enabling background presence of a\nsocio-symbolic milieu (incarnated first and foremost by parental\ncaregivers) as the trigger prompting the child’s identification\nwith mirrored images of him/her-self (as I will discuss subsequently\nhere, this hint is expanded and embellished upon by Lacan in 1960s-era\nrevisions of the mirror stage—see 2.2 below). \n\nDespite the rise to prominence of the register of the Real beginning\naround 1959–1960, the Symbolic continues to play pivotal roles in\nLacan’s teachings right up until the start of the 1980s.\nFor instance, in Seminar XVII (1969–1970) and the\ncontemporaneous interview “Radiophonie,” Lacan\nforges his theory of the “four discourses” (those of the\n“master”, “university,” “hysteric,”\nand “analyst”) to reflect the interlinked permutations of\nmultiple kinds of “social links” configuring the relations\nbetween speaking subjects. More generally, the later Lacan\nremains reliant on the notion of the Real sides of the Symbolic, these\nbeing signifiers in their meaningless, nonsensical materiality as\nvisible marks and audible sounds (i.e., “letters” in\nLacan’s technical sense)—and this by contrast with the\nImaginary sides of the Symbolic, in which signifiers are paired with\nsignifieds to form meaningful, significant signs (à la\nSaussure’s classic explanation of successful communication via\nnatural language). Such senseless signifiers and their\nenchainings amount to a late Lacanian rendition of Freudian primary\nprocesses as the thinking distinctive of unconscious mindedness. \n\nWhen Lacan mentions “structure,” a word to which he has\nfrequent recourse, he usually is thinking of his register of the\nSymbolic. Between the periods of his “return to\nFreud” and later teachings, Lacan reconsiders and alters what is\nconceptualized under the heading of the “like a language”\n(comme un langage) part of his fundamental claim that,\n“the unconscious is structured like a language.”\nHowever, from the 1950s until his death, his specific rendition of\nFreud’s discovery consistently holds to the thesis that,\n“the unconscious is structured.” That is to say, the\nunconscious, as bound up with that which is Symbolic, is an intricate,\nlabyrinthine web of ideational representations interconnected in\nmultiple sophisticated manners. Contrary to the crudeness of\ncommonplace vulgar picturings of Freudian analysis as an irrationalist,\nneo-romantic psychology of the unruly natural depths, the unconscious\nis not the id, namely, an anarchic seething cauldron of unthinking\nanimalistic instincts (i.e., something unstructured). \n\nThe register of the Real is tricky to encapsulate and evades being\npinned down through succinct definitions. Lacan’s numerous\nand shifting pronouncements apropos the Real are themselves partly\nresponsible for this absence of straightforwardness. But, rather\nthan being just a barrier to grasping the Real, this absence is itself\nrevelatory of this register. To be more precise, as that which is\nforeign to Imaginary-Symbolic reality—this reality is the realm\ncontaining conscious apprehension, communicable significance, and the\nlike—the Real is intrinsically elusive, resisting by nature\ncapture in the comprehensibly meaningful formulations of concatenations\nof Imaginary-Symbolic signs. It is, as Lacan stresses again and\nagain, an “impossibility” vis-à-vis\nreality. \n\nLacan’s earliest employments of the term “Real”\nuse it to refer to material being(s) an sich, namely,\nto physical existents handled as roughly equivalent to Kant’s\nthings-in-themselves. The Real hence would be whatever is beyond,\nbehind, or beneath phenomenal appearances accessible to the direct\nexperiences of first-person awareness. This characterization of\nthe Real persists into the first versions of Lacan’s mature\nregister theory as initially elaborated throughout the 1950s.\nDuring this decade of the “return to Freud,” the Real also\ngets connected to Lacan’s contemporaneously emerging conceptions\nof psychosis and Otherness (the latter to be addressed soon—see\n2.3 below). Additionally, in the 1950s, \nLacan tends to speak of\nthe Real as an absolute fullness, a pure plenum devoid of the\nnegativities of absences, antagonisms, gaps, lacks, splits, etc.\nPortrayed thusly, the Symbolic is primarily responsible for injecting\nsuch negativities into the Real. For instance, only though the\npowers of language can material being in itself be said to be\n“missing” things, since, on its own, this dimension of\nbeing always is simply whatever it is in its dumb, idiotic presence as\nnever more and never less than sheer, indifferent plenitude. \n\nAs I noted above, the seventh seminar of 1959–1960 marks a shift\naway from the privileging of the Symbolic over the course of the 1950s\nand toward prioritizing the Real. The Real prior to Seminar\nVII tends to be depicted in non-dialectical and/or quasi-Kantian\nterms. Although Kant is one of the main explicit foci during this\nacademic year, Lacan’s sustained reformulation of the Real in\nthis seminar introduces quasi-Hegelian dialectical features into it,\nthereby nuancing and complicating his ideas about this register.\nThe new Real involves convergences of opposites as a register of\nvolatile oscillations and unstable reversals between excesses and\nlacks, surpluses and deficits, flooding presences and draining\nabsences. In the seventh seminar, Lacan puts forward the figure\nof the mother as the key analytic referent justifying this rendition of\nthe Real (a figure he relates to another figure, that of “the\nLady” in the courtly love tradition). In the beginning of\nthe psychical-libidinal subject’s ontogentic life history, the\nmaternal caretaker is, at one and the same time, both overwhelmingly,\nstiflingly present or near and, in her strange, impenetrable alterity,\nalso frustratingly, uncontrollably absent or inaccessible; there\nis either too much or too little of her, never the right balanced\namount. With the passage of time and the temporal transformations\nof the libidinal economy, the mother, as this archaic Real Other,\nbecomes the forever unattainable “Sovereign Good,” the\nfixed vanishing point, of all desiring (what Lacan calls, in dialogue\nwith the history of philosophy as well as Freud, “das\nDing” [la Chose, the Thing]). \n\nThroughout the 1960s and up through the end of Lacan’s\nteachings, the Real takes on an ever increasing number of aspects and\nconnotations. It becomes both a transcendence troubling and\nthwarting Imaginary-Symbolic reality and its language from without as\nwell as an immanence perturbing and subverting reality/language from\nwithin. It comes to be associated with libidinal negativities\n(objet petit a, jouissance, and sexual difference,\nall to be discussed later—see 2.3, \n2.4.2, and 2.4.3 below),\nmaterial meaninglessness both linguistic (see 2.1.2 above) and\nnon-linguistic, contingent traumatic events, unbearable bodily\nintensities, anxiety, and death. \n\nAs regards the unconscious as the principle concern of\npsychoanalysis, the later Lacan combines his earlier emphasis on\nsocio-linguistic formations (à la “the\nunconscious is structured like a language”) with a subsequent\nstress on forces and factors internal but irreducible to these\nformations. After the 1950s, Real dimensions are added to the\nunconscious, with its Symbolic dimensions being made to orbit around\nblack holes of unsymbolizability impossible to represent via the\nsignifier-like ideational representations (Freud’s\nVorstellungen) of the language-like sides of the\nunconscious. Nonetheless, the rise of the Real in Lacan’s\nteachings does not amount to him converting to any sort of analytic\nrecapitulation of mysticisms or negative theologies. Instead, for\nLacan, analysis both theoretical and clinical permits delineating and\ntracking the Real with conceptual precision, if only as an exercise in\npinpointing the exact limits of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and their\noverlappings. \n\nThe account of the mirror stage is perhaps Lacan’s most famous\ntheoretical contribution (maybe even more famous than the well-known\nthesis apropos the unconscious as “structured like a\nlanguage”). Initially developed in the 1930s, this account\ninvolves a number of interrelated ingredients. Lacan offers the\nnarrative of this stage as an explanation specifically for the genesis\nand functions of the Freudian psychical agency of the ego\n(Ich, moi). One of the psychoanalytic and\nphilosophical upshots of the mirror stage, a crucial one in\nLacan’s eyes, is that the ego is an object rather than a\nsubject. In other words, the ego, despite conscious senses to the\ncontrary, is not a locus of autonomous agency, the seat of a free, true\n“I” determining its own fate. This portrait of the\nego-as-object is at the heart of Lacan’s lifelong critical\npolemics against Anglo-American ego psychology, with the ego\npsychologists seeking to strengthen their patients’ egos by\nappealing to supposed autonomous and “conflict-free” sides\nof these psychical agencies. Against this, Lacan views the ego as\nthoroughly compromised and inherently neurotic to its very core, as a\npassionate defense of a constitutive ignorance of the unconscious. \n\nTo stay at this more general metapsychological level for a little\nwhile longer, Lacan eventually forges, partly on the basis of the\nmirror stage, a distinction between the ego (moi) and the\nsubject (sujet, a word freighted with philosophical\nbaggage—Lacan knowingly adds this word and its philosophical\nvocabulary to analytic discourse, although Freud did not speak of\n“the subject” and was wary of philosophy).\nAppearances notwithstanding, the ego is, when all is said and done, an\ninert, fixed bundle of objectified coordinates, a libidinally invested\nand reified entity. By contrast with the ego and the illusory\nsense of fictional selfhood it supports, the psychoanalytic subject of\nLacanianism is an unconscious kinetic negativity defying capture by and\nwithin ego-level identificatory constructs. The Lacanian\nenunciating subject of the unconscious speaks through the ego while\nremaining irreducibly distinct from it. \n\nReturning to a tighter focus on the mirror stage proper, Lacan,\nrelying on empirical data from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth\ncenturies, posits that very young children, between the ages of six and\neighteen months, quickly acquire the ability to identify their own\nimages in reflective surfaces. At this time, infants are lacking\nin most physical and mental abilities possessed by older human\nbeings. Prior to Lacan, Freud already highlights how a\nbiologically dictated prematurational helplessness\n(Hilflosigkeit) naturally predestines the human being to the\npredominance of social nurture over material nature due to the\nprotracted period of total reliance on other persons for one’s\nlife-or-death vital requirements. Following Freud here, Lacan\nfleshes out this helplessness into which birth throws neonates,\ndescribing in detail the anatomical, physiological, cognitive,\nemotional, and motivational facets of this natural condition of\npost-birth prematurity. \n\nThis initial state of helpless “motor impotence and nursling\ndependence” entails the infant experiencing a swirl of negative\naffects: anxiety, distress, frustration, and so on. To the\nyoung child, motivated by these negative affects, a crucial component\nof the enthralling lure exerted by the fascinating image of his/her\nbody is this image’s promise that he/she can overcome his/her\nHilflosigkeit and be a unified, pulled-together whole, an\nintegrated, coordinated totality like the bigger, more mature others\nhe/she sees around him/her-self (however, according to Lacan,\nindividuals spend their entire lives, beginning thusly, chasing in vain\nafter an unattainable state of harmony and mastery first falsely\npromised by the mirror). This imago-Gestalt of virtual\nwholeness, identified with by the infant in a jubilant moment of\n“Aha!,” lays down the imagistic nucleus of the thereafter\nontogenetically accreting ego as a series of self-objectifications in\nimages and, soon after with the event of language acquisition, words\ntoo. \n\nFor Lacan, identification with the imago-Gestalt of the\nmoi entails alienation—and this for additional reasons\nover and above those given in the preceding paragraphs. Already\nin the 1949 écrit on the mirror stage, mention is made\nof “some prop, human or artificial” supporting the infant\nas he/she gazes into the mirror and looks at him/her-self. In\n1949, Lacan seems to think of this prop more as artificial than human,\nreferring to the “trotte-bébé”\n(walker) leaned on by the child. But, in subsequent revisitations\nof the mirror stage during the 1960s, Lacan dramatically highlights the\nsupporting role of fellow human beings instead. In so doing, he\nargues that the infant is encouraged to identify with the mirror image\nas “me” by verbal and gestural prompts issuing from the\nbigger other(s) holding him/her up in front of the reflective surface\n(for example, the utterance “That’s you there!”\naccompanied by pointing and grinning). This later shift of\nemphasis has two crucial consequences. First, the Imaginary\nregister of the mirror does not precede the Symbolic register of\nlanguage and sociality in a linear chronology of developmental stages\n(as the earlier text of “The Mirror Stage” might be at risk\nof suggesting); if anything, socio-linguistic variables (for\ninstance, the words and body language of parents) are the causal\ntriggers of the child’s investment in select sensory-perceptual\nexperiences (such as the body image in the mirror). Second, this\nmeans that the imagistic nucleus of the ego is suffused from the get-go\nwith the destinal “discourse of the Other”—in this\ncase, fateful significations (in Lacanese, “unary traits”)\ncoming from caregivers’ narratives articulated simultaneously\nalong with their encouragements to the child to recognize him/her-self\nin the mirror (“What a handsome boy!,” “What a\nbeautiful girl!,” “You’re going to grow up to be big\nand strong, just like your daddy,” etc.). \n\nAs a result of all of the above, Lacan considers the recognition\nthat happens in the mirror stage to amount to\n“misrecognition” (méconnaissance).\nThis likewise holds throughout life for all ensuing experiences of\n“recognizing” oneself as being a particular kind of\n“I,” namely, taking qua imagining oneself to be a\ncertain sort of ego-level self (apropos Freudian-Lacanian\npsychoanalysis, it always pays to remember William Wordsworth’s\nline, “The child is the father of the man”). The ego\nis not only a congealed, heteronomous object rather than fluid,\nautonomous subject, but also, in its very origins, a repository for the\nprojected desires and fantasies of larger others; the\nchild’s image is a receptacle for his/her parents’ dreams\nand wishes, with his/her body image being always-already overwritten by\nsignifiers flowing from the libidinal economies of other speaking\nbeings. Hence, recognizing the ego as “me,” as\nembodying and representing an authentic, private, unique selfhood that\nis most genuinely my own, is tantamount to misrecognizing that, at\nroot, the ego ultimately is an alienating foreign introject through\nwhich I am seduced and subjected by others’ conscious and\nunconscious wants and machinations. To borrow one of\nLacan’s many neologisms, the ego ultimately is something\n“extimate” (i.e., intimately exterior, an internal\nexternality) insofar as it crystallizes “the desire of the\nOther” (qua others’ conscious and unconscious\nwants and machinations). Or, as the Lacan of the eleventh seminar\nwould put it, there is something in the me more than the me itself to\nthe extent that this moi essentially is a coagulation of\ninter-subjective and trans-subjective alien influences. \n\nFinally, Lacan’s utilization of the idea of the mirror is not\nexclusively literal. Although he often talks of mirrors as shiny\nreflective surfaces, he does not limit mirroring to being a visible\nphysical phenomenon alone. Most importantly, other persons’\nspeech, gestures, postures, moods, facial expressions, and so on\nfrequently can be said to “mirror” back to one an\n“image” of oneself, namely, a conveyed sense of how one\n“appears” from other perspectives. \n\nThroughout his teachings, Lacan regularly utilizes the terms\n“other” (with a lower-case o) and “Other” (with\na capital O). Given an understanding of Lacan’s register\ntheory and the mirror stage (see 2.1 and\n 2.2 above), these terms can be\nclarified with relative ease and brevity. The lower-case-o other\ndesignates the Imaginary ego and its accompanying alter-egos. By\nspeaking of the ego itself as an “other,” Lacan further\nunderscores its alien and alienating status as spelled out in the\nimmediately preceding sub-section here (see 2.2 above).\nAdditionally, when relating to others as alter-egos, one does so on the\nbasis of what one “imagines” about them (often imagining\nthem to be “like me,” to share a set of\nlowest-common-denominator thoughts, feelings, and inclinations making\nthem comprehensible to me). These transference-style imaginings\nare fictions taming and domesticating the mysterious, unsettling\nforeignness of one’s conspecifics, thereby rendering social life\ntolerable and navigable. \n\nThe capital-O Other refers to two additional types of otherness\ncorresponding to the registers of the Symbolic and the Real. The\nfirst type of Other is Lacan’s “big Other”\nqua symbolic order, namely, the overarching “objective\nspirit” of trans-individual socio-linguistic structures\nconfiguring the fields of inter-subjective interactions.\nRelatedly, the Symbolic big Other also can refer to (often\nfantasmatic/fictional) ideas of anonymous authoritative power and/or\nknowledge (whether that of God, Nature, History, Society, State, Party,\nScience, or the analyst as the “subject supposed to know”\n[sujet supposé savoir] as per Lacan’s distinctive\naccount of analytic transference). But, as already becomes\nevident in Lacan’s first few annual seminars of the early 1950s,\nthere also is a Real dimension to Otherness. This particular\nincarnation of the Real, about which Lacan goes into greatest detail\nwhen addressing both love and psychosis, is the provocative, perturbing\nenigma of the Other as an unknowable “x,” an unfathomable\nabyss of withdrawn-yet-proximate alterity (in his 1895 Project for\na Scientific Psychology, to which Lacan refers repeatedly, Freud\ndepicts this alterity in the guise of the Nebenmensch als Ding\n[Neighbor-as-Thing]). \n\nFor Lacan, the Freudian Oedipus complex stages the drama of the\nchild’s laborious struggles to situate him/her-self\nvis-à-vis all three register-theoretic dimensions of\nOtherness. Thanks particularly to what he takes from his\nengagements with structuralism, Lacan, throughout his career, is\ncareful to avoid a pseudo-Freudian reification of the bourgeois nuclear\nfamily, with a mother and father biologically sexed female and male\nrespectively. The maternal and paternal Oedipal personas are\npsychical-subjective positions, namely, socio-cultural (i.e.,\nnon-natural, non-biological) roles that potentially can be played by\nany number of possible persons of various sexes/genders. \n\nThat noted, in the Lacanian version of the Oedipus complex, the\nmaternal figure initially features for the infant as a Real Other\n(i.e., the Nebenmensch als Ding)—more specifically, as\nan obscure omnipotent presence who is the source of all-important love\n(more will be said about Lacan’s concept of love—see \n2.4.1\nbelow). But, because of the combination of her obscurity and\nimportance, the mother qua Real Other also is a source of\ndeeply unsettling anxiety for the very young child. She seemingly\nthreatens her offspring with being alternately too smothering or too\nwithdrawn, too much or not enough. In his/her anxiousness about\ncontrolling the ultimately uncontrollable presence (and absence) of\nthis mysterious and indispensable maternal Other, the child confronts\nthe question, “What does the (m)Other want?” The\ninfant’s gradual formation of an ego as per the temporally\nelongated processes delineated in Lacan’s account of the mirror\nstage (see 2.2 above) is, in part, a \nresponse to this riddle (albeit in\na broader sense, with the child constructing an ego-level identity\ninformed by the perceived wants of Others in addition to the mother,\nsuch as the father). \n\nIn relation to the immediately preceding, Lacan’s Oedipal\nfather is an Other with both Symbolic and Real faces. On the\nSymbolic side, the paternal figure represents the answer to the\nquestion, “What does the maternal Other want?” In\nLacan’s terminology, the child’s alighting upon the\npaternal third party in the family romance of the Oedipal social\ntriangle as the solution to the puzzle of the maternal figure’s\nenigmatic intentionality amounts to “the desire of the\nmother,” as an unknown, being replaced by “the paternal\nmetaphor.” Directly connected to this, Lacan (re)defines\nthe phallus (which is not the penis) as the structural function of\nwhatever “x” the child hypothesizes the paternal figure\npossesses making him the focus of the maternal figure’s desire,\nthat is, the possession enabling the father to domesticate and control\nthe mother’s otherwise unpredictable desire. Also at the\nlevel of the Symbolic, the paternal function involves bringing to bear\nwithin the child’s familial sphere the disciplinary and\nprohibitory features of the family’s enveloping symbolic order as\ntheir socio-linguistic milieu (this entails such impositions as\nweaning, toilet training, exogamy, and “castration” in the\nFreudian-Lacanian sense—see 2.4.1 below). As for Real\nOtherness here, this would be the version of the paternal figure\nmythically portrayed by Freud in Totem and Taboo (1913),\nnamely, the tyrannical, enjoying-without-restraints “primal\nfather” (Urvater) of the savage fraternal horde, the\nexception to the otherwise universal law of (symbolic)\ncastration. This Real Urvater arguably is a\nfantasy-construct generated in and by the Oedipus complex, with the\nchild imagining an obscene, dark, jouissance-saturated\nunderbelly behind the Symbolic façade of paternal authority and\nits rules. \n\nThe child’s identifications with maternal and paternal Others\nare distributed across Real and Symbolic dimensions. However,\ndifferent subjects-in-formation distribute their identifications\ndifferently. Freud, in his reconsiderations of earlier renditions\nof the Oedipus complex, came to highlight an asymmetry between Oedipal\ndynamics for young boys and girls, repudiating the idea of girls\nundergoing an “Electra complex” as the symmetrical\ncounterpart to the Oedipus complex. Skipping over a lot of\ndetails and cutting a long story short, the later Lacan, when taking up\nthe topic of sexual difference, preserves this Freudian emphasis on\nasymmetry. In this vein, Lacan introduces the idea of sexuation\nas the Real of sexual difference, namely, as an impenetrable, opaque\nfacticity of this difference continually prompting and yet perpetually\nresisting being adequately translated into the terms of Imaginary and\nSymbolic realities. As neither biologically given sex nor\nsocially constructed gender, the Real of sexuation is what is\nresponsible for the absence of an exhaustively representable,\nsymbolizable natural and/or cultural relationship between sexuated\npositions (as per Lacan’s statement, “Il n’y a\npas de rapport sexuel”). The structural-psychical\npositions of masculinity and femininity embody constitutively\nout-of-synch and inherently incommensurable subjective stances,\nincompatible (yet interacting) arrangements of distinct sorts of\nlibidinal economies. \n\nFreud’s metapsychology of the libidinal economy, of the\nunderlying motivational mechanisms of psychical life, is grounded on\nhis theory of drive (Trieb, and not Instinkt, despite\nmany English mistranslations of Trieb as\n“instinct”). Lacan elaborates upon and extends this\nFreudian theoretical framework. In the process, he reworks some\nof Freud’s concepts and adds other concepts of his own. \n\nNeed, demand, and desire form a conceptual-terminological triad in\nLacanian theory. Needs are biologically innate vital requirements\nfor the human being as a living organism. Humans are born saddled\nwith such imperatives from the very start, although, as per Freudian\nHilflosigkeit, they are powerless on their own to satisfy\nthese bodily dictates for a protracted initial period lasting well into\nchildhood (see 2.2 above). \n\nThe combination of being prematurationally helpless but having\nunavoidable needs means that, over the course of physical and mental\ndevelopment, the infant must come to articulate its needs to bigger\nothers. These others (as three-dimensional O/others along the\nlines of Lacan’s register theory—see 2.3 above) are\naddressed as those capable of assisting in the meeting and quelling of\nneeds. Of course, crying, screaming, gesticulating, and the like\nare early expressions of needs, being the fashions in which infants\nprior to acquiring language per se alert the older individuals around\nthem of their requirements. Even at this early stage, the infant\nis forced to rely on his/her thus-addressed significant others to\ninterpret the “meaning” of his/her cries, screams, and\ngesticulations (“Ah, you’re hungry,” “Uh oh,\nthat means you’re tired,” “So, it’s time to\nchange your diaper,” etc.). Through these spontaneous\ninterpretations, others, whether knowingly or not, participate with the\npre-verbal child in shaping links between needs and the socially\nmediated significance of the expressions of needs. These others\nthereby lend the child’s noises and movements the significance of\nbeing “demands,” with this amounting to a kind of\nassistance provided over and above the assistance of meeting bare needs\nthemselves. Now, this is not to say that there are no natural\ncorrelations whatsoever between needs and their pre-verbal expressions\nhardwired into babies’ behavioral repertoires. But,\narguably, infants are not immediately and automatically\nself-consciously aware of these correlations as such, with\ncaretakers’ responses being key aids in helping the child become\nexplicitly cognizant of need-expression couplings. \n\nAs the infant continues maturing, soon acquiring language, the\ninfluences of others and Others (especially inter-subjective others as\nconveyors of the signs and signifiers of the big Other qua\ntrans-subjective symbolic order—see 2.1.2\n and 2.3 above)\nincreasingly exert themselves on the forming of associative connections\nbetween needs and demands. For example, as part of socialization\nand education, parents typically begin to introduce the discipline of\ninsisting that the child articulate his/her requirements and urges in\nspecific manners (“Say ‘please’ and ‘thank\nyou,’” “Ask nicely,” “In this household,\nwe do not yell when we’re hungry,” and so on). The\nchild learns that he/she must accept, internalize, and speak “the\ndiscourse of the Other” (in this instance, the parents) in order\nto get his/her needs recognized, acknowledged, and addressed in a\nsatisfactory fashion. In short, he/she must make demands couched\nin terms and conventions imposed by O/others’ socio-symbolic\nregimes. Lacan maintains that natural bodily needs hence, via the\ninter- and trans-subjective dynamics of demand, are\n“overwritten” by the signifiers of an ultimately Symbolic\nOtherness, an overwriting through which the bases of the libidinal\neconomy are denaturalized and subjected to socio-cultural forces and\nfactors. Much of this beds down in the young, nascent\nsubject’s psyche, thereafter exerting (often in unconscious ways)\ndecisive effects on this person’s libidinal economy throughout\nhis/her life. \n\nIn his 1958 écrit “The Signification of the\nPhallus,” Lacan provides a succinct formula for defining\n“desire” in relation to both need and demand. He\nstipulates that desire is what remains after need is subtracted from\ndemand. What, exactly, does this equation mean? Through\nbeing translated into demands, needs come to be saddled with surpluses\nof more-than-biological significances; vital requirements take on\nthe excess baggage of meanings over and above the level of brute,\nsimple organic survival. Largely by virtue of what O/others add\nto the child’s experiences of needs through superimposing\ninterpretations of these needs as socio-symbolic demands, the meeting\nof the child’s needs in response to his/her demands makes these\nneeds into, first and foremost, litmus tests of where he/she stands in\nrelation to these thus-addressed significant O/others. Being\ngiven specific items of food by a parent in response to a demand\nexpressing hunger can indicate to the child not only that the parent\nunderstands that a need to eat has to be met, but also, and more\nimportantly, that he/she is loved by the parent, that he/she enjoys a\nprivileged position in relation to the parent’s attention and\npriorities. Lacan therefore asserts that each and every demand\nis, at bottom, a demand for love. Returning to the equation\n“demand – need = desire,” what is desired when a\ndemand is addressed to another is not so much the meeting of the\nthus-expressed need, but, in addition to this, the very love of\nanother. \n\nParents of children are all too familiar with seemingly endless\nseries of demands from the little ones (“I want a\nsandwich,” “OK, here’s a sandwich”…\n“I want a lollipop,” “OK, here’s a\nlollipop”… “I want a new toy,” “OK,\nhere’s a new toy”… and on and on until an exhausted\nparental “No” is pronounced and wearily defended against\nvigorous protests). Adults, whether parents or not, also are\naware of a similar desiring restlessness in themselves, an inability to\nacquire an object or attain a success that would be “IT”\n(with-a-capital-I-and-T), the final be-all-and-end-all telos\nof wanting and wishing satisfying them for good forever after.\nSimilarly, an adult in a romantic relationship never is content with\nbeing told that he/she is loved by the beloved only once; he/she\ninsists upon repetitions ad infinitum of the affirmation by\nthe significant other that, “I love you” (as if no\naffirmation is ever quite enough). With both children and adults,\nmargins of dissatisfaction, perpetually resurfacing itches that never\ncan be scratched just right, are to be explained, according to Lacan,\nthrough a clarification of the essence of the “love”\ndemanded in all demands in excessive addition to the gratification of\ncorresponding needs. What is being requested is an impossibility\nimpossible on the basis of the register-theoretic version of\nO/otherness à la Lacanianism (see 2.1 \nand 2.3\nabove): the non-objectifiable negativity of the kinetic, slippery\nheart of Real Otherness (i.e., the always-on-the-move affection, focus,\netc. of the Real Other’s desiring core both conscious and\nunconscious) being objectified as the positivity of a static, stable\nthing (i.e., a special object able to be gift-wrapped and handed over\nas part of the response to demand). Employing once again the\nexample of hunger, while the O/other can respond to demands for food\nwith the provision of nourishing substances answering to the need for\nnourishment, he/she is constitutively incapable of turning the nucleus\nof his/her desiring being (i.e., the non-object of his/her\n“love”) into one tangible object among others to be\nbestowed along with food and the like. As will be discussed here\nshortly (see 2.4.3 below), conscious \nand unconscious fantasies are\naroused on the sides of desiring demanders—and, everyone is a\ndesiring demander—by the necessary, inevitable dissatisfactions\naccompanying desires. These fantasies cover over the\nimpossibility of bringing desires to satisfying ends. They do so\nby constructing scenarios in which there is a yet-to-be-(re)obtained\nobject that really is “IT.” Moreover, in these\nfantasmatic scenarios, answers to questions of Real Others’\ninscrutable desires (“What does the Other want, and want\nspecifically of me?”) are staged. \n\nAs should be evident by now, the intervention of the signifiers of\nthe symbolic order (i.e., the discourses of big Others) is integral to\nthe genesis of the need-demand-desire triad. Through the\nintrusion of these signifiers cutting into both the body and mind of\nthe young child, a proto-subjective being of need, passing through the\ndemands of discipline (in both sense of the genitive), is transformed\ninto a subject of desire. Such a subject is\n“barred”—Lacan’s matheme for the barred subject\nof desire is $—alienated from its natural needs and derailed onto\nthe tracks of non-natural desires doomed never to reach enjoyable\ndestinations. In connection with his revisions of the Oedipus\ncomplex (see 2.3 above), Lacan turns Freudian castration into\n“symbolic castration.” The latter, rather than being\na real or imagined scene in which a specific threat to bodily integrity\nis issued, designates the dual somatic and psychical discombobulating\neffects upon the premature human animal caused by insertion into and\nsubjection to surrounding socio-symbolic contexts, of being made to\ndepend on the foreignness of signifiers and everything they bring with\nthem. \n\nIn Freud’s drive theory, sublimation amounts to a drive\nfinding a means to secure satisfaction (Befriedigung) in the\nface of “aim-inhibition” (i.e., a blockage of its prior\npath to an earlier aimed-at drive-object). But, as Lacan\nobserves, Freud also oddly defines the aim (Ziel) of any and\nevery drive as satisfaction. Therefore, how can a drive achieve\nsatisfaction if its aim (defined as the achievement of satisfaction) is\ninhibited? Lacan’s response to this apparent Freudian\ncontradiction is to put forward a distinction between the aim and\n“goal” of the drive as a metapsychological entity:\nWhile the aim of a drive can be and inevitably is inhibited, its (true)\ngoal always is reached—and this because its goal is nothing other\nthan enjoying the ceaseless movement of repetitively rotating around\nwhatever blockages land on its path. \n\nAccording to a certain widely accepted reading appealing to the\nimmediately above (promoted by Slavoj Žižek and the Slovenian\nSchool of Lacanian theory), Lacan distinguishes between desire and\ndrive. As seen (see 2.4.1 above), an essential characteristic of\ndesire is its restlessness, its ongoing agitated searching and futile\nstriving. No object it gets its hands on is ever quite\n“IT.” Whereas desire is stuck with its dissatisfied\ndrifting from object to object and ever onward (in a structured\nmovement akin to the “spurious/bad infinite” as per Hegel),\ndrive derives a perverse enjoyment from this desire-fuelled libidinal\ncircling around the vanishing point of the\nimpossible-qua-unattainable. There where desire is\nfrustrated, drive is gratified. Drive gains its satisfaction\nthrough vampirically feeding off of the dissatisfaction of desire. \n\nLike the register of the Real with which it is most closely\nassociated, jouissance, a notion that comes to the fore at the\nend of the 1950s, is difficult to encapsulate in succinct defining\nformulas. By the end of Lacan’s itinerary at the start of\nthe 1980s, this term had taken on a plethora of significations,\ndividing and sub-dividing into a wide array of distinct-but-related\nconcepts. In English-language Lacanian scholarship,\njouissance almost always is left untranslated, since its\nEnglish equivalent, “enjoyment,” fails to capture the\nspecifically sexual connotations of the original French word. \n\nThe best way to begin getting a sense of what Lacan means by\njouissance is through reference to the Lacanian distinction\nbetween drive and desire (see 2.4.2 above) in conjunction with select\nstipulations by Freud regarding the infamous death drive\n(Todestrieb) of Freud’s later dual drive theory (first\nlaid out in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920)).\nLike Freud’s Todestrieb, Lacan’s\njouissance is “beyond the pleasure principle”\n(this being another reason why the English “enjoyment,” as\nsynonymous with pleasure, is an inappropriate translation). The\npost-1920 Freud muses that all drives might be said to be death drives,\nmeaning that each and every drive perhaps works, at least in certain\nrespects at certain times, contrary to the pursuit of the pleasurable\nas balance, gratification, homeostasis, satisfaction, and so on.\nAlong these same lines, the Lacanian drive extracts\n“enjoyment” from the thwartings and failures of\ndesire; whereas the latter is oriented by the tantalizingly\nelusive telos of pleasure qua satisfaction, the\nformer generates its jouissance-beyond-pleasure precisely\nthrough the inhibiting of desire itself. The many possible\nsadistic and masochistic implications of this side of the libidinal\neconomy are not difficult to imagine. \n\nOne of several clinical phenomena pushing Freud into dethroning the\npleasure principle in 1920 as the formerly hegemonic ruler of the\npsyche in its entirety is “repetition compulsion”\n(Wiederholungszwang)—specifically, the psyche’s\nperplexing, spontaneous compulsive repeating of that which is painful\nand/or traumatic (examples of this include post-traumatic disorders,\nso-called “negative therapeutic reaction,” and the\nrecurrent types of self-defeats unconsciously arranged by neurotics for\nthemselves). One of the theoretical functions of the death drive\nis to account for whatever disregards or disrupts the reign of the\npleasure principle as a fundamental “law” of mental\nlife. In Lacan’s conceptual apparatus, jouissance\nsometimes likewise refers to an overriding force/tendency compelling\nrepetitions of experiences or events upsetting the calm, delicate\nequilibrium of psychical subjectivity’s Imaginary-Symbolic\nreality (hence the association of jouissance with the\nReal). \n\nIn the process of the neonate as a biological being acquiring both\nan ego and a speaking subjectivity—this involves the living\norganism being submitted to the mediating matrices of\nImaginary-Symbolic realities—the human creature supposedly loses,\nthrough symbolic castration (see 2.4.1 above), \naccess to an immediate,\nundiluted jouissance in its raw, unmitigated intensities\n(whether this is an actual, factual occurrence in linear, chronological\nontogeny or an après-coup, retrospective fantasy is a\ncomplicated issue in Lacanian theory). The jouissance\npresumably lost to the speaking subject returns only in the guises of\nwhat might be labeled “limit experiences,” namely,\nencounters with that which is annihilating, inassimilable,\noverwhelming, traumatic, or unbearable. Similarly,\njouissance, in this vein, is related to transgressive\nviolations, the breaching of boundaries and breaking of barriers.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, for the parlêtre to\naccommodate, tolerate, and digest. The speaking being is forced\nto cohabitate uneasily with its always problematic\njouissance. \n\nIn line with Freud’s discussions of fantasizing in psychical\nlife, Lacan treats fantasies, particularly those functioning at the\nlevel of fundamental formations of the unconscious, as schematizations\n(in a quasi-Kantian respect) of desiring subjectivity. Put\ndifferently, the wants and wishes of a particular subject are shaped\nand governed by a peculiar skeletal template, an idiosyncratic and\nparadigmatic Ur-scene, in which this desiring subject is\npositioned in a specific manner vis-à-vis a specific\nobject of its desire. This fundamental template/scene is an\nunconscious formation operating as a transcendental condition of\npossibility for the subject’s libidinal economy in all its\ncrucial, symptomatic manifestations. Lacan’s matheme for\nthe fantasy is $ ◊ a. The $ stands for the\nsubject of desire brought into being by the barring/splitting\nconsequences of Others’ mediating influences (see\n 2.3 and 2.4.1\nabove). \n\nThe a stands for objet petit a, that is, object\na as the “object-cause of desire.” Lacan\nemploys this latter phrase for object a because this\n“object” is a spectral, virtual construct of what would\nqualify as “IT” for the desiring subject (see 2.4.1 above),\nwith this libidinal-transcendental schema of desire’s object\n(i.e., a) “causing” select given empirical objects\nin a person’s libidinal-amorous history and experience to be\ndesired as stand-ins for “IT.” However, these\nsubstitutes are always and necessarily inadequate and unsatisfactory\ndue to an insurmountable, ineliminable gap between the\nmore-than-empirical fantasmatic objet a originating in the\nsubject’s unconscious past and the empirical objects present and\nfuture incarnating it. These latter objects are situated in\nImaginary-Symbolic reality, condemned partially and imperfectly to\nembody an interminably receding and elusive surplus (i.e., the\nimpossible-qua-Real dimension of object a). \n\nTo refer back one last time to the matheme of fantasy ($ ◊\na), the diamond-shaped “lozenge”\n(poinçon) ◊ can be read as a condensation of\nfour symbols: one, ∧ (the logical symbol for conjunction\n[“and”]); two, ∨ (the logical symbol for\ndisjunction [“or”]); three, > (the\nmathematical symbol for “greater than”); and, four,\n< (the mathematical symbol for “less than”).\nAs per Lacan’s matheme, the subject’s desires are scripted\nand orchestrated by an unconscious fundamental fantasy in which the\ndesiring subject ($) is positioned in relation to its corresponding\nobject-cause of desire (a). Hence, ∧, ∨,\n>, and < represent, in a deliberately loose and open\nfashion, possible variants of this positioning of $\nvis-à-vis a. Singular subjects flesh out\nconjunction, disjunction, being “greater than,” and being\n“less than” in their own styles, namely, as their unique\nfantasies of merger or symbiosis (conjunction), scorn or refusal\n(disjunction), mastery or domination (“greater than”),\nslavery or submission (“less than”), and any number of\nother possible particularizations of these four basic categories of\nrapport. \n\nIn some of Lacan’s earlier presentations of the mirror stage,\nthe a serves as an abbreviation for autre\n(other). More precisely, in this context, a refers\nprimarily to the little-o-other as the Imaginary ego (see\n 2.2 and 2.3\nabove). The ego is an “other,” a not-me misrecognized\nas “me,” insofar as it is brought into existence through a\ncombination of an object external to the (proto-)subject (i.e., the\nimago-Gestalt of the body image) and the interests of Symbolic\nand Real Others investing this object through words and behaviors.\nWithin the framework of the mirror stage, a (usually as\na’) also designates alter-egos as the Imaginary partners with\nwhich the ego itself is inextricably intertwined, invariably defining\nitself through reference to these partners. \n\nFurthermore, there indeed is a thread of continuity between the\na of the mirror stage and object a: Both ego\n(as a) and fantasy (with its a) unconsciously are the\nsubject’s fateful answers to the questions, “What does the\nOther want?” and “How must I position myself with respect\nto the desire of the Other?” (see 2.3 above). Lacan’s\na, like the rest of his mathemes, is deliberately handled as\nakin to an algebraic variable. It is a placeholder for any number\nof particular types of determinants: what an Other desires, what\nI must be so as to be the object of an Other’s desire, what would\nat last lay to rest my restless strivings and yearnings, what would do\nso for a significant Other to whom I remain attached, etc. But,\nin all cases, a reflects Lacan’s\nHegelian-Kojèvian slogan having it that, “man’s\ndesire is the desire of the Other.”","contact.mail":"aojohns@unm.edu","contact.domain":"unm.edu"}]
