Of the books, the first, Aesthetics: Problems in the\nPhilosophy of Criticism (1958; reissued with a postscript, 1981), is\nby far the most substantial, comprehensive, and influential. More than\nthat, it's also the first systematic, well-argued, and critically\ninformed philosophy of art in the analytic tradition. Given the wide\nrange of topics covered in Aesthetics, the intelligent and\nphilosophically informed treatment accorded them, the historically\nunprecedented nature of the work, and its effect on subsequent\ndevelopments in the field, a number of philosophers, including some of\nBeardsley's critics, have argued that Aesthetics is the most\nimpressive and important book of 20th century analytic\naesthetics.\n\n\n\nThe Possibility of Criticism, the second of the three books,\nis more modest in scope and less groundbreaking. Exclusively concerned\nwith literary criticism, it limits itself to four problems: the\n‘self-sufficiency’ of a literary text, the nature of\nliterary interpretation, judging literary texts, and bad poetry.\n\n\n\nThe last of the books, The Aesthetic Point of View, is a\ncollection of papers, most old, some new. Fourteen papers, largely on\nthe nature of the aesthetic and art criticism, are reprinted, and six\nnew pieces are added. The new pieces are of special interest, because\nthey constitute Beardsley's final word on the topics covered, and the\ntopics are themselves central ones: aesthetic experience, the\ndefinition of art, judgments of value, reasons in art criticism,\nartists' intentions and interpretation, and art and culture.\n\n\n\nIn Aesthetics, Beardsley develops a philosophy of art that is\nsensitive to three things: (i) art itself and people's\npre-philosophical interest in and opinions about art, (ii) critics'\npronouncements about art, and (iii) developments in philosophy,\nespecially, though not exclusively, those in the analytic\ntradition. To explain each of these elements further: (i) In the late\n1940s and early 1950s, the time at which Beardsley developed his\nphilosophy of art, there were developments in the arts—new forms\nin music, painting, and literature had appeared and were\nappearing—but there was also a well established and relatively\nlarge canon of works almost universally regarded as aesthetically\nsuperior and worthy of attention. (ii) Art criticism had become an\nindustry, with major schools of all sorts flourishing: Marxist,\nFormalist, psychoanalytic, semiotic, historical, biographical. (iii)\nAnd philosophy had changed in rapid and unexpected ways. Analytic\nphilosophy, with its emphasis on language and strong empiricist\ntendencies, had gained ascendancy in American universities in little\nmore than 20 years, and dominated the philosophical scene. \n\nBeardsley responded to each of the three. His position on developments\nin the arts is probably best described as open-minded moderation. He\nwelcomed new developments, and reference to new works and works that\nlack the luster of fame, notoriety, or ready recognition appear\nfrequently in Aesthetics and his other work. He didn't\nautomatically embrace the latest fad, fashion, or movement, however,\nbut tried, as he said, to get something out of a work. \n\nAs for art criticism, the school of criticism that attracted\nBeardsley, and that his philosophy of art ultimately underwrites, is\nthe so-called New Criticism. The New Criticism made the literary work\nthe center of critical attention, and denied, or at least greatly\ndevaluated, the relevance of facts about the origin of literary works,\ntheir effects upon individual readers, and their personal, social, and\npolitical influence. Close reading is what is required of a critic,\nnot biographical information about the author, a rundown of the state\nof society at the time the work was written, data about the psychology\nof creation, predictions about the effects of the work on society, and\ncertainly not a piece of autobiography detailing the critic's own\npersonal response to the work. Though based in literary criticism, the\nNew Criticism could be, and should be, extended to the other arts,\nBeardsley thought: all art criticism should make a serious effort to\nrecognize its objects as special, autonomous, and important in their\nown right, and not subservient to ulterior aims or values; all art\ncriticism should attempt to understand how works of art work, and what\nmeanings and aesthetic properties they have; all art criticism should\nstrive for objective and publicly accessible methods and standards to\ntest its pronouncements. \n\nDevelopments in philosophy were a different story. Beardsley embraced\na general form of analytic philosophy not heavily influenced by either\nlogical positivism or ordinary language philosophy, the dominant\nmovements of the time. For him, an analytic approach to the philosophy\nof art meant no more than critically examining the fundamental\nconcepts and beliefs underlying art and art criticism.  Doing\nphilosophy of that sort required clarity, precision, and a good eye\nfor identifying, exposing, and evaluating arguments, but left\naesthetics, as a systematic study, a real possibility. \n\nNot all the arts could be covered in detail in even so long a book as\nAesthetics—it's over 600 pages—so Beardsley had\nto content himself with concentrating on three relatively disparate\narts: literature, music, and painting. In keeping with the conception\nof philosophy mentioned above, aesthetics was thought of as\nmeta-criticism. “There would be no problems of aesthetics,” Beardsley\nsays, “if no one ever talked about works of art…. We can't do\naesthetics until we have some critical statements to work on”\n(pp. 1,4). Aesthetics is concerned with “the nature and basis of\ncriticism, … just as criticism itself is concerned with works of art”\n(p. 6). The then-current and still widespread view that philosophy is\na second-order, meta-level, and essentially linguistic activity,\ntaking as its object of study the pronouncements of first-order\nactivities, such as chemistry, religion, or history, is reflected in\nBeardsley's view on the nature of aesthetics. \n\nCritical statements are of three kinds, Beardsley thinks: descriptive,\ninterpretative, and evaluative. The first concerns non-normative\nproperties of works of art that are simply in it, in some sense, and\nare available, at least in principle, to anyone of normal eyes and\nears if sufficiently sensitive, attentive, and experienced.\n‘There is a small red patch in the upper right-hand corner of\nthe painting’ is a descriptive statement, but so is\n‘Haydn's 23rd Symphony abounds in dynamic\ntension.’ The philosophical problems that descriptive statements\ngive rise to involve the concept of form, Beardsley\nthinks. Interpretative statements are also non-normative, but concern\nthe ‘meaning’ of a work of art, with ‘meaning’\nhere referring to a semantic relation, or at least a purported\nsemantic relation, between the work and something outside it.\n‘That's a picture of Notary Sojac’ is an interpretative\nstatement, as are ‘That's a picture of a unicorn,’\n‘The passage refers to Brutus's betrayal of Caesar,’ and\n‘The thesis of Macbeth is exceedingly simple: Thou\nshalt not kill.’ Last, critical evaluations are normative\njudgments that basically say that a work of art is good or bad, or how\ngood or bad it is. ‘Mozart's Turkish March is an\nexcellent short piano piece’ is a critical evaluation, and so is\n‘The Face on the Barroom Floor is wretched\nverse.’ The judgment ‘This is beautiful’—the\nparadigm of a judgment of taste, according to Kant—is sometimes\nthought of as a critical evaluation (p. 9), but more often (e.g.,\npp. 463, 507), and always in Beardsley's later writing, as a\ndescriptive judgment, and one that frequently forms at least a partial\nbasis for a critical evaluation. \n\nThe first chapter of Aesthetics is in part devoted to the\nontology of art—or aesthetic objects, as Beardsley was then wont\nto say.  The term ‘work of art’ was largely avoided by him\nat the time, because, as he later admitted, he did “not [want] to\nbecome enmeshed … in [the question of the definition of\n‘work of art,’ a question] that … [had] not\nconvince[d] [him] of its importance or promise[d] any very\nsatisfactory and agreeable resolution” (p. xviii). \n\nThe ontology argued for begins with a distinction between physical\nobjects and perceptual objects. In speaking of a thing being six feet\nby six feet in size and at rest, we're speaking of a physical object;\nin speaking of a thing being dynamic and frightening, we're speaking\nof a perceptual object. Perceptual objects are the objects we\nperceive, objects “some of whose qualities, at least, are open to\ndirect sensory awareness” (p. 31). Aesthetic objects are a subset of\nperceptual objects. This doesn't necessarily mean that aesthetic\nobjects aren't physical objects, however. Aesthetic objects might be\nother than physical objects—the conceptual distinction might\nmark a real distinction—or they might be physical\nobjects—the conceptual distinction, though somewhat misleadingly\ncouched in terms of objects, might simply mark “two aspects of the\nsame” thing (p. 33). At first indifferent as to which alternative is\nopted for—Beardsley mentions that he doesn't “see that it makes\nmuch difference which terminology [that of objects or aspects] is\nchosen” (p. 33)—he then proceeds to develop an ontology that\nstresses objects more than aspects. \n\nThe ontology is phenomenalistic in its leanings, though open to a more\nphysicalistic interpretation. A presentation of an aesthetic object is\ndefined as the object as experienced by a particular person on a\nparticular occasion. Essentially, presentations are sense-data of\naesthetic objects. Aesthetic objects aren't presentations, however,\nfor that would invite not just an uncontrollable population explosion\nof aesthetic objects, but chaos in criticism; and neither are\naesthetic objects classes of presentations, for aesthetic objects must\nhave at least some perceptual properties, but classes, as abstract\nentities, have none. However, “whenever we want to say anything about\nan aesthetic object, we can talk about its presentations”\n(p. 54). This, Beardsley says, “does not ‘reduce’ the\naesthetic object to a presentation; it only analyzes statements\nabout aesthetic objects into statements about presentations”\n(p. 54). In effect, this is a form of linguistic phenomenalism, and\ncommits Beardsley to meaning-preserving translations of statements\nabout aesthetic objects into statements about the presentations of\nsuch objects—in effect, statements about experiences of such\nobjects. \n\nNot satisfied with this, Beardsley presses on to distinguish (a) the\nartifact—the play itself, say, as written down—from (b) a\nparticular production of it—the Old Vic's production, as opposed\nto the Marquette University theater department's production—from\n(c) a particular performance of it—last night's performance in\nthe Haelfer Theater—from (d) a particular presentation of\nit—the play as it shows up in Peter Alelyunas's experience of\nit, upon attending last night's performance. The same distinctions\nhold across the arts, though differently in different arts, and\nsomewhat more naturally in some than others. There is Beethoven's\nD Minor Symphony (the artifact), a production of it (The\nPhiladelphia Symphony Orchestra's recording of it), a particular\nperformance of it (my playing the recording last night, in my house),\nand particular presentations of it (mine and other people's\nexperiences of it last night, in my house). At least in many arts, a\nsingle artifact can have many productions; a single production can\nhave many performances; and a single performance can give rise to many\npresentations. As Beardsley notes, these distinctions collapse to some\nextent in some of the arts, and would have to be stretched a bit to\nfit them all. In reading a poem silently, he says, the production is\nthe presentation (and I would also think the performance); “in\narchitecture, the architect's plans are the artifact; the completed\nbuilding is the production” (pp. 57–58) (and also presumably the\nperformance); and in painting and sculpture, “the distinction between\nartifact and production almost disappears” (p. 58) (with the\nperformance presumably being identical with both). \n\nBut what is the aesthetic object, the object of critical attention?\nIt's not a presentation or class of presentations, and it's not the\nartifact—Beethoven's 9th Symphony, for example. If the\naesthetic object were the artifact, it would have contradictory\ncharacteristics, since different recordings of the 9th have\ndifferent, incompatible characteristics: some are shorter than 60\nminutes, some longer. What's left, and what the aesthetic object must\nbe, is the production. Thus the primary object of critical attention\nis the production of an artifact, and the basic job of the critic is\nto describe, interpret, and evaluate such productions. \n\nAlthough Beardsley's early views on ontology tended to either\nlinguistic phenomenalism or unsystematic pluralism—some\nproductions are physical objects, some mental objects, and some\nphysical events—there were hints, event at that time, of a\nsimpler and more commonsensical view. The ontology can be seen lurking\nbeneath the surface of his postulates of art criticism: \n\nTaking ‘aesthetic object’ to mean ‘work of\nart,’ the underlying ontology isn't a sense-datum ontology or a\nmixed-category ontology at all. A number of the postulates—2, 4,\nand 6; possibly 3 and 7—are in fact prima facie incompatible\nwith a sense-datum ontology. Rather, what 1-7 strongly suggest is that\na work of art is a physical object: it's perceptible, publicly or\ninter-subjectively available in both time and space, can appear\ndifferently from different points of view and at different times, may\nnot be exhaustively understood on any given occasion, has properties\nthat may be correctly or incorrectly perceived, and is such that\nattributions to it obey the law of the excluded middle. \n\nNot surprisingly, after 1958 Beardsley “moved steadily in the\ndirection of some form of non-reductive materialism, of seeing how far\nit is possible to go in treating artworks as physical objects”\n(Aesthetics, p. xxiv). The materialism is non-reductive, in\nthat works of art have properties that physical objects generally\ndon't. Such materialism works well with “singular” works of art, such\nas paintings, Beardsley thinks, but “multiple artworks”—musical\ncompositions which have many performances, poems which exist in\nmultiple printings—present problems. The musical composition\nisn't any single score or performance, the poem any single printed\ntext. For that reason, Beardsley once again is driven back in the\ndirection of ontological pluralism: perhaps works of art are either\nphysical objects (the singular works) or kinds of physical object (the\nmultiple works), with “physical object” construed broadly here so as\nto include events (such as a dance). \n\nAs mentioned above, Beardsley “sedulously avoided” (p. 59) the term\n‘work of art’ as much as possible in\nAesthetics. He later did offer a definition, however, and,\nsomewhat surprisingly, a neo-Romantic and intentionalistic one. A work\nof art, he says, is “either an arrangement of conditions intended to\nbe capable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic character\nor (incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of\narrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity”\n(The Aesthetic Point of View, p. 299). The first disjunct is\nthe more important one; it says that something's a work if it's an\nartifact, “an arrangement of conditions,” that was intended by its\ncreator to be capable of providing an experience with non-negligible\naesthetic character. This definition doesn't say that a work of art is\nintended to provide (or be capable of providing) a full-blown\naesthetic experience. Only “an experience with marked aesthetic\ncharacter” is required. It also doesn't say that a work of art doesn't\nor can't have a utilitarian function, in the everyday sense of the\nterm. A work of art could be a chair that's many times simply sat in,\nfor example. And, last, it doesn't say that the primary intention\nbehind the creation of the artifact is an aesthetic one. The primary\nintention behind the creation of a religious icon, for example, could\nbe to bring worshippers closer to God. \n\nThe second part of the definition picks up those objects that\ndefinitely are works of art, but were created in a mechanical, almost\nan assembly-line fashion, or as just another instance of its\nkind. Some beautiful vases may fall into the first class, and many\nmedieval icons into the second. To make sure that the extension of the\ndefiniens matches that of the definiendum, Beardsley\nthinks, the second disjunct of the definition is needed. \n\nBut why accept the definition? For a number of reasons, according to\nBeardsley. First, a definition “chosen for a role in aesthetic theory\nshould mark a distinction that is … significant for aesthetic\ntheory” (p. 299), and Beardsley's does. Second, “in selecting key terms\nfor aesthetic theory we ought to stay as close as convenient to\nordinary use” (p. 300). Not everyone's use of a term needs to be\ncaptured in fashioning a definition, which would be impossible in any\ncase with a term as elastic and tendentiously used as ‘work of\nart.’ Beardsley's definition has the merit of capturing\n“reasonably well a use that has been prominent for some centuries and\nstill persists quite widely today, outside the speech and writing of\nor about the avant-garde” (p. 300). Third, a definition of ‘work\nof art’ “should be of the greatest possible utility to inquirers\nin other fields besides aesthetics—fields to which aesthetics\nitself should (sometimes) be thought of as a support and underpinning”\n(p. 304). The fields Beardsley has in mind, more than any other, are\nart history and anthropology. Fourth and last, a definition of\n‘work of art’ should “conceptually link … art and\nthe aesthetic” (p. 312). That Beardsley's does in spades, directly\ndefining art in terms of the aesthetic as it does. \n\nDespite his many books and articles, Beardsley is probably best known\nfor his very first article in aesthetics. In “The Intentional\nFallacy,” a paper co-written with William K. Wimsatt and published in\n1946 (and widely re-printed, e.g., in Joseph Margolis, ed.,\nPhilosophy Looks at the Arts, 3rd edition, 1987), he argued\nagainst the neo-Romantic view that a work of art means what the artist\nsays it means, or what he intends it to mean. More precisely, the\nissue can put in terms of the relation between and \n\nAccording to E.D. Hirsch, (1) entails (2), at least if w is a literary\nwork, because the meaning of ‘x’ simply is what\nthe writer meant or intended by ‘x.’ Knowing the\nartist's intention is thus knowing the work's meaning. That's one end\nof the spectrum on the relation between (1) and (2). \n\nBeardsley sits at the other end. He holds that the intentions of the\nartist aren't relevant to the interpretation of a work of art at all.\n(1) not only doesn't entail (2); in and of itself, it provides no\ndirect evidential support for (2). An artist's intentions have nothing\nto do with what a work means. \n\nBeardsley was in fact more than consistent on the issue of the\nintentional fallacy; he also held that provides no direct evidential support for and that provides no direct evidential support for An artist's intentions are utterly irrelevant to the descriptive,\ninterpretive, and evaluative properties of his work. \n\nAnd in addition to “The Intentional Fallacy,” there's also “The\nAffective Fallacy.” In a paper bearing that name, and also co-written\nwith William Wimsatt, Beardsley argues that a person's affective\nresponses to a work of art are irrelevant to its descriptive,\ninterpretive, and evaluative properties. \n\nBeardsley's arguments against intentionalism in interpretation are of\na variety of sorts. In “The Intentional Fallacy,” he says\nthat the intentions of the artist are neither “available nor\ndesirable” (p. 367), with this meaning that such intentions aren't always\navailable and are never desirable. Since we frequently can and do\ncorrectly interpret a work of art with little or no knowledge about\nthe artist, the fact that the artist's intentions aren't always\navailable is enough to show that Hirsch's position is wrong. \n\n“Judging a poem is like judging a pudding or a machine,”\naccording to Beardsley. “One demands that it work. It is only\nbecause an artifact works that we infer the intention of the\nartificer …. A poem can be only through its\nmeaning … yet it is, simply is, in\nthe sense that we have no excuse for inquiring what part is intended\nor meant” (p. 368). In other words, a poem or other work of art is\nindependent of its creator, just as any other artifact—a pudding\nor a washing machine—is. A pudding consists of milk, eggs, and\nother ingredients, a washing machine of a metal drum, rubber gaskets,\nand other parts, and a poem of words. In all three cases, the parts\nexist and are what they are independently of the artificers, and the\nartifacts are to be judged—and interpreted—on the basis of\ntheir properties. There's no need to bring in the artificer. \n\nIn Aesthetics, the attack is a little different. “We must\ndistinguish between the aesthetic object and the intention in the mind\nof its creator,” Beardsley says, and the irrelevance of the latter to\ninterpretation can be shown if we consider a certain sculpture, “a\nlarge, twisted, cruller-shaped object of polished teak, mounted at an\noblique angle to the floor.” The creator of the sculpture intends it\nto “symbolize … Human Destiny.” Try as we might, however, we\n“see in it no such symbolic meaning.” The philosophical question then\nis, “Should we say that we have simply missed the symbolism, but that\nit must be there, since what a statue symbolizes is precisely what its\nmaker makes it symbolize? Or should we say, in the spirit of Alice\nconfronting the extreme semantic conventionalism [intentionalism] of\nHumpty Dumpty, that the question is whether that object can be made to\nmean Human Destiny?” Obviously the latter, Beardsley thinks, for the\nformer entails that “anyone can make anything symbolize anything just\nby saying it does, for another sculptor could copy the same object and\nlabel it ‘Spirit of Palm Beach, 1938’”\n(Aesthetics, pp. 18–19, 21). \n\nIn addition to sculpture, the irrelevance of the author to the meaning\nof his text is also argued for by Beardsley, though only partly by\ncounterexample. “Suppose someone utters a sentence,” he says. “We can\n[then] ask two questions: (1) What does the speaker mean?\n(2) What does the sentence mean?” Although answers to the two\nquestions usually coincide, they can diverge; people can mean one\nthing and say another. The reason that's possible is that “what a\nsentence means depends not on the whim of the individual, and his\nmental vagaries, but upon public conventions of usage that are tied up\nwith habit patterns in the whole speaking community.” Sentence\nmeaning—that is, textual meaning—is thus one thing, and is\nanchored in “the whole speaking community,” while speaker\nmeaning—what the author meant—is quite another, and is\nanchored in his own, quite possibly idiosyncratic intentions. Thus an\nauthor can be wrong about what his own work means. A.E. Housman, for\nexample, was probably wrong in claiming that his poem “1887” wasn't\nironic (pp. 25–26). \n\nIn The Possibility of Criticism, three arguments are offered\nagainst intentionalism, which is again taken to be the view that the\nmeaning of a work of art is what the artist intends it to mean. The\nfirst is that “some texts that have been formed without the agency of\nan author, and hence without authorial meaning, nevertheless have a\nmeaning and can be interpreted” (p. 18). What Beardsley has in mind is\nthe kind of verbal mistake made at a publishing house, or by a\ncomputer in scanning a document. He cites the sentence “Jensen argued\nlike a man filled with righteous indigestion” as an example of a text\nthat can be read and interpreted, yet no agency, a fortiori no\nauthor's intention, stands behind it. “Indignation” became\n“indigestion” at the printer's, by mechanical error. \n\nThe second argument is that “the meaning of a text can change after\nits author has died. But the author cannot change his meaning after he\nhas died. Therefore, textual meaning is not identical to the authorial\nmeaning.” Bolstering this argument is the fact that “the OED furnishes\nabundant evidence that individual words and idioms acquire new\nmeanings and lose old meanings as time passes; these changes can in\nturn produce changes of the meaning in sentences in which the words\nappear.” As an example, Beardsley cites a line from a poem written in\n1744, “He raised his plastic arm,” and notes that “plastic arm” has\n“acquired a new meaning in the twentieth century.” Thus the line “in\nwhich it occurs has also acquired a new meaning” (p. 19). \n\nThe third argument is the familiar one that “a text can have\nmeanings that its author is not aware of. Therefore, it can have\nmeanings that its author did not intend. Therefore, textual meaning is\nnot identical to authorial meaning” (p. 20). \n\nMore than this, what's really needed to decide whether there's an\nintentional fallacy is a theory of meaning. A theory of meaning is a\ntheory of what it is for w (some object, in the broad sense\nof the term) to mean p. Beardsley was always aware of the\nneed for a theory of meaning, and in Aesthetics he proposed\none, a complicated theory which he later rejected. A few years later,\nhowever, he embraced a speech-act theory based on the work of William\nAlston, and used it to defend the intentional fallacy in his final\npaper on the topic. \n\nAlston believes that the meaning of a sentence is the sentence's\nspeech act potential, its potential for performing all of the various\nspeech acts it can be used to perform. In effect, this is to take the\nslogan “Meaning is use” very seriously, and to cash in “use” in terms\nof the performance of speech acts. Sentence meaning is primary on this\ntheory, and word meaning secondary and derivative, since it's defined\nin terms of a word's contribution to the speech act potential of the\nsentences into which it can figure.  Beardsley thought this theory\ncorrect and used it to argue that the intentional fallacy is indeed a\nfallacy. \n\nIn “Intentions and Interpretations” (The Aesthetic Point of\nView), he claims that in composing a poem the poet doesn't\nperform a speech act, but rather represents the performance of a\nspeech act or acts. When Wordsworth writes, \n\nEngland hath need of thee— \n\nhis words are ostensibly addressed to a long-dead poet, but to perform\nan illocutionary, any illocutionary action, a person must believe that\nhe can or will “secure uptake,” that is, secure understanding of his\nsentence and the speech act performed. Wordsworth, however, knew that\nMilton was long dead, and had no such belief. He thus didn't perform\nthe illocutionary act of addressing Milton, or stating that England\nneeds him. He does represent the performance of those illocutionary\nacts, though. What poets and other authors of literary works do,\nBeardsley thinks, is represent the performance of illocutionary acts,\nnot perform illocutionary acts themselves. \n\nBeardsley's complete argument is basically: \n\nThe proof of (6) is that \n\nBroader than concerns about the relevance of the artist's intention\nand encompassing them is the distinction between external and internal\nevidence. “Internal evidence,” Beardsley says, “is evidence from\ndirect inspection of the object” (Aesthetics, p. 20). What is\ninternal is publicly accessible; “it is discovered [in the case of\npoetry] through the semantics and syntax of a poem, though our\nhabitual knowledge of the language through grammars, dictionaries, and\nall the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general\nthrough all that makes a language and culture” (“The Intentional\nFallacy,” p. 373). “External evidence,” on the other hand, “is\nevidence from the psychological and social background of the object,\nfrom which we may infer something about the object itself”\n(Aesthetics, p. 20). What is external is not publicly\naccessible; it is “private or idiosyncratic; not [again in the case of\npoetry] a part of the work as a linguistic fact: it consists of\nrevelations (in journals, for example, or letters or recorded\nconversations) about how or why the poet wrote the poem—to what\nlady, while sitting on what lawn, or at the death of a friend or\nbrother” (“The Intentional Fallacy,” p. 373). In addition to internal\nand external evidence, there is “an intermediate kind of evidence\nabout the character of the author or about private or semi-private\nmeanings attached to words or topics by the author or by a coterie of\nwhich he is a member” (“The Intentional Fallacy,” p. 373). External\nevidence is verboten in criticism, Beardsley thinks, but at least at\nthe time of “The Intentional Fallacy,” intermediate evidence was\nadmissible, the reason being that “the meaning of words is the history\nof words, and the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the\nassociations the word had for him, are part of the word's\nhistory and meaning” (“The Intentional Fallacy,” p. 373). Caution has\nto be exercised, though, for the line between intermediate evidence\nand external evidence isn't sharp, and “a critic who is concerned with\n[internal] evidence … and moderately with [intermediate]\nevidence will in the long run produce a different sort of comment from\nthat of the critic who is concerned with [external] evidence and with\n[intermediate] evidence” (“The Intentional Fallacy,” p. 373).\nIntermediate evidence is never mentioned in Aesthetics or in\nany of Beardsley's subsequent writings, however, and the category\nseems to have been subsumed under “external evidence.” The result is\nan even sharper line between what is and isn't admissible evidence in\ncriticism.","contact.mail":"michael.wreen@marquette.edu","contact.domain":"marquette.edu"}]
