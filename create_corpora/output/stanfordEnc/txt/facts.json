Rundle 1993) and are to be distinguished from things, in\nparticular from complex objects, complexes and wholes, and from\nrelations. They are the objects of certain mental states and acts,\nthey make truth-bearers true and correspond to truths, they are part\nof the furniture of the world. Not only do philosophers oppose facts\nto theories and to values, they sometimes distinguish between facts\nwhich are brute and those which are not (Anscombe 1958). We present\nand discuss some philosophical and formal accounts of facts.\n\nThe word “fact” is used in at least two different ways. In\nthe locution “matters of fact”, facts are taken to be what\nis contingently the case, or that of which we may have empirical or\na posteriori knowledge. Thus Hume famously writes at the\nbeginning of Section IV of An Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding: “All the objects of human reason or inquiry\nmay naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas\nand Matters of Fact”. The word is also used in locutions such\nas \nIn this second use, the functor (operator, connective) “It is a\nfact that” takes a sentence to make a sentence (an alternative\nview has it that “It is a fact” takes a nominalised\nsentence, a that-clause, to make a sentence), and the predicate\n“is a fact” is either elliptic for the functor, or takes a\nnominalised sentence to make a sentence. It is locutions of this\nsecond sort that philosophers have often employed in order to claim\n(or deny) that facts are part of the inventory of what there is, and\nplay an important role in semantics, ontology, metaphysics,\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind. \nWe may, then, distinguish between Humean facts and functorial facts.\nWith the help of this distinction, two philosophical options can be\nformulated. One may think that there are facts in the functorial sense\nof the word which are contingent—the fact that Sam is\nsad—and facts in the functorial sense which are not\ncontingent—the fact that \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). Or one may think that\nall facts in the functorial sense are contingent, are Humean matters\nof fact. The latter option is expounded in the influential philosophy\nof facts to be found in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\n(1921). Wittgenstein there announces that the world is the totality of\nfacts and that every fact is contingent (Wittgenstein TLP:\n1.1). \nThe word “fact”, particularly when it is understood in the\nfunctorial sense, belongs to a family of related terms:\n“circumstance”, “situation\n(Sachlage)”, “state of affairs\n(Sachverhalt)”. We refer happily to the state of\naffairs or circumstance that Sam is sad and to the situation in which\nSam is sad, although “It is a circumstance/situation that Sam is\nsad”, unlike “It is a fact/the case that Sam is\nsad”, is ill-formed. \nIn what follows, we distinguish three types of account of what it is\nto be a fact in the functorial sense and consider some possible roles\nfor facts which have been thought to yield arguments in favor of\nadmitting facts into our inventory of what there is. Since the\ncategory of facts is a formal category, a semantic or ontological\ncategory, we then look in some detail at different formal theories of\nfacts and their ilk. \nWhat might a fact be? Three popular views about the nature of facts\ncan be distinguished: \nIn order to understand these claims and the relations between them it\nis necessary to appeal to some accounts of truth, truth-bearers,\nstates of affairs, obtaining, objects, properties, relations and\nexemplification. Propositions are a popular candidate for the role of\nwhat is true or false. One view of propositions has it that these are\ncomposed exclusively of concepts, individual concepts (for example,\nthe concept associated with the proper name “Sam”),\ngeneral concepts (the concept expressed by the predicates “is\nsad” and “est triste”) and formal concepts\n(for example, the concept expressed by “or”). Concepts so\nunderstood are things we can understand. Properties and relations, we\nmay then say, are not concepts, for they are not the sort of thing we\nunderstand. Properties are exemplified by objects and objects fall\nunder concepts. Similarly, objects stand in relations but fall under\nrelational concepts. \nIt will be convenient to understand the view that a fact is just a\nsui generis type of entity in which objects exemplify\nproperties or stand in relations as relying on the way of\nunderstanding properties and relations just sketched. We shall refer\nto the view as the claim that facts are exemplifications. Similarly,\nwe may understand the claim that a fact is an obtaining state of\naffairs to say that a state of affairs is something which contains one\nor more objects and at least one property or relation and that a state\nof affairs obtains if an object exemplifies a property or one or more\nobjects stand in a relation. “Obtains” (German:\n“besteht”) belongs to the same family of\npredicates as “is true”. Just as it is often argued that\nthe truth-predicate is tenseless and timeless, so it is sometimes\nargued or assumed that “obtains” is tenseless and\ntimeless. A distinct question: Is “obtain” not simply a\nfancy way of saying “exists”? (Sundholm 1994). No, it is\nsometimes claimed. Obtaining is a mode of being. If a state of affairs\nobtains, then an obtaining state of affairs exists, a fact exists. In\nthis respect, “obtains” resembles “endures”.\nThings endure. If a thing endures, then the enduring thing exists. \nBut it should be noted that some philosophers use\n“proposition” or “structured proposition”\n(Soames 2010) to refer to what are here called “states of\naffairs” and that some philosophers do not distinguish between\nproperties and concepts. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that\nin ordinary English the expression “state of affairs” is\nnot normally used to refer to something which obtains or fails to\nobtain. It is used to refer to what is the case. Philosophers who talk\nof “states of affairs” as obtaining or failing to obtain\nare employing the term as a technical term, often as a translation of\nthe German word “Sachverhalt”. Finally, states of\naffairs, unlike facts, are commonly said to last or endure, whereas\n“Sachverhalte” do not last or endure. \nThe two views of facts as exemplifications of properties and as\nobtaining states of affairs raise many metaphysical and ontological\nquestions and are often appealed to in giving answers to metaphysical\nand ontological questions. They are also often appealed to in answers\nto questions about semantics and intentionality. Finally, facts are\nsometimes invoked in an area where semantics and ontology connect, the\ntheory of truthmaking. Throughout the twentieth century the categories\nof fact and state of affairs have also been been the object of\nscepticism (see Betti 2015). \nThe metaphysical and ontological questions which are raised by the two\nviews of facts mentioned include the following: Are the properties and\nrelations which go to make up facts abstract (repeatable) universals\nor bearer-specific (non-repeatable) properties and relations (tropes)?\nIf they are abstract universals, are these such that they are always\nexemplified, as friends of “Aristotelian” universals\nclaim, or not, as friends of “Platonic” universals claim?\nAnd are they qualitative only (the property of being round) or also\nsubstantial (the property of being a man)? Are there facts containing\nabstract objects and properties, for example the fact that 2 is a\nnumber? Is a fact which contains a concrete object, for example the\nfact that Sam is sad, itself concrete or abstract? Are there facts\nwhich are formally complex, for example negative or conditional facts?\nWhat is the relation between facts, on the one hand, and concrete\nevents, processes and states, on the other hand? Do objects stand in\nrelations because the objects and the relations they stand in\nare parts of facts? What are the identity conditions for facts? Are\nthere states of affairs which do not obtain? May such states of\naffairs contain non-existent objects? Are states of affairs abstract\nentities which exist necessarily? Do facts understood as\nexemplifications of properties come in two kinds—the\ncontingently existing ones and the non-contingently existing ones?\n(For discussions of all these questions see the entry on\n states of affairs.)\n If concrete events, processes and states are identical with facts or\ncan be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to think that\ncausality is a relation between facts. If they are not identical with\nfacts and cannot be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to\nthink that causality is a relation between events and states and that\ncausality should not be identified with causal explanations. For\ndiscussions of the view that one or both of the relata of the causal\nrelation are facts, see Vendler 1967a,b; Menzies 1989; Mellor 1995;\nPersson 1997; and also the entry on\n the metaphysics of causation. \nThe assumption that facts contain objects, properties and\nrelations as proper parts may be criticised (Lowe 1998; Vallicella\n2000; Künne 2003). One natural mereological principle is that the\nproper parts of the most basic kinds of whole belong to the same\ngeneral ontological category to which their wholes belong. Thus parts\nof things or substances are things or substances and parts of\nprocesses are processes. The view that the fact that Sam is sad\ncontains a substance and a property offends against this principle:\nsubstances and properties belong to different kinds and neither\nsubstances nor properties, it seems, are facts. Perhaps the natural\nmereological principle should be rejected in favor of the view that\nentities of any kind may come together to form a whole. But friends of\nfacts tend to think of facts as forming a very natural kind of whole.\nAnother possible view is that Sam is a fact rather than part of a fact\n(Armstrong 1997; Johansson 2004: 34; Récanati 2000; Bergmann\n1967). \nEven if facts or states of affairs do not contain objects\nsuch as substances or events, some may still be about, or\nconcern, such objects. This notion of aboutness has recently\nbeen assigned heavy metaphysical duties. Thus, Shamik Dasgupta (2014,\n2017) defines qualitative facts as facts which are not about\nany particular individuals, and argues that all the basic facts that\nconstitute the universe are qualitative, the individualistic (i.e.,\nnon-qualitative) facts being grounded in that qualitative basis (see\nbelow on grounding as a relation between facts). And Dan Marshall\nexploits the notion of factual aboutness for the purpose of theorizing\nabout intrinsicality. In his 2016a, he argues that a number\nof different notions of intrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the\nnotion of a state of affairs being intrinsically about\nsomething, and in his 2016b he defends a particular account of that\nsort. \nOne ontological role for states of affairs and facts is to be the\nprimary bearers of modality. Suppose that facts are obtaining states\nof affairs. Then we may distinguish the obtaining state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad from the obtaining states of affairs that Sam is\npossibly sad, that Sam is probably sad, and that Sam ought to be sad.\nHere the modal properties qualify the property of being sad and so\nqualify Sam. They are de re modalities. And, so the view\ngoes, the place of such modal properties is in states of affairs. (A\nstate of affairs is, as the German terms\n“Sachverhalt”,\n“Sachverhältnis” suggest, a relation between\nthings, the way things stand with respect to one another,\n“wie die Sachen sich zueinander verhalten”.) A\nfurther claim is that some de dicto modalities properly\nqualify states of affairs: the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nprobably obtains/possibly obtains/ought to obtain. Suppose that a fact\nis just the exemplification of properties. Then we may distinguish the\nfact that Sam is a man and the fact that Sam is necessarily a man. But\na friend of facts like the last one then has to accept that not all\nfacts are formally simple. \nAnother possible ontological role for states of affairs and facts is\nto provide the terms for the tie of grounding or explanation. The fact\nthat there is an explosion explains the fact that Sam’s head\nturns (causal explanation). The fact that Mary slapped Sam is\nexplained by the fact that Sam is a sexist (explanation of action by\nreference to an “objective” reason; Dancy 2000). The fact\nthat Sam admires Mary is explained by the fact that she is charming\n(explanation of feeling by reference to an “objective”\nreason). The fact that there is a one-one correlation between the\n\\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s is explained by the fact that the number of\n\\(F\\)s = the number of \\(G\\)s (non-causal, conceptual or essential\nexplanation). Sceptics about such claims ask what “the fact that\n\\(p\\) explains the fact that \\(q\\)” adds to “\\(q\\) because\n\\(p\\)”. (See Correia & Schnieder 2012, Mulligan 2007,\nTrogdon 2013, and the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.) \nAppeal to facts has also been made in order to give a semantics for\ncounterfactuals (Kratzer 2002). A premise semantics for\ncounterfactual, Kratzer argues, relies on facts: \nin a premise semantics, a “would”-counterfactual is true\nin a world \\(w\\) iff every way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the\nantecedent as consistency allows reaches a point where the resulting\nset logically implies the consequent. On the other hand, a\n“might”-counterfactual is true in a world \\(w\\) iff not\nevery way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the antecedent as\nconsistency allows reaches a point where adding the consequent would\nresult in an inconsistent set. \nThose facts, she argues, have to be propositions, but they must be\nhighly specific, almost as specific as facts conceived of as\nparticulars (see\n section 1.3\n below). \nFinally, certain metaphysical disputes of the realism/anti-realism\ntype are sometimes characterized in terms of facts: in such a dispute,\nthe realist is said to countenance facts of a certain kind, whereas\nthe anti-realist is said to reject facts of that kind. The\ndisagreement between realists about tense (or A-theorists) and\nanti-realists about tense (or B-theorists), for instance, is sometimes\ntaken to boil down to a disagreement about the question whether there\nare tensed facts: the former answer ‘Yes’ while the latter\nsay ‘No’. (See, e.g., Mellor 1998, Fine 2005 and Correia\n& Rosenkranz 2011.) \nOne difficulty faced by such characterizations is that of making clear\nwhat the relevant facts are supposed to be. The difficulty is\nparticularly acute in certain debates, for instance in the debate over\ntense realism. For what is it for a fact to be tensed? It cannot\nsimply be said that a tensed fact is a fact that can be referred to by\nmeans of a tensed description of type “the fact that\n\\(p\\)”, where “\\(p\\)” is a tensed sentence. For it\nis open to a B-theorist to hold that such expressions do refer to\n(tenseless) facts—e.g., that “the fact that Sam is\nlying” refers, at any time \\(t\\), to a fact which can also be\nreferred to (at any time) using the description “the fact that\nSam is lying at \\(t\\)”. Another suggestion is that a fact is\ntensed if and only if it is transient, i.e., sometimes obtains and\nsometimes fails to obtain. Yet, it may be replied, even if the\nproposed characterization does capture some tensed facts, it leaves\naside a number of other such facts, e.g., those which can be referred\nto by “the fact that Sam is currently sitting or not currently\nsitting” and (barring certain forms of indeterminism) “the\nfact that if Sam is currently sitting, then it was the case yesterday\nthat Sam would be sitting one day hence”, respectively. \n“Know” in instances of the locution “\\(x\\) knows\nthat \\(p\\)” is factive: if \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\).\nSimilarly, “know” in instances of the locution\n“\\(x\\) knows \\(y\\)” is veridical: if \\(x\\) knows \\(y\\), is\nacquainted with \\(y\\), then there is a \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) knows\n\\(y\\). \nIs knowledge that \\(p\\) knowledge of facts? Is coming to know (cf.\n“Erkennen”) that \\(p\\) a form of contact with\nfacts, where facts are understood as something other than true\ntruth-bearers? Husserl, Russell, Vendler and Hossack (Husserl\n1900–1901; Russell 1906–1907; Vendler 1967a, 1972; Hossack\n2007) reply affirmatively to one of these questions; thus Russell at\none point argues that a perception has a single object, such as\n“knife-to-left-of-book”, an entity he first called a\n“complex” and then “a fact” (Russell\nONTF). From Ramsey to Williamson (Ramsey 1927 [1931]; Vickers\n2004; Williamson 2000) many philosophers have replied negatively. \nWhat may be said in favor of the view? Consider the atomic predication\nFa, where this is a formula that a logician would use to\nrepresent the claim that object a has property F.\nComing to know that Fa, in the simplest cases, involves\nacquaintance with objects and properties. Coming to know that the wall\nis red by seeing that it is red often involves seeing the wall. The\nwall is not any sort of concept. According to a popular theory in\nperceptual psychology, seeing that the wall is red or straight\ntypically involves perception of a constant property, the redness or\nstraightness of the wall, and perception of it as constant\n(“property constancy”, “color constancy”,\n“shape constancy”). These properties are not concepts.\nThere is thus some reason for thinking that perceptually coming to\nknow that \\(p\\), in the simplest cases, involves epistemic contact\nwith objects and with properties. If that is right, then two\ncomponents of the view that to come to know that \\(p\\) in such cases\nis to come to have knowledge of facts are plausible. But even if\nperceptual knowledge of facts is allowed, it is not clear why one\nshould think that instances of “knowledge that \\(p\\)” or\nof “coming to know that \\(p\\)” in which the substitutions\nfor “\\(p\\)” are logically complex, constitute knowledge of\nrobust facts. Similarly, if we consider the many and various types of\ncoming to know that \\(p\\) in which the source of knowledge is not\nsensory perception but, for example, testimony or inference, we may\nthink that in such cases there is no reason to think that what we come\nto know are facts. \nKratzer’s (2002) account of knowledge of facts is applied to\nGettier problems (Gettier 1963, see the entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n She puts forward a view according to which facts are particulars\nwhich exemplify propositions (cf. Baylis 1948)—just as other\nparticulars such as tables and persons exemplify properties. (She\nmodels these facts and propositions within Situation Semantics, as\nsituations of a certain sort and sets of situations, respectively, but\nwe need not go into the details here. Note that, as we saw in\n section 1.2\n above, she also countenances facts which are propositions.)\nShe then proposes the following analysis of knowledge: \n\\(S\\) knows \\(p\\) if and only if \nIt is condition (ii), Kratzer argues, which deals with Gettier cases.\nTake the second type of case discussed by Gettier. Smith is justified\nin believing the false proposition that Jones owns a Ford. Therefore\nhe is justified in believing the proposition that Jones owns a Ford or\nBrown is in Barcelona. Now Brown happens to be in Barcelona, but Smith\nhas no idea about where Brown is—in particular, he is not\njustified in believing that Brown is in Barcelona. Intuitively, Smith\ndoes not know the disjunctive proposition he is justified in\nbelieving. But that proposition is true, and so the standard analysis\nof knowledge fails. The analysis in terms of beliefs de re of\nfacts fares better, Kratzer argues. For, she claims, the fact\nexemplified by the disjunctive proposition is the fact that Brown is\nin Barcelona, and Smith’s belief is not a de re belief\nabout that fact. \nWe have mentioned the view that facts may explain actions and mental\nstates and the view that facts are what we know. Facts are also\ninvoked in the philosophy of mind by philosophers who claim that\njudgments or beliefs enjoy the property of intentionality, of\nbeing “directed towards” something, because they\nrepresent states of affairs or are psychological relations to\nstates of affairs and that judgments and beliefs are correct or\nsatisfied only if states of affairs obtain, that is, if facts exist.\nVersions of these claims are given by many philosophers from Meinong,\nthe early Husserl and Russell to Searle (Searle 1983). Analogous\nclaims in semantics are sometimes made about propositions or other\ntruth-bearers: the proposition that Sam is sad represents the state of\naffairs that Sam is sad and is true only if this state of affairs\nobtains. Versions of this view are given by Husserl, Wittgenstein and\nCarnap. See the\n supplementary document on the History of Philosophies of Facts. \nOne objection to the view that the judgment that Sam is sad represents\na state of affairs is that although the judger arguably thinks of Sam\nand of his sadness, he may not possess any concept of a state of\naffairs. (Consider the analogous claim that one may judge that \\(p\\)\nwithout employing the concept of truth). Perhaps then a judgment\nrepresents a state of affairs but does not represent it as a\nstate of affairs. One objection to this claim is that it commits one\nto the ontological view that there are states of affairs which do not\nobtain, the states of affairs represented by false judgments or\nbeliefs. \nIf we reject the view that judgments and beliefs represent states of\naffairs, it is still possible to claim that judgments and beliefs have\ncorrectness conditions which mention states of affairs: if \\(x\\)\njudges correctly that \\(p\\), then the state of affairs that \\(p\\)\nobtains. And if this is plausible, so too is the further claim that if\n\\(x\\) judges correctly that \\(p\\), then \\(x\\) judges correctly that\n\\(p\\) because the state of affairs that \\(p\\) obtains. Facts make\njudgments correct. \nDoes the proposition that Sam is sad represent the state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad? It may be objected that the proposition does not\nrefer to anything as a state of affairs. And once again the friend of\nstates of affairs may retreat to the safer claims that the proposition\nthat Sam is sad is true only if the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nobtains and that if the proposition that Sam is sad is true, it is\ntrue because the state of affairs obtains. Facts make propositions\ntrue. \nFacts, then, are perhaps qualified to play the role of what makes\njudgments correct and propositions true. But the theory of correctness\nand of truth does not require us to accept that there are facts.\nIndeed it may be thought that the requirements of such a theory are\nsatisfied by the observations that a judgment that \\(p\\) is correct\nonly if \\(p\\), and that the proposition that \\(p\\) is true only if\n\\(p\\). If arguments in metaphysics or epistemology persuade us that\nthere are facts, then we may perhaps appeal to facts in giving\naccounts of correctness and of truth. In the case of the theory of\ncorrectness conditions for judgment and belief the argument that\nknowledge is of facts together with the view that, contrary to a long\nand influential tradition, the theory of belief and of judgment\npresupposes a theory of knowledge (Williamson 2000) may persuade us\nthat facts make judgments and beliefs correct. \nThe view that facts make propositions or other truth-bearers true is\none theory among many of truthmaking. The theory of truthmaking deals\nwith questions at the intersection between ontology, metaphysics and\nsemantics. The view that facts are what make truth-bearers true is the\noldest theory of truthmaking. One central choice within truthmaker\ntheory is between acceptance and rejection of truthmaker maximalism.\nTruthmaker maximalism is the view that every truth has a truthmaker.\n(It is an analogue of claims about modalities other than the modality\nof truth such as that every necessity is made necessary, that every\nprobability has a probabiliser, that if something has a value there is\nsomething which makes it valuable, a “valifier” etc.)\nFactualist truthmaker maximalism says that every truth is made true by\na fact. Factualist truthmaker maximalism comes in many shapes and\nsizes. It is sometimes combined with the view that propositions\nrepresent states of affairs. It is sometimes defended by friends of\nthe view that facts are obtaining states of affairs (Pfänder\n1921), sometimes by friends of the view that facts are neither true\npropositions nor obtaining states of affairs but exemplifications of\nproperties (Armstrong 2004). \nBy far the most popular objection to factualist truthmaker maximalism,\nan objection made by both friends and enemies of facts, is that it is\nontologically baroque, that is to say, incredible. The idea that there\nare negative or conditional facts, the objection goes, is incompatible\nwith the demands of metaphysical economy or with the requirements of\nnaturalism. By far the most popular factualist alternative to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism is the view that all logically atomic\ntruths have truthmakers and that these are formally simple or atomic\nfacts or the view that the only truthmakers which are facts are\nformally simple. Versions of these views are defended by the logical\natomists (see the entry on the\n correspondence theory of truth\n and\n section 2.4.2\n below). \nAppeals to facts as truthmakers presuppose that there are different\nfacts. But it has been argued that if there are any facts, there is\nonly one Great Fact. See the\n supplementary document on the Slingshot Argument. \nIf this argument is sound, then theories of facts as truthmakers and\nas what correspond to truths as well as many other theories which rely\non facts, are trivialised. \nIn the debate between friends and enemies of factualist truthmaker\nmaximalism it is often assumed that truthmakers must be ontologically\nor metaphysically fundamental. Indeed it is sometimes argued that the\ntheory of truthmaking is a guide to what there is and it is assumed\nthat what there is is just what is ontologically fundamental. The\nassumption may be rejected (see the entry on\n truthmakers).\n Perhaps there are facts but facts are not ontologically fundamental.\n(Compare the claim that there are social entities but that these are\nnot ontologically fundamental.) Then even atomic facts would not be\nontologically fundamental. Perhaps Sam and his concrete state of\nsadness are ontologically fundamental and the fact that Sam is sad is\nnot ontologically fundamental. \nWhat might it mean to say that there are facts but they are not\nontologically fundamental? Perhaps that facts or the unity of facts\nare determined by non-facts (Vallicella 2000, Mulligan 2006b).\nPossible candidates for this role are truth-bearers, for example\npropositions, together with what is ontologically fundamental. If\nfacts are not ontologically fundamental, then one objection to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism misses its mark. According to yet\nanother view, facts are complexes made up of objects and properties\nand those complexes which are facts are less basic than their parts\n(Fine 1982). \nAny philosophy of facts owes us an account of the form of such\nexpressions as “the fact that Sam is sad” (Lowe 1998) and\n“the state of affairs that Sam is sad”. (Analogous\nquestions arise concerning the form of “the proposition that Sam\nis sad”, “the property of sadness”, “the\nconcept of sadness” etc.) Friends of facts who have written at\ngreat length about facts and given the distinct impression that they\nare referring to facts and predicating properties of facts have\nnevertheless claimed that facts or situations cannot be named\n(Russell, Wittgenstein; cf. Clarke 1975) or that they have no\nproperties (Ingarden 1965). The expression “the fact that Sam is\nsad” looks like a definite description. What is the form of such\na description? One possibility (Künne 2003: 10) is that it should\nbe read as: the unique \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is a fact and \\(x =\\)\nthat Sam is sad. \nOne objection to this suggestion is that clauses such as “that\nSam is sad” cannot flank the identity sign. The following\nidentity sentence, on the other hand, is perfectly well-formed and,\nmany friends of facts claim, false: \nThe fact that Sam is sad = the proposition that Sam is sad \nThis suggests that clauses such as “that Sam is sad” can\nonly flank the identity sign if they are governed by expressions such\nas “the fact”, “the proposition”, “the\nbelief”. The suggested analysis of our definite descriptions may\nbe motivated by the assumption that “the fact that Sam is\nsad” is derived by nominalising “It is a fact that Sam is\nsad” and the assumption that in the latter sentence “It is\na fact” takes “that Sam is sad” to make a\nsentence. \nAnother account of expressions such as “the fact that\nFa” builds on suggestions made by Russell in 1913\n(Hochberg 2001). Let ‘\\(\\mathbf{T}\\)’,\n‘\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)’ and ‘\\(\\mathbf{IN}\\)’ express\nthe relations ‘is a term in’, ‘is an attribute\nin’ and ‘informs’, respectively. These relations are\nthe formal ontological relations between atomic facts, on the one\nhand, and their terms (objects), attributes (properties) and forms, on\nthe other hand. Then the structure of “the fact that Fa\nexists” is: \nThat is, the fact that contains \\(a\\) as a term and \\(F\\) as an\nattribute and that is of the form \\(\\phi x\\) exists. It has also been\nargued that what underlies talk about an object exemplifying a\nproperty is just the relations of being a term in a fact and being an\nattribute in a fact (Sprigge 1970). \nHow do expressions such as “the state of affairs that Sam is\nsad” relate to their referents? One view is that they are rigid\ndesignators. (For discussion of this question in connection with\nrelated cases such as instances of “the property of being\n\\(F\\)” and “the proposition that \\(p\\)”, see\nSchnieder 2005, Yagiwasa 1997, Tye 1981). \nAccording to a common definition, a brute fact is a fact that is\nunexplained, i.e. a fact of which there is no explanation. (On the\nquestion of how to characterise brute facts and a number of other\nissues discussed below, see Vintiadis and Mekios 2018, a volume\ndedicated to the topic of brute facts.) \n“Explain”, like many other verbs of interest to\nphilosophers (“mean”, “refer”\n“name”) can be used personally and impersonally (typically\na three-place vs a binary relation). The contrast is for instance\nbetween \nand \nPersonal explanations are not truth-bearers but are correct or\nincorrect and successful or unsuccessful. Impersonal explanations are\ntrue or false but not correct or incorrect, successful or\nunsuccessful. What is the relation between personal and impersonal\nexplanations? Plausibly, one connection between the two is this: if a\npersonal explanation is successful, then the person on the receiving\nend of the explanation must grasp some true impersonal explanation\nthanks to the explanation. Personal explanation is arguably irrelevant\nto the notion of bruteness, and accordingly from now on we will focus\non impersonal explanation. \nIt is common to distinguish between epistemic and\nmetaphysical (or ontic, or ontological) explanations (see\ne.g. Barnes 1984 and Salmon 1984). The distinction can be precisely\nformulated in many different ways, but the contrast can be illustrated\nin a simple way by means of an example taken from Bolzano 1837\n(§162). The following two statements are (let us suppose)\ntrue: \nWhereas the first one gives a metaphysical (in this case, a causal)\nexplanation of a fact, the second one gives an epistemic explanation\n(in this case, a reason to believe that a state of affairs obtains).\n(We find it very plausible to think that every epistemic explanation\nis a personal explanation, but since this seems to be far from being a\nmajority view, we will not assume it to be correct.) \nGiven that there is this distinction between explanations, one can\ncorrespondingly distinguish between two types of brute facts, the\nepistemically brute facts and the metaphysically\nbrute facts. Since epistemic explanations and metaphysical\nexplanations themselves come in various types, one can actually make\nmore fine-grained distinctions. Thus, for instance, if\ndeductive-nomological explanations count as epistemic explanations,\none can introduce the notion of a “deductive-nomologically brute\nfact”, i.e. of a fact that has no deductive-nomological\nexplanation. And given that grounding explanations (explanations given\nby pointing to a ground) count as metaphysical explanations, one can\nintroduce the notion of a “ground-theoretically brute\nfact”, i.e. of a fact that has no grounding explanation. \nA further distinction adds to the multiplicity of notions of\nbruteness. This is the distinction between explanations and relations\nthat “back” explanations. The relation of causation, it is\noften claimed, backs causal explanation: what makes it true that a\ngiven fact causally explains another fact is that the former causes\nthe latter or that some event causes another event. Likewise, some\nphilosophers distinguish between the relation of grounding and\ngrounding explanations (see §4 of the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Corresponding to these various relations are various notions of\nbeing brute, which must be distinguished from the notions\nintroduced above: being brute qua uncaused, being brute\nqua ungrounded, etc. These notions deserve to be put under the\nlabel “metaphysical bruteness”, just like the notions\ndefined in terms of explanation that we did put under this label\nabove. \nThus, there are very many notions of bruteness one may want to\ndistinguish. In what follows we will largely (but not completely)\nignore this variety, and we will focus mainly on metaphysical\nbruteness. \nThe fact that there is a world and the fact that throughout its\nhistory the universe will have contained exactly N electrons\nare perhaps good examples of facts that are metaphysically brute, in\nseveral senses of “metaphysically brute”. The same is\nperhaps true of basic laws of physics (understood as facts). \nIn reply to van Inwagen’s (1990) Special Composition Question,\nMarkosian (1998) defends the “brutality of compositional\nfacts”, the view that whenever there is an object composed of\nsome given objects, then it is an ungrounded fact that there is an\nobject composed of these objects. \nDasgupta (2016) holds that essentialist facts, such as the fact that\nSocrates is essentially human, are “not apt for being\ngrounded”, and hence are brute in the sense of ungrounded.\nGlazier (2017) argues against Dasgupta’s view, but holds that\nessentialist facts are brute in another sense. He advocates the view\nthat metaphysical explanations of a certain kind, essentialist\nexplanations of the type “p because it is essential to\nx that p”, are true when the explanans is\ntrue. On his view, essentialist facts cannot themselves receive such\nessentialist explanations, and hence are metaphysically brute in this\nspecific sense. \n“Emergent” facts (see the entry on emergent properties)\nprovide a further interesting illustration. On some views, they are\nbrute in the sense of ungrounded, but they are nevertheless\nnomologically necessitated by what they emerge from, and hence have an\nexplanation (see Baysan 2019). \nAre modal facts brute? This question has been at the centre of\nmetaphysical inquiry for a large part of the 20th century\nand is still widely debated. Which notion of bruteness is at stake in\nthe debate is however (very) often unclear. The key question here is\nwhether modal facts have their “source” in other kinds of\nfacts.  This can be understood in various ways, some\nmetaphysical, some not. Thus, friends of the view that necessity has\nits source in essence may be understood as endorsing any of the\nfollowing claims: \nOn each view, the fact that a given proposition is necessary is never\nbrute. While on the first view, it may be epistemic bruteness that is\ninvolved, on the other view it is metaphysical bruteness, in two\ndifferent forms. \nThe concept of a brute fact is closely related to the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see the entry on the\n principle of sufficient reason).\n The PSR comes in various versions. For each sense of\n“brute”, the claim that there are no brute facts is\n(logically equivalent to) a version of the PSR. Thus if we appeal to\nthe distinction between epistemically brute and metaphysically brute\nfacts, then some of these versions are epistemic (e.g. “Every\nfact has a deductive-nomological explanation”) and others\nmetaphysical (e.g. “Every fact is grounded”). \nVan Inwagen (1983) and Bennett (1984) once put forward a famous\nargument to the effect that the PSR entails that every truth is\nnecessary. Since some truths are contingent, the argument is in effect\nan objection against the PSR, and hence potentially in favour of brute\nfacts. The force of the argument strongly depends on which version of\nthe PSR is taken to be involved. The argument, in one version or\nanother, has stimulated much philosophical reflection since then (see\ne.g. Hudson 1997 and the reply in Feit 1998, Dasgupta 2016, and\nMcDaniel 2019 and the reply in Werner 2020). \nFollowing current discussions on grounding, let us define\nmetaphysical foundationalism as the view according to which\nevery fact is either ungrounded or grounded in ungrounded facts (see\nDixon 2016 and Rabin & Rabern 2016 for discussions on the view and\nits relations to other views in the vicinity). Metaphysical\nfoundationalism entails that there are ungrounded facts. The converse\nentailment, of course, fails. \nLet us say, following common usage, that a fact partially\ngrounds another fact if the former fully grounds, or only helps\nto ground, the latter. Granted that partial grounding is a strict\npartial order (i.e. a transitive and irreflexive relation), the\nnegation of metaphysical foundationalism entails the existence of\ninfinitely descending chains of partial grounds (a series \\(F_1\\),\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_3\\), … where \\(F_1\\) is partially grounded in\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_2\\) in \\(F_3\\), …). The converse entailment, of\ncourse, also fails: foundationalism is compatible with the existence\nof such chains. \nSwapping grounding for other explanation-backing relations, or for\nrelations of explaining, yields other forms of foundationalism, and\nthe previous considerations apply mutatis mutandis to these\nviews. \n“Brute” is often taken to be interchangeable with\n“fundamental” (see McKenzie 2017 for a representative list\nof references). Is this objectionable? Just like “brute”,\n“fundamental” can be understood in many ways (see the\nentry on\n fundamentality\n for the various notions currently discussed in metaphysics), and\nwhether “brute” and “fundamental” mean the\nsame or otherwise have the same extension depends, trivially, on how\nthese terms are understood. As we saw, “brute” can be\nunderstood as meaning the same as “ungrounded”. In some\ncontexts, many philosophers use “fundamental” as\nsynonymous with “ungrounded” in a way that is not at all\nobjectionable (see e.g. Bennett 2011, Rosen 2010 and Schaffer 2009).\nUsing “brute” and “fundamental” as\ninterchangeable can thus be perfectly legitimate, albeit in\nuninteresting ways. \nThe question of interchangeability becomes interesting when\n“brute” and “fundamental” are used with\ndifferent meanings. Thus, for instance, the question of whether a\nfundamental qua ungrounded fact can fail to be brute qua\nlacking a metaphysical explanation is interesting\n(McKenzie’s (2017) aim is to argue for a positive answer to this\nquestion). However, in this case, as presumably in all the other\npossible cases of interest, the use of the labels “brute”\nand “fundamental” is immaterial because the question can\nbe rephrased using only their respective definientia (the\nprevious question, for instance, can be rephrased as the question\nwhether an ungrounded fact can be metaphysically explained). \nFormal studies of facts are scarce. And they are also heterogeneous,\nboth in form and in content. In form insofar as they are formulated in\nlanguages of various kinds, which vary greatly in expressive power.\nAnd in content, not only because of the variety of views on given\nissues, but also because the kind of issues dealt with varies greatly.\nThis makes it difficult to present these theories within a uniform\nframework. We are going to choose a specific framework, present,\nwithin that framework, (some of) the options a fact-theorist may wish\nto adopt, study their relationships, and give references in due course\nto indicate where in the resulting space of possible theories various\naccounts, formal and non-formal, are to be located. Our framework is\nsignificantly distinct from many of those which are used in the\nliterature. So it should be kept in mind that in attributing this or\nthat view to an author, what we will say is often not to be understood\nliterally: when it is not, what we really attribute to the\nauthor is something which, translated into our framework, is what we\nliterally attribute to her. \nThere are two main uses of the predicate ‘is a fact’. On\none of them, the predicate is rigid (necessarily, if something is a\nfact, then it cannot fail to be a fact). On that use, and given the\nassumption that there are contingent facts, it is possible that\nsomething be a fact without existing (obtaining). On the second use,\nnothing can be a fact unless it exists, and so on the assumption that\nthere are contingent facts, the predicate is non-rigid. Some call\nfacts in the first sense states of affairs or\nsituations, reserving the word ‘fact’ to mean\nwhat ‘obtaining state of affairs’ or ‘actual\nsituation’ mean. Throughout this section we shall use\n‘fact’ in the first sense. \nThe issues we are going to deal with fall under the following five\nheadings: Facts and Worlds, Boolean Operations on Facts, Independency,\nFacts and Propositions, The Inner Structure of Facts. The presentation\nwill be cumulative in character: in each section we will come back to\ntopics dealt with in previous ones (if any), sometimes in order to\ncompare the current options available to a fact-theorist to the old\nones. \nMany metaphysicians are interested in the modal sphere. They do not\nonly want to determine which entities there actually are and\ntheir actual properties. They wish to formulate claims with\nmodal content, they want to determine which entities there\ncan or must be, and which are their properties\nacross all (metaphysically) possible worlds. \nIn this section we deal with some basic modal issues related to facts.\nMore precisely, we shall present and compare certain principles\ninvolving facts and (possible) worlds. Although at some places we\nshall mention the view that worlds are themselves facts, or sets or\npluralities or sums of facts, we shall remain neutral as to the nature\nof worlds. \nLet \\(W\\) be the set of all possible worlds, \\(F\\) the function which\nassigns to each world \\(w\\) the set \\(F_w\\) of facts which exist in\nit, and \\(F\\) the union of all the \\(F_w s\\), i.e., the set of all\nfacts. We assume that \\(W\\) has infinitely many members. This is a\nreasonable assumption, which will have some importance in what follows\nwith respect to certain entailment claims we are going to make (not\nhaving the assumption would force us to distinguish cases). Since we\nare dealing with theories of facts, we shall also assume that \\(F\\) is\nnon-empty. Although perhaps there are impossible states of affairs or\nsituations, we take it that there are no impossible facts. That is why\nthere is no room for them in our framework. \nWhere \\(x\\) is a fact, \\(\\ES(x)\\) (the existence-set of\n\\(x\\)) is the set of all worlds at which \\(x\\) exists. And where \\(G\\)\nis a set of facts, \\(\\CES(G)\\) (the conjunctive-existence-set\nof \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cap_{x\\in G} \\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at\nwhich all elements of \\(G\\) exist, and \\(\\DES(G)\\) (the\ndisjunctive-existence-set of \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cup_{x\\in G}\n\\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at which some elements of \\(G\\)\nexist. Notice that \\(\\CES(\\varnothing) = W\\), \\(\\DES(\\varnothing) =\n\\varnothing\\), and that given any \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\), \\(\\CES(G)\n\\subseteq \\DES(G)\\). (Here and elsewhere, we borrow some vocabulary\nand symbolism from Fine 1982.) \nWe shall say that a set of facts \\(G\\) characterizes a set of\nworlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) = V\\), and that a fact \\(x\\)\ncharacterizes a set of worlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\ES(x) = V\\) (no\nconfusion should arise from the ambiguity of\n‘characterize’). At this very early point some work can\nalready be done. \nWe assume the following definitions: \nOf special interest are the following Boolean principles\n(‘\\(\\setsub\\)’ refers to the operation of set-theoretic\nsubtraction): \nIf facts can be negated, then the negation of fact \\(x\\) (if any) will\nhave existence-set \\(W \\setsub \\ES(x)\\). If facts can be conjoined,\nthen the conjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have\nexistence-set \\(\\CES(G)\\). And if facts can be disjoined, then the\ndisjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have existence-set\n\\(\\DES(G)\\). One can then understand why we call these principles\n‘Boolean’. \nB1 and B3 together entail B4. Assuming B1 and B4, B2 is equivalent to\nB3. Notice that if it is assumed that every world contains at least\none fact (a principle we shall call ‘Plenitude’),\nthen B3 implies B4 (take \\(G = F)\\). Also notice that both B1 and B4\nentail Plenitude. See Figure 1. \nFigure 1. \nIt is tempting to adopt the principle: \nNo Twins. Worlds with the very same facts (twins,\nfor short) are identical, i.e., \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(w = v\\),\ni.e., \\(F\\) is injective. \nAnother formulation of No Twins might be the following: the\nidentity of a world is completely determined by which facts hold in\nit. No Twins imposes serious constraints on the cardinality\nof \\(F\\). In particular, since there are infinitely many worlds,\nNo Twins implies that there must also be infinitely many\nfacts. \nThe B-principles assert the existence of facts characterising various\nsets of worlds. Similar principles of special interest are of the same\nvein: \nThe W-principles have mates of a certain interest: \nA set* is a set of worlds which contains all twins of its\nmembers \\((\\varnothing\\) and \\(W\\) are then sets*), and a\nsingleton* is a set* whose members are all twins. Notice that\nall existence-sets, conjunctive existence-sets and disjunctive\nexistence-sets, as well as their complements in \\(W\\), are sets*. \nW4 entails both W2 and W3, and in turn each of them entails W1. All\nthe same, W\\(4'\\) entails both W\\(2'\\) and W\\(3'\\), and in turn each\nof them entails W\\(1'\\). No Twins is a consequence of W1.\nUnder the assumption that No Twins is true, each W\\(i\\) is\nequivalent to W\\(i'\\). So each W\\(i\\) entails W\\(i'\\). W\\(4'\\) entails\nall the Bs. W\\(1'\\) entails Plenitude. W4 is thus an\nextremely strong principle, since it entails all the principles we\nhave met so far. See Figure 2. \nFigure 2. \nW\\(4'\\) is equivalent to B\\(2 +\\) W\\(3'\\), W\\(2'\\) plus B3 yields\nW\\(4'\\), W\\(1'\\) plus B2 yields W\\(2'\\). B1 yields W\\(1'\\). See Figure\n3. \nFigure 3. \nAll the previous principles are compatible with there being distinct\nfacts existing at exactly the very same worlds. One may wish to deny\nthat this is possible, and adopt: \nModal Criterion. Two facts are identical if they have the\nsame existence-set, i.e., \\(x = y\\) whenever \\(\\ES(x) = \\ES(y)\\). \nThis provides a modal criterion for the identity of facts. If\nModal Criterion is accepted, each B-principle is equivalent\nto the result of replacing in the principle ‘some fact’ by\n‘a unique fact’. The same holds of W2, W\\(2'\\), W4 and\nW\\(4'\\). \nModal Criterion is controversial. One may wish to claim that\nthere are such things as the fact that Socrates exists, the fact that\nSocrates exists and every number is a number, and the fact that\nsingleton [Socrates] exists, and that all or some of these facts are\ndistinct. But given plausible assumptions about the\nexistence-conditions of these facts, they all have the same\nexistence-set. \nModal Criterion holds in the views put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP, Suszko 1968 and Fine 1982 (in theories\nF(A)-Cond and C-Cond). It does not hold in Fine’s theory F-Cond\n(Fine 1982) and Zalta’s theory (Zalta 1991), under the two\ninterpretations indeed. References relative to previous principles\nwill be given later on. More detail is available in the\n supplementary document on Some Formal Theories in the Literature. \nThere is a view according to which propositions are sets of worlds.\nOne might prefer to identify facts with sets of worlds (this\nis what is done in Restall 2004). On this view, for every fact \\(x\\),\n\\(\\ES(x) = x\\), and for every world \\(w, F_w = \\{x : x\\in F\\) and\n\\(w\\in x\\}\\). Modal Criterion is then satisfied. Suppose that\nall non-empty sets of worlds are facts. This is a very natural option\nfor the view under consideration, and is actually countenanced by\nRestall. Then the strong W4 is satisfied. \nOn a dual view, worlds are taken to be sets of facts, a world being\nidentified with its own domain: for every world \\(w, F_w = w\\). On\nthat view, No Twins is trivially true. Variants on that view\ntake worlds to be pluralities, or mereological sums of facts.\nCresswell (Cresswell 1972) is in the set camp, Wittgenstein\n(TLP), it seems, in the plurality camp. \nStill another view is that worlds are themselves facts (Suszko 1968,\nPlantinga 1974 and Zalta 1991). A natural claim, on that view, is that\neach world belongs to its own domain and to it only, i.e., that for\nevery world \\(w\\), \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). If this is accepted, No\nTwins and W2 are true. \nHere is a simple theory which goes in that direction (Wolniewicz\n1982). Let us take the notion of a fact containing another\nfact as a primitive. We shall use ‘\\(x \\le y\\)’ for\n‘\\(x\\) is contained in \\(y\\)’, and we shall take relation\n\\(\\le\\) to be reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. One option is\nto define fact containment in modal terms (i.e., define ‘\\(x \\le\ny\\)’ as ‘necessarily, \\(x\\) exists if \\(y\\) does’),\nbut we shall remain neutral on this issue. \nLet us define a world as a maximal fact under the relation of\nfact-containment: \\(x\\) is a world iff for every fact \\(y\\), if \\(x\n\\le y\\), then \\(x = y\\). We assume that every fact is contained in\nsome world. \nWe then define the domain \\(F_w\\) of world \\(w\\) to be the set of all\nfacts \\(w\\) contains. Thus the union of all the domains is the set of\nall facts. Clearly, each world belongs to its own domain and to it\nonly: \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). So (as we previously pointed out) No\nTwins and W2 hold, and Modal Criterion is ensured if we\naccept the principle according to which two facts are identical\nprovided that they are contained in the very same worlds. \nPropositions can be negated, conjoined and disjoined to other\npropositions. As we previously saw, there is an issue as to whether\nthe same holds of facts. In this section we introduce the Boolean\noperations on facts, and point to the four main views as to which of\nthese operations actually exist. \nAn operation of negation on facts is a function \\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{n}}\\)\nwhich satisfies the following axioms: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B1. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of negation is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B1 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view which takes facts to be sets of worlds; in that case,\nset-complementation is a negation operation. \nAn operation of conjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{c}}\\) which obeys the following principles: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B2. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of conjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B2 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, intersection is a\nconjunction operation. \nFinally, an operation of disjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{d}}\\) which has the following properties: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B3. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of disjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B3 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, union is a\ndisjunction operation. \nSuppose all three operations are accepted (in which case all the Bs\nare true). It is then possible to define an operation in terms of\nnegation and conjunction which behaves almost exactly like\ndisjunction. Let \\(\\varrho(F)\\) be the set of all sets of facts \\(G\\)\nwith \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\) and \\(\\DES(G) \\ne W\\). Where \\(H\\) is any\nset of facts, we let \\(\\mathbf{n}H\\) be \\(\\{x^\\textbf{n}\\) : \\(x\\in\nH\\cap F^{\\#}\\}\\), the negative image of \\(H\\). This\ndisjunction-like operation, \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\), is a (total) function\nfrom \\(\\varrho(F)\\) to \\(F^{\\#}\\) defined by the following condition:\n\\(G^{\\delta} = (\\mathbf{n}G)^{\\textbf{{cn}}}\\). \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\)\nbehaves like disjunction in that it satisfies the principles resulting\nfrom replacing ‘\\(P(F)^*\\)’ by\n‘\\(\\varrho(F)\\)’ in\nD1–D4. \nSome extra principles must then presumably be introduced, as we\npresumably want \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) and \\(^{\\delta}\\) to coincide on\n\\(\\varrho(F)\\). We may just adopt the principle which says this: \nHere is a table indicating, for some theories, which operations they\nallow \\((+\\) means acceptance and \\(-\\) rejection): \n(On the entries containing a *, see the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.)\n In the case of Restall, commitment to all three operations directly\nfollows from the fact that his theory validates W4 and Modal\nCriterion. Taylor in fact has no modal theory of facts, but it\nseems that in a natural modal extension of his theory the previously\nmentioned acceptance claims should be correct. The restrictions in\nTaylor’s case are due to the fact that he works with standard\nfirst-order languages. Taylor is concerned with giving a theory of the\nfacts “posited” by standard first-order languages, i.e.,\nof the facts which play a role in determining the truth-values of the\nsentences of that language. Standard first-order languages admit of\nconjunction and disjunction only on finite collections of sentences,\nhence the restrictions relative to facts. But clearly, moving to\nlanguages in which infinite conjunctions and disjunctions are freely\nallowed, the restrictions would vanish. \nIn the light of the previous table, there are four main views as to\nwhich Boolean operations are to be accepted: \n(The restrictions for conjunction and disjunction indicated in the\ntable are due to accidental limitations in expressive power, as we\npointed out for the case of Taylor, and point out for the other cases\nin the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.) \nSay that a set of facts \\(G\\) is independent iff \\(G\\) is not\nempty and any of its subsets \\(H\\) is such that there is a domain\n\\(F_w\\) such that such that \\(G \\cap F_w = H\\). That \\(G\\) is\nindependent means (i) that any collection of facts in \\(G\\) may obtain\ntogether without any other fact in \\(G\\) obtaining, and (ii) that no\nfact in \\(G\\) need obtain. \nLet \\(^{\\textbf{n}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{c}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) be Boolean\noperations, of negation, conjunction and disjunction, respectively.\nWhere \\(G\\) is any set of facts, we put: \nEach world-domain is maximal consistent. Maximal consistency entails\nconjunctive closure, so each world-domain is maximal consistent. A\nmaximal set of facts contains all non-contingent facts (if any), and\nis never empty. \nWhere \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are any set of facts, we shall say that: \nNotice that \\(\\mathbf{dc}(H \\cup \\mathbf{n}H)\\) is the smallest set of\nfacts containing \\(H\\) closed under the Boolean operations. \nSuppose there is an independent set \\(H\\). Then if \\(H = F\\) or \\(H\\)\ngenerates \\(F\\) via conjunction, then all facts are contingent.\nMoreover, Modal Criterion holds if \\(H = F\\) or generates\n\\(F\\) via conjunction or Booleanization. \nWe shall now consider three particular theories of facts involving the\nnotions of independence and generation: \nLet \\(\\phi\\) be the function which associates to each singleton* the\ncommon domain of its members. Consider now the following\nprinciples: \nFor \\(i = 1, 3\\) or 4, \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails Co\\(_i\\). If No\nTwins is added to each theory, each \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails the\nprinciple which results from replacing ‘\\(\\phi\\)’ by\n‘\\(F\\)’ and ‘the set of all singletons’ by\n‘\\(W\\)’ in Co\\(_i\\): \nSome properties of our theories are depicted in the following table,\nwhere ‘+’ means ‘holds’, ‘−’\nmeans ‘fails to hold’ and ‘?’ means\n‘indeterminate’. \nIn the presence of No Twins, \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) entails all the\nWs. \n\\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) is a component of Wittgenstein’s logical\natomism in Wittgenstein TLP. It also appears in Cresswell\n1972. Suszko 1968 has something very close to \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) (cf.\nthe supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature). \nArmstrong (1997) works with a different notion of independency, which\nwe may call independency*. A set of facts is independent* iff\ngiven any of it subsets \\(G\\) and any of its member \\(x\\) not in\n\\(G\\), it is possible that the members of \\(G\\) exist without \\(x\\),\nand it is also possible that they exist with \\(x\\). Independency is\nstrictly stronger than independency*: The independency*, but not the\nindependency, of a set is compatible with there being a member of that\nset existing in every world (not the same member each time, of\ncourse). Armstrong expresses the hope that the set of atomic facts he\ncountenances is independent*, though he recognizes that there may be\ndifficulties to defend the view. We do not know whether he would\nexpress the hope that the set of atomic facts he countenances is\nindependent tout court. Anyway, even if he held the view he\nwould not endorse \\(\\textrm{T}_3\\), since he recognizes\n“totality facts” (cf.\n section 2.4.2),\n which are not conjunctions of atomic facts. \nAs we pointed out above, one view about facts is that to be a fact is\nto be a true proposition. On another, incompatible view, facts are\nwhat make true propositions true, or more generally, account for their\ntruth. The search for what accounts for the truth of propositions is,\nas we have seen, actually one main rationale for the introduction of\nfacts. In what follows we shall deal with the two views. \nBy ‘proposition’, we shall mean truth-bearer, and\nremain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements,\nbeliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for\ninstance—except in\n section 2.4.1. \nEach world \\(w\\) has its set \\(\\textrm{T}_w\\) of true propositions,\nand we call \\(\\TS(p)\\) (the truth-set of \\(p\\)) the set of\nall worlds at which \\(p\\) is true. Where \\(p\\) is a proposition, let\n\\(\\ES(p)\\) (the existence-set of \\(p\\)) be the set of all\nworlds at which it exists. \nLet us consider here the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition. On such a view, propositions cannot be sentences or\nstatements or beliefs. They are, perhaps, abstract entities expressed\nor designated by sentences. \nThere is an issue as to what the existence-conditions for propositions\n(taken in that sense, the qualification will be constant in this\nsection) are, which is relevant for the view under consideration. On\none view, propositions exist necessarily, i.e., the existence-set of\nany proposition is \\(W\\), the set of all possible worlds. On another\nview, the existence of a proposition is in general world-relative. \nThe world-relative view comes in several variants. Two such variants\nwhich will be of central interest to us correspond to the two possible\nanswers to the question ‘Can a proposition be true without\nexisting?’. The view that a proposition can be true without\nexisting is quite plausible under the assumption that propositions\nexpressed by sentences which contain proper names are composite\nobjects which literally contain the individuals denoted by these\nnames. For it is plausible to maintain that no whole can exist without\nits parts, and if this and the previously mentioned assumption are\ntrue, then the proposition expressed by ‘Socrates is not a\nphilosopher’ will turn out true in worlds where it does not\nexist (it is assumed here that there can be no non-existent\nphilosopher, and that Socrates is not a necessary existent). (Against\nthis line of thought, see the discussion of New Actualism in the entry\non\n actualism.) \nThere is a conception of propositions according to which they are sets\nof worlds (see, e.g., Stalnaker 1976). On such a conception, the\ntruth-set of a proposition is the proposition itself, and issues about\npropositional existence remain: it may be held that propositions exist\nnecessarily, or that their existence is in general world-relative. The\nfirst option seems intrinsically the most natural, and a proponent of\nthe world-relative view will most naturally identify the existence-set\nof a proposition with its truth-set—or so it seems. \nWhere \\(w\\) is a world, let \\(P_w\\) be the set of propositions which\nexists in it, and let \\(P\\) be \\(\\cup_{w\\in W} P_{w}\\), the set of all\npropositions. On the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition, the set of facts which exist in world \\(w\\) is the set of\nall propositions which exist and are true at \\(w\\), i.e., \\(F_{w} =\nT_w \\cap P_{w}\\), and the existence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\ES(x)\n\\cap \\TS(x)\\). (There is a similar view according to which all facts\nare true propositions, while some true propositions—say, the\ncomplex ones—may not be facts, but we leave it aside.) Of\ncourse, under the assumption that no proposition can be true without\nexisting, in particular under the assumption that they exist\nnecessarily, for every world \\(w, F_{w} = T_{w}\\), and the\nexistence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\TS(x)\\). \nSuppose that propositions exist necessarily. It is plausible to say\nthat propositions can be freely negated, conjoined and disjoined to\nother propositions. On that view, there are operations of negation,\nconjunction and disjunction of facts which obey the principles we\npreviously introduced. The resulting view is thus extremely strong. If\nnot all propositions exist necessarily, then questions related to the\nBoolean operations receive answers which may vary according to the\nexistence-conditions which are imposed on propositions. \nAs we have emphasized, one of the main rationale for introducing facts\nhas been to account for the truth of true propositions. The idea is\nthat whenever a proposition is true, its truth is to be explained in\nterms of the existence and / or non-existence of some facts. \nA minimal requirement one may wish to impose in that direction is the\nfollowing: \nSupervenience. \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(T_{w} =\nT_{v}\\). \nThis says that truth supervenes on facts: no difference in truth\nwithout a difference in facts. \nSupervenience is a direct consequence of No Twins,\nbut one may wish to leave open the possibility of distinct worlds\ncontaining the same facts. (On the view that to be a fact is to be a\ntrue proposition, Supervenience trivially holds if it is\nassumed that no proposition can be true if it does not exist. If that\nassumption is dropped, then there is room for Supervenience\nto fail. That might be taken to be an argument for keeping the\nassumption on the view under consideration.) \nLet us say that a property \\(\\phi\\) is a fact-condition iff\nit is a binary relation connecting sets of sets of facts and worlds,\nsuch that given any set of sets of facts \\(\\Gamma\\) and any worlds\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\), if \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\), then \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\) iff\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v)\\) (i.e., the holding of the condition supervenes on\nwhich facts there are). The following principle better captures the\nidea that facts account for the truth of true propositions: \nDetermination. For every proposition \\(p\\) and every world\n\\(w\\) at which it is true, there exists a fact-condition \\(\\phi\\) and\na set \\(\\Gamma\\) of sets of facts such that \nDetermination clearly entails Supervenience. \nLet us examine some stronger principles. Let us say that some given\nfacts (jointly) necessitate proposition \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\) is\ntrue in every world where they all exist. The facts in set \\(G\\)\n(jointly) necessitate \\(p\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) \\subseteq \\TS(p)\\). Let us\nalso say that some given facts (jointly) make true\nproposition \\(p\\) in world \\(w\\) iff they all exist in \\(w\\) and they\nnecessitate the proposition. Let us finally say that proposition \\(p\\)\nrepresents some given facts iff in every world where \\(p\\) is\ntrue, some of them exist. Proposition \\(p\\) represents the facts in\n\\(G\\) iff \\(\\TS(p) \\subseteq \\DES(G)\\). \nOur definition of truthmaking fails to capture the explanatory\ncharacter of the notion people have usually in mind when they talk\nabout truthmaking. If something makes a given proposition\ntrue, it is usually assumed, then the existence of that thing explains\nthe truth of the proposition. Now it should be clear that truthmaking\nas we have defined it is not explanatory in this sense. For everything\nwhatsoever is a truthmaker (in our sense) for any necessary\nproposition, while arguably, the obtaining of the fact that Philipp\nlives in Geneva fails to explain the truth of your favourite\ntautology. Or again, consider Socrates and its singleton-set,\n[Socrates]. It may be argued, as we previously stressed, that granted\nthat there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists and the\nfact that [Socrates] exists, these two facts obtain in exactly the\nsame worlds. Assume this is the case. Now some may be happy with the\nview that the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in the usual\nsense) for the proposition that Socrates exists—and so with the\nview that the obtaining of the fact explains the truth of the\nproposition, but the view that the truth of that proposition is\nexplained by the obtaining of the fact that the singleton exists is\nhighly implausible. Yet if the fact that Socrates exists is a\ntruthmaker (in our sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists,\nthen the fact that the singleton exists is also a truthmaker (in our\nsense) for that proposition. \nRepresentation, as we have defined it, is also quite remote from what\npeople usually have in mind when they speak of propositions\nrepresenting facts: propositions which cannot be true represent (in\nour sense) any fact whatsoever, and if the proposition that Socrates\nexists represents (in our sense) the fact that Socrates exists, then\nit also represents (in our sense) the fact that [Socrates] exists\n(granted that these two facts exist at the same worlds). \nDespite the fact that truthmaking as defined above does not to capture\nthe usual concept of making true, we shall not deal with the latter\nconcept here. And we shall not deal either with the usual notion of\nrepresentation. \nLet us now turn to the stronger principles. A very strong principle\nconnecting propositions and facts says that for every proposition\n\\(p\\) which can be true, there exists a fact represented by \\(p\\)\nwhich necessitates \\(p\\) (i.e., a fact which makes the proposition\ntrue in every world where it is true). The principle just says that\nfor every proposition which can be true, there is a fact whose\nexistence-set is identical to the proposition’s truth-set: \n(\\(P^{\\circ}\\) is the set of all propositions which can be true.) \nThis is a very strong principle. Under reasonable assumptions, P1\nentails the strong principle W4. For instance, this is so under the\nassumption that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some\nproposition. This assumption trivially holds if sets of worlds are\ntaken to be propositions, but such an assumption is not needed. For\nlet \\(V\\) be any set of worlds. Assume that No Twins is true.\nTo each world \\(w\\) associate the conjunction \\(c_w\\) of all\npropositions true in \\(w\\) (we suppose it exists), and consider the\ndisjunction \\(d_V\\) of all \\(c_w, w\\in V\\) (we suppose it exists).\nThen \\(\\TS(d_V) = V\\). \nTheory F(A)-Cond described in Fine 1982 licences P1, as well as the\ntheory put forward in Zalta 1991 (cf. the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n As we saw, Taylor (1985) has no modal theory of facts, but it seems\nthat in a natural modal extension of his theory, P1 should hold.\nNotice that P1 is immediate on the view that facts are sets of worlds,\nand that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts (the view put forward\nin Restall 2004). For then, \\(\\ES(x) = x\\) for any fact \\(x\\). \nP1 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\).\nConsider the following assumptions \\((H_0\\) is a selected independent\nset which generates \\(F\\) via Booleanization): \nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) may be willing to accept them, and doing\nso he will thereby endorse P1. \nThere is a simpler argument against P1 enemies of disjunctive facts\nmay advance. Take any two propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and assume they\nhave a disjunction \\(r\\) (we may assume that \\(p\\) can be true and\n\\(q\\) false, and vice versa). By P1, there are facts \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\) and \\(\\ES(y) = \\TS(q)\\) and\n\\(\\ES(z) = \\TS(r)\\). So \\(\\ES(z) = \\ES(x) \\cup \\ES(y)\\), and \\(z\\)\nbehaves like a disjunctive fact: it exists in a world iff \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) does. \nThose who take these to be problems may endorse the following weaker\nprinciple: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can be true and every\nworld \\(w\\) at which it is true, there is a fact which makes it true.\nThat principle is equivalent to: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can\nbe true, there exists a set of facts \\(G\\) whose members are\nrepresented by \\(p\\) such that every member of \\(G\\) necessitates\n\\(p\\). To put it differently, for every proposition which can be true,\nthere is set of facts whose disjunctive existence-set is identical to\nthe proposition’s truth-set: \nThis principle is endorsed by Armstrong (1997), and seems to be taken\nby Fine as fitting his theory C-Cond (Fine 1982; cf. the supplementary\ndocument\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature). \nBut there are still potential problems, this time related to\nconjunction. \nFor take the conjunctive proposition that Socrates is a philosopher\nand Frege is human. P2 tells us that there is a set of facts \\(K\\)\nsuch that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is\nthat set of facts? One may be tempted to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human.\nIt is hard to see which other answer could be provided, and so P2\nseems to commit one to conjunctive facts. \nThose who are bothered by these features of P1 and P2 may wish to\nadopt the following principle: there is a special set of propositions\n\\(Q\\) such that (i) the restriction of P1 to \\(Q\\) holds, i.e., for\nevery \\(p\\) in \\(Q\\), there is a fact \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) =\n\\TS(p)\\), and (ii) for every world \\(w\\) where a proposition \\(p\\) is\ntrue, there is a part \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) whose members are true, and such\nthat in every world where they are true, \\(p\\) is true. \nBut there are still potential problems, which actually affect P2 as\nwell, this time related to negation. Take the negative proposition\nthat Socrates is not a philosopher. By P2, there is a set of facts\n\\(K\\) such that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What\nis that set of facts? One may wish to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is not a philosopher. Again, it is\nhard to think of any alternative, and so P2 seems to commit one to\nnegative facts. Alternatively, assume the previous principle. Shall we\ntake the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher to be in \\(Q\\)\nor not? If we do, then we are in the same situation as before: we seem\nto be committed to negative facts. If we do not, it is hard to see\nwhich set of propositions \\(R \\subseteq Q\\) satisfying condition (ii)\nabove we are going to choose. \nIn order to deal with negative propositions, Armstrong (1997) invokes\na certain kind of facts which he calls ‘totality facts’,\nfacts which can be designated by means of expressions of type\n‘the fact that \\(X\\) are all the \\(F\\)s that there are’,\nwhere ‘\\(X\\)’ is a rigid plural designator and\n‘\\(F\\)’ a predicate. The proposition that Socrates is not\na philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the atomic\nfacts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there are—a\ntotality fact. \nThose who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative\nand totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker\nthan P2): \nP3 says that the following is true of every proposition \\(p\\) which\ncan be true: for every world where \\(p\\) is true, there are two sets\nof facts \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) such that (i) in \\(w\\), all members of \\(G\\)\nexist and none of \\(H\\) do, and (ii) in every world where this is the\ncase, \\(p\\) is true. That principle is rather ugly, but it does what\nit should do. \nP3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\).\nConsider the following assumptions: \nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) may be willing to accept\nthem—Wittgenstein (TLP) does—and if he does, he\nwill thereby accept P3. \nEven the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true\nuniversal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my\nright hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some\ncontroversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein’s view\nthat universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3\ninvolves accepting that there is something like the fact that every\nfinger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its\nexistence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in\nquestion. Following Wittgenstein (TLP), many reject such\nuniversal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (PLA)\nand Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which\nhave indeed a universal component.). \nThere is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous\ndifficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic\npropositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex\npropositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular\ncontent of these propositions. This is the view put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP: the atomic facts make true the true atomic\npropositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean\ncombination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what\nhappens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive,\nsince they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they\nprove especially difficult to develop, especially when special\npropositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving\nmodal concepts. \nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n singular propositions\n and\n structured propositions.) \nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction—and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as parts. \nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\nsubstantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation \\(R\\) (in that order) by ‘[\\(R\\); \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\)]’. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n‘Socrates is mortal’ corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls ‘objectualism’ (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP\n(‘perhaps’, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him). \nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations. \nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts: \nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.) \nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one’s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world. \nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation. \nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation \\(x\\). Then as we saw,\nit would be odd to claim that \\(x\\) is not a complex fact, having\nSocrates as a component. Suppose \\(x\\) has such a complexity. Now take\ntwo worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\), such that in \\(w\\) Socrates exists but is\nnot a philosopher, and in \\(v\\), Socrates does not exist (and so is\nnot a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that\nSocrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of\nview (a), \\(x\\) exists in \\(w\\) but not in \\(v\\). The outcome is\nrather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of\nconjunction. \nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on. \nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal\nCriterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.","contact.mail":"kevin.mulligan@unige.ch","contact.domain":"unige.ch"},{"date.published":"2007-09-21","date.changed":"2020-10-16","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/","author1":"Kevin Mulligan","author1.info":"https://fabricecorreia.com/","entry":"facts","body.text":"\n\n\nFacts, philosophers like to say, are opposed to theories and to values\n(cf. Rundle 1993) and are to be distinguished from things, in\nparticular from complex objects, complexes and wholes, and from\nrelations. They are the objects of certain mental states and acts,\nthey make truth-bearers true and correspond to truths, they are part\nof the furniture of the world. Not only do philosophers oppose facts\nto theories and to values, they sometimes distinguish between facts\nwhich are brute and those which are not (Anscombe 1958). We present\nand discuss some philosophical and formal accounts of facts.\n\nThe word “fact” is used in at least two different ways. In\nthe locution “matters of fact”, facts are taken to be what\nis contingently the case, or that of which we may have empirical or\na posteriori knowledge. Thus Hume famously writes at the\nbeginning of Section IV of An Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding: “All the objects of human reason or inquiry\nmay naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas\nand Matters of Fact”. The word is also used in locutions such\nas \nIn this second use, the functor (operator, connective) “It is a\nfact that” takes a sentence to make a sentence (an alternative\nview has it that “It is a fact” takes a nominalised\nsentence, a that-clause, to make a sentence), and the predicate\n“is a fact” is either elliptic for the functor, or takes a\nnominalised sentence to make a sentence. It is locutions of this\nsecond sort that philosophers have often employed in order to claim\n(or deny) that facts are part of the inventory of what there is, and\nplay an important role in semantics, ontology, metaphysics,\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind. \nWe may, then, distinguish between Humean facts and functorial facts.\nWith the help of this distinction, two philosophical options can be\nformulated. One may think that there are facts in the functorial sense\nof the word which are contingent—the fact that Sam is\nsad—and facts in the functorial sense which are not\ncontingent—the fact that \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). Or one may think that\nall facts in the functorial sense are contingent, are Humean matters\nof fact. The latter option is expounded in the influential philosophy\nof facts to be found in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\n(1921). Wittgenstein there announces that the world is the totality of\nfacts and that every fact is contingent (Wittgenstein TLP:\n1.1). \nThe word “fact”, particularly when it is understood in the\nfunctorial sense, belongs to a family of related terms:\n“circumstance”, “situation\n(Sachlage)”, “state of affairs\n(Sachverhalt)”. We refer happily to the state of\naffairs or circumstance that Sam is sad and to the situation in which\nSam is sad, although “It is a circumstance/situation that Sam is\nsad”, unlike “It is a fact/the case that Sam is\nsad”, is ill-formed. \nIn what follows, we distinguish three types of account of what it is\nto be a fact in the functorial sense and consider some possible roles\nfor facts which have been thought to yield arguments in favor of\nadmitting facts into our inventory of what there is. Since the\ncategory of facts is a formal category, a semantic or ontological\ncategory, we then look in some detail at different formal theories of\nfacts and their ilk. \nWhat might a fact be? Three popular views about the nature of facts\ncan be distinguished: \nIn order to understand these claims and the relations between them it\nis necessary to appeal to some accounts of truth, truth-bearers,\nstates of affairs, obtaining, objects, properties, relations and\nexemplification. Propositions are a popular candidate for the role of\nwhat is true or false. One view of propositions has it that these are\ncomposed exclusively of concepts, individual concepts (for example,\nthe concept associated with the proper name “Sam”),\ngeneral concepts (the concept expressed by the predicates “is\nsad” and “est triste”) and formal concepts\n(for example, the concept expressed by “or”). Concepts so\nunderstood are things we can understand. Properties and relations, we\nmay then say, are not concepts, for they are not the sort of thing we\nunderstand. Properties are exemplified by objects and objects fall\nunder concepts. Similarly, objects stand in relations but fall under\nrelational concepts. \nIt will be convenient to understand the view that a fact is just a\nsui generis type of entity in which objects exemplify\nproperties or stand in relations as relying on the way of\nunderstanding properties and relations just sketched. We shall refer\nto the view as the claim that facts are exemplifications. Similarly,\nwe may understand the claim that a fact is an obtaining state of\naffairs to say that a state of affairs is something which contains one\nor more objects and at least one property or relation and that a state\nof affairs obtains if an object exemplifies a property or one or more\nobjects stand in a relation. “Obtains” (German:\n“besteht”) belongs to the same family of\npredicates as “is true”. Just as it is often argued that\nthe truth-predicate is tenseless and timeless, so it is sometimes\nargued or assumed that “obtains” is tenseless and\ntimeless. A distinct question: Is “obtain” not simply a\nfancy way of saying “exists”? (Sundholm 1994). No, it is\nsometimes claimed. Obtaining is a mode of being. If a state of affairs\nobtains, then an obtaining state of affairs exists, a fact exists. In\nthis respect, “obtains” resembles “endures”.\nThings endure. If a thing endures, then the enduring thing exists. \nBut it should be noted that some philosophers use\n“proposition” or “structured proposition”\n(Soames 2010) to refer to what are here called “states of\naffairs” and that some philosophers do not distinguish between\nproperties and concepts. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that\nin ordinary English the expression “state of affairs” is\nnot normally used to refer to something which obtains or fails to\nobtain. It is used to refer to what is the case. Philosophers who talk\nof “states of affairs” as obtaining or failing to obtain\nare employing the term as a technical term, often as a translation of\nthe German word “Sachverhalt”. Finally, states of\naffairs, unlike facts, are commonly said to last or endure, whereas\n“Sachverhalte” do not last or endure. \nThe two views of facts as exemplifications of properties and as\nobtaining states of affairs raise many metaphysical and ontological\nquestions and are often appealed to in giving answers to metaphysical\nand ontological questions. They are also often appealed to in answers\nto questions about semantics and intentionality. Finally, facts are\nsometimes invoked in an area where semantics and ontology connect, the\ntheory of truthmaking. Throughout the twentieth century the categories\nof fact and state of affairs have also been been the object of\nscepticism (see Betti 2015). \nThe metaphysical and ontological questions which are raised by the two\nviews of facts mentioned include the following: Are the properties and\nrelations which go to make up facts abstract (repeatable) universals\nor bearer-specific (non-repeatable) properties and relations (tropes)?\nIf they are abstract universals, are these such that they are always\nexemplified, as friends of “Aristotelian” universals\nclaim, or not, as friends of “Platonic” universals claim?\nAnd are they qualitative only (the property of being round) or also\nsubstantial (the property of being a man)? Are there facts containing\nabstract objects and properties, for example the fact that 2 is a\nnumber? Is a fact which contains a concrete object, for example the\nfact that Sam is sad, itself concrete or abstract? Are there facts\nwhich are formally complex, for example negative or conditional facts?\nWhat is the relation between facts, on the one hand, and concrete\nevents, processes and states, on the other hand? Do objects stand in\nrelations because the objects and the relations they stand in\nare parts of facts? What are the identity conditions for facts? Are\nthere states of affairs which do not obtain? May such states of\naffairs contain non-existent objects? Are states of affairs abstract\nentities which exist necessarily? Do facts understood as\nexemplifications of properties come in two kinds—the\ncontingently existing ones and the non-contingently existing ones?\n(For discussions of all these questions see the entry on\n states of affairs.)\n If concrete events, processes and states are identical with facts or\ncan be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to think that\ncausality is a relation between facts. If they are not identical with\nfacts and cannot be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to\nthink that causality is a relation between events and states and that\ncausality should not be identified with causal explanations. For\ndiscussions of the view that one or both of the relata of the causal\nrelation are facts, see Vendler 1967a,b; Menzies 1989; Mellor 1995;\nPersson 1997; and also the entry on\n the metaphysics of causation. \nThe assumption that facts contain objects, properties and\nrelations as proper parts may be criticised (Lowe 1998; Vallicella\n2000; Künne 2003). One natural mereological principle is that the\nproper parts of the most basic kinds of whole belong to the same\ngeneral ontological category to which their wholes belong. Thus parts\nof things or substances are things or substances and parts of\nprocesses are processes. The view that the fact that Sam is sad\ncontains a substance and a property offends against this principle:\nsubstances and properties belong to different kinds and neither\nsubstances nor properties, it seems, are facts. Perhaps the natural\nmereological principle should be rejected in favor of the view that\nentities of any kind may come together to form a whole. But friends of\nfacts tend to think of facts as forming a very natural kind of whole.\nAnother possible view is that Sam is a fact rather than part of a fact\n(Armstrong 1997; Johansson 2004: 34; Récanati 2000; Bergmann\n1967). \nEven if facts or states of affairs do not contain objects\nsuch as substances or events, some may still be about, or\nconcern, such objects. This notion of aboutness has recently\nbeen assigned heavy metaphysical duties. Thus, Shamik Dasgupta (2014,\n2017) defines qualitative facts as facts which are not about\nany particular individuals, and argues that all the basic facts that\nconstitute the universe are qualitative, the individualistic (i.e.,\nnon-qualitative) facts being grounded in that qualitative basis (see\nbelow on grounding as a relation between facts). And Dan Marshall\nexploits the notion of factual aboutness for the purpose of theorizing\nabout intrinsicality. In his 2016a, he argues that a number\nof different notions of intrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the\nnotion of a state of affairs being intrinsically about\nsomething, and in his 2016b he defends a particular account of that\nsort. \nOne ontological role for states of affairs and facts is to be the\nprimary bearers of modality. Suppose that facts are obtaining states\nof affairs. Then we may distinguish the obtaining state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad from the obtaining states of affairs that Sam is\npossibly sad, that Sam is probably sad, and that Sam ought to be sad.\nHere the modal properties qualify the property of being sad and so\nqualify Sam. They are de re modalities. And, so the view\ngoes, the place of such modal properties is in states of affairs. (A\nstate of affairs is, as the German terms\n“Sachverhalt”,\n“Sachverhältnis” suggest, a relation between\nthings, the way things stand with respect to one another,\n“wie die Sachen sich zueinander verhalten”.) A\nfurther claim is that some de dicto modalities properly\nqualify states of affairs: the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nprobably obtains/possibly obtains/ought to obtain. Suppose that a fact\nis just the exemplification of properties. Then we may distinguish the\nfact that Sam is a man and the fact that Sam is necessarily a man. But\na friend of facts like the last one then has to accept that not all\nfacts are formally simple. \nAnother possible ontological role for states of affairs and facts is\nto provide the terms for the tie of grounding or explanation. The fact\nthat there is an explosion explains the fact that Sam’s head\nturns (causal explanation). The fact that Mary slapped Sam is\nexplained by the fact that Sam is a sexist (explanation of action by\nreference to an “objective” reason; Dancy 2000). The fact\nthat Sam admires Mary is explained by the fact that she is charming\n(explanation of feeling by reference to an “objective”\nreason). The fact that there is a one-one correlation between the\n\\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s is explained by the fact that the number of\n\\(F\\)s = the number of \\(G\\)s (non-causal, conceptual or essential\nexplanation). Sceptics about such claims ask what “the fact that\n\\(p\\) explains the fact that \\(q\\)” adds to “\\(q\\) because\n\\(p\\)”. (See Correia & Schnieder 2012, Mulligan 2007,\nTrogdon 2013, and the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.) \nAppeal to facts has also been made in order to give a semantics for\ncounterfactuals (Kratzer 2002). A premise semantics for\ncounterfactual, Kratzer argues, relies on facts: \nin a premise semantics, a “would”-counterfactual is true\nin a world \\(w\\) iff every way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the\nantecedent as consistency allows reaches a point where the resulting\nset logically implies the consequent. On the other hand, a\n“might”-counterfactual is true in a world \\(w\\) iff not\nevery way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the antecedent as\nconsistency allows reaches a point where adding the consequent would\nresult in an inconsistent set. \nThose facts, she argues, have to be propositions, but they must be\nhighly specific, almost as specific as facts conceived of as\nparticulars (see\n section 1.3\n below). \nFinally, certain metaphysical disputes of the realism/anti-realism\ntype are sometimes characterized in terms of facts: in such a dispute,\nthe realist is said to countenance facts of a certain kind, whereas\nthe anti-realist is said to reject facts of that kind. The\ndisagreement between realists about tense (or A-theorists) and\nanti-realists about tense (or B-theorists), for instance, is sometimes\ntaken to boil down to a disagreement about the question whether there\nare tensed facts: the former answer ‘Yes’ while the latter\nsay ‘No’. (See, e.g., Mellor 1998, Fine 2005 and Correia\n& Rosenkranz 2011.) \nOne difficulty faced by such characterizations is that of making clear\nwhat the relevant facts are supposed to be. The difficulty is\nparticularly acute in certain debates, for instance in the debate over\ntense realism. For what is it for a fact to be tensed? It cannot\nsimply be said that a tensed fact is a fact that can be referred to by\nmeans of a tensed description of type “the fact that\n\\(p\\)”, where “\\(p\\)” is a tensed sentence. For it\nis open to a B-theorist to hold that such expressions do refer to\n(tenseless) facts—e.g., that “the fact that Sam is\nlying” refers, at any time \\(t\\), to a fact which can also be\nreferred to (at any time) using the description “the fact that\nSam is lying at \\(t\\)”. Another suggestion is that a fact is\ntensed if and only if it is transient, i.e., sometimes obtains and\nsometimes fails to obtain. Yet, it may be replied, even if the\nproposed characterization does capture some tensed facts, it leaves\naside a number of other such facts, e.g., those which can be referred\nto by “the fact that Sam is currently sitting or not currently\nsitting” and (barring certain forms of indeterminism) “the\nfact that if Sam is currently sitting, then it was the case yesterday\nthat Sam would be sitting one day hence”, respectively. \n“Know” in instances of the locution “\\(x\\) knows\nthat \\(p\\)” is factive: if \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\).\nSimilarly, “know” in instances of the locution\n“\\(x\\) knows \\(y\\)” is veridical: if \\(x\\) knows \\(y\\), is\nacquainted with \\(y\\), then there is a \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) knows\n\\(y\\). \nIs knowledge that \\(p\\) knowledge of facts? Is coming to know (cf.\n“Erkennen”) that \\(p\\) a form of contact with\nfacts, where facts are understood as something other than true\ntruth-bearers? Husserl, Russell, Vendler and Hossack (Husserl\n1900–1901; Russell 1906–1907; Vendler 1967a, 1972; Hossack\n2007) reply affirmatively to one of these questions; thus Russell at\none point argues that a perception has a single object, such as\n“knife-to-left-of-book”, an entity he first called a\n“complex” and then “a fact” (Russell\nONTF). From Ramsey to Williamson (Ramsey 1927 [1931]; Vickers\n2004; Williamson 2000) many philosophers have replied negatively. \nWhat may be said in favor of the view? Consider the atomic predication\nFa, where this is a formula that a logician would use to\nrepresent the claim that object a has property F.\nComing to know that Fa, in the simplest cases, involves\nacquaintance with objects and properties. Coming to know that the wall\nis red by seeing that it is red often involves seeing the wall. The\nwall is not any sort of concept. According to a popular theory in\nperceptual psychology, seeing that the wall is red or straight\ntypically involves perception of a constant property, the redness or\nstraightness of the wall, and perception of it as constant\n(“property constancy”, “color constancy”,\n“shape constancy”). These properties are not concepts.\nThere is thus some reason for thinking that perceptually coming to\nknow that \\(p\\), in the simplest cases, involves epistemic contact\nwith objects and with properties. If that is right, then two\ncomponents of the view that to come to know that \\(p\\) in such cases\nis to come to have knowledge of facts are plausible. But even if\nperceptual knowledge of facts is allowed, it is not clear why one\nshould think that instances of “knowledge that \\(p\\)” or\nof “coming to know that \\(p\\)” in which the substitutions\nfor “\\(p\\)” are logically complex, constitute knowledge of\nrobust facts. Similarly, if we consider the many and various types of\ncoming to know that \\(p\\) in which the source of knowledge is not\nsensory perception but, for example, testimony or inference, we may\nthink that in such cases there is no reason to think that what we come\nto know are facts. \nKratzer’s (2002) account of knowledge of facts is applied to\nGettier problems (Gettier 1963, see the entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n She puts forward a view according to which facts are particulars\nwhich exemplify propositions (cf. Baylis 1948)—just as other\nparticulars such as tables and persons exemplify properties. (She\nmodels these facts and propositions within Situation Semantics, as\nsituations of a certain sort and sets of situations, respectively, but\nwe need not go into the details here. Note that, as we saw in\n section 1.2\n above, she also countenances facts which are propositions.)\nShe then proposes the following analysis of knowledge: \n\\(S\\) knows \\(p\\) if and only if \nIt is condition (ii), Kratzer argues, which deals with Gettier cases.\nTake the second type of case discussed by Gettier. Smith is justified\nin believing the false proposition that Jones owns a Ford. Therefore\nhe is justified in believing the proposition that Jones owns a Ford or\nBrown is in Barcelona. Now Brown happens to be in Barcelona, but Smith\nhas no idea about where Brown is—in particular, he is not\njustified in believing that Brown is in Barcelona. Intuitively, Smith\ndoes not know the disjunctive proposition he is justified in\nbelieving. But that proposition is true, and so the standard analysis\nof knowledge fails. The analysis in terms of beliefs de re of\nfacts fares better, Kratzer argues. For, she claims, the fact\nexemplified by the disjunctive proposition is the fact that Brown is\nin Barcelona, and Smith’s belief is not a de re belief\nabout that fact. \nWe have mentioned the view that facts may explain actions and mental\nstates and the view that facts are what we know. Facts are also\ninvoked in the philosophy of mind by philosophers who claim that\njudgments or beliefs enjoy the property of intentionality, of\nbeing “directed towards” something, because they\nrepresent states of affairs or are psychological relations to\nstates of affairs and that judgments and beliefs are correct or\nsatisfied only if states of affairs obtain, that is, if facts exist.\nVersions of these claims are given by many philosophers from Meinong,\nthe early Husserl and Russell to Searle (Searle 1983). Analogous\nclaims in semantics are sometimes made about propositions or other\ntruth-bearers: the proposition that Sam is sad represents the state of\naffairs that Sam is sad and is true only if this state of affairs\nobtains. Versions of this view are given by Husserl, Wittgenstein and\nCarnap. See the\n supplementary document on the History of Philosophies of Facts. \nOne objection to the view that the judgment that Sam is sad represents\na state of affairs is that although the judger arguably thinks of Sam\nand of his sadness, he may not possess any concept of a state of\naffairs. (Consider the analogous claim that one may judge that \\(p\\)\nwithout employing the concept of truth). Perhaps then a judgment\nrepresents a state of affairs but does not represent it as a\nstate of affairs. One objection to this claim is that it commits one\nto the ontological view that there are states of affairs which do not\nobtain, the states of affairs represented by false judgments or\nbeliefs. \nIf we reject the view that judgments and beliefs represent states of\naffairs, it is still possible to claim that judgments and beliefs have\ncorrectness conditions which mention states of affairs: if \\(x\\)\njudges correctly that \\(p\\), then the state of affairs that \\(p\\)\nobtains. And if this is plausible, so too is the further claim that if\n\\(x\\) judges correctly that \\(p\\), then \\(x\\) judges correctly that\n\\(p\\) because the state of affairs that \\(p\\) obtains. Facts make\njudgments correct. \nDoes the proposition that Sam is sad represent the state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad? It may be objected that the proposition does not\nrefer to anything as a state of affairs. And once again the friend of\nstates of affairs may retreat to the safer claims that the proposition\nthat Sam is sad is true only if the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nobtains and that if the proposition that Sam is sad is true, it is\ntrue because the state of affairs obtains. Facts make propositions\ntrue. \nFacts, then, are perhaps qualified to play the role of what makes\njudgments correct and propositions true. But the theory of correctness\nand of truth does not require us to accept that there are facts.\nIndeed it may be thought that the requirements of such a theory are\nsatisfied by the observations that a judgment that \\(p\\) is correct\nonly if \\(p\\), and that the proposition that \\(p\\) is true only if\n\\(p\\). If arguments in metaphysics or epistemology persuade us that\nthere are facts, then we may perhaps appeal to facts in giving\naccounts of correctness and of truth. In the case of the theory of\ncorrectness conditions for judgment and belief the argument that\nknowledge is of facts together with the view that, contrary to a long\nand influential tradition, the theory of belief and of judgment\npresupposes a theory of knowledge (Williamson 2000) may persuade us\nthat facts make judgments and beliefs correct. \nThe view that facts make propositions or other truth-bearers true is\none theory among many of truthmaking. The theory of truthmaking deals\nwith questions at the intersection between ontology, metaphysics and\nsemantics. The view that facts are what make truth-bearers true is the\noldest theory of truthmaking. One central choice within truthmaker\ntheory is between acceptance and rejection of truthmaker maximalism.\nTruthmaker maximalism is the view that every truth has a truthmaker.\n(It is an analogue of claims about modalities other than the modality\nof truth such as that every necessity is made necessary, that every\nprobability has a probabiliser, that if something has a value there is\nsomething which makes it valuable, a “valifier” etc.)\nFactualist truthmaker maximalism says that every truth is made true by\na fact. Factualist truthmaker maximalism comes in many shapes and\nsizes. It is sometimes combined with the view that propositions\nrepresent states of affairs. It is sometimes defended by friends of\nthe view that facts are obtaining states of affairs (Pfänder\n1921), sometimes by friends of the view that facts are neither true\npropositions nor obtaining states of affairs but exemplifications of\nproperties (Armstrong 2004). \nBy far the most popular objection to factualist truthmaker maximalism,\nan objection made by both friends and enemies of facts, is that it is\nontologically baroque, that is to say, incredible. The idea that there\nare negative or conditional facts, the objection goes, is incompatible\nwith the demands of metaphysical economy or with the requirements of\nnaturalism. By far the most popular factualist alternative to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism is the view that all logically atomic\ntruths have truthmakers and that these are formally simple or atomic\nfacts or the view that the only truthmakers which are facts are\nformally simple. Versions of these views are defended by the logical\natomists (see the entry on the\n correspondence theory of truth\n and\n section 2.4.2\n below). \nAppeals to facts as truthmakers presuppose that there are different\nfacts. But it has been argued that if there are any facts, there is\nonly one Great Fact. See the\n supplementary document on the Slingshot Argument. \nIf this argument is sound, then theories of facts as truthmakers and\nas what correspond to truths as well as many other theories which rely\non facts, are trivialised. \nIn the debate between friends and enemies of factualist truthmaker\nmaximalism it is often assumed that truthmakers must be ontologically\nor metaphysically fundamental. Indeed it is sometimes argued that the\ntheory of truthmaking is a guide to what there is and it is assumed\nthat what there is is just what is ontologically fundamental. The\nassumption may be rejected (see the entry on\n truthmakers).\n Perhaps there are facts but facts are not ontologically fundamental.\n(Compare the claim that there are social entities but that these are\nnot ontologically fundamental.) Then even atomic facts would not be\nontologically fundamental. Perhaps Sam and his concrete state of\nsadness are ontologically fundamental and the fact that Sam is sad is\nnot ontologically fundamental. \nWhat might it mean to say that there are facts but they are not\nontologically fundamental? Perhaps that facts or the unity of facts\nare determined by non-facts (Vallicella 2000, Mulligan 2006b).\nPossible candidates for this role are truth-bearers, for example\npropositions, together with what is ontologically fundamental. If\nfacts are not ontologically fundamental, then one objection to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism misses its mark. According to yet\nanother view, facts are complexes made up of objects and properties\nand those complexes which are facts are less basic than their parts\n(Fine 1982). \nAny philosophy of facts owes us an account of the form of such\nexpressions as “the fact that Sam is sad” (Lowe 1998) and\n“the state of affairs that Sam is sad”. (Analogous\nquestions arise concerning the form of “the proposition that Sam\nis sad”, “the property of sadness”, “the\nconcept of sadness” etc.) Friends of facts who have written at\ngreat length about facts and given the distinct impression that they\nare referring to facts and predicating properties of facts have\nnevertheless claimed that facts or situations cannot be named\n(Russell, Wittgenstein; cf. Clarke 1975) or that they have no\nproperties (Ingarden 1965). The expression “the fact that Sam is\nsad” looks like a definite description. What is the form of such\na description? One possibility (Künne 2003: 10) is that it should\nbe read as: the unique \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is a fact and \\(x =\\)\nthat Sam is sad. \nOne objection to this suggestion is that clauses such as “that\nSam is sad” cannot flank the identity sign. The following\nidentity sentence, on the other hand, is perfectly well-formed and,\nmany friends of facts claim, false: \nThe fact that Sam is sad = the proposition that Sam is sad \nThis suggests that clauses such as “that Sam is sad” can\nonly flank the identity sign if they are governed by expressions such\nas “the fact”, “the proposition”, “the\nbelief”. The suggested analysis of our definite descriptions may\nbe motivated by the assumption that “the fact that Sam is\nsad” is derived by nominalising “It is a fact that Sam is\nsad” and the assumption that in the latter sentence “It is\na fact” takes “that Sam is sad” to make a\nsentence. \nAnother account of expressions such as “the fact that\nFa” builds on suggestions made by Russell in 1913\n(Hochberg 2001). Let ‘\\(\\mathbf{T}\\)’,\n‘\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)’ and ‘\\(\\mathbf{IN}\\)’ express\nthe relations ‘is a term in’, ‘is an attribute\nin’ and ‘informs’, respectively. These relations are\nthe formal ontological relations between atomic facts, on the one\nhand, and their terms (objects), attributes (properties) and forms, on\nthe other hand. Then the structure of “the fact that Fa\nexists” is: \nThat is, the fact that contains \\(a\\) as a term and \\(F\\) as an\nattribute and that is of the form \\(\\phi x\\) exists. It has also been\nargued that what underlies talk about an object exemplifying a\nproperty is just the relations of being a term in a fact and being an\nattribute in a fact (Sprigge 1970). \nHow do expressions such as “the state of affairs that Sam is\nsad” relate to their referents? One view is that they are rigid\ndesignators. (For discussion of this question in connection with\nrelated cases such as instances of “the property of being\n\\(F\\)” and “the proposition that \\(p\\)”, see\nSchnieder 2005, Yagiwasa 1997, Tye 1981). \nAccording to a common definition, a brute fact is a fact that is\nunexplained, i.e. a fact of which there is no explanation. (On the\nquestion of how to characterise brute facts and a number of other\nissues discussed below, see Vintiadis and Mekios 2018, a volume\ndedicated to the topic of brute facts.) \n“Explain”, like many other verbs of interest to\nphilosophers (“mean”, “refer”\n“name”) can be used personally and impersonally (typically\na three-place vs a binary relation). The contrast is for instance\nbetween \nand \nPersonal explanations are not truth-bearers but are correct or\nincorrect and successful or unsuccessful. Impersonal explanations are\ntrue or false but not correct or incorrect, successful or\nunsuccessful. What is the relation between personal and impersonal\nexplanations? Plausibly, one connection between the two is this: if a\npersonal explanation is successful, then the person on the receiving\nend of the explanation must grasp some true impersonal explanation\nthanks to the explanation. Personal explanation is arguably irrelevant\nto the notion of bruteness, and accordingly from now on we will focus\non impersonal explanation. \nIt is common to distinguish between epistemic and\nmetaphysical (or ontic, or ontological) explanations (see\ne.g. Barnes 1984 and Salmon 1984). The distinction can be precisely\nformulated in many different ways, but the contrast can be illustrated\nin a simple way by means of an example taken from Bolzano 1837\n(§162). The following two statements are (let us suppose)\ntrue: \nWhereas the first one gives a metaphysical (in this case, a causal)\nexplanation of a fact, the second one gives an epistemic explanation\n(in this case, a reason to believe that a state of affairs obtains).\n(We find it very plausible to think that every epistemic explanation\nis a personal explanation, but since this seems to be far from being a\nmajority view, we will not assume it to be correct.) \nGiven that there is this distinction between explanations, one can\ncorrespondingly distinguish between two types of brute facts, the\nepistemically brute facts and the metaphysically\nbrute facts. Since epistemic explanations and metaphysical\nexplanations themselves come in various types, one can actually make\nmore fine-grained distinctions. Thus, for instance, if\ndeductive-nomological explanations count as epistemic explanations,\none can introduce the notion of a “deductive-nomologically brute\nfact”, i.e. of a fact that has no deductive-nomological\nexplanation. And given that grounding explanations (explanations given\nby pointing to a ground) count as metaphysical explanations, one can\nintroduce the notion of a “ground-theoretically brute\nfact”, i.e. of a fact that has no grounding explanation. \nA further distinction adds to the multiplicity of notions of\nbruteness. This is the distinction between explanations and relations\nthat “back” explanations. The relation of causation, it is\noften claimed, backs causal explanation: what makes it true that a\ngiven fact causally explains another fact is that the former causes\nthe latter or that some event causes another event. Likewise, some\nphilosophers distinguish between the relation of grounding and\ngrounding explanations (see §4 of the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Corresponding to these various relations are various notions of\nbeing brute, which must be distinguished from the notions\nintroduced above: being brute qua uncaused, being brute\nqua ungrounded, etc. These notions deserve to be put under the\nlabel “metaphysical bruteness”, just like the notions\ndefined in terms of explanation that we did put under this label\nabove. \nThus, there are very many notions of bruteness one may want to\ndistinguish. In what follows we will largely (but not completely)\nignore this variety, and we will focus mainly on metaphysical\nbruteness. \nThe fact that there is a world and the fact that throughout its\nhistory the universe will have contained exactly N electrons\nare perhaps good examples of facts that are metaphysically brute, in\nseveral senses of “metaphysically brute”. The same is\nperhaps true of basic laws of physics (understood as facts). \nIn reply to van Inwagen’s (1990) Special Composition Question,\nMarkosian (1998) defends the “brutality of compositional\nfacts”, the view that whenever there is an object composed of\nsome given objects, then it is an ungrounded fact that there is an\nobject composed of these objects. \nDasgupta (2016) holds that essentialist facts, such as the fact that\nSocrates is essentially human, are “not apt for being\ngrounded”, and hence are brute in the sense of ungrounded.\nGlazier (2017) argues against Dasgupta’s view, but holds that\nessentialist facts are brute in another sense. He advocates the view\nthat metaphysical explanations of a certain kind, essentialist\nexplanations of the type “p because it is essential to\nx that p”, are true when the explanans is\ntrue. On his view, essentialist facts cannot themselves receive such\nessentialist explanations, and hence are metaphysically brute in this\nspecific sense. \n“Emergent” facts (see the entry on emergent properties)\nprovide a further interesting illustration. On some views, they are\nbrute in the sense of ungrounded, but they are nevertheless\nnomologically necessitated by what they emerge from, and hence have an\nexplanation (see Baysan 2019). \nAre modal facts brute? This question has been at the centre of\nmetaphysical inquiry for a large part of the 20th century\nand is still widely debated. Which notion of bruteness is at stake in\nthe debate is however (very) often unclear. The key question here is\nwhether modal facts have their “source” in other kinds of\nfacts.  This can be understood in various ways, some\nmetaphysical, some not. Thus, friends of the view that necessity has\nits source in essence may be understood as endorsing any of the\nfollowing claims: \nOn each view, the fact that a given proposition is necessary is never\nbrute. While on the first view, it may be epistemic bruteness that is\ninvolved, on the other view it is metaphysical bruteness, in two\ndifferent forms. \nThe concept of a brute fact is closely related to the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see the entry on the\n principle of sufficient reason).\n The PSR comes in various versions. For each sense of\n“brute”, the claim that there are no brute facts is\n(logically equivalent to) a version of the PSR. Thus if we appeal to\nthe distinction between epistemically brute and metaphysically brute\nfacts, then some of these versions are epistemic (e.g. “Every\nfact has a deductive-nomological explanation”) and others\nmetaphysical (e.g. “Every fact is grounded”). \nVan Inwagen (1983) and Bennett (1984) once put forward a famous\nargument to the effect that the PSR entails that every truth is\nnecessary. Since some truths are contingent, the argument is in effect\nan objection against the PSR, and hence potentially in favour of brute\nfacts. The force of the argument strongly depends on which version of\nthe PSR is taken to be involved. The argument, in one version or\nanother, has stimulated much philosophical reflection since then (see\ne.g. Hudson 1997 and the reply in Feit 1998, Dasgupta 2016, and\nMcDaniel 2019 and the reply in Werner 2020). \nFollowing current discussions on grounding, let us define\nmetaphysical foundationalism as the view according to which\nevery fact is either ungrounded or grounded in ungrounded facts (see\nDixon 2016 and Rabin & Rabern 2016 for discussions on the view and\nits relations to other views in the vicinity). Metaphysical\nfoundationalism entails that there are ungrounded facts. The converse\nentailment, of course, fails. \nLet us say, following common usage, that a fact partially\ngrounds another fact if the former fully grounds, or only helps\nto ground, the latter. Granted that partial grounding is a strict\npartial order (i.e. a transitive and irreflexive relation), the\nnegation of metaphysical foundationalism entails the existence of\ninfinitely descending chains of partial grounds (a series \\(F_1\\),\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_3\\), … where \\(F_1\\) is partially grounded in\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_2\\) in \\(F_3\\), …). The converse entailment, of\ncourse, also fails: foundationalism is compatible with the existence\nof such chains. \nSwapping grounding for other explanation-backing relations, or for\nrelations of explaining, yields other forms of foundationalism, and\nthe previous considerations apply mutatis mutandis to these\nviews. \n“Brute” is often taken to be interchangeable with\n“fundamental” (see McKenzie 2017 for a representative list\nof references). Is this objectionable? Just like “brute”,\n“fundamental” can be understood in many ways (see the\nentry on\n fundamentality\n for the various notions currently discussed in metaphysics), and\nwhether “brute” and “fundamental” mean the\nsame or otherwise have the same extension depends, trivially, on how\nthese terms are understood. As we saw, “brute” can be\nunderstood as meaning the same as “ungrounded”. In some\ncontexts, many philosophers use “fundamental” as\nsynonymous with “ungrounded” in a way that is not at all\nobjectionable (see e.g. Bennett 2011, Rosen 2010 and Schaffer 2009).\nUsing “brute” and “fundamental” as\ninterchangeable can thus be perfectly legitimate, albeit in\nuninteresting ways. \nThe question of interchangeability becomes interesting when\n“brute” and “fundamental” are used with\ndifferent meanings. Thus, for instance, the question of whether a\nfundamental qua ungrounded fact can fail to be brute qua\nlacking a metaphysical explanation is interesting\n(McKenzie’s (2017) aim is to argue for a positive answer to this\nquestion). However, in this case, as presumably in all the other\npossible cases of interest, the use of the labels “brute”\nand “fundamental” is immaterial because the question can\nbe rephrased using only their respective definientia (the\nprevious question, for instance, can be rephrased as the question\nwhether an ungrounded fact can be metaphysically explained). \nFormal studies of facts are scarce. And they are also heterogeneous,\nboth in form and in content. In form insofar as they are formulated in\nlanguages of various kinds, which vary greatly in expressive power.\nAnd in content, not only because of the variety of views on given\nissues, but also because the kind of issues dealt with varies greatly.\nThis makes it difficult to present these theories within a uniform\nframework. We are going to choose a specific framework, present,\nwithin that framework, (some of) the options a fact-theorist may wish\nto adopt, study their relationships, and give references in due course\nto indicate where in the resulting space of possible theories various\naccounts, formal and non-formal, are to be located. Our framework is\nsignificantly distinct from many of those which are used in the\nliterature. So it should be kept in mind that in attributing this or\nthat view to an author, what we will say is often not to be understood\nliterally: when it is not, what we really attribute to the\nauthor is something which, translated into our framework, is what we\nliterally attribute to her. \nThere are two main uses of the predicate ‘is a fact’. On\none of them, the predicate is rigid (necessarily, if something is a\nfact, then it cannot fail to be a fact). On that use, and given the\nassumption that there are contingent facts, it is possible that\nsomething be a fact without existing (obtaining). On the second use,\nnothing can be a fact unless it exists, and so on the assumption that\nthere are contingent facts, the predicate is non-rigid. Some call\nfacts in the first sense states of affairs or\nsituations, reserving the word ‘fact’ to mean\nwhat ‘obtaining state of affairs’ or ‘actual\nsituation’ mean. Throughout this section we shall use\n‘fact’ in the first sense. \nThe issues we are going to deal with fall under the following five\nheadings: Facts and Worlds, Boolean Operations on Facts, Independency,\nFacts and Propositions, The Inner Structure of Facts. The presentation\nwill be cumulative in character: in each section we will come back to\ntopics dealt with in previous ones (if any), sometimes in order to\ncompare the current options available to a fact-theorist to the old\nones. \nMany metaphysicians are interested in the modal sphere. They do not\nonly want to determine which entities there actually are and\ntheir actual properties. They wish to formulate claims with\nmodal content, they want to determine which entities there\ncan or must be, and which are their properties\nacross all (metaphysically) possible worlds. \nIn this section we deal with some basic modal issues related to facts.\nMore precisely, we shall present and compare certain principles\ninvolving facts and (possible) worlds. Although at some places we\nshall mention the view that worlds are themselves facts, or sets or\npluralities or sums of facts, we shall remain neutral as to the nature\nof worlds. \nLet \\(W\\) be the set of all possible worlds, \\(F\\) the function which\nassigns to each world \\(w\\) the set \\(F_w\\) of facts which exist in\nit, and \\(F\\) the union of all the \\(F_w s\\), i.e., the set of all\nfacts. We assume that \\(W\\) has infinitely many members. This is a\nreasonable assumption, which will have some importance in what follows\nwith respect to certain entailment claims we are going to make (not\nhaving the assumption would force us to distinguish cases). Since we\nare dealing with theories of facts, we shall also assume that \\(F\\) is\nnon-empty. Although perhaps there are impossible states of affairs or\nsituations, we take it that there are no impossible facts. That is why\nthere is no room for them in our framework. \nWhere \\(x\\) is a fact, \\(\\ES(x)\\) (the existence-set of\n\\(x\\)) is the set of all worlds at which \\(x\\) exists. And where \\(G\\)\nis a set of facts, \\(\\CES(G)\\) (the conjunctive-existence-set\nof \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cap_{x\\in G} \\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at\nwhich all elements of \\(G\\) exist, and \\(\\DES(G)\\) (the\ndisjunctive-existence-set of \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cup_{x\\in G}\n\\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at which some elements of \\(G\\)\nexist. Notice that \\(\\CES(\\varnothing) = W\\), \\(\\DES(\\varnothing) =\n\\varnothing\\), and that given any \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\), \\(\\CES(G)\n\\subseteq \\DES(G)\\). (Here and elsewhere, we borrow some vocabulary\nand symbolism from Fine 1982.) \nWe shall say that a set of facts \\(G\\) characterizes a set of\nworlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) = V\\), and that a fact \\(x\\)\ncharacterizes a set of worlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\ES(x) = V\\) (no\nconfusion should arise from the ambiguity of\n‘characterize’). At this very early point some work can\nalready be done. \nWe assume the following definitions: \nOf special interest are the following Boolean principles\n(‘\\(\\setsub\\)’ refers to the operation of set-theoretic\nsubtraction): \nIf facts can be negated, then the negation of fact \\(x\\) (if any) will\nhave existence-set \\(W \\setsub \\ES(x)\\). If facts can be conjoined,\nthen the conjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have\nexistence-set \\(\\CES(G)\\). And if facts can be disjoined, then the\ndisjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have existence-set\n\\(\\DES(G)\\). One can then understand why we call these principles\n‘Boolean’. \nB1 and B3 together entail B4. Assuming B1 and B4, B2 is equivalent to\nB3. Notice that if it is assumed that every world contains at least\none fact (a principle we shall call ‘Plenitude’),\nthen B3 implies B4 (take \\(G = F)\\). Also notice that both B1 and B4\nentail Plenitude. See Figure 1. \nFigure 1. \nIt is tempting to adopt the principle: \nNo Twins. Worlds with the very same facts (twins,\nfor short) are identical, i.e., \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(w = v\\),\ni.e., \\(F\\) is injective. \nAnother formulation of No Twins might be the following: the\nidentity of a world is completely determined by which facts hold in\nit. No Twins imposes serious constraints on the cardinality\nof \\(F\\). In particular, since there are infinitely many worlds,\nNo Twins implies that there must also be infinitely many\nfacts. \nThe B-principles assert the existence of facts characterising various\nsets of worlds. Similar principles of special interest are of the same\nvein: \nThe W-principles have mates of a certain interest: \nA set* is a set of worlds which contains all twins of its\nmembers \\((\\varnothing\\) and \\(W\\) are then sets*), and a\nsingleton* is a set* whose members are all twins. Notice that\nall existence-sets, conjunctive existence-sets and disjunctive\nexistence-sets, as well as their complements in \\(W\\), are sets*. \nW4 entails both W2 and W3, and in turn each of them entails W1. All\nthe same, W\\(4'\\) entails both W\\(2'\\) and W\\(3'\\), and in turn each\nof them entails W\\(1'\\). No Twins is a consequence of W1.\nUnder the assumption that No Twins is true, each W\\(i\\) is\nequivalent to W\\(i'\\). So each W\\(i\\) entails W\\(i'\\). W\\(4'\\) entails\nall the Bs. W\\(1'\\) entails Plenitude. W4 is thus an\nextremely strong principle, since it entails all the principles we\nhave met so far. See Figure 2. \nFigure 2. \nW\\(4'\\) is equivalent to B\\(2 +\\) W\\(3'\\), W\\(2'\\) plus B3 yields\nW\\(4'\\), W\\(1'\\) plus B2 yields W\\(2'\\). B1 yields W\\(1'\\). See Figure\n3. \nFigure 3. \nAll the previous principles are compatible with there being distinct\nfacts existing at exactly the very same worlds. One may wish to deny\nthat this is possible, and adopt: \nModal Criterion. Two facts are identical if they have the\nsame existence-set, i.e., \\(x = y\\) whenever \\(\\ES(x) = \\ES(y)\\). \nThis provides a modal criterion for the identity of facts. If\nModal Criterion is accepted, each B-principle is equivalent\nto the result of replacing in the principle ‘some fact’ by\n‘a unique fact’. The same holds of W2, W\\(2'\\), W4 and\nW\\(4'\\). \nModal Criterion is controversial. One may wish to claim that\nthere are such things as the fact that Socrates exists, the fact that\nSocrates exists and every number is a number, and the fact that\nsingleton [Socrates] exists, and that all or some of these facts are\ndistinct. But given plausible assumptions about the\nexistence-conditions of these facts, they all have the same\nexistence-set. \nModal Criterion holds in the views put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP, Suszko 1968 and Fine 1982 (in theories\nF(A)-Cond and C-Cond). It does not hold in Fine’s theory F-Cond\n(Fine 1982) and Zalta’s theory (Zalta 1991), under the two\ninterpretations indeed. References relative to previous principles\nwill be given later on. More detail is available in the\n supplementary document on Some Formal Theories in the Literature. \nThere is a view according to which propositions are sets of worlds.\nOne might prefer to identify facts with sets of worlds (this\nis what is done in Restall 2004). On this view, for every fact \\(x\\),\n\\(\\ES(x) = x\\), and for every world \\(w, F_w = \\{x : x\\in F\\) and\n\\(w\\in x\\}\\). Modal Criterion is then satisfied. Suppose that\nall non-empty sets of worlds are facts. This is a very natural option\nfor the view under consideration, and is actually countenanced by\nRestall. Then the strong W4 is satisfied. \nOn a dual view, worlds are taken to be sets of facts, a world being\nidentified with its own domain: for every world \\(w, F_w = w\\). On\nthat view, No Twins is trivially true. Variants on that view\ntake worlds to be pluralities, or mereological sums of facts.\nCresswell (Cresswell 1972) is in the set camp, Wittgenstein\n(TLP), it seems, in the plurality camp. \nStill another view is that worlds are themselves facts (Suszko 1968,\nPlantinga 1974 and Zalta 1991). A natural claim, on that view, is that\neach world belongs to its own domain and to it only, i.e., that for\nevery world \\(w\\), \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). If this is accepted, No\nTwins and W2 are true. \nHere is a simple theory which goes in that direction (Wolniewicz\n1982). Let us take the notion of a fact containing another\nfact as a primitive. We shall use ‘\\(x \\le y\\)’ for\n‘\\(x\\) is contained in \\(y\\)’, and we shall take relation\n\\(\\le\\) to be reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. One option is\nto define fact containment in modal terms (i.e., define ‘\\(x \\le\ny\\)’ as ‘necessarily, \\(x\\) exists if \\(y\\) does’),\nbut we shall remain neutral on this issue. \nLet us define a world as a maximal fact under the relation of\nfact-containment: \\(x\\) is a world iff for every fact \\(y\\), if \\(x\n\\le y\\), then \\(x = y\\). We assume that every fact is contained in\nsome world. \nWe then define the domain \\(F_w\\) of world \\(w\\) to be the set of all\nfacts \\(w\\) contains. Thus the union of all the domains is the set of\nall facts. Clearly, each world belongs to its own domain and to it\nonly: \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). So (as we previously pointed out) No\nTwins and W2 hold, and Modal Criterion is ensured if we\naccept the principle according to which two facts are identical\nprovided that they are contained in the very same worlds. \nPropositions can be negated, conjoined and disjoined to other\npropositions. As we previously saw, there is an issue as to whether\nthe same holds of facts. In this section we introduce the Boolean\noperations on facts, and point to the four main views as to which of\nthese operations actually exist. \nAn operation of negation on facts is a function \\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{n}}\\)\nwhich satisfies the following axioms: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B1. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of negation is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B1 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view which takes facts to be sets of worlds; in that case,\nset-complementation is a negation operation. \nAn operation of conjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{c}}\\) which obeys the following principles: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B2. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of conjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B2 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, intersection is a\nconjunction operation. \nFinally, an operation of disjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{d}}\\) which has the following properties: \nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B3. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of disjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B3 are accepted—in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, union is a\ndisjunction operation. \nSuppose all three operations are accepted (in which case all the Bs\nare true). It is then possible to define an operation in terms of\nnegation and conjunction which behaves almost exactly like\ndisjunction. Let \\(\\varrho(F)\\) be the set of all sets of facts \\(G\\)\nwith \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\) and \\(\\DES(G) \\ne W\\). Where \\(H\\) is any\nset of facts, we let \\(\\mathbf{n}H\\) be \\(\\{x^\\textbf{n}\\) : \\(x\\in\nH\\cap F^{\\#}\\}\\), the negative image of \\(H\\). This\ndisjunction-like operation, \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\), is a (total) function\nfrom \\(\\varrho(F)\\) to \\(F^{\\#}\\) defined by the following condition:\n\\(G^{\\delta} = (\\mathbf{n}G)^{\\textbf{{cn}}}\\). \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\)\nbehaves like disjunction in that it satisfies the principles resulting\nfrom replacing ‘\\(P(F)^*\\)’ by\n‘\\(\\varrho(F)\\)’ in\nD1–D4. \nSome extra principles must then presumably be introduced, as we\npresumably want \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) and \\(^{\\delta}\\) to coincide on\n\\(\\varrho(F)\\). We may just adopt the principle which says this: \nHere is a table indicating, for some theories, which operations they\nallow \\((+\\) means acceptance and \\(-\\) rejection): \n(On the entries containing a *, see the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.)\n In the case of Restall, commitment to all three operations directly\nfollows from the fact that his theory validates W4 and Modal\nCriterion. Taylor in fact has no modal theory of facts, but it\nseems that in a natural modal extension of his theory the previously\nmentioned acceptance claims should be correct. The restrictions in\nTaylor’s case are due to the fact that he works with standard\nfirst-order languages. Taylor is concerned with giving a theory of the\nfacts “posited” by standard first-order languages, i.e.,\nof the facts which play a role in determining the truth-values of the\nsentences of that language. Standard first-order languages admit of\nconjunction and disjunction only on finite collections of sentences,\nhence the restrictions relative to facts. But clearly, moving to\nlanguages in which infinite conjunctions and disjunctions are freely\nallowed, the restrictions would vanish. \nIn the light of the previous table, there are four main views as to\nwhich Boolean operations are to be accepted: \n(The restrictions for conjunction and disjunction indicated in the\ntable are due to accidental limitations in expressive power, as we\npointed out for the case of Taylor, and point out for the other cases\nin the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.) \nSay that a set of facts \\(G\\) is independent iff \\(G\\) is not\nempty and any of its subsets \\(H\\) is such that there is a domain\n\\(F_w\\) such that such that \\(G \\cap F_w = H\\). That \\(G\\) is\nindependent means (i) that any collection of facts in \\(G\\) may obtain\ntogether without any other fact in \\(G\\) obtaining, and (ii) that no\nfact in \\(G\\) need obtain. \nLet \\(^{\\textbf{n}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{c}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) be Boolean\noperations, of negation, conjunction and disjunction, respectively.\nWhere \\(G\\) is any set of facts, we put: \nEach world-domain is maximal consistent. Maximal consistency entails\nconjunctive closure, so each world-domain is maximal consistent. A\nmaximal set of facts contains all non-contingent facts (if any), and\nis never empty. \nWhere \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are any set of facts, we shall say that: \nNotice that \\(\\mathbf{dc}(H \\cup \\mathbf{n}H)\\) is the smallest set of\nfacts containing \\(H\\) closed under the Boolean operations. \nSuppose there is an independent set \\(H\\). Then if \\(H = F\\) or \\(H\\)\ngenerates \\(F\\) via conjunction, then all facts are contingent.\nMoreover, Modal Criterion holds if \\(H = F\\) or generates\n\\(F\\) via conjunction or Booleanization. \nWe shall now consider three particular theories of facts involving the\nnotions of independence and generation: \nLet \\(\\phi\\) be the function which associates to each singleton* the\ncommon domain of its members. Consider now the following\nprinciples: \nFor \\(i = 1, 3\\) or 4, \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails Co\\(_i\\). If No\nTwins is added to each theory, each \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails the\nprinciple which results from replacing ‘\\(\\phi\\)’ by\n‘\\(F\\)’ and ‘the set of all singletons’ by\n‘\\(W\\)’ in Co\\(_i\\): \nSome properties of our theories are depicted in the following table,\nwhere ‘+’ means ‘holds’, ‘−’\nmeans ‘fails to hold’ and ‘?’ means\n‘indeterminate’. \nIn the presence of No Twins, \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) entails all the\nWs. \n\\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) is a component of Wittgenstein’s logical\natomism in Wittgenstein TLP. It also appears in Cresswell\n1972. Suszko 1968 has something very close to \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) (cf.\nthe supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature). \nArmstrong (1997) works with a different notion of independency, which\nwe may call independency*. A set of facts is independent* iff\ngiven any of it subsets \\(G\\) and any of its member \\(x\\) not in\n\\(G\\), it is possible that the members of \\(G\\) exist without \\(x\\),\nand it is also possible that they exist with \\(x\\). Independency is\nstrictly stronger than independency*: The independency*, but not the\nindependency, of a set is compatible with there being a member of that\nset existing in every world (not the same member each time, of\ncourse). Armstrong expresses the hope that the set of atomic facts he\ncountenances is independent*, though he recognizes that there may be\ndifficulties to defend the view. We do not know whether he would\nexpress the hope that the set of atomic facts he countenances is\nindependent tout court. Anyway, even if he held the view he\nwould not endorse \\(\\textrm{T}_3\\), since he recognizes\n“totality facts” (cf.\n section 2.4.2),\n which are not conjunctions of atomic facts. \nAs we pointed out above, one view about facts is that to be a fact is\nto be a true proposition. On another, incompatible view, facts are\nwhat make true propositions true, or more generally, account for their\ntruth. The search for what accounts for the truth of propositions is,\nas we have seen, actually one main rationale for the introduction of\nfacts. In what follows we shall deal with the two views. \nBy ‘proposition’, we shall mean truth-bearer, and\nremain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements,\nbeliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for\ninstance—except in\n section 2.4.1. \nEach world \\(w\\) has its set \\(\\textrm{T}_w\\) of true propositions,\nand we call \\(\\TS(p)\\) (the truth-set of \\(p\\)) the set of\nall worlds at which \\(p\\) is true. Where \\(p\\) is a proposition, let\n\\(\\ES(p)\\) (the existence-set of \\(p\\)) be the set of all\nworlds at which it exists. \nLet us consider here the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition. On such a view, propositions cannot be sentences or\nstatements or beliefs. They are, perhaps, abstract entities expressed\nor designated by sentences. \nThere is an issue as to what the existence-conditions for propositions\n(taken in that sense, the qualification will be constant in this\nsection) are, which is relevant for the view under consideration. On\none view, propositions exist necessarily, i.e., the existence-set of\nany proposition is \\(W\\), the set of all possible worlds. On another\nview, the existence of a proposition is in general world-relative. \nThe world-relative view comes in several variants. Two such variants\nwhich will be of central interest to us correspond to the two possible\nanswers to the question ‘Can a proposition be true without\nexisting?’. The view that a proposition can be true without\nexisting is quite plausible under the assumption that propositions\nexpressed by sentences which contain proper names are composite\nobjects which literally contain the individuals denoted by these\nnames. For it is plausible to maintain that no whole can exist without\nits parts, and if this and the previously mentioned assumption are\ntrue, then the proposition expressed by ‘Socrates is not a\nphilosopher’ will turn out true in worlds where it does not\nexist (it is assumed here that there can be no non-existent\nphilosopher, and that Socrates is not a necessary existent). (Against\nthis line of thought, see the discussion of New Actualism in the entry\non\n actualism.) \nThere is a conception of propositions according to which they are sets\nof worlds (see, e.g., Stalnaker 1976). On such a conception, the\ntruth-set of a proposition is the proposition itself, and issues about\npropositional existence remain: it may be held that propositions exist\nnecessarily, or that their existence is in general world-relative. The\nfirst option seems intrinsically the most natural, and a proponent of\nthe world-relative view will most naturally identify the existence-set\nof a proposition with its truth-set—or so it seems. \nWhere \\(w\\) is a world, let \\(P_w\\) be the set of propositions which\nexists in it, and let \\(P\\) be \\(\\cup_{w\\in W} P_{w}\\), the set of all\npropositions. On the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition, the set of facts which exist in world \\(w\\) is the set of\nall propositions which exist and are true at \\(w\\), i.e., \\(F_{w} =\nT_w \\cap P_{w}\\), and the existence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\ES(x)\n\\cap \\TS(x)\\). (There is a similar view according to which all facts\nare true propositions, while some true propositions—say, the\ncomplex ones—may not be facts, but we leave it aside.) Of\ncourse, under the assumption that no proposition can be true without\nexisting, in particular under the assumption that they exist\nnecessarily, for every world \\(w, F_{w} = T_{w}\\), and the\nexistence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\TS(x)\\). \nSuppose that propositions exist necessarily. It is plausible to say\nthat propositions can be freely negated, conjoined and disjoined to\nother propositions. On that view, there are operations of negation,\nconjunction and disjunction of facts which obey the principles we\npreviously introduced. The resulting view is thus extremely strong. If\nnot all propositions exist necessarily, then questions related to the\nBoolean operations receive answers which may vary according to the\nexistence-conditions which are imposed on propositions. \nAs we have emphasized, one of the main rationale for introducing facts\nhas been to account for the truth of true propositions. The idea is\nthat whenever a proposition is true, its truth is to be explained in\nterms of the existence and / or non-existence of some facts. \nA minimal requirement one may wish to impose in that direction is the\nfollowing: \nSupervenience. \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(T_{w} =\nT_{v}\\). \nThis says that truth supervenes on facts: no difference in truth\nwithout a difference in facts. \nSupervenience is a direct consequence of No Twins,\nbut one may wish to leave open the possibility of distinct worlds\ncontaining the same facts. (On the view that to be a fact is to be a\ntrue proposition, Supervenience trivially holds if it is\nassumed that no proposition can be true if it does not exist. If that\nassumption is dropped, then there is room for Supervenience\nto fail. That might be taken to be an argument for keeping the\nassumption on the view under consideration.) \nLet us say that a property \\(\\phi\\) is a fact-condition iff\nit is a binary relation connecting sets of sets of facts and worlds,\nsuch that given any set of sets of facts \\(\\Gamma\\) and any worlds\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\), if \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\), then \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\) iff\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v)\\) (i.e., the holding of the condition supervenes on\nwhich facts there are). The following principle better captures the\nidea that facts account for the truth of true propositions: \nDetermination. For every proposition \\(p\\) and every world\n\\(w\\) at which it is true, there exists a fact-condition \\(\\phi\\) and\na set \\(\\Gamma\\) of sets of facts such that \nDetermination clearly entails Supervenience. \nLet us examine some stronger principles. Let us say that some given\nfacts (jointly) necessitate proposition \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\) is\ntrue in every world where they all exist. The facts in set \\(G\\)\n(jointly) necessitate \\(p\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) \\subseteq \\TS(p)\\). Let us\nalso say that some given facts (jointly) make true\nproposition \\(p\\) in world \\(w\\) iff they all exist in \\(w\\) and they\nnecessitate the proposition. Let us finally say that proposition \\(p\\)\nrepresents some given facts iff in every world where \\(p\\) is\ntrue, some of them exist. Proposition \\(p\\) represents the facts in\n\\(G\\) iff \\(\\TS(p) \\subseteq \\DES(G)\\). \nOur definition of truthmaking fails to capture the explanatory\ncharacter of the notion people have usually in mind when they talk\nabout truthmaking. If something makes a given proposition\ntrue, it is usually assumed, then the existence of that thing explains\nthe truth of the proposition. Now it should be clear that truthmaking\nas we have defined it is not explanatory in this sense. For everything\nwhatsoever is a truthmaker (in our sense) for any necessary\nproposition, while arguably, the obtaining of the fact that Philipp\nlives in Geneva fails to explain the truth of your favourite\ntautology. Or again, consider Socrates and its singleton-set,\n[Socrates]. It may be argued, as we previously stressed, that granted\nthat there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists and the\nfact that [Socrates] exists, these two facts obtain in exactly the\nsame worlds. Assume this is the case. Now some may be happy with the\nview that the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in the usual\nsense) for the proposition that Socrates exists—and so with the\nview that the obtaining of the fact explains the truth of the\nproposition, but the view that the truth of that proposition is\nexplained by the obtaining of the fact that the singleton exists is\nhighly implausible. Yet if the fact that Socrates exists is a\ntruthmaker (in our sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists,\nthen the fact that the singleton exists is also a truthmaker (in our\nsense) for that proposition. \nRepresentation, as we have defined it, is also quite remote from what\npeople usually have in mind when they speak of propositions\nrepresenting facts: propositions which cannot be true represent (in\nour sense) any fact whatsoever, and if the proposition that Socrates\nexists represents (in our sense) the fact that Socrates exists, then\nit also represents (in our sense) the fact that [Socrates] exists\n(granted that these two facts exist at the same worlds). \nDespite the fact that truthmaking as defined above does not to capture\nthe usual concept of making true, we shall not deal with the latter\nconcept here. And we shall not deal either with the usual notion of\nrepresentation. \nLet us now turn to the stronger principles. A very strong principle\nconnecting propositions and facts says that for every proposition\n\\(p\\) which can be true, there exists a fact represented by \\(p\\)\nwhich necessitates \\(p\\) (i.e., a fact which makes the proposition\ntrue in every world where it is true). The principle just says that\nfor every proposition which can be true, there is a fact whose\nexistence-set is identical to the proposition’s truth-set: \n(\\(P^{\\circ}\\) is the set of all propositions which can be true.) \nThis is a very strong principle. Under reasonable assumptions, P1\nentails the strong principle W4. For instance, this is so under the\nassumption that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some\nproposition. This assumption trivially holds if sets of worlds are\ntaken to be propositions, but such an assumption is not needed. For\nlet \\(V\\) be any set of worlds. Assume that No Twins is true.\nTo each world \\(w\\) associate the conjunction \\(c_w\\) of all\npropositions true in \\(w\\) (we suppose it exists), and consider the\ndisjunction \\(d_V\\) of all \\(c_w, w\\in V\\) (we suppose it exists).\nThen \\(\\TS(d_V) = V\\). \nTheory F(A)-Cond described in Fine 1982 licences P1, as well as the\ntheory put forward in Zalta 1991 (cf. the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n As we saw, Taylor (1985) has no modal theory of facts, but it seems\nthat in a natural modal extension of his theory, P1 should hold.\nNotice that P1 is immediate on the view that facts are sets of worlds,\nand that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts (the view put forward\nin Restall 2004). For then, \\(\\ES(x) = x\\) for any fact \\(x\\). \nP1 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\).\nConsider the following assumptions \\((H_0\\) is a selected independent\nset which generates \\(F\\) via Booleanization): \nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) may be willing to accept them, and doing\nso he will thereby endorse P1. \nThere is a simpler argument against P1 enemies of disjunctive facts\nmay advance. Take any two propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and assume they\nhave a disjunction \\(r\\) (we may assume that \\(p\\) can be true and\n\\(q\\) false, and vice versa). By P1, there are facts \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\) and \\(\\ES(y) = \\TS(q)\\) and\n\\(\\ES(z) = \\TS(r)\\). So \\(\\ES(z) = \\ES(x) \\cup \\ES(y)\\), and \\(z\\)\nbehaves like a disjunctive fact: it exists in a world iff \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) does. \nThose who take these to be problems may endorse the following weaker\nprinciple: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can be true and every\nworld \\(w\\) at which it is true, there is a fact which makes it true.\nThat principle is equivalent to: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can\nbe true, there exists a set of facts \\(G\\) whose members are\nrepresented by \\(p\\) such that every member of \\(G\\) necessitates\n\\(p\\). To put it differently, for every proposition which can be true,\nthere is set of facts whose disjunctive existence-set is identical to\nthe proposition’s truth-set: \nThis principle is endorsed by Armstrong (1997), and seems to be taken\nby Fine as fitting his theory C-Cond (Fine 1982; cf. the supplementary\ndocument\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature). \nBut there are still potential problems, this time related to\nconjunction. \nFor take the conjunctive proposition that Socrates is a philosopher\nand Frege is human. P2 tells us that there is a set of facts \\(K\\)\nsuch that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is\nthat set of facts? One may be tempted to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human.\nIt is hard to see which other answer could be provided, and so P2\nseems to commit one to conjunctive facts. \nThose who are bothered by these features of P1 and P2 may wish to\nadopt the following principle: there is a special set of propositions\n\\(Q\\) such that (i) the restriction of P1 to \\(Q\\) holds, i.e., for\nevery \\(p\\) in \\(Q\\), there is a fact \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) =\n\\TS(p)\\), and (ii) for every world \\(w\\) where a proposition \\(p\\) is\ntrue, there is a part \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) whose members are true, and such\nthat in every world where they are true, \\(p\\) is true. \nBut there are still potential problems, which actually affect P2 as\nwell, this time related to negation. Take the negative proposition\nthat Socrates is not a philosopher. By P2, there is a set of facts\n\\(K\\) such that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What\nis that set of facts? One may wish to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is not a philosopher. Again, it is\nhard to think of any alternative, and so P2 seems to commit one to\nnegative facts. Alternatively, assume the previous principle. Shall we\ntake the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher to be in \\(Q\\)\nor not? If we do, then we are in the same situation as before: we seem\nto be committed to negative facts. If we do not, it is hard to see\nwhich set of propositions \\(R \\subseteq Q\\) satisfying condition (ii)\nabove we are going to choose. \nIn order to deal with negative propositions, Armstrong (1997) invokes\na certain kind of facts which he calls ‘totality facts’,\nfacts which can be designated by means of expressions of type\n‘the fact that \\(X\\) are all the \\(F\\)s that there are’,\nwhere ‘\\(X\\)’ is a rigid plural designator and\n‘\\(F\\)’ a predicate. The proposition that Socrates is not\na philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the atomic\nfacts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there are—a\ntotality fact. \nThose who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative\nand totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker\nthan P2): \nP3 says that the following is true of every proposition \\(p\\) which\ncan be true: for every world where \\(p\\) is true, there are two sets\nof facts \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) such that (i) in \\(w\\), all members of \\(G\\)\nexist and none of \\(H\\) do, and (ii) in every world where this is the\ncase, \\(p\\) is true. That principle is rather ugly, but it does what\nit should do. \nP3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\).\nConsider the following assumptions: \nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) may be willing to accept\nthem—Wittgenstein (TLP) does—and if he does, he\nwill thereby accept P3. \nEven the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true\nuniversal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my\nright hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some\ncontroversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein’s view\nthat universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3\ninvolves accepting that there is something like the fact that every\nfinger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its\nexistence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in\nquestion. Following Wittgenstein (TLP), many reject such\nuniversal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (PLA)\nand Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which\nhave indeed a universal component.). \nThere is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous\ndifficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic\npropositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex\npropositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular\ncontent of these propositions. This is the view put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP: the atomic facts make true the true atomic\npropositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean\ncombination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what\nhappens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive,\nsince they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they\nprove especially difficult to develop, especially when special\npropositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving\nmodal concepts. \nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n singular propositions\n and\n structured propositions.) \nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction—and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as parts. \nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\nsubstantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation \\(R\\) (in that order) by ‘[\\(R\\); \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\)]’. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n‘Socrates is mortal’ corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls ‘objectualism’ (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP\n(‘perhaps’, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him). \nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations. \nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts: \nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.) \nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one’s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world. \nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation. \nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation \\(x\\). Then as we saw,\nit would be odd to claim that \\(x\\) is not a complex fact, having\nSocrates as a component. Suppose \\(x\\) has such a complexity. Now take\ntwo worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\), such that in \\(w\\) Socrates exists but is\nnot a philosopher, and in \\(v\\), Socrates does not exist (and so is\nnot a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that\nSocrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of\nview (a), \\(x\\) exists in \\(w\\) but not in \\(v\\). The outcome is\nrather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of\nconjunction. \nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on. \nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal\nCriterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.","contact.mail":"fabricecorreia@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
