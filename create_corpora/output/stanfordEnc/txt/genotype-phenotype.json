The\nphenotype is the physical and behavioral traits of the\norganism, for example, size and shape, metabolic activities, and\npatterns of movement. The distinction between them is\nespecially important in evolutionary theory, where the survival and\nmating of organisms depends on their traits, but it is the DNA, held\nto be unaffected by the development of the traits over the life\ncourse, that is transmitted to the next generation. Philosophical\ndiscussion mostly now takes the predominant meanings as given,\nfocusing instead on questions about the genotype-phenotype\nrelationship. For example: How can DNA be construed as\ninformation for the processes of development of an organism’s\ntraits? What is the causal status of DNA versus other influences in\nthe organism’s development? (see entries on\n inheritance systems\n and\n biological information\n and also Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Without dismissing the\nimportance of such questions, the focus of this entry remains on the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction. Given that discussion by\nphilosophers of this issue has been minimal, this entry cannot take\nthe standard form of a review of published debates. In order to help\nframe and orient readers’ conceptual inquiries, another approach\nis needed. The entry builds from the observations that the original\nmeanings of genotype and phenotype and the distinction between them as\ngiven by Wilhelm Johannsen (1911) were quite different from the now\npredominant meaning (given above) and that different kinds of meanings\ncoexist in Johannsen and up to the present. To make sense of those\nobservations, Johannsen’s paper is recounted with special\nreference to practices or assumptions regarding control of\nbiological materials and conditions. Subsequent developments are then\ndescribed in relation to problems introduced by conceptualizing\nheredity on the basis of breeding experiments. This framing brings\ninto play many areas of philosophical discussions, including the\n“New Experimentalism” in philosophy of biology (see entry\non\n experiment in biology),\n abstraction (see entry on\n abstract objects),\n confirmation, ambiguity, Scientific Realism, descriptive versus\nnormative approaches, and The Social Dimensions of Scientific\nKnowledge. At the same time, the framing helps open up questions that\nhave not been well addressed in those discussions and has implications\nfor issues that might seem settled to many who, when they invoke the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction, are simply thinking DNA\nversus trait. \n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of the terms given at the start of the introduction may at\nfirst seem clear, but conceptual questions have accompanied or been\nimplied by the use of the terms since their introduction to\nEnglish-language readers by Johannsen’s (1911) “The\nGenotype Conception of Heredity” and up until the present. How\ndoes an individual organism’s DNA influence the processes of\ndevelopment of its traits over its lifetime—processes that also\ninvolve other influences? How can an individual organism’s\ntraits be used to identify its DNA sequence? Why are the terms\ngenotype and phenotype still used if they simply refer to the\nindividual’s DNA and traits? One answer to this last question is\nthat what counts is less the meaning of the terms than what their use\nhas come to signify, in particular, that certain issues have\nbeen resolved: the barrier between the organism’s life course\nand DNA transmitted to the next generation; evolution is change in\nfrequencies of genes or DNA sequences in populations over time;\ndevelopment of traits will eventually be understood in terms of a\ncomposite of the effects of DNA on the organism; what counts is what\nis underneath or inside the observable surface; and findings about\nheredity derived using one meaning of terms affirm findings derived\nusing a different meaning. How firmly resolved are these issues? If\none wants to open them up for further scrutiny, it could be helpful to\nquestion the meaning of genotype, phenotype, and the distinction\nbetween them. \nAnother response to why the terms continue to be used is that the\npredominant meanings are not the only ones. Type connotes a\nclass. This sense of the terms leads to further questions:\nWhat makes organisms similar enough to be grouped in a genotype as a\nclass? …or in a phenotype as a class? How is the membership of\norganisms in a genotype manifest in their membership in a\nphenotype—or phenotypes? How can the membership of organisms in\na phenotype be used to identify their membership in a genotype? Type\nalso connotes an abstraction away from the full set of\nobserved characteristics. What then is to be accentuated and what\nde-emphasized about a genotype and phenotype, as DNA and traits or as\nclasses—especially when asking any of the previous questions?\nAnd how—by what concepts, methods, and models—is what has\nbeen de-emphasized to be brought back and re-integrated into\nthe scientific account?  \nTo make sense of the original meanings of the terms and the\ndistinction between them as well as the coexistence of different kinds\nof meanings since then, a specific kind of abstraction (see entry on\n abstract objects)\n is pertinent, namely, the material practices of\ncontrol over biological materials and conditions advanced in\nmodern experimental biology and agricultural breeding or entailed in\nthe allied use of models in analysis of data. Reliable\nmethods more than endorsable theories are the touchstone of this kind\nof abstraction. It is within a framing of control—and the\nconsequent challenge of reintegration—that this entry discusses\nthe other senses already mentioned of the terms genotype and\nphenotype: in the context of the relationship between an\nindividual’s DNA and traits; what the use of the terms\nsignifies; and grouping into classes. (Given the continuing\ncoexistence of the different kinds of meaning of the terms, qualifiers\nare used when there might be ambiguity.) \nAlthough there may be grounds to revise various positions and\ninquiries about the genotype-phenotype relationship in light\nof assumptions made about control and eventual reintegration, such\ndiscussion lies beyond the scope of this entry. (If the\ngenotype-phenotype relationship were the entry’s focus, more\nattention would need to be given to philosophical arguments about\ncausality and about abstraction as it relates to causal claims; see\nWinther 2014 for an entry point and\n section 7.)\n The entry also cannot do justice to the rich social and economic\nhistory of heredity, where concrete cases abound concerning the\ncontrol of biological materials for production and\nbreeding—dating from well before the genotype-phenotype\ndistinction through to present-day biotechnology. (Readers wanting to\nreintegrate the history and context might usefully start with the\nessays collected in Müller-Wille et al. 2008b, Deichmann et al.\n2014, and Müller-Wille & Brandt 2016, and references cited\ntherein. Müller-Wille 2008 and Bonneuil 2016, in particular,\ndescribe Johannsen’s professional and modernizing aspirations\nand place them in their economic context. Rolls-Hansen 2014 places\nJohannsen’s 1911 contribution in the context of shifts in his\nviews over his career.)  \nMarcel Weber (2014) notes that, because many areas of modern biology\n“are profoundly experimental disciplines, an increased attention\n[in philosophy of biology] to the experiment in biology was\ninevitable” (see also entry on\n gene).\n Yet, how an area of biology becomes experimental in the first place\nas well as the implications of that shift also warrant attention. A\nrecounting of Johannsen (1911) in this vein serves not only to\nintroduce his original genotype-phenotype distinction, but also to\npoint to various conceptual and methodological complexities that are\nassociated with redefining heredity on the basis of breeding\nexperiments. The detail in this section and the next is important not\nas a matter of doing history, but to insert distance from the\npredominant current-day meanings and establish a space in which modern\nusers of his terms can consider issues that had been left behind. \nThe overarching project for Johannsen (1911) was to promote a shift\nfrom “morphological-descriptive” natural history (1911:\n134), in which appearances could mislead or be spun into speculative\ntheories, to an “exact science” (1911: 131) using the\nexperimental control of biological materials and conditions needed to\nestablish repeatable outcomes and expose hidden processes.  \nA specific variant of Johannsen’s overarching project was to\narticulate an alternative to traditional accounts of heredity, which,\nin his words,  \ntried to conceive or “explain” the presumed transmission\nof general or peculiar characters and qualities\n“inherited” from parents or more remote ancestors. (1911:\n129)  \nIn rejecting such a “transmission-conception” of heredity\n(his term), Johannsen sought specifically to depart from two\napproaches: a) the analysis by biometricians of continuous variation\n(such as the spread of heights in a given population), which showed\ntraits of offspring to be numerically correlated with those of their\nparents, grandparents, and so on—such analysis preserved the\npossibility of “ancestral influences” (1911: 138); and b)\nparticulate theories, such as those of August Weismann and Darwinians\nthat could be seen as consistent with transmission of parental traits\nto the zygote (the initial cell resulting from a fusion of gametes or\ngerm cells, i.e., egg and sperm). Johannsen saw no evidence\nfor the idea that the “elements responsible for\ninheritance… involve the different organs or tissue-groups of\nthe individual developing from the zygote” (1911: 131). \nJohannsen’s alternative involved four steps of concept and\nmethod: \nIn Johannsen’s experiments, the plants in any line showed\nvariation in a given trait under differing conditions, but selection\namong the plants for that trait did not result in improvement\nfrom one generation to the next. Whatever the nature of the germ cells\nthat seeds from a line shared, and in whatever ways it\n“reacted” during the plant’s development thus\n“interfering with the totality of all incident factors, may it\nbe external or internal” (1911: 133), seeds of the next\ngeneration did not result in plants that matched their parent any more\nthan plants from any other seed from the same line (a theory\nsummarized in\n Figure 1).\n Plants from the inbred line were instances of a genotype; variation\nin the traits grown from the seeds was, borrowing from Richard\nWoltereck, the norm of reaction (Reaktionsnorm) of that\ngenotype; a plant’s relative position in the norm of reaction\nwas not transmitted to its offspring; and (with the emphasis\nJohannsen’s) “selection is not able to shift the\nnature of genotypes” (1911: 137). Because the nature or\nconstituents of a genotype were stable, the\n“genotype-conception” of heredity was\n“ahistoric” (1911: 139). (Note: Johannsen did not adopt\nWeismann’s term germplasm to denote the material basis\nfor animal development sequestered from the somatoplasm early\neach generation [Churchill 1974: 19]. Yet, whatever the material basis\nof development was for plant genotypes, it was similarly shielded from\nmost of the interactions that occur during the organism’s\nlifetime within the organism and with the environment.) \nFigure 1: Johannsen’s view of\nheredity: Germ cells that form a basis for development of an organism\nget reproduced for the next generation unaffected by the development\nof the traits over the life course.  \nPhenotypes might, Johannsen noted, be a mix of several genotypes (as\nillustrated by the sole figure in the 1911 article; Churchill 1974).\nTo remove the ambiguity of appearance—to be able to use\nphenotypes to distinguish genotypes—he relied on research that\nwas flourishing after the rediscovery in 1900 of Gregor Mendel’s\nexperiments on peas. Those experiments can be summarized as\nfollows: \nThe experiments of Johannsen and Mendel (summarized in\n Figure 2)\n can be seen as having achieved the goals given above\n (section 2.1).\n  \nFigure 2: Mendel-Johannsen method:\nInbreeding, controlled crosses, and control of experimental conditions\nallows unambiguous use of phenotypes to distinguish genotypes. \nJohannsen’s experiments on inbred lines produced repeatable\noutcomes and illuminated hidden processes: traits acquired during\ndevelopment in certain conditions were not transmitted to offspring,\nthat is, the nature or constituents of the genotype were shielded from\nmost of the interactions within the organism and with the environment\nthat occur during the organism’s lifetime. Even if the reactions\nof different genotypes under various conditions resulted in\n“differences between the phenotype-curves [that] may vary\nconsiderably or may even vanish entirely” (Johannsen 1911: 145),\na specific “genotypical constitution always reacts in the same\nmanner under identical conditions” (1911: 146). Mendelian\nexperiments crossing inbred lines extended this genotype-conception of\nheredity. Hidden processes were exposed in the sense that sexual\nreproduction involves joining together of pairs of factors—for\nwhich Johannsen coined the term genes.  That meant the\nreappearance in F2 of traits not visible in F1 could be explained\nwithout any ancestral influence. The rest of his goals were also\nfulfilled: The dichotomous nature of Mendel’s traits afforded\nJohannsen the distance he desired from the analysts of continuous\nvariation who had entertained ancestral influences. Mendelian\nresearchers had a method to remove the ambiguity of appearance so\ngenotypes could be distinguished from each other (and their\nconstituents shown to be stable). In sum, these experimental\napproaches rendered irrelevant past speculations about the\n“elements responsible for inheritance” (1911: 131;\nChurchill 1974). \nAt the same time, Johannsen (1911) introduced many ambiguities and\nquestions about the import of his new terms. At first sight, the sense\nof classes is predominant. The phenotype, consisting of organisms\n“distinguishable by direct inspection or… by finer\nmethods of measuring or description” (1911: 134), is used to\nidentify the genotype as a class of organisms that shares constituents\nstable from generation to generation. Yet, no method is discussed to\ndivide a natural varying population into phenotypes, let alone\nidentify a genotype-as-class in such populations. It is in the\nrestricted realm of inbred lines that identifying genotypes from\nphenotypes is possible, albeit not reliably if a phenotype includes a\nmix of inbred lines. Notice, however, if an inbred line is bred true\n(i.e., not crossed with any other lines), it is a genotype-as-class.\nThere is no need to divide up the lines into phenotypes in order to\nidentify genotypes, and it matters not that the traits of individuals\nin an inbred line vary with the conditions in which the individuals\nare raised. Indeed, the norm of reaction of the inbred line is one way\nto think of the genotype as an abstracted type. \nMoreover, there is no need to identify the material basis of the\ngenotypic constituents shared by the inbred line. Nevertheless,\nMendel’s experiments had begun to expose the constituents’\nnature. When inbred lines were crossed then self-pollinated, the\ntraits of individuals raised under uniform conditions could be\nanalyzed statistically by employing—and thereby\ndemonstrating—a model of genotypic constituents as pairs of\nsegregating factors. In these experiments, phenotypes and genotypes as\nclasses still play a role, with the F2 phenotypes being used to\nidentify whether apparently identical F1 phenotypes are heterozygote\nor homozygote genotypes. It might be asked whether Johannsen’s\nreference to the “finer methods of measuring or\ndescription” could be construed to include the disambiguating\nanalysis of ratios after inbreeding, crossing, and self-pollination?\nIf the answer is yes, the inbred parent could be classified as a\ndifferent phenotype from the F1 hybrid. In that case, the Johannsenian\nstudy of heredity would amount to generating phenotypes—classes\nof organisms distinguished by “finer methods of measuring or\ndescription” of traits—that are isomorphic with\ngenotypes—classes of organisms that share identical stable\nconstituents.  \nYet, the experimental control of biological material and conditions\nthat make such a mapping possible also provided the Mendelian\nresearchers of the early twentieth century a means to investigate the\ngenotype-as-material-constituents (see\n section 3).\n Indeed, Johannsen’s conception of the genotype as a class of\norganisms sharing stable genotypic constituents already\npointed that way. However, in taking up that direction of research\nwhat was left unaddressed was the relevance for understanding heredity\nin naturally varying populations of phenotype-to-genotype\nmapping and investigations of the constituents of genotype using\nMendelian methods. Johannsen (1911) does not address those issues\n(which are returned to in\n section 5),\n but he does point to several other concerns about the concepts,\nmethods, and implications of the genotype conception of heredity.\nThese follow. \nThe continuous variation common in regular populations did not, for\nJohannsen, contradict the discontinuity of genotypes:  \nThe well-known displacement… of a population… proceeding\nfrom generation to generation in the direction indicated by the\nselection—is due to the existence a priori of genotypical\ndifferences in such populations. (1911: 137)  \nSuch selection changed the relative proportion of genotypes in the\npopulation, not any genotype itself. There could have been room here\nfor reconciliation with the biometrical view of variation in\nnon-experimental populations, but that avenue was not pursued by\nJohannsen. Instead, like many other exponents of Mendel’s\nrediscovered work, he chose to dispute the idea that different types\nof organism could be “evolved from each other by extremely small\nsteps in genotypical change”. Instead, “the mutations\nreally observed in nature have all shown themselves as considerable,\ndiscontinuous saltations” (1911: 158; i.e., jumps). \nMendelian experiments fostered a particulate view of heredity in the\nway that two factors influence a given trait. (In that sense, the old\ntransmission conception had not been fully banished.) Yet Johannsen\nwanted the genotype to be seen as a whole:\n“[C]haracters may be determined by several different genes,\nand… one sort of gene may have influence upon several different\nreactions” (1911: 153). He advised that “the talk of\n‘genes for any particular character’ ought to be\nomitted…” (1911: 147). If this view was to be made into\nexact science, some method for analyzing the genotypical constitution\nor genotype as a whole was needed. Johannsen did not provide one. \nJohannsen raised another concern about genes as particulate factors\nwhen he asserted that the traits “of the organism in\ntoto are the results of the reactions of the genotypical\nconstitution” (1911: 147; his emphasis); there was no\n“suggestive value” in the idea that “discrete\nparticles of the chromosomes are ‘bearers’ of special\nparts of the whole inheritance in question” (1911: 131–2).\nYet Mendel’s original experiments could be seen to support that\nvery idea: the traits of the peas were not only dichotomous, but there\nwas no pattern of co-occurrence of variants of the different traits,\nas would be the case if, say, crinkly peas occurred more often on\ndwarf plants. Given such independent assortment of traits, it\nwould make sense, contra Johannsen, to talk of a pair of\nfactors or genes for crinkly peas. A new transmission\nconception of heredity was plausible. \nJohannsen also noted that  \nthere may be… very narrow limits for [Mendelian] analysis: the\nentire organization may never be “segregated” into genes.\n(1911: 153)  \nTo put that in another way, the influence of factors that are\nidentical for all members of a species cannot be studied\nthrough Mendelian crosses. The genotype-conception of heredity, by\ncentering on genotypic differences associated with phenotypic\ndifferences, shifted attention away from the species-typical aspects\nof the germ cells and subsequent development. Mendelian analysis\nfocused on differences over similarity, even though both\naspects were included in then prevailing conceptions of heredity (Sapp\n1987). (Similarity was part of heredity in the sense that, for the eye\ncolor of some flies to differ from the rest of the population, the\ninitial cell or zygote of the fly has to be able to develop into an\norganism that has eyes with color.)  \nMorphological-descriptive natural history is, as Johannsen (1911)\ndesired, downplayed in the pursuit of experimentally generated and\nrepeatable outcomes, yet his writing did not acknowledge that the same\npursuit characterized a well-established field of zoological research,\n“developmental mechanics” (Entwicklungsmechanik).\nThis experimental field had a morphological focus on how cells become\narranged into tissues, organs, and the organism’s overall form,\nand how such organization is regenerated after disturbance or through\nthe formation of germ cells (see entry on\n developmental biology).\n Important contemporaries of Johannsen grappled with the tensions\nbetween Mendelism and development (Deichmann 2014), but he merely\nevoked development in broad strokes—as the genotypes reacting or\n“interfering with the totality of all incident factors”\n(1911: 133)—and left the mechanics or dynamics as a secondary\nconcern. For the new genotype-conception of heredity, stability of the\ngenotype across generations was the primary fact. In putting mechanics\nto the side, the descriptive side of studies of heredity that\nJohannsen decried can be seen persisting, to some degree, in his\noriginal definitions of phenotype and genotype as classes of\norganisms.  \nJohannsen placed not only the developmental processes, but also the\nmaterial make-up of the germ cells or the genes outside the scope of\nhis genotype-conception of heredity: “[T]he nature of the\n‘genes’… is as yet of no value to propose any\nhypothesis” (1911: 133). Yet, the shift (mentioned earlier),\nwhere the focus in studies of heredity moved on to the material\nmake-up, was prefigured by his referring to the genotypical\nconstitution and noting that “a ‘genotype’ is\nthe sum total of all the ‘genes’ in a gamete or in a\nzygote” (1911: 132–3). A further shift towards exposing\nthe dynamics of development that build on those constituents was\nprefigured when Johannsen referred to “phenotypes… i.e.,\nthe reactions of the genotypical constituents” (1911: 145).  \nFigure 3: Extensions of Mendel-Johannsen\nmethod: Identification of genotypes as parts of germ cells\ncorresponding to differences in phenotypes as specific traits\n→ Location of genotypes on chromosomes → Further control and\nreproducibility of genotypes and phenotypes → Heredity as\ntransmission of genes (pairs of which make up genotypes) → DNA as\nmaterial basis of genes. \nThe conservatism expressed in Johannsen (1911) about identifying the\nmaterial basis of genes, as the nature of the germ cells shared by a\ngenotype, was not so evident among the Mendelian researchers who\nquickly came to adopt the new terms gene, genotype, and phenotype\nduring that decade. The focus moved beyond refuting what Johannsen\ncalled the “transmission-conception” of heredity and\ntowards heredity as transmission in the new sense of genes going from\nparents to the germ cells of offspring\n (Figure 3).\n Research in laboratory genetics and agricultural breeding extended\nMendelian methods productively, but it also allowed some of the\nconceptual and methodological problems of Johannsen introduced in\n section 2\n to persist and ramify. \nMendelian research soon showed the independent assortment of factors\nin Mendel’s experiments to be a special case, not a law.\nDepartures from independent assortment of traits allowed the\nidentification of linkage groups, in which variants of two or more\ntraits co-occur, which eventually were shown to correspond to the\nproximity of their place or locus on distinct chromosomes.\n(Indeed, Mendelian research helped expose properties of the\nchromosomes, such as their role in sex determination, and investigate\nmany other biological issues. Waters [2004] criticizes philosophers\nwho interpret Mendelism solely in terms of establishing a theory of\ninheritance: “Posing and solving carefully orchestrated pedigree\nproblems was the means, not the ends, of classical genetics”.)\nJohannsen’s resistance to the idea that “discrete\nparticles of the chromosomes are ‘bearers’ of special\nparts of the whole inheritance” (1911: 131–2) was shared\nby others (Deichmann 2014), but such reservations did not hold back\nthe rise of Mendelianism to a dominant position in research into\nheredity well before the material make-up and functioning of those\nparticles—the genes—was revealed in the 1950s. The\nparticulate view was affirmed by producing heritable alterations in\nphenotypes after bombarding organisms with high-energy ionizing\nradiation.  \nIt remained central to experiments involving crosses between lines\nthat, as much as possible, those lines were inbred and identical and\nhomozygous for genes influencing all traits apart from for the traits\nunder study. While the identical homozygous genes might have an\ninfluence on the development of any focal trait,\ndifferences in that trait could be attributed to\ndifferences in the genes that were not identical among the\ncrossed lines. (Indeed, by the 1930s heredity had come to refer to the\ntransmission of and cross-generational patterns in these differences,\nnot to the development of the similarities from which differences\ndepart [Sapp 1987].) Genotype could be applied to classes of\norganisms with a specific pair of genes (or small set of pairs)\nor to the specific pairs of genes themselves (matching the\nconnotation of type as an abstraction away from the full set of\nobserved characteristics). In Mendelian experiments\nphenotypes-as-classes demarcated by a small set of traits could be\nused to identify genotypes-as-classes. Then, once the genotype as\npair(s) of genes was mapped to a locus on the chromosome, the\ndirection could be reversed: the phenotype would then be the subset of\nan organism’s traits associated with the genotype under given\nconditions (a forerunner here of the predominant current-day\nmeaning). \nMendelian methods of inference based on a small set of traits and\npairs of genes were complicated by phenomena that came to be called\nepistasis, expressivity, penetrance, and incomplete dominance and, to\na lesser extent, by a background level of mutation for any gene being\nstudied. Muriel Wheldale’s genetic analysis of the color of\nsnapdragon flowers, for example, showed that plants with one or more\ndominant alleles (i.e., variants of the gene) at a certain locus would\nshow color patterns that she was able to associate with the genotype\nat three other loci, but plants with two recessive alleles at the\nfirst locus would be white no matter what—the homozygote\nrecessive genotype had an epistatic effect over the other\ngenotypes. A range of phenotypes may be shown to correspond to the\nsame genotype—expressivity. A phenotype that is\nassociated with a certain genotype may be observed for only a fraction\nof individuals in or with that genotype—penetrance.\nWith respect to expressivity and penetrance, researchers try to link\nthe observed variation to conditions occurring during development,\nstochastic developmental noise, or differences remaining at loci not\nunder study, and to decide where in the range of the trait, say,\nmelanin pigmentation, to demarcate one phenotype from another.\nIncomplete dominance means the occurrence of an intermediate\nphenotype (e.g., pink snapdragon flowers resulting from crosses of\nwhite and red inbred lines).  \nIncomplete dominance removed some of the ambiguities in using\nphenotypes to distinguish genotypes, but the combination of the four\nphenomena and linkage for multiple loci meant that Mendelian\nresearchers had to distinguish among multiple hypotheses about the\ngenotypes consistent with observed patterns of traits in the offspring\nof crosses. Background levels of mutation, including mutations in\nnon-germ cells during the lifetime, ensure that even\ngenotypes-as-classes consisting of clones or of identical or\nmonozygotic twins are not made up of strictly identical\nmembers. Nevertheless, with suitable organisms and for certain traits,\nand under the inbreeding and control of conditions typical of\nMendelian experiments, the painstaking work of inferring genotypes (as\npairs of genes) from phenotypes could bear fruit. \nNot all aspects of the study of heredity could be made an experimental\nendeavor through Mendelian methods. There were many traits for which\nthe continuous variation could not be subdivided into discrete\nphenotypes, let alone linked to genotypes, especially for traits in\nagriculture of economic interest such as yield of plant and animal\nvarieties or breeds. By the end of the 1910s Ronald Fisher and Sewall\nWright had begun to address the need to reconcile the discreteness of\ngenotypes with continuous variation in many observable traits. In the\nmathematical models of a field that came to be known as\nquantitative genetics, differences between unobserved\ntheoretical genotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) at each of a\nlarge number of loci contribute to differences in the trait, modulated\nby degrees of correspondingly theoretical dominance and epistasis.\nUnder the reasonable assumption that more of the genes are shared\namong relatives than in the population as a whole, data on a given\ntrait as it varies across genealogically defined lines or groups of\nspecified relatedness could be analyzed so as to provide predictions\nof changes in the average value of the trait in the population under\nselective breeding. Of course, the trait values and thus the\npredictions depended on the conditions in which the organisms\ndeveloped, but in the laboratory and, to varying degrees, in\nagricultural breeding, conditions could be replicated. For the\nbreeder, the focus of the quantitative genetic data analysis on\ndifferences in the trait makes practical sense; it is not necessary to\nknow the mechanisms through which the traits developed as organisms\nreacted to conditions. In other words, the meanings of genotype,\nphenotype, and their distinction again make sense as an abstraction\nthrough practices of control over biological materials and conditions\nin agricultural and laboratory breeding and the allied use of models\nand analysis of data. \nIt should also be noted that, in agricultural breeding, the lines or\nother genealogically defined groups became called genotypes as well.\nGenotypes in this sense are classes of individuals related by\ngenealogy from a common ancestor or set of ancestors. The relatedness\ntakes a variety of forms—not only pure (inbred or cloned) lines,\nbut also offspring of a given pair of parents or a set of ancestors or\nan open pollinated plant variety in which the genes vary within\nreplicable bounds among the generations of individuals in the class.\nThe corresponding phenotype is then the range of values of the trait\nor set of traits as they are observed to vary for the genealogically\ndefined line or group in the given location(s) or situation(s). In\nthis sense the phenotypes from different lines may overlap; organisms\nare divisible into phenotypes as classes for the purpose of\nquantitative genetic analysis not through “finer methods of\nmeasuring or description”, but because the lines or groups are\nseparable. (Quantitative genetics extended to humans does not involve\ncontrolled breeding, but does rely on relatedness that differs\nbetween, say, monozygotic and dizygotic (i.e., fraternal) twins. Even\nthough a twin pair is not conventionally referred to as a genotype,\nhuman quantitative genetics has followed the same idea for data\nanalysis as used in agricultural breeding.) \nThe mathematical models of quantitative genetics could be readily\nextended from selective breeding to evolutionary change by having\ntheoretical genotypes from a large number of loci each contribute to\nparameters for surviving and leaving offspring—so-called\nselection coefficients. Data on the variation for a trait in\na specific group or population could be analyzed so as to estimate the\nparameters in the model that would generate the observed changes in\nthe average value of the trait over time. Thinking about evolution in\nthe terms of quantitative genetics meant that it was no longer\nnecessary, contra Johannsen (1911: 138) (and others), to\ninsist that evolution proceeded through “considerable,\ndiscontinuous saltations”. Notice, again the separate\ntheoretical genotypes and their contributions, this time to selection\ncoefficients, remain unobserved; the focus of the data analysis could\nbe on differences in the trait, not the mechanisms of trait\ndevelopment. The complexity of developmental mechanisms, which involve\ninteractions with the environment, was collapsed in the models into\nthe selection coefficients modulated by parameters for dominance\nbetween alleles (i.e., variants of a gene) within, and epistasis\nbetween, theoretical genotypes. \nA parallel development, initiated again by Fisher and Wright, as well\nas by J.B.S. Haldane, involved mathematical models of theoretical\ngenotypes at one or a few loci each contributing to the parameters for\nsurviving and leaving offspring. In this field, which came to be known\nas Population Genetics, estimation of selection coefficients of\ngenotypes inferred from distinct phenotypes was possible, albeit more\nreadily when the populations were subject to artificial selection in\nthe laboratory than when frequencies or changes over time were\nobserved in the wild (which was studied in the new field of\necological genetics). Just as in quantitative genetics, the\nfocus in population genetics was on difference in traits;\ncomplexities of development in its ecological context were typically\ncollapsed into the parameters of the models. \nSome Mendelian researchers extended the investigation of the material\nbasis for genes to their role in developmental processes. For example,\nthe eyes of fruit flies, normally red, are sometimes white.\nGeneticists identified the location on the chromosomes that\ncorresponds to the white-eye mutation (Morgan 1919) and later\ninvestigated the pigment-formation metabolic pathway and the enzymes\n(proteins that modulate biochemical interactions) involved as fruit\nfly eyes develop the normal or mutant color (e.g., Beadle &\nEphrussi 1936). Research since World War II that came to be known as\nmolecular genetics or molecular biology went on to\nidentify DNA as the chemical basis of genes and the mechanisms of DNA\nreplication, mutation, transcription to RNA, and translation to\npolypeptides (components of proteins). Researchers probed the feedback\nnetworks that regulate these mechanisms, first in viruses and\nbacteria, then in complex, multicellular organisms; mapped and\nmodified the specific DNA sequence of organisms; compared sequences\namong taxonomic groups (i.e., groups in different branches of\nthe classification of life) so as to assess the degree of genetic\nvariation in populations and to classify taxonomic groups into\nphylogenies; traced where and when in development specific genes are\nactive; and examined the role of DNA sequences not associated with\ngenes (Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Such research, which now occupies\nthe center of biology, renders it plausible to many researchers and\ncommentators that development of traits will eventually be understood\nin terms of a composite of the influences on the organism over time of\nidentified DNA variants (see entry on\n gene). \nJohannsen, as noted earlier (and conveyed in the contrast between the\nmethod of\n figure 2\n and the theory of\n figure 1),\n provided no method to divide a natural varying population into\nphenotypes as classes of organisms, let alone to use these classes to\nidentify genotypes as classes within such populations. What would be\nrequired then in order to apply his terms and distinction in the study\nof heredity for natural varying populations? A number of pathways can\nbe delineated:  \nAs a sociological, not a logical matter, success in engineering may\nunderwrite theoretical generalizing and both may, in turn, make more\nplausible any assumed extension to naturally varying populations.\nTogether with further experiments, these pathways may eventually lead\nto success in re-integration. It could be imagined that the processes\nexposed in controlled conditions would eventually explain heredity in\nnaturally varying populations. This might happen by researchers\nidentifying the material constituents of the genotype passed to the\norganism by its parents and then tracing how all these constituents\ninfluence the development over time of the organism’s traits or\nphenotype—perhaps first in controlled conditions, and then in\nvariable ecological situations (see entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n However, there is no guarantee that the original experimental basis\nfor the genotype-phenotype distinction or subsequent developments must\nlead to effective engineering, theoretical generalization, or likening\nthat clarifies. Indeed, as a sociological not logical matter, pursuing\nsuch steps may distract attention from the project of re-integration.\n Section 5\n reviews what would be entailed in reintegration, doing so in order to\nproblematize the status of the original experimentally based\ndistinction as a basis for the study of heredity for natural varying\npopulations. The rest of section 4 points to several areas of\nphilosophical discussions brought into play and extended by\nexperiments followed by the pathways and steps above. \nThe “New Experimentalism” counters or complicates a\ntraditional emphasis in philosophy of science on theories by studying\nwhat goes on in laboratories, or, more generally, the practical\nmethods of achieving reliable results (see entries on\n experiment in biology\n &\n the structure of scientific theories).\n As noted earlier\n (section 2),\n attention is also warranted to the ways that an area of biology, such\nas the study of heredity, becomes experimental in the first place.\nExperiments in biology may lead to the engineering of new phenomena or\nobjects, such as knockout mice (i.e., a line with a specific gene\ndeactivated), but, at the same time, they leave open the question of\nthe significance of what gets de-emphasized through the control of\nbiological material and conditions employed in the experiments. To\ncontinue the knockout example: does the effect of a gene knocked out\nin a highly inbred line of mice extrapolate to its effects in\nnaturally variable populations of mice, let alone other species? In\nother words, the demonstration of genes in knockout lines that have\ndefined effects could be a textbook case of something\nrepresented—the DNA sequence as gene—warranting the status\nreal given the reliable effect of its absence. Yet\nantirealists could point to what has not yet been observed given the\nspecial experimental conditions of Mendelian research and subsequent\nmolecular biology (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Such an objection notwithstanding, if there is a method that is\nproductive of results, there will be scientists who apply it even if\nthe results do not address questions that once motivated their line of\ninquiry (as evident, for example, when, as noted earlier, the study of\nheredity came to focus on differences not similarity and development).\nHow is any such pragmatism to be viewed?—are experiments in\nbiology like a philosophical pragmatism concerned with truth or one\nconcerned about achieving goals and formulating further goals that can\nbe pursued in practice (see entry on\n pragmatism).\n Or is it a pragmatism highlighted more in sociology than philosophy\nof science, in which the researcher or the interpreter of science\nconsiders how difficult it is in practice to modify what has\nbeen established as knowledge (Latour 1987)? The last sense fits well\nwith this entry’s attention to abstraction in the form of the\nmaterial practices of control over biological\nmaterials and conditions advanced in modern experimental biology and\nagricultural breeding. It should be noted, however, that this form of\nabstraction centers on objects that are concrete, not therefore\nconforming to the contrast abstract versus concrete (see entry on\n abstract objects).\n  \nThe interrelated issues concerning pragmatism, scientific realism, and\nabstraction become even more pertinent when the theory and models that\ninform experiments, such as the genotype-phenotype distinction in\nMendelian research, are extended to less-controlled situations, such\nas agricultural breeding trials, and to analysis of data derived from\nthem. As noted earlier, quantitative genetics relies on models of\ncontributions from unobserved, theoretical genotypes. Analyses of data\nusing those models allow breeders to decide which traits to enhance\nthrough selection even though they have no evidence independent of the\ndata to confirm the assumption in their models about\ntheoretical genotypes and their contributions (Lloyd 1988). Yet, as publications,\ncareers, release of varieties, software packages, and so on get built\non such a foundation, it becomes ever more difficult in practical\nterms for researchers to promote alternatives that do not rest on the\nunobserved and unconfirmed entities and properties. Indeed,\nunconceived alternatives, the possibility that Stanford\n(2006) highlights, may well include theories that entail methods that\nare, for various reasons, impractical. The pragmatic issue of\nneeding a practical method applies in turn to philosophy: When\nphilosophers make distinctions or otherwise point to issues that\nscientists have left unclear or under-examined, by what means do they\nenvisage influencing the scientists to change their views or\npractices? That question is left open by this entry. The\ngenotype-phenotype distinction has been positioned in this entry in\nrelation to control of biological materials and conditions, thus\ndrawing attention to the challenge of reintegrating what had been\nde-emphasized through that control. Yet, no method is provided for\nphilosophers to get the challenge taken up beyond the implication that\nthe description—the framing—would be a helpful starting\npoint. In other words, the entry has positioned the genotype-phenotype\ndistinction in line with the descriptive emphasis in the New\nExperimentalism on scientific practice, a prescriptive\npossibility of reintegration, and an open question about the method\nneeded to shift actual practice. (The contrast of descriptive versus\nprescriptive perspectives is explored in Stegenga’s 2009 review\nof Weber’s contribution to philosophy of experimental\nbiology.) \nThe description versus prescription contrast also comes into play in\nrelation to the different kinds of meaning given to the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction. Should philosophers descriptively\ntrace the shifts in meaning from Johannsen to the current day, or\nshould they prescriptively disambiguate different meanings that may\ncoexist among the work of different groups of researchers or even\nwithin a given group (see entry on\n ambiguity)?\n Or should it be simply and descriptively noted that coexisting\nmeanings make the genotype-phenotype distinction a “boundary\nobject” that allows various fields (or “social\nworlds”) to interact even though the fields use the term to\ndifferent ends (Star & Griesemer 1989)? Perhaps the different\nmeanings given to the term serve as a reminder of the disunity of\nscience that follows once rationality and objectivity are seen not as\n“universal or necessary [matters], but local and contingent,\nrelative to scientific interests and purposes” (entry on\n the unity of science;\n Cartwright 1999). Descriptively, philosophers could tease out the\ndifferent, sometimes incommensurable, interests and purposes that make\na line of inquiry rational. Prescriptively, they may highlight where\nthey disagree with a given field’s interests and purposes, but\nthey could also advocate pluralistic acceptance of different sciences\nthat reflect  \nthe complexity of the phenomena under investigation in interaction\nwith the limitations of human cognitive capacities and the variety\nof… pragmatic interests in representations of those phenomena\n \n(The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge; on “pragmatic\ninterests”, see also references on social and economic history\nof heredity at the end of\n section 1).\n However, two other possibilities remain, namely, ambiguity in the use\nof the genotype-phenotype distinction obscures shortcomings in\ntheories and methods and allows the advances in one field (e.g.,\nmolecular genetics) to be seen to render more plausible the\nempirically and conceptually unrelated claims of another (e.g.,\nquantitative genetics) (see sections\n 5.2.1,\n 6.4, and\n 6.5). \nSections\n 2\n and\n 3\n described how the original genotype-phenotype distinction was\noperationalized under special, controlled conditions, namely, the\ngrowing and crossing of inbred lines raised under uniform conditions.\n Section 4\n laid out pathways from the experimentally based distinction:\nreintegrate, engineer, generalize theoretically, liken, and experiment\nmore. Yet biology and philosophy of biology have not emphasized the\nneed to reintegrate what has been abstracted away as a necessary step\nif the genotype-conception of heredity is to be extended beyond those\nspecial conditions (Figures\n 2\n and\n 3)\n and applied to the study of heredity for natural varying populations\n (Figure 1).\n Therefore, to highlight the implications of basing the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction in controlled conditions, this section\nconsiders what control and possible reintegration might entail in the\ndifferent realms reviewed so far. \nFor inbred lines, in contrast to the realm of natural varying\npopulations, the phenotype-as-class is not used to identify the\ngenotype-as-class; indeed it is recognized as a phenotype because the\ngenotype, which is the inbred line, is given. As far as\nJohannsen’s experiments could discern, the\ngenotype-as-material-constituents could be the whole germ cell or\nseed. Reintegration would entail conceptualizing the action of these\nconstituents of the genotype-as-whole-cell and finding methods to\ninvestigate their influence on the development over time of the\norganism’s traits (see entry on\n developmental biology).\n Such a program had proponents, especially in the first half of the\ntwentieth century, but came to be eclipsed by Mendelian genetics and\ndiscounted by historians and philosophers of heredity (Sapp 1987). \nMendelian experiments require further control than for inbred lines,\nbecause the lines have to be raised in uniform conditions, crossed,\nand self-pollinated. Phenotypes can then be used to discriminate among\nmultiple hypotheses about genotypes, where the phenotype is a class of\norganisms that share only some part of the whole set of the\norganisms’ traits and the genotype is a class or organisms that\nhave some part of their germ cells in common. The relevant part of the\ngenotype was shown to be pairs of genes located along chromosomes as\nlong as, given the control entailed by Mendelian experiments, the\nfocus lay on differences in traits, not on how an offspring\ndevelops to have the trait at all. Recall, as Johannsen noted, that\nMendelian experiments are limited in examining the species-typical\naspects of the germ cells and subsequent development. Again, a program\nfor reintegrating what is abstracted away through experimental control\ncan be imagined: researchers identify the material constituents of the\ngenotype and then trace how all these constituents influence the\ndevelopment over time of the species-typical traits. From the\ncomposite of these influences the organism as a structured whole might\nemerge. Two emerging features of the study of heredity, however, work\nagainst such a reintegration program: Heredity, as mentioned earlier,\nhas become equated with the transmission of and cross-generational\npatterns in the differences. That means development became a separate\nand secondary matter (Sapp 1987); analysis of the dynamics of\nspecies-typical development of morphological structure was eclipsed by\ngenetics. \nIt is not strictly correct to assert that Mendelian experiments are\nunable to examine species-typical traits. For example, all individuals\nof all species of the fruit-fly genus Drosophila have exactly three\nsimple light receptors, ocelli, arranged in a symmetrical\ntriangle on the midline of the top of their heads. The simplest\nassumption is that there is no variation in genotypes (in the sense of\nmaterial constituents) that influence this trait and its development\nis resistant to normal environmental disturbance. However, if the\ndevelopment of the fly is sufficiently disturbed, some flies with two\nor fewer ocelli are observed. If those with fewer than three ocelli\nare used as parents for the next generation, they produced more\nabnormal flies than the parental generation. When the process of\nselective breeding from abnormal flies is continued over many\ngenerations, a line of flies is produced that consistently has two\nocelli, even in the absence of any external disturbance of development\n(Maynard Smith & Sondhi 1960). The success of this and other\nselection experiments in the same vein shows that the original\nuniformity of the trait is not an indication that there is uniformity\nin all of the genotypes that may, under certain conditions, influence\nthe trait’s development (Rendel 1967). Any investigation of how\nthe diverse genotypes result in the development of the typical\nthree-ocelli pattern now has to explain the occurrence of the aberrant\npattern as well. \nAlthough Johannsen (1911) gave almost no attention to the dynamics of\ndevelopment, recall (from\n section 2)\n that he wanted the genotype to be seen as a whole and saw no value in\nthe idea that “discrete particles of the chromosomes are\n‘bearers’ of special parts of the whole inheritance in\nquestion” (1911: 131–2). Yet, Mendelian experiments seemed\nto show that the discrete-particles idea was justified.  \nMuch progress in restoring what was abstracted away has come through\nthe productive research program of molecular genetics (as summarized\nat the end of\n section 3).\n This is not to say that any catalog or database of genes and DNA\nvariants for any organism remotely resembles a literal\n“blueprint” or “program” for its\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, with ever-improving knowledge\nabout genetics at the molecular level and technologies to manipulate\nDNA, the field of genetics is now involved, not only in accounting for\nhow one organism differs in a trait from another, but also in\nilluminating the networks of gene activity and feedback (gene\nregulation) and the major branch-points of development of the\norganized structures—biochemical, physiological, and behavioral,\nas well as morphological—which phenotypes-as-traits are variants\nof. Whether this progress eventually leads to an account of the\noperation of the genotype as a whole (or even of some delimited parts\nof the genotype), and then to the species-typical development of\nstructure, remains to be seen (Robert 2004, entry on\n developmental biology).\n The need for such reintegration is, however, often discounted. This\nis evident when, for example, it is assumed that genes descended from\na common ancestor (orthologs) should have the same function\nand influence the same traits across taxonomic groups descended from\nthat ancestor (e.g., PAX6 gene in relation to the eyes of mammals and\nfruit flies). What that assumption overlooks is the possibility that\ntraits depend on the genotype as a whole in the development of the\norganism as a whole and the possibility that a gene may be conserved\nthrough roles that shift in the evolving lineages. \nNotwithstanding the advances of molecular genetics, its methods\ninvolve another significant form of control. The uniform conditions\ntypical in molecular genetics exclude dynamics of development in\necological context, a context, moreover, that the organism, with its\ntraits, helps shape (Gilbert & Epel 2009; Lewontin 1983). It could\nbe imagined that genetic investigations of the hereditary basis of\ntraits—or, at least, of differences among\ntraits—for inbred organisms in tightly controlled situations\nmight permit successful extrapolation to the development of traits in\nan ecological context (as pursued, for example, in investigations of\nstrategies of growth and reproduction over the life course and\nplasticity of traits under environmental variation [“phenotypic\nplasticity”;\n developmental biology]).\n Yet, again, the need for reintegration of these aspects of naturally\nvariable situations may readily get discounted. Consider animal\nexperiments viewed as models for human medicine. Questions are\nroutinely raised about the validity of, say, mice as a model for\nhumans. However, even to speak of “mice” and\n“humans” is an abstraction that discounts the variation\namong mice and the variation among humans. If, instead, the variation\nwere paid attention to, the first step would be to note that highly\nselected strains of laboratory mice are less variable than\nundomesticated populations (Rader 2004) and experiments made on such\nmice involve tightly controlled situations. To what extent, it could\nthen be asked, do experimental observations hold for individuals from\nundomesticated populations raised in varied and far more complex\nsituations? If mechanisms have been exposed using laboratory mice\n(Tabery 2014), to what extent do they depend on the controlled value\nof factors that are not typically enumerated when describing the\nmechanism? Of course, this line of questioning is preempted when\nbiotechnology expands its capacity to control conditions and harness\ngenetically engineered organisms to produce desired products.\n(Biotechnology can be seen as the industrial manifestation of\nanalytic biology, the program that seeks to understand\norganisms by cutting them up into some appropriate small parts.\nRelevant here are the politics, economics, and cultural dimensions of\nthe rise of biotechnology and, before that, genetics itself in the\nareas of agriculture, health, food science, the legal system, and\nmore. All that lies beyond this entry’s scope; see\nMüller-Wille & Brandt 2016.) \nThe use of models in quantitative genetics and population genetics is\nalso based on control of biological materials and conditions. For\nthese fields, as indicated in this section, it is more difficult to\nformulate programs that reintegrate what had been de-emphasized. \nMendelian experiments crossing inbred lines met the goal of Johannsen\n(and biologists following him) of giving repeatable outcomes and\nexposing hidden processes, but quantitative genetics, designed to\nanalyze continuous traits (see sections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4),\n bore an ambiguous relationship with that goal. Models allowed\nbreeders to predict outcomes under different mating designs;\nthe outcomes were not strictly repeatable given that what was\nactually achieved typically varies from what was predicted. Moreover,\nwhile researchers could imagine that the hidden processes\nwere like the theoretical ones in the models, the theoretical\ngenotypes forming the basis for quantitative genetic models were\nunobservable (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Nevertheless, material practices of control of materials and\nconditions ensure that the model-based analyses continue to be useful.\nIn particular, when there are discrepancies between outcomes and\npredictions, which may result from the hidden processes being\nunlike the theoretical ones in the models, breeders can\nalways compensate: they can discard the undesired offspring and breed\nfrom the desired ones. And, as breeding programs are elaborated that\nbuild on the models (e.g., Holland et al. 2003), it becomes ever more\ndifficult in practice to implement data analysis that would build up\nfrom an alternative model (see entry on\n pragmatism\n and\n section 4).\n Note, because quantitative genetics involves statistical analysis of\ndata on continuous traits, it must be possible to analyze the data on\ntrait variation using models that avoid reference to what is\nnot observed (Taylor 2012). However, this possibility has not\nbeen pursued in quantitative genetics (and thus becomes a potential\ncase of Stanford’s [2006] unconceived alternatives mentioned\nearlier). Indeed, the difficulty of applying any alternative to\nquantitative genetic models extends to analysis of data on variation\nin human traits, even though in that realm breeding is not an option\nand control of biological material and conditions is minimal.  \nIf it is difficult in practice to implement breeding programs and data\nanalysis based on models that avoid reference to what is not observed,\nit is difficult to conceive such alternatives without the following\nprescriptive disambiguation. Here a restoration more than a\nreintegration can be entertained, that is, to insist on the\ndistinction between variance in actual observable genotypes and\ngenotypic variance (sometimes shortened to genetic\nvariance, where variance is the statistical measure of variation\nin a given quantity). The latter term stems from breeders using the\nterm genotypic value for the average value of a trait over\nall locations in which they raise or grow the genotype (in the sense\nof classes of individuals related by genealogy from a common ancestor\nor set of ancestors; see\n section 3).\n The variation among these genotypic values is, as shorthand, called\nthe genotypic variance. In other words, the quantity derives from\nstatistical analysis of variation among related and unrelated\nindividuals in their phenotypes (in the sense of observed\ntraits), not in their genotypes (in the sense of DNA). Not\nonly does genotypic variance vary with the mix of genotypes and\nlocations, its statistical estimation does not reference measurable\ngenetic or environmental factors influencing the development of the\ntraits. Unfortunately, it is common for researchers and commentators,\nincluding philosophers, to speak of genotypic or genetic variance in\nterms like the “contribution of genetic differences to observed\ndifferences among individuals” (Plomin et al. 1997: 83) as if\nvariation in traits and variation in genotypes had some obvious\nrelationship. The conflation may derive from quantitative genetic\nmodels being based on genotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes). But\nthose are theoretical genotypes, unobserved and, as noted above, not\nessential to the analysis of trait variation. (To add to the potential\nfor confusion, the technical term for the ratio of the genotypic\nvariance to the total variance observed in the trait in question is\nHeritability, which has no relation to the existence of a connection\nbetween parent and offspring traits through transmission of genes\n[Taylor 2012].) \nTo enhance the disambiguation, Taylor (2012) recommends the use of\nterms familiar in agricultural trials: variety instead of\ngenotype (in the sense of classes of individuals related by genealogy\nfrom a common ancestor or set of ancestors), location instead\nof environment, and trait instead of phenotype (given that\nthis last term implies a connection with a set of genotypes, in the\nsense of pairs of genes). Whether or not the alternatives terms get\nmore widely adopted, once the gap between statistical patterns from\nquantitative genetics and measurable underlying factors is recognized\nand consistently observed, it becomes difficult to follow the\nreasoning of accounts that conflate or slip between the disparate\nmeanings of “genetic”. This difficulty extends to accounts\nof the interaction between genes or genotypes and environment\nthat overlook the distinction, proceeding then as if interaction as\ndefined in quantitative genetic analyses of variation has some\nconceptual or empirical connection with statistical interaction\nbetween measured presence of genes and environmental variables. (It is\nbeyond the scope of this entry to review such accounts by scientists\nor philosophers; see Taylor 2015 as well as discussion in\nSection 6.5 on what the conflation or ambiguity signifies.) \nThere is an alternative to restoration of the distinction between\ngenotypic variance and variation in actual genotypes, which is to\nfocus on the latter. As determining the sequence of DNA at any stretch\nof the genome (i.e., of the genotype-as-material-constituents) has\nbecome routine, Genome-Wide Association (GWA) studies allow estimation\nof the fraction of the variation in the trait that is associated with\nmeasurable genetic variants. (The variants studied are\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], which are not held to be the\nDNA influencing the trait, but simply somewhere close to those factors\non the genome.) It turns out, however, that, even when many genetic\nvariants are examined together, only a small fraction of the variation\nin the trait is associated with—or in statistical terms,\n“accounted for” by—the genetic variants (McCarthy et\nal. 2008). This finding has led to discussions about missing\nheritability (e.g., Manolio et al. 2009). This new heritability\nhas, however, no conceptual or empirical connection with the\nheritability of quantitative genetics. To the extent that the\nadditional ambiguity in use of the term heritability is associated\nwith the unfulfilled expectation that high heritability means genetic\nvariants might account for a large fraction of trait variation, the\nrestoration identified in the previous paragraphs is warranted.  \nOne plausible explanation of the limited success of GWA studies\ndepends on the distinction between genotypic variance and variance in\nactual genotypes being clearly made. Even if the classical\nquantitative genetic heritability is high and similarity between twins\nor a set of close relatives is associated with the similarity of\nyet-to-be-identified genotypes or genetic factors, the factors may\nnot be the same from one set of relatives to the next, or from one\nlocation (environment) to the next. In other words, the\nunderlying factors and the pathways of development that they influence\nmay be heterogeneous. It could be that pairs of alleles, say,\nAAbbcbDDee, subject to a sequence of environmental factors, say,\nFghiJ, are associated, all other things being equal, with the same\noutcomes as alleles aabbCCDDEE subject to a sequence of environmental\nfactors FgHiJ (Taylor 2012). The possibility of heterogeneous factors\nunderlying similarity in traits obviously recedes if the biological\nmaterials and locations are close to the original set of relatives and\nenvironmental factors. The corollary is that, when users of\nquantitative genetic models overlook that possibility, they are, in\neffect, assuming tight control of biological materials and\nconditions. \nSome degree of reintegration of what is unobservable in the classical\nuse of quantitative genetic models has occurred through the technique\nof mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL)—regions of the genome\ncontaining genetic factors associated with variation in a continuously\nvariable trait. Yet QTL mapping has had most success in animal and\nplant varieties that can be replicated and raised in controlled\nconditions; reliable QTL results for human populations are few\n(Majumder & Ghosh 2005; but see the Wellcome Trust Case Control\nConsortium 2007). Indeed, reintegration of the complexities of\ndevelopment in its ecological context, which are collapsed into the\nparameters of the models, remains scarcely developed in quantitative\ngenetics (as evoked for the human case by Turkheimer 2004). \nIn population genetics, the complexities of development in its\necological context are also collapsed into the parameters of the\nmodels, such as the parameters for surviving and leaving offspring.\nNot surprisingly then, the estimation of the selection coefficients of\ngenotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) is more readily done when\nthe populations are subject to artificial selection in the laboratory\nthan when frequencies or changes over time are observed in the wild.\nLewontin (1974a) provides grounds for doubting the likelihood of some\nday restoring what is abstracted away in those selection coefficients.\nMeasurements of selection coefficients and other parameters of the\nmodel are possible, Lewontin concludes, only when a single allelic\nsubstitution is associated with a large difference in the trait, not\nwhen the effects of gene substitutions make only small differences.\nThis led him to remark that: “What we can measure is by\ndefinition uninteresting and what we are interested in is by\ndefinition unmeasurable” (1974a: 23). The problem of relating\npopulation genetic models to observations becomes astronomically worse\nwhen there are multiple, linked loci (1974: 317). He suggests that\npopulation genetics should shift its attention to the selection\ncoefficients for long segments of chromosomes. This program, like\nJohannsen’s wish that the genotype be seen as a whole, has\nscarcely been pursued. Even if it had been, ecological genetic\nanalysis of variation in natural populations, with all its complexity\n(e.g., Clausen et al. 1948), would still be needed to begin to\nreintegrate ecological context into population genetics.  \nThat special experimental conditions are entailed in the original\nformulation of the terms genotype, phenotype, and the distinction\nbetween them also has implications for the issues that might seem to\nhave been settled by the adoption of Johannsen’s\ngenotype-concept of heredity. \nTo the extent that the DNA transmitted to the next generation has been\nshielded from most of the interactions that occur during the\norganism’s lifetime (both within the organism and with the\nenvironment), there is a barrier to “peculiar” traits\n(Johannsen’s label for traits acquired during the specific\ndevelopment of the parents) being passed on to their offspring. (A key\npart of this shielding is the one-way transcription of DNA to RNA\n[which then codes for the amino acids that make up proteins], not, in\ngeneral, transcription in the other direction.) While the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction can be seen to signify the\nexistence of this barrier, there is a long history of researchers\nclaiming to show ways around it. Most notably, the modern science of\nepigenetics, building on ever-increasing information about DNA\nsequences and how genes function, shows how chemicals from outside the\ncell can modify the activity of genes for the rest of an\norganism’s life and sometimes even into subsequent generations\n(Stotz 2006).  \nDevelopmental Systems Theory (Oyama, Griffiths, & Gray 2001),\nEvolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”) (Moczek et\nal. 2015), and a Post-genomic Synthesis in Behavior and Cognition\nResearch (Stotz 2008) also argue for attention to extended\ninheritance, which includes transmission not only of epigenetic\nmodifications, but also of resources outside the organism, such as\nwhen reptiles lay their eggs in places that ensure the right\ntemperature for incubation. This last example also fits under the\nambit of Niche Construction theory (Odling-Smee et al. 2003). This\nfield investigates the significance of organisms shaping the\necological context in which they develop their traits, survive, and\nreproduce, as epitomized by beavers living in the ecosystem of ponds\nformed by the dams that they build and maintain. (Whether or not\nepigenetic and extra-organismal resources have the same causal status\nas genes is a matter of philosophical debate beyond the scope of this\nentry; see Waters 2007; Stotz 2006; Griffiths & Stotz 2013; entry\non\n inheritance systems,\n and\n section 7\n below.) \nBiological evolution, in its most general construal, is modification\nby descent, that is, change over time in frequency of observed traits\nor forms in a population or a taxonomic group derived from a common\nancestor. A narrower definition, however, arose with the rise of a\ngenotypic conception of heredity, namely, only with changes in\nfrequencies of genes is evolution deemed to be happening. The barrier\nto so-called inheritance of acquired characteristics is held to make\nirrelevant any changes in forms without changes in gene frequencies.\nExponents of extended inheritance disagree, including in their\ndefinition of evolution the changes in the developmental system and\nits constructed niche (Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Adjudication of\nthe disagreement comes down, in part, to a matter of quantity: How\nsignificant are resources other than the genotype (in the sense of the\nDNA of the whole genome) in development of traits that influence\nsurvival and reproductive success? Significance may depend on the\nnumber of generations that the resources are transmitted. The\ndisagreement, however, becomes qualitative, even radical, if attention\nis given to the dynamics of development in an ecological context that\nhad been abstracted away in demonstrating the original genotype\nconception of heredity. Reintegrating developmental dynamics entails\nmore than noting the existence of developmental noise, such as when\nDrosophila individuals are not symmetric in the number of bristles on\neach side. The next subsection elaborates. \nSeveral of the programs of reintegration sketched in\n section 5\n rest on the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. An alternative approach is to observe that germ cells\nare organized structures, which means that development is always a\nprocess of further organization emerging from initial organization.\nThat emphasis was evident, not only in developmental mechanics\n(Entwickslungsmechanik), but also in a mid-twentieth century\nform of epigenetics centered on embryological or developmental\npathways. Conrad Waddington, for example, undertook experiments on\nvariation in certain characters that was originally seen only in\nresponse to an environmental stress, e.g., enlarged anal papillae (a\nfleshy protuberance) of Drosophila larvae that arose in\nhigher salt concentrations (Waddington 1959). In populations that had\nbeen selected for that responsiveness, eventually the trait occurred\neven when that stress was withdrawn. Waddington’s interpretation\nis that a genotype (in the sense of a specific set of pairs of genes)\nhad arisen in the population that switched on development of large\npapillae. Presumably, this could happen through reassortment of genes\ninto new genotypes, not a random mutation. An alternative hypothesis,\nwhich places more emphasis on the dynamics of development, is that, if\nmany pathways in a non-inbred population can produce the same response\n(e.g., enlarged anal papillae in response to salt), selection results\nin a population of individuals that have a concentration or redundancy\nof the various pathways. If pathways arise within this\nconcentration where large papillae develop without the salt stress,\nthat is not a logical process to be modeled by population genetic or\nquantitative genetic models, but a contingent outcome of the dynamics\nof development in a realm in which a variety of genotypes can\ninfluence a variety of paths to a trait. In this light, to call traits\nphenotypes, and thus suggest that they have a direct association with\na specific genotype, is to make it more difficult to conceive and\npursue a program of reintegration in which researchers examine cases\nof traits that are acquired as an appropriate response to\nenvironmental condition and then increase in frequency in a\npopulation. Moreover, even if such cases turn out not to be common,\nthey trouble the premise that the individual-to-individual\nbarrier to a trait being transmitted back into the genotype\nbarrier means that acquired characters cannot increase in a\npopulation during evolution. \nThe genotype-phenotype distinction can also signify that the\nsurface—phenotype—is mere appearance; what is underneath\nor inside that surface—the genotype—is what counts. A\nsmall irony, given that the phenotype originated in relation to\ninferring genotypes (in the sense of a class that shared something\nunobservable), is that, to the extent that molecular biology has made\nDNA sequences observable, especially at sites in which the sequences\nvary from one group to another, each genotype (in the sense of a pair\nof genes or DNA sequence) becomes another phenotype (Nachtomy et al.\n2009). During the development of an organism, each of these\ngenotypes-as-phenotypes at time 0 interacts with the rest of the\nphenotype and environmental factors to produce the phenotype at time\n1, 2, and so on. It may well be the case that germ cells arise at some\npoint in the life course that are buffered from most of these\ninteractions. However, with respect to conceptualizing development\nfrom time 0 till death, nothing logically makes the genotype not also\na phenotype. \nIn any case, the view is widespread that what counts is underneath or\ninside. It is evident in the definition of evolution as change in gene\nfrequencies and the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. It can also be seen in many other features of\ndiscourses around heredity, such as the following: \nWith genetics held to get at the fundamental thing that counts in\nheredity, it makes it plausible to take research using methods based\non one kind of meaning of the terms genotype, phenotype, and the\ndistinction between them to affirm research based on another\nmeaning—they are all contributing to an understanding of that\nfundamental something. In this spirit, the ascendance of the\npredominant current meaning—DNA versus traits—has not\nnecessitated rejection or even disambiguation of the other meanings of\nthe terms evident in Johannsen (1911) and that have coexisted\nsince—class, abstraction, or material constituents; whole or\npart; natural units or products of experimental control\n (sections 1–3).\n Not being troubled by the ambiguity of different meanings and methods\nis especially evident when commentators speak of “the\nnature-nurture debate” as if it were unimportant to specify\nwhich nature-nurture science is being debated. In practice, at least\nfive nature-nurture sciences can be readily distinguished (Taylor\n2015): \nThese nature-nurture sciences entail not only different methods but\nalso different control of materials and conditions, so, in practice,\nresults are difficult to translate from one of them to the next.\nDiscussion of the nature-nurture debate (even in critical\naccounts where nature and nurture are said to interact or shape each\nother) signifies, among other things, that the specialness of the\nconditions involved in the original formulation and demonstration of\nthe genotype-phenotype distinction may be overlooked. As a\nconsequence, for example, control of materials and conditions that is\npractical in laboratory and agricultural breeding gets built into\nevolutionary thinking when the latter uses models and terms from\nbreeding as if there were also a selector in naturally variable\npopulations.  \nGranted, as noted earlier, biotechnology has a growing capacity to\ncontrol conditions and harness genetically engineered organisms to\nproduce desired products. However, to the extent that biological\ntheory is still meant to address naturally variable populations, then\nconcepts, methods, and models are needed through which what has been\ncontrolled or de-emphasized might be brought back and\nre-integrated into the scientific accounts. The framing of\nthis entry in terms of control and reintegration has been designed to\ndraw attention to the space around the genotype-phenotype distinction\nthat remains open for conceptual clarification and methodological\nadvances. \nThe introduction noted that, if the genotype-phenotype\nrelationship had been the focus of this entry, more attention\nwould need to be given to philosophical arguments about causality and\nabout abstraction as it relates to causal claims. Yet, realizing any\nof the programs of reintegration mentioned in this entry would entail\nrich causal analyses: networks of gene regulation linked to organized\nstructures that branch into more organized structures, epigenetic\nmodifications during and across lifespans, organisms shaping the\ndynamics of the ecological context in which they develop their traits,\nand frequencies of traits changing in populations over generations.\nThis said, in realms of experimentally controlled biological materials\nand conditions, a simpler sense of causality may seem plausible,\nnamely, a difference that makes a difference (see entry on\n causation and manipulability).\n (The serious debate about whether statistical analysis can\ndistinguish causal from non-causal differences that “make”\na difference should be noted; Hernán et al. 2002.) The\nconnection between an association within some population and causal\nmechanisms is susceptible to disconfirmation by experiments. At the\nsame time, doing such experiments invites scrutiny of the relationship\nof experimentally altered dynamics to the original dynamics that\ngenerated the data that were analyzed to show the original statistical\nassociation (Taylor 2015).  \nMost importantly given the framing of this entry around control and\nreintegration: Any experimental as well as statistical association is\nalso conditional on the subset of the population or species\nstudied and the situations where they are observed (Lewontin 1974b).\nUnderstanding associations and formulating manipulations based on them\nrequires attention to what has been experimentally or, at least,\nstatistically held constant. In other words, in controlled conditions\nthe direction of the arrow labeled identification in Figures\n 2\n and\n 3\n may be reversed and given a causal connotation, but the causality is\nconditional on the factors, including the rest of the organism, held\nconstant. The understanding and manipulations may well extrapolate\nbeyond the original, controlled population and situations (and thus\nmatch the general theory summarized in\n Figure 1),\n but, absent an actual program of reintegration, there is no basis for\nassuming that they will. While Waters (2007), Tabery (2014) and others\nwould give greater status to differences that have actually\nbeen observed to make a difference (Griffiths & Stotz 2013), this\nentry has pointed to the control of biological materials and\nconditions that excludes many factors—genetic as well\nas environmental, structural as well as particulate—from\nbeing seen to make a difference. Ironically, if\nappearances are not to mislead and obscure, or be spun into\nspeculative theories\n (section 2),\n the science of heredity needs methods that bring back what was\nabstracted away under the experimental control that made\nJohannsen’s original genotype-conception meaningful."}]
