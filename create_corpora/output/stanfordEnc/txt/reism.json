The name is derived from\nthe Latin noun res (‘thing’). The interpretation\nof this very rough view depends on how things are understood. Reism\nwas anticipated by many nominalists (that is, philosophers maintaining\nthat only individuals exist) and materialists, particularly by the\nStoics, medieval doctrines of singularia\n(particulars) or Hobbes’ considerations on corpora\n(bodies). Some tenets of reism are to be found in\nLeibniz. Brentano defended reism very strongly in\nhis later philosophy, when he argued against entia rationis\n(objects of thought; he meant by this objects which exist in thought\nalone). Brentano became a reist in about 1904 and attracted to this\nposition some of his younger followers (so-called younger\nBrentanists), like O. Kraus, A. Kastil and G. Katkov. The most\ndeveloped version of reism can be credited to Tadeusz Kotarbiński\n(1886–1981), a Polish philosopher and one of the leading members of\nthe Lvov-Warsaw School. He introduced the term\n‘reism’ to denote the philosophical view that the category\nof things is the sole ontological category. In other words, reism\nreduces all categories to that of things. Yet reists differ in their\nviews about what exactly is included in the category of things. For\nexample, if one takes the Aristotelian table of categories (ten\nrubrics: substance, relation, etc.) the reist would say that\nsubstances interpreted as things are the only existents. Reism also\nhas a semantic dimension, for it recommends that only singular names, that\nis, names referring to concrete things, should be used, and\nabstract words avoided. Eventually, one can use sentences with\nabstract words provided that they have translations into statements\nwith singular terms.\n\n\n\nWhen arguing for reism Brentano was conscious of some related views of\nLeibniz. He even referred to Leibniz’s statements (in Nouveaux\nessais) about the dangers caused by using abstract words.\nBrentano’s reism was an effect of his departure from Aristotelian\nontology. Brentano’s first metaphysics has a rich list of categories,\nincluding substances, modifications, circumstance, etc. Later, he\ndivided being into things and irrealia, and the latter into\nimmanent objects, contents, relations and so-called\ncollectiva. All items belonging to irrealia had the\nstatus of entia rationis (beings in the mind or thought\nobjects). Ultimately, Brentano rejected all entia rationis,\nthat is, intentional objects, immanent objects, states of affairs,\nexistence and non-existence, modalities, relations, probabilities,\nuniversals, Gestalten, time and space, Aristotelian forms, contents of\njudgements, etc.. His final ontological theory was based on the\nequality: being = entia realia = things. According to\nBrentano’s later philosophy, things are concrete (particular)\nentities.  They are fully determined in their properties and are\nextended in time. Brentano distinguished two kinds of things, namely\nbodies (temporal and spatially extended) and souls (only\ntemporal). \n\nBrentano offered some methods on how to speak about entia\nrationis without being committed to their existence. Take the\nsentence: \n\nOne can maintain that (1) refers to an immanent object (sense-data\nin the theory of perception are a good example here). According to\nBrentano, this sentence means: \n\nNow, (2) is about X not about a. Another\ninstructive example concerns universals. Consider: \n\nApparently, it seems to refer to two abstracts, namely Redness and\nColor. However, (3) means that all red things are red, and, by the\nrule of conversion of categorical sentences implies   hence, the ontological commitment of (3) is reducible to\nindividuals (red things). According to Brentano, terms referring to\nentia rationis are actually not expressions functioning as\nnames, but they belong to so-called syncategorematica (or\nsynsemantica), that is, the category of expressions not\nhaving an autonomous meaning, but only a contextual one as for example,\nlogical constants (‘and’, ‘or’,\netc.). Omitting sentences, only names of particulars are categorematic\n(or autosemantic). On the other hand, the nouns used to refer to\nentia rationis are useful because they simplify our\ndiscourse.  Nevertheless, we could live without abstract terms. \n\nBrentano also offered a quite general argument for reism based on the\nidea of intentionality as direction of thinking (and other mental\nacts). According to Brentano, the expression ‘to think’ is\nunivocal in the sense that it always refers to a definite mental act\ndirected to something. Accordingly ‘to think’ always means\n‘to think of something’. This implies that the expression\n‘something’ is univocal too, because there is no generic\nconcept comprising both things and non-things as object to which\nintentional acts refer. This argument assumes that\n‘something’ is co-extensional with ‘being’.\nNow, if ‘being’ is the most general noun, there is no noun\nwhich refers to being and non-being. Hence, if ‘something’\nrefers to a thing at time t, it cannot refer to a non-thing\nat different time. Although Brentano himself considered this argument\nas fully conclusive, it is dubious whether he was right in this\nrespect.  His argument eventually implies that if\n‘something’ refers to the objects a and\nb, both belong to the same ontological category, but not that\nthey are things, at least, in any ordinary sense. Thus, Brentano’s\nargument for reism is at most an argument for a unicategorial ontology,\nthat is, an ontology based on only one kind of object. See section 4\nfor the further discussion. \n\nAlthough Kotarbiński was a philosophical grandson of Brentano\n(via K. Twardowski, a student of the latter), he developed his\nversion of reism independently. This took place in the 1920s. The most\nextensive treatment of Kotarbiński’s reism is to be found in his\nbook Elementy, published in 1929 (in Polish). In general,\nKotarbiński followed Brentano’s criticism of abstract objects.\nKotarbiński worked with a simplified table of ontological\ncategories proposed by W. Wundt at the end of the 19th\ncentury. This table includes: things, states of affairs, relations and\nproperties. Accordingly, Kotarbiński stated reism by two\ntheses: \n\nThe thesis (R1) was supplemented by a closer characterization of\nthings given by \n\nKotarbiński called (R3) “the thesis of pansomatism”\n(pansomatism is derived from the Greek term soma which means\n‘body’; hence, pansomatism claims that every object is a\nbody, assuming that bodies are material). It indicates that reism\ndefined by (R1)–(R3) is a kind of materialism. Kotarbiński\nsometimes used the terms ‘reism’, ‘pansomatism’\nand ‘concretism’ as equivalents. \n\nThe theses (R1)–(R3) concern an ontological dimension of reism\nor ontological reism. However, Kotarbiński’s reism, like\nBrentano’s version of this view, also has a semantic dimension.\nSemantic reism is a theory of language. In particular, it is a theory\nof names. According to this account, names occurring in ordinary\nparlance can be divided into two categories: genuine names and\nnon-genuine names (i.e., apparent names, onomatoids). The former\ncategory is reduced to names of things in the sense of (R1) and\n(R3). Now, onomatoids seem to refer to abstract objects, but that is a\nmistake, because such objects do not exist by standards of\nreism. Kotarbiński supplemented this distinction with a theory of\nsense. Only sentences with genuine names (and logical constants) have\na literal meaning (sense). If a sentence with onomatoids is\nreplaceable by a sentence with genuine names only (call such sentences\n“reistic”), it is meaningful, if not it is\nmeaningless. Consider: \n\nIt contains two apparent names, namely ‘wisdom’ and\n‘property’. Now, according to Kotarbiński, the content\nof (5) can be fully expressed by: \n\nThis sentence does not have any apparent name. On the other hand,\nthe sentence: \n\nis not replaceable by any sentence in which onomatoids are replaced\nby genuine names. At first glance, onomatoids are similar to empty\nnames. Yet there is an important difference between them because\nsentences with empty names are meaningful. For example, \n\ndoes not need to be replaced by a reistic sentence because it is\nitself reistic. Kotarbiński believes that (8) is meaningful,\nunlike (7), and that this shows that sentences with empty names are\nalready reistic, unlike sentences with onomatoids, which are\nmeaningless.  Sentences with apparent names have either\nmeanings via reistic translations or they are meaningless\nstrings of words. Onomatoids are dangerous, because they are sources\nof hypostatisation, which consists in committing abstract objects as\nreally existing, although their existence is apparent only. In\nparticular, hypostatisation is very common in philosophy (see the\nsentence (7) above) and leads, according to Kotarbiński, to\npointless speculations about abstract objects, their kinds, etc.\nTherefore, reism provides a weapon against involving philosophy in\nunending pseudocontroversies. In particular, reism accuses all kinds\nof Platonism to be the source of the hopeless problems and discussions\nthat stem from admitting the existence of beings, like Platonic\nforms. \n\nSome points of Kotarbiński’s reism can be illuminated by\npointing out its connections with Leśniewski’s calculus of names\n(the Leśniewski’s Ontology, LO, for brevity). According to LO, a\nname is an expression which can stand for the variable b in\nthe sentence: \n\n(Leśniewski wanted to have names in the predicative position).\nIt is assumed that the copula ‘is’ has so-called\nfundamental meaning. It is established by the axiom of LO, which is,\nthe conjuction of three following sentences: \n\nThis axiom implies that, in order to be true, any sentence of the form (9) must\nhave a singular name (that is, a name denoting exactly one object) at\nthe place a. Furthermore, the copula ‘is’ is\ndevoid of any temporal or spatial connotations. Any sentence with an\nempty name in the position of a or b is false; thus,\n(8) is false. The sentence,  which is crucial for reism, is true only if the term a is\na name of a particular. Thus, the logical basis of reism implies that\nnames of things are singular. LO justifies also Kotarbiński’s\naccount of common nouns (general names, according to traditional\nlogic) as genuine names. Consider the sentence: \n\nwhere ‘John’ is a proper name, that is, referring to an\nindividual person. The expression ‘sportsman’ should be\ninterpreted as ‘one of the sportsmen’, that is, it refers\nto any individual belonging to the class of sportsmen. It enables the\nreader to see a connection between ‘John’ and\n‘sportsman’ as expressed by: \n\nA further possible step consists in appealing to mereology (i.e.,\nthe theory of parts and wholes) and interpreting the class of sportsmen\nas a collective (mereological) set. On the other hand, LO does not\nmotivate the division of names into genuine names and onomatoids. In\nparticular, Leśniewski himself was not a reist. \n\nKotarbiński argued for reism mostly pragmatically. One of his\narguments (concerning the dangers of hypostatization) has been pointed\nout already. Moreover, Kotarbiński saw reism as a very natural\ninterpretation of natural language. He stressed that concrete terms\nprecede abstract nouns in language acquisition and that only bodies (as\ndefined by (R2), that is, pansomatically) are beings which we encounter\nin our everyday experience. Kotarbiński himself considered the\nabove arguments for reism as sufficient, but he was perfectly conscious\nthat they provide an inductive and partial support for the reistic\nstandpoint. \n\nReism had to meet several serious problems. It was very soon observed\nthat (R2), one of the most important theses of reism, contained\napparent names ‘state of affairs’, ‘relation’\nand ‘property’. Hence, it should be disqualified as\nmeaningless by reistic standards. In order to cope with this\nobjection, Kotarbiński sharply distinguished semantic reism and\nontological reism. He gradually ascribed a greater importance to\nsemantic issues. For example, he was inclined to consider (R2) as a\nstatement about the reistic language, that is, providing the condition\nfor which names are admissible in our language. Another difficult\nproblem came from various special fields and concerned the reistic\ninterpretation of mathematics, logic, semantics, psychology sociology\nand the humanities. How should a reistic interpretation of set theory\nbe presented? Is the concept of meaning explainable reistically? How\nshould psyche, social rules or pieces of art be understood in the\nreistic frameworks? Kotarbiński hoped that mereology would\nprovide a reistic alternative of set theory. He also offered a partial\nsolution to other difficulties, but he finally recognized that the\nsuccesses of reism were very partial. At the last stage,\nKotarbiński considered reism rather as a program than as a theory\nof the world and language.  However, he always stressed that every\nform of progress in reism, even regional or local, is a cognitive\nsuccess, because it introduces a language which is free of the dangers\nthat result from using abstract words. In spite of these difficulties,\nreism attracted many philosophers, mainly in Poland.  Perhaps\nTarski is the most notable example. He expressed sympathy for\nreism and even translated one of Kotarbiński’s papers into\nEnglish, but he used Platonistic methods in his works on the\nfoundations of mathematics. \n\nKotarbiński’s reism has some affinities with logical\nempiricism. Pansomatism is a version of physicalism and semantic reism\nwhich is similar to the formal mode of speech in Carnap’s sense. Although\nKotarbiński’s later formulation of semantic reism was influenced\nby logical empiricism, pansomatism appeared earlier than the Viennese\nphysicalism. There are several similarties between Kotarbiński and\nBrentano, but there are also important differences. For Brentano, an\nobject is what can be presented. This definition of object is\npsychological. Kotarbiński wanted to give an ontological or semantic\n(an object is what is denoted by a genuine name) explanation of the\nconcept of object. For Brentano, ‘to exist’ means ‘to\nexist now’, but for Kotarbiński, existence is free of all\ntemporal connotations. The crucial difference is this: Brentano’s reism\nis dualistic (things are bodies or soul), but Kotarbiński’s reism\nis monistic (only bodies are things). This difference suggests an\ninterpretation of reism. If we add Leibniz to this company, we see that\nhe, Brentano and Kotarbiński share the following thesis: \n\nOn the other hand, the inventory of particulars is different in all\nthree cases. For Leibniz, only spiritual monads exist, for Brentano,\nthere are spiritual souls and material bodies, but for\nKotarbiński, only material bodies occur in the world. Thus, we\nhave one formal ontological thesis (RO) and its three different\nmetaphysical concretisations. Using Kotarbiński’s terms,\nconcretism points out an ontological feature of reism, but pansomatism\nconcerns metaphysical matters. If this is accepted, reism in the sense\nof (RO) becomes a kind of nominalism. Due to its connection with LO, it\nis a fairly strong version of nominalism, probably stronger than any\nother. This is due to the fact that identity is defined in elementary\nOntology, but is not definable in standard first-order logic.","contact.mail":"wolenski@if.uj.edu.pl","contact.domain":"if.uj.edu.pl"}]
