It is usually\ncontrasted with microevolution, or evolutionary change within\npopulations. This customary way of drawing the macro/micro distinction\nis not perfect, however, because species sometimes consist of multiple\npopulations. Some evolutionary processes, such as the spread of a\ntrait from one population to another, might count as within-species\nprocesses but not within-population processes.\n Population genetics (see entry),\n which emerged during the modern synthesis of the early- to\nmid-twentieth century, explains within-population microevolutionary\nchange in terms of\n natural selection,\n genetic drift, mutation, and migration.\n\n\nOne question that looms over philosophical work on macroevolutionary\ntheory is how macroevolution and microevolution are related. One view,\nwhich is closely associated with the modern synthesis, is that\nmacroevolutionary patterns are fully explicable in terms of\nmicroevolutionary processes. On this view, macroevolution is\n“nothing but” successive rounds of microevolution (a\nformulation due to Grantham 2007). Stephen Jay Gould pejoratively\nreferred to this kind of view as “extrapolationism” (Gould\n2002). This issue links up with more general philosophical questions\nabout the potential reduction of higher-level biological phenomena to\nlower levels (Oppenheimer & Putnam 1958; Fodor 1974; Kitcher 1984;\nSarkar 1992, Rosenberg 1997).\n\n\nDuring the paleobiological revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, a number\nof paleontologists sought to establish paleontology’s status as\nan evolutionary discipline, with something to say about evolutionary\ntheory. This shift was reflected in the decision to use the term\n‘paleobiology’ (Sepkoski & Ruse 2009). For some of these\nscientists of the 1970s\nand 1980s, the disciplinary autonomy of paleobiology was closely\nlinked to ideas about macroevolution. As Steven Stanley (1975) put it,\ntheir thought was that macroevolution is “uncoupled” from\nmicroevolution, and that macroevolutionary patterns sometimes require\nexplanation in terms of macro-level processes. One early move in this\ndirection was the construction of the MBL model (Gould, Raup,\nSepkoski, Schopf, and Simberloff 1977), a computer simulation of\nmacroevolutionary processes that explicitly ignored microevolutionary\nfactors such as natural selection (Sepkoski 2012). Today, this\napproach is sometimes known as the “hierarchical\nexpansion” of evolutionary theory, and it remains the focus of\nquite a bit of theoretical work (see, e.g., Eldredge, Pievani,\nSerrelli, & Temkin 2016).\n\n\nSince the 1970s, theorizing about macroevolution has focused on\nseveral important ideas: punctuated equilibria, species selection,\nhierarchical theory, historical contingency, passive vs. driven\nevolutionary trends, major evolutionary transitions, and more recently\nthe zero-force evolutionary law (or ZFEL) defended by McShea\nand Brandon (2010). One philosophical challenge is to understand the\nrelationships among these ideas; another is to work out what they\nmight mean for the relationship between macro- and microevolution.\n\n\nThe fossil record is the chief source of empirical evidence concerning\nmacroevolutionary patterns, and so macroevolutionary theory is closely\nassociated with paleontology. In addition to questions of\nmacroevolutionary theory per se, there are also\nepistemological questions about how paleontologists infer pattern from\nprocess, and how they correct for biases in the fossil data (Bokulich\nforthcoming). In addition, the distinction between macroevolution and\nmicroevolution sometimes mirrors the distinction between paleontology,\nwith its focus on the fossil record, and neontology, with its focus on\nobservable, extant populations. For this reason, metaphysical\nquestions about the relationship between macro- and microevolution are\nsometimes difficult to disentangle from epistemological questions\nabout what sorts of things can be inferred from different evidence\nbases.\n\nThe classic paper on punctuated equilibria (PE) was co-authored by\nNiles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (1972), although Eldredge (1971)\nwas originally responsible for the idea. Their (1972) presentation of\nPE draws heavily on themes from Thomas Kuhn’s (1962) work, as\nthey present PE as a new paradigm to rival traditional Darwinian\ngradualism (Turner 2011b: chapter 2). Far from challenging the modern\nsynthesis in that early work, they present PE as a straightforward\nconsequence of allopatric speciation (speciation driven by isolating\ngeographic change). Eldredge and Gould reasoned that if speciation\nwere typically allopatric, then it would tend to happen fairly rapidly\nin geological terms, and new species would be geographically distant\nfrom parent species. Consequently, in the fossil record, one should\nnot expect to see very many cases where a fossil series documents a\nclear and gradual transition from one species to another. Eldredge and\nGould also argued that most morphological change occurs in\n(geologically) rapid spurts during speciation events and that new\nspecies, once they arise, typically exhibit stasis. \nWhen Eldredge and Gould (1972) introduced punctuated equilibria, the\nreceived view of expected morphological change via evolution was that\nof phyletic gradualism. This is a notion that can be traced all the\nway from Darwin’s Origin of Species to, for instance,\nSimpson (1970). In accepting phyletic gradualism, paleontologists had\nlong had to accept that the incompleteness of the fossil record was\nsignificantly responsible for the lack of (ideally expected)\ngeological documentation of gradual transformation in the majority of\nfossilized speciation events. What Eldredge and Gould uniquely\nrealized, however, was that the expectation of phyletic gradualism\nclashed not only with what the fossil record actually showed, but also\nwith what the dominant model of (allopatric) speciation predicted. So\nthey developed PE: an alternative view of morphological evolution (and\nstasis) intended to synthesize what allopatric speciation projected\nwith what the fossil record depicted. \nIn the Origin of Species, Darwin had attributed the lack of\nfossil series exhibiting gradual morphological transition to the\nincompleteness of the fossil record. He thought of speciation and\nmorphological evolution as gradual processes (though he did\nacknowledge variation in evolutionary rates), and thought that they\noften happen under the geological radar. As he put it: “Nature\nmay almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of\nher transitional or linking forms” (Darwin 1859 [1964: 292]).\nEldredge and Gould were, in contrast, proposing that the fossil record\nis more complete than it seems, and that we should take the rapid\nappearance of new species more or less at face value. As they\neventually put it, in designing the theory of punctuated equilibrium\nthey were “hoping to validate our profession’s primary\ndata as signal rather than void” (Gould & Eldredge 1993:\n223). One epistemological issue in play here is whether the absence of\nevidence—in this case, the absence of evidence of gradual\nevolutionary change—is really evidence of absence (Sober 2009;\nCurrie & Turner 2017). \nThe ensuing debate about punctuated equilibria proved to be complex\nand contentious. Gould, in particular, made increasingly bold and\ncontroversial claims on behalf of PE during the 1980s, and he tended\nto see PE as the opening wedge for a more ambitious critique of the\nmodern synthesis. Notoriously, Gould also flirted with non-Darwinian\naccounts of speciation, such as Richard Goldschmidt’s (1940)\nidea that new species arise from “hopeful monsters” (Gould\n1977). The stasis claim of PE was also controversial, especially since\nGould took it to mean that cumulative, directional natural selection\nis a less significant factor in evolution than many had thought. The\nreasoning was that if directional natural selection were the dominant\ndriver of evolutionary change, then you would not expect to see such\nclear patterns of stasis in the fossil record. PE elicited a great\ndeal of opposition from biologists and philosophers who were more\ncommitted to a selectionist picture of evolution (Dawkins 1986;\nDennett 1995; and see Sterelny 2001a for a useful guide to the\ncontroversy). \nIn the meantime, PE also inspired new empirical research in\npaleontology, with scientists doing statistical analysis of large\nfossil samples to try to assess the relative importance of stasis vs.\ngradual directional change. This research continues to get more\nsophisticated, and as it happens, PE has fared reasonably well,\nempirically (J. Jackson & Cheetham 1999; Hunt 2007; Uyeda, Hansen,\nArnold, & Pienaar 2011). \nOne other philosophical issue raised by PE concerns the explanation of\nevolutionary stasis (Turner 2017). Eldredge and Gould never really\noffered a very clear account of the mechanism(s) that could maintain\nstasis, a fact that critics often seized upon (e.g., Coyne &\nCharlesworth 1996). They did propose that species might be homeostatic\nsystems. To make matters worse, there is a mismatch between the fossil\nevidence (where stasis is common) and studies of extant populations\nthat show lots of directional evolutionary change (Price, Grant,\nGibbs, & Boag 1984; Endler 1986; Lenski & Travisano 1994;\nHarshman & Hoffmann 2000), a puzzle sometimes called the\n“paradox of stasis” (Hendry 2007). Many evolutionary\nbiologists (e.g. Estes and Arnold 2007) are quick to attribute stasis\nat larger scales to well-known processes such as stabilizing selection\nand/or habitat tracking, but Kaplan (2009) raises some critical\nquestions about that move. And Sterelny (2001b) has pointed out that\ncases of “coordinated stasis” in the fossil record pose\nspecial explanatory challenges. Coordinated stasis is a pattern where\na whole ecological assemblage seems to persist without change for\nmillions of years. Stasis, the idea at the heart of PE, remains an\nissue of considerable theoretical and empirical interest in\npaleontology (Lidgard & Hopkins 2015; Lidgard & Love\n2018). \nIf punctuated equilibria (PE) was the first innovative idea about\nmacroevolution to emerge during the 1970s, species selection followed\nclose on its heels. Just how the two ideas are related is itself a\ntopic of some philosophical interest (Turner 2010). According to\nEldredge and Gould (1972), driven or directional change is\nonly part of the theoretical story about the evolution of morphology;\nit is not, perhaps, even a geologically common narrative. Directional\nselection is selection that changes a population, pushing its\ndistribution of traits from one pattern of trait expression to\nanother. More typical, according the Eldredge and Gould, are cases of\neither non-directional change or even stasis. Like\ndirectional selection, nondirectional selection also changes a\npopulation, but not towards any particular distribution of\ntraits—it just moves a population from one pattern to another.\nStabilizing selection is selection that keeps a population the same,\nnudging it back to its trait distribution pattern whenever it starts\nto stray away. PE as originally formulated favors stabilizing\nselection, suggesting that both individuals and species are inherently\nstable homeostatic systems—systems that are “amazingly\nwell-buffered to resist change and maintain stability in the face of\ndisturbing influences” (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 114). On this\nview, whatever the mechanisms that “resist change and maintain\nstability” are, they are in conflict with and must be overcome\nby directional natural selection in order for natural selection to\nsuccessfully push for or “force” directional change.\nWhether natural selection is properly thought of as a force is itself\nan interesting philosophical issue (Sober 1984; Walsh 2000; Matthen\n& Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Bouchard &\nRosenberg 2004; Stephens 2004; Brandon 2006; Millstein 2006; Filler\n2009). Setting that question aside, however, allows us to consider the\nsuggestion that species might be homeostatic systems which\n“resist change by self-regulation” (Eldredge & Gould\n1972: 114)—as this is a suggestion rife with implications for\nmacroevolutionary theory. \nAt first, the idea that species are homeostatic systems may have been\na way of addressing critics of PE, who wondered what sort of\nbiological mechanisms could maintain stasis over long stretches of\ngeological time. However, it is a short step from thinking of species\nas homeostatic systems to thinking of them as the sort of thing that\ncould be a unit of selection. Eldredge and Gould thought that\nvariation introduced amongst organisms is typically isolated within\nthe population and constrained by stabilizing selection, unless\ngeographic separation creates the conditions for rapid evolutionary\nchange. During allopatric speciation events, the adaptive forces\nnegate the stabilizing ones effectively enough to disrupt the stasis\nof the species and cause the formation of a new lineage. Eventually\nthough, the stabilizing forces (re)assert themselves upon the emergent\nspecies and (re)establish stasis. Most biologists think of stabilizing\nselection as an ordinary microevolutionary process (Schmalhausen\n1949); however, the suggestion that a species is a homeostatic system\nmakes it look like some form of stabilizing selection might be\noperating (in some sense) as a mechanism that maintains equilibrium at\nthe level of populations. \nWhen modeling how these interactions generate macroevolutionary\npatterns, PE presents the dominant (i.e., equilibrium) state as one of\npopulation-level morphological stasis—a state in which\nspeciation attempts often occur but generally fail to take. These\nperiods of stasis are occasionally interrupted (i.e., punctuated) by\nperiods of population-level morphological change—periods of\nsuccessful speciation. This bifurcated model (depicting states of both\nstasis and change) is one in which species behave a little bit like\norganisms: speciation begins to look like reproduction, and extinction\nbegins to look like death. Crucial to this picture is the claim that\nonce a new species comes into existence, it mostly exhibits stasis.\nThe analogy is by no means perfect (Havstad 2016 in Other Internet\nResources), but it did open up a new field of theoretical exploration.\nWhat if the differential speciation and extinction of whole lineages\nis a lot like the differential survival and reproduction of\nindividuals in a population? PE may not logically imply species\nselection, but it does point in that direction by suggesting that\nspecies resemble organisms in relevant ways—for instance, by\nhaving comparable integration and cohesion, enough for populations to\nblock directional change in favor of stasis. \nInitially, Eldredge and Gould (1972) were quite explicit that they did\nnot see their model as entailing a new type of selection. They\nstraightforwardly wrote “we postulate no ‘new’ type\nof selection” (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 112). But in 1975, the\npaleontologist and evolutionary theorist Steven M. Stanley dubbed\nEldredge and Gould’s population-level selection process a form\nof species selection, and by 1977 the inventors of PE concurred. They\nwrote that they nonetheless understood species selection as\nrepresenting “no more than the operation of natural selection at\nhigher levels” (Gould & Eldredge 1977: 139), but still, this\ninterpretation presents a challenge to one typical way of\ninstantiating the dominant model of natural selection. \nRegarding the dominant model: classically and summarily described (see\nGodfrey-Smith 2007), evolution occurs when individuals in a population\naccumulate a change to the degree that this change becomes a feature\nin the population. On this view, natural selection requires variation,\nfitness, and heritability (Lewontin 1970; though see Brandon 1990).\nWhen all three of these things coincide within populations, and change\nresultantly accumulates, evolution occurs. Proponents of species\nselection argue that these three conditions are met at the species\nlevel. \nBut on a typical way of instantiating this rather abstract model of\nnatural selection, one can identify what plays the role of the\nindividuals in this model (organisms) and what plays the role of the\npopulations (species). This popular view treats organisms as the units\nof selection and species as the units of evolution. Species evolve,\nowing to the differential survival and reproduction of organisms. This\nemphasis on organism-level selection and species-level evolution is\nanother which dates back to Darwin’s Origin of Species,\nalthough Darwin also countenanced family selection (Darwin 1859),\nsexual selection (Darwin 1871) and group selection (Stauffer 1975).\nSome early proponents of the modern synthesis (e.g., Mayr 1942, 2001)\nalso shared this basic picture in which selection acts on organisms,\nwhile species evolve. To propose that selection occurs at the level of\nspecies as opposed to that of organisms, is to suppose that not only\ncan organisms act as the units of selection but that species can\ntoo. \nSo, if the proper way to understand natural selection casts organisms\nas the units of selection, and species as the unit of evolution, then\nGould and Eldredge’s model of PE challenges that view.\nAlternatively, if the proper way to understand natural selection\nmerely names biological individuals as the units of selection and\nbiological populations as the unit of evolution, and species can be\nbiological individuals too, then Gould and Eldredge’s model of\nPE is not really a challenge to the model of natural selection, it is\njust a new instance of it. This is because the notion of\n biological individual (see entry)\n is more expansive than that of biological organism; biological\nindividuals include but are not limited to biological organisms.\nBiofilms, coral reefs, insect colonies, obligate symbionts,\nsiphonophores, slime molds, and viruses are just a few of the many\nbiological entities that we might want to consider as individuals,\nalthough they are not organisms (see Buss 1983; J. Wilson 1999; Clarke\n2010, 2013; and R.A. Wilson & Barker 2013, among others). If\nspecies are themselves individuals (Ghiselin 1974; Hull 1976), then\nthe traditional evolutionary theorist may be able to accommodate\nspecies-level selection—in this sense, it is just another flavor\nof individual-level selection. Note that is it is very easy for this\ndispute to become an instance of what the philosopher John Beatty\n(1997) calls a “relative significance” debate—one in\nwhich proponents move from arguing about whether something is possible\n(species acting as the unit of selection) to whether that thing is\nsignificant (as opposed to a mere oddity). \nMany of these issues—such as how to understand stabilizing\nmechanisms and selection, what biological individuals are, whether\nspecies are individuals, and whether species-level selection is\nreducible to individual-level selection—are ongoing. In the\ndecades since Eldredge and Gould first outlined the theory of\npunctuated equilibria, various biological theorists have attempted to\nprovide definitive and irreducible examples of species-level\nselection—ones that cannot be recreated at lower levels such as\nthat of the organism. Species-level traits like range size (where a\nspecies may be wide-ranging even though its organisms are not; see\nJablonski 1987) and rate of speciation (where a species may be slow to\n“reproduce” although its organisms are not; see Vrba 1987)\nare especially promising candidates. In addition to the issue of\nproviding definitive examples of irreducible species selection, there\nis also the issue of providing a satisfactory definition of the\nconcept itself. The biologist Elisabeth Vrba (1984) posits that all\nproposed definitions of species selection ought to identify causes, be\nrestricted enough for testing, and employ a concept of selection that\nis consistent with how selection is understood to act at other levels\nas well. See Vrba (1984), Cracraft (1985), Grantham (1995), Jablonski\n(2008), and Turner (2011b: chapters 4 and 5) for further discussion of\nspecies selection. \nIt is worth noting that several discussions of species selection\npre-date Eldredge and Gould’s (1972) proposal (e.g., Fisher\n1929, Wright 1956; Lewontin 1970). However, it is the ensuing\ndiscussion of stabilizing selection prompted by PE—in\ncombination with a contemporaneous uptick in discussion of kin\nselection, group selection, and altruism (Haldane 1932; Wright 1945;\nWynne-Edwards 1962; Hamilton 1963; Maynard Smith 1964; Boorman &\nLevitt 1973; E.O. Wilson 1973; Levin & Kilmer 1974; D.S. Wilson\n1975; Wade 1978)—which transforms these macroevolutionary sparks\ninto an ongoing, hierarchical conflagration (see Gould 1980b, 1982,\n2002; Vrba & Eldredge 1984; Cracraft 1985; Eldredge 1985; Grantham\n1995; and Eldredge, Pievani, Serrelli, & Temkin 2016, among\nothers). Indeed, some theorists see the paleobiological revolution as\ncontributing to a “hierarchical expansion” of evolutionary\ntheory. \nEvolutionary theorists often distinguish between the unit of selection\n(Williams 1966; Franklin & Lewontin 1970; Lewontin 1970) and the\nunit of evolution (Williams 1966; Hull 1978; Ereshefsky 1991).\nExpanding the category of what can act as a unit of selection leads\ndirectly into a corresponding expansion of what can act as a unit of\nevolution. This is how a hierarchical theory of evolution is\ntheoretically generated: when theoreticians consider not just\norganisms or individuals as the\n unit of selection (see entry)\n but also species and (kin) groups, and genes (for instance), they are\nalso and correspondingly considering not just species or populations\nas the unit of evolution but also clades, and cultures, and cells or\nperhaps organisms (respectively). Each proposed unit of selection\nincurs another, higher-level candidate for the unit of evolution.\nHierarchical evolutionary theory is just the name for theories of\nevolution that admit of different units of selection and evolution\nthan that of (merely and respectively) organisms or individuals and\nspecies or populations. Hierarchical theorists see evolutionary\nprocesses (especially selection processes) unfolding simultaneously at\ndifferent biological levels and temporal scales. \nHierarchical thinking about evolution is perhaps best illustrated with\nan example. It has already been noted that one way of explaining\nmorphological stasis is stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection\nis a well-understood Darwinian mechanism that operates on organisms in\na population. Here, organisms are the units of selection while species\nare the units of evolution. But Sheldon (1996) introduced another\npotential explanation of stasis, which he called the “plus\nça change” model. Sheldon observed that in times of\nenvironmental turmoil, ecological generalists usually have lower\nextinction risk, while ecological specialists are more prone to\nextinction. Perhaps surprisingly, then, a pattern of stasis in the\nfossil record might be due to the persistence of ecological\ngeneralists during times of environmental upheaval. This model appeals\nto species selection, or to the differential extinction and\npersistence of whole species, rather than to stabilizing selection\nprocesses occurring within those species. Hierarchical theorists hold\nthat evolutionary patterns (like stasis) can be generated and\nsustained by processes operating at different biological levels. \nAltogether, hierarchical evolutionary theory is potentially inclusive\nof macroevolutionary processes (such as species selection), along with\nparadigmatic microevolutionary processes (such as organism-level\nselection), sub-microevolutionary processes (such as genic selection),\nand even super-macroevolutionary processes (like clade selection).\nLewontin (1970) considers the possibility of the following acting as\nunits of selection: molecules, cell organelles, cells themselves,\ngametes, individuals (this is the term he uses), kin groups,\npopulations, species, communities of species, and phyla. Williams\n(1966) and Dawkins (1976) are often credited with developing the\nnotion of genic selectionism.  Debate over genic selectionism—a\ntheory within which genes are both the units of heredity and the units\nof selection—has led to further philosophical discussion\nregarding what counts as a replicator as opposed to an interactor\n(Hull 1980; Brandon 1988, 1990; Lloyd 1988; Griffiths & Gray 1994,\n1997; Sterelny 1996; Sterelny, Smith, & Dickison 1996;\nGodfrey-Smith 2000; Griesemer 2000; Nanay 2002).  Various biologists\n(e.g., Mayr 1963; Gould 1980a; Lewontin 1991) have ardently disputed\nthe claim that genes act as direct targets of selection. Philosophers\nof biology have taken positions both pro (e.g., Sterelny & Kitcher\n1988; Waters 1991) and con (e.g., Sober & D.S. Wilson 1994; Lloyd\n2005) on the topic of genic selectionism. \nPhilosophical discussions of genic selection, clade selection, other\nunits of selection, and the hierarchical theory of evolution are\nextensive and ongoing (in addition to works already cited, see Wimsatt\n1980; Kitcher, Sterelny, & Waters 1990; Sober 1990; Godfrey-Smith\n& Lewontin 1993; Stanford 2001; Glennan 2002; R.A. Wilson 2003;\nWalsh 2004; Waters 2005; and Okasha 2006, among others). Another\ninteresting, relatively recent, and somewhat related development is\nthe proposal of a further, even-more-extended evolutionary synthesis,\nor EES (Jablonka & Lamb 2005; Pigliucci & Müller 2010;\nLaland et al. 2014; though see Wray et al. 2014). Proponents of EES\ncontend that phenomena such as developmental bias (Arthur 2004), niche\nconstruction (Odling-Smee, Laland, and Feldman 2003), phenotypic\nplasticity (West-Eberhard 2003), and non-genetic inheritance processes\nlike social learning and cultural transmission (Hoppitt & Laland\n2013) challenge evolutionary theory as standardly understood.\nOpponents contend that the now-traditional theoretical framework\nconstructed via the modern synthesis can accommodate all these\nphenomena and more. See Pigliucci and Finkelman (2014) for a\ndiscussion of the philosophical implications of the EES debate. \nOne meta-scientific issue raised by these macroevolutionary disputes\nis just how much a scientific theory can flex and change before it\neither becomes a different theory altogether, or it becomes a bad\nscientific theory (via too much of what Popper [1974] would call\nad hoc revisionism). \nAs an illustrative example, consider punctuated equilibrium, which has\ncertainty been articulated in many and varying ways. The two initial\npublications by Eldredge (1971) and Eldredge and Gould (1972) are\nundoubtedly the founding ones, but there are other crucial moments in\nthe development of the theory (e.g., Gould & Eldredge 1977, 1983,\n1986, 1993; Eldredge & Gould 1988; Gould 2002). At times the\nshifting nature of PE has been a target of criticism (e.g., Levinton\n1986; Coyne & Charlesworth 1997; see Eckhardt 1986 for a\nparticularly entertaining visit from “the shade of Francis\nGalton”). \nAnother dynamic theoretical dimension of PE, hierarchical theory, and\nthe like is how radically these scientific notions are\nperceived—even by their own creators. In 1982, for instance,\nGould first asked and then answered:  \nWhat would a fully elaborated, hierarchically based evolutionary\ntheory be called? It would neither be Darwinism, as usually\nunderstood, nor a smoothly continuous extension of Darwinism, for it\nviolates directly the fundamental reductionist tradition embodied in\nDarwin’s focus on organisms as units of selection. (1982: 386)\n \nBut in 2002, Gould wrote  \nI do believe that the Darwinian framework, and not just the\nfoundation, persists in the emerging structure of a more adequate\nevolutionary theory. (2002:3)  \nHe devoted much of the extensive efforts of his Structure of\nEvolutionary Theory to defending an interpretation of Darwinian\nevolutionary theory as resting on a revisable “tripod of\nnecessary support” (Gould 2002: 586)—one whose three\ncritical supports were challenged by proposed expansions to\nevolutionary theory, but which nonetheless could be buttressed via\nintegration with these challenges, rather than replacement by them. In\nshort, the later Gould argues that Darwinian evolution traditionally\nemphasizes organismic selection, adaptationism, and extrapolationism;\nthat punctuated equilibria, stabilizing selection, and species\nselection challenge the first of these supports, developmental and\nother constraints challenge the second, and major evolutionary\ntransitions challenge the third; but that all three of these\nchallenges can be accommodated by a revised but still Darwinian\nconception of evolutionary theory. \nNote that efforts to retain (or reject) the Darwinian label show up in\nother contexts as well—for instance, in discussions of\nadaptationism (e.g., Gould & Lewontin 1979) and the neutral theory\nof molecular evolution (Dietrich 1994). Darwin himself declared that\n“He who rejects these views [his] on the nature of the\ngeological record, will rightly reject my whole theory” (1859\n[1964: 342]). Whether or not Darwin’s emphatic claim is correct\nis still an open question. Additional philosophical resources on\ntheoretical and conceptual change in science include but are by no\nmeans limited to Kuhn (1962), LaPorte (2004), and M. Wilson\n(2006). \nFrom October 16th to 19th of 1980, a conference\non the subject of macroevolution was held at the Field Museum of\nNatural History in Chicago, Illinois. Shortly thereafter—in the\nNovember 21, 1980 issue of Science—an exciting report\non some events of the conference was published (Lewin 1980). The\nreport was entitled “Evolutionary Theory under Fire”, and\nit prompted a cascade of responses in the Letters section of\nScience—an exchange of scientific correspondence that\ncontinued for almost two decades. Whatever the motives behind the\nheadlining of the report, it is empirically evident that the chosen\ntitle was inflammatory. \nThe February 21, 1981 issue of Science included no fewer than\n5 separate contributions (in order of printing: Futuyma et al. 1981;\nTempleton & Giddings 1981; Carson 1981; Olson 1981; Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981). The February 4, 1983 issue of Science\ncontained a letter by critics of PE (Schopf & Hoffman 1983) and a\nreply (Gould 1983). In the March 11 issue of that same year both prior\nparties were accused of prolonging a fruitless discussion of a\n“philosophically intractable” and dubious\n“pseudoquestion” (Grant 1983: 1170). In April, one\ncorrespondent wrote in agreement with Grant (Schoch 1983) and another\nchided him for failing “to explore and appreciate the latest\nblooming in the desert of dogma” (Maderson 1983: 360). To put it\nmildly, and purely descriptively: many of the responses elicited by\nthe original report were impassioned and emotive. \nIn the February 14, 1986 issue of Science, the original\nreporter on the macroevolutionary conference fanned the flames with\nanother piece, one entitled “Punctuated Equilibrium is Now Old\nHat” (Lewin 1986). In March, Jeffrey Levinton registered an\nardent objection to Lewin’s characterization of the theory as\nwidely accepted, as well as to PE in general (Levinton 1986). In\nApril, Gould responded (Gould 1986), and in May, Robert Eckhardt\nresponded to Gould’s response (Eckhard 1986). Throughout these\nexchanges and related ones, many interesting meta-scientific charges\nwere laid and lobbed. Questions of “where is the\nevidence?” as well as accusations of dogma, religionism,\nrevisionism, sloganeering, and vagueness abounded. \nSo did references to creationism, specifically. The very first batch\nof letters in response to Lewin’s initial piece included one\nobjecting strongly to the choice of title (Armstrong & Drummond\n1981). The correspondents wrote that “this article is\nundoubtedly destined to enter the out-of-context arsenal that has\nbecome a mainstay of recent creationist literature” (Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981: 774). Incidentally, the correspondents were\ncorrect about this (e.g., Meyer 1994; Parker 2006). \nAnd in the March 10, 1995 issue, a different journalist for\nScience published another piece, this one entitled “Did\nDarwin Get It All Right?” (Kerr 1995). By May 5, a scientist had\nwritten in to protest the use of such an inflammatory headline\n(McInerney 1995), referencing Lewin’s original piece (from\n1980). McInerney wrote that Lewin’s earlier piece had\n“provided a gold mine for subsequent creationist\npropaganda” (1995: 624). He bemoaned the fact that another such\nheadline had just been published by Science, and recommended\nthat “a journal representing some 130,000 scientists be a bit\nmore judicious in its choice of headlines” (1995: 624). \nThese references to a wider social context—the one in which such\nardent macroevolutionary debate is being held—raise interesting\nissues that have perhaps been somewhat neglected by philosophers of\nscience (though see the entry on\n  the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n Do the scientists involved in this dispute, and the\nscientific journalists reporting on it, have a responsibility to\nconsider the (unintended yet foreseeable and potentially avoidable)\nuses to which their headlines might be put (by creationists and other\nparties)? Some scientific correspondents evidently think they do. And\nif such responsibility exists, does it fall upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua scientist—or upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua citizen, or scientist qua educator?\nPhilosophers focusing on the relation between science and value have\ndone some relevant work on questions like these, usually while\nfocusing on other scientific domains—work which could be applied\nto macroevolutionary instances and issues (e.g., Rudner 1953; Hempel\n1960; Longino 1990; Douglas 2000, 2009; Kourany 2010). \nThese are not the only issues of provocative linguistic expression\nawaiting further exploration by philosophers of macroevolution.\nQuestions of what it means to sit “at the high table”\n(Maynard Smith 1984; Sepkoski 2014) or to “replay life’s\ntape” (Gould 1989; Beatty 2006; Sepkoski 2016) are perhaps more\nfamiliar to philosophers of biology, but still worth exploring. \nStephen Jay Gould (1989) famously argued that evolutionary history is\ncontingent. George Gaylord Simpson (1963) foreshadowed that claim when\nhe suggested that paleontology is a distinctively historical science\nthat seeks to understand “configurational change”. Gould\nclaimed that if we could rewind the tape of history to some point in\nthe deep past and play it back again, the outcome would probably be\ndifferent. \nGould’s thinking about contingency has had significant impacts\nin both philosophy and biology. In philosophy, for instance, John\nBeatty (1995) argued that the contingency of evolutionary history\nimplies that there are no distinctively biological laws, an argument\nthat served as a touchstone for much of the subsequent debate about\nlaws in biology (Brandon 1997; Mitchell 1997, 2000, 2002; Sober 1997;\nGiere 1999; Shapiro 2000; Woodward 2000, 2001, 2004; Elgin 2003, 2006;\nand Hamilton 2007; for important precursors to Beatty 1995, see Smart\n1963; Ruse 1970; Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989; and Rosenberg\n1994). More recently, Beatty (2016) has argued that the contingency of\nevolutionary history is closely connected to narrative modes of\nexplanation. His suggestion is that narrative explanations are\nespecially well suited to historically contingent series of events.\nMcConwell (2017) argues that the contingency of evolutionary history\nexplains why we should be pluralists about biological individuality.\nIn biology, on the other hand, Gould’s argument about\ncontingency, particularly his thought experiment concerning rewinding\nand playing back the tape of history, helped to inspire research in\nlong-term experimental evolution (e.g., Travisano, Mangold, Bennett,\n& Lenski 1995). In addition to fueling interest in understanding\nthe Cambrian explosion, Gould’s work also instigated something\nof a backlash from other scientists convinced that selection-driven\nconvergence is the hallmark of evolutionary history (e.g., Conway\nMorris 2003). This debate concerning contingency and convergence\nsometimes also has theological overtones. Conway Morris has at least\nhinted that he sees convergentism about evolution as cohering\nespecially well with theism. This contrasts with Gould’s\nwell-known view that science and religion should be regarded as\n“non-overlapping magisteria” (Gould 1997). \nThere is some question about just what Gould meant by the term\n‘contingency’. Some philosophers read him as meaning that\ndownstream outcomes are sensitive to small changes in upstream\nconditions (Ben-Menahem 1997; Inkpen & Turner 2012). On this\nreading, contingency comes in degrees, and in contrast with historical\ninsensitivity to changes in upstream conditions, which we\ncould think of as historical convergence or robustness. When, for\nexample, Sterelny (1995, crediting F. Jackson & Pettit 1992) talks\nabout “robust process explanations”, he means explanations\nthat show how an outcome would have resulted from a wide range of\nupstream conditions. \nBeatty (2006), however, has shown that there are two different senses\nof ‘contingency’ in play in Gould’s work. In\naddition to what Beatty calls contingency as causal\ndependence—basically, sensitivity to initial\nconditions—there is a second form of contingency that Beatty\ninitially called contingency as unpredictability, but now calls\ncontingency per se (Beatty 2016). These two senses of\ncontingency correspond with two versions of the famous thought\nexperiment that Gould (1989) deployed. Sometimes, Gould imagines\nrewinding the tape of history, tweaking an upstream variable, and then\nplaying the tape back. On other occasions, he talks about playing the\ntape back from the same initial conditions. Beatty (2016) thinks that\nboth senses of ‘contingency’ are important, and he takes\nit that the second sense—contingency per se—must\ncommit us to some sort of causal indeterminism. On the other hand,\nTurner (2011a) has tried to give an account of this second sense of\ncontingency that is neutral with respect to determinism. His\nsuggestion is that what Gould really cared about was random or\nunbiased macroevolutionary sorting. Processes such as coin tosses, or\nrandom genetic drift, can be random or unbiased (in a sense) without\nviolating causal determinism. One way to think about this is by\nadopting a frequentist conception of probability: the outcome of a\ncoin toss could be causally determined by small-scale physical\ninfluences, but the outcome is still random or unbiased in the sense\nthat over a long series of trials, the ratio of heads to tails will\napproximate 50:50. This account is closely allied with\nSepkoski’s (2016) suggestion that Gould’s metaphor of\nreplaying the tape of history was rooted in his work on simulations of\nmacroevolution in the 1970s. Turner (2015) has also argued that there\nis a connection between contingency, thus understood, and the notion\nof a passive evolutionary trend.  \nMcConwell and Currie (2017) have added further complexity to the\ndiscussion by arguing that there is an important difference between\nabstract, source-independent accounts of contingency and\nsource-dependent accounts. The notion of sensitivity to\ninitial conditions is a good example of what they mean by a\nsource-independent account: it gives an abstract characterization of\nhistorical or biological processes without saying what the source of\ncontingency is. Does the source have something to do with genetic\ndrift? With mutational ordering? Or something else entirely? McConwell\nand Currie argue that in order to establish the autonomy of\nmacroevolutionary theory, a source-dependent account is required. \nSome commentators have noted that Gould’s defense of\nevolutionary contingency sits in tension with his arguments, in the\n1970s and early 1980s, for a more “nomothetic”\npaleobiology (e.g., Raup & Gould 1974). A more nomothetic\npaleobiology would seem to place the emphasis on laws and\npredictability. However, contingency is thought by some to mean that\nthere are no distinctively biological laws (Beatty 1995). Haufe (2015)\naddresses this puzzle by arguing that Gould was interested in\ndeveloping a “nomothetic” science of macroevolution\ninvolving generations at large spatial and (especially) temporal\nscales, but that this is compatible with saying that contingency\nreigns at other scales. One other larger theme that may help to unify\nsome of Gould’s thinking is his skepticism about the power of\nnatural selection, which is the classic example of a\nmicro-evolutionary process (see also Gould & Lewontin 1979). One\nway to limit the importance of natural selection is to insist on the\nautonomy of macroevolutionary theory, and to show that natural\nselection is insufficient to explain certain larger scale patterns.\nAnother way is to insist that evolutionary history is contingent,\nsince one would expect selection to produce convergent outcomes. \nThus, philosophers have done a lot of work on challenging conceptual\nquestions about the various senses of ‘contingency’ and\ntheir relationship to other macroevolutionary ideas. One problem\nlurking in the background of this discussion is empirical: how can\nscientists even tell whether evolutionary history is contingent or\n(say) convergent? Conway Morris (2003) assembles a whole catalog of\nexamples of evolutionary convergence in an effort to provide\ncounterevidence against Gould’s contingency thesis. One\nimportant issue here is to find a principled way of distinguishing\ncases of convergent evolution (where unrelated lineages subject to\nsimilar selection pressures evolve similar traits) from parallel\nevolution (where lineages with similar traits to start with follow\nsimilar evolutionary trajectories) (Pearce 2012). Another issue is\nthat one can multiply convergences by giving coarser-grained\ndescriptions of the traits in question—for example, by counting\nagriculture in humans and some ant species as the same trait (Sterelny\n2005). Powell & Mariscal (2015) argue that not all of the putative\nexamples of convergence really tell against the contingency thesis,\nand they try to specify more clearly what would actually count as\nevidence against contingency. \nIn developing his initial claim about evolutionary contingency, Gould\n(1989) made much of the Burgess Shale fauna, exquisite Cambrian\nfossils from western Canada first described by the American\npaleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in the early 1900s. Gould was\nwriting in the wake of what some call the “first\nreclassification” of the Burgess fossils, when work by British\npaleontologist Harry Blackmore Whittington and students Derek Briggs\nand Simon Conway Morris had placed many of the strange forms in their\nown phyla, with the idea that each phylum represented a unique body\nplan. Most of those Burgess phyla went extinct, but some (including a\nlikely ancestor of chordates) persisted. But what if that sorting had\nhappened differently? Since 1989, scientists Graham Budd, Allison\nDaley, and others using cladistic methods of classification (which\nwere slow to be adopted by paleontologists) have reclassified the\nBurgess fauna yet again, placing many of the strangest ones in stem\ngroups of existing clades (such as arthropods). So one further\nphilosophical question is whether and to what extent this change in\ntaxonomic practice matters to the argument that Gould tried to make\nabout contingency (Brysse 2008). \nThere is a closely related debate about the status of phyla. Some\ncladists see phyla as being nothing terribly special. Like any higher\ntaxa, phyla must be monophyletic, but from a cladistic perspective\nthere is nothing about the taxonomic rank of phylum that has any\nparticular importance to macroevolutionary theory. Others have argued\nthat lower ranks like order and class are evolutionarily meaningful in\na way that phyla are not (e.g., Holman 1989). Gould (1989), however,\ndrawing upon German paleontological tradition, saw phyla as\ncorresponding to stable morphological body plans (or\nBaupläne). This connects closely with his argument about\ncontingency: if different Cambrian phyla had persisted, downstream\nevolutionary history would have involved modification of totally\ndifferent body plans. Some scientists have recently tried to revive\nthe idea that there is something special about the role of phyla in\nmacroevolution (Levin, et al. 2016; though see Hejnol & Dunn\n2016). \nFinally, historical contingency is a counterfactual notion, and\nalthough this issue has not gotten as much attention as it deserves,\nthere is a nascent philosophical literature on historical\ncounterfactuals (Tucker 2004: 227ff; Nolan 2013; Radick 2016; Zhao\n2017 in Other Internet Resources). The debate about historical\ncontingency can be construed as a disagreement about the truth of\nvarious historical counterfactuals. Gould claimed that if things in\nthe Cambrian had been slightly different, there would be no\nvertebrates today, let alone humans, while other convergentists claim\nthat humanlike cognitive abilities, language, tool use, and sociality\nwould have evolved even if other things had been different in the\npast—for example, if the non-avian dinosaurs had not gone\nextinct. \nPaleontologists have long been interested in documenting and\nexplaining larger-scale evolutionary trends in the fossil record\n(McShea 1998). Perhaps the classic example of a macroevolutionary\ntrend, and one that paleontologists have studied extensively, is\nCope’s rule of size increase. Paleontologists routinely\ndistinguish within-lineage trends (e.g., average size increase within\na single lineage) from among-lineage trends (e.g., increase in the\naverage size of mammals over the Cenozoic). The latter are\ndistinctively macro-level patterns. While it might be tempting to\nthink that trends such as evolutionary size increase are generally\nattributable to natural selection, Stanley (1973) pointed out that\nthese trends could be merely statistical phenomena. Suppose that a\nclade, such as mammals, starts out at or near a fixed lower boundary\non body size. And suppose that evolutionary size increases and\ndecreases are equally probable. As the clade evolves, the mean body\nsize might do a “random walk” away from the fixed\nboundary—an idea that Gould (1996) later popularlized. Many\nscientists also think of this as a passive diffusion model of\nevolutionary change. \nThe notion of a passive trend is closely related to other themes of\nmacroevolutionary theory. Gould, in particular, was enthusiastic about\nthe possibility that Cope’s rule might be a passive trend. If\nthat were the case, then it would mean that evolutionary size increase\nis not attributable to natural selection. What’s more, if we\nexplain size increase by supposing it to be a passive trend, then the\nexplanation need not reference any micro-level causes. The fixed\nboundary in the state space could be maintained by developmental\nconstraints—another favorite theme of Gould’s. And\nfinally, a trend resulting from a random walk away from a fixed\nboundary would not seem to be progressive at all. To the extent that\nlarger-scale evolutionary trends are passive, chance looks like a more\nsignificant factor in evolutionary history, and selection looks like a\nless significant one. \nMcShea (1994) gave one widely-cited formulation of the distinction\nbetween passive and driven trends, and also suggested several\napproaches for determining, empirically, whether a trend is passive or\ndriven. One such approach is the stable minimum test: track, say, the\nbody size of the smallest members of the clade. If that increases\nsteadily over time, it is a signal that the trend is driven.\nPaleobiologists now routinely try to determine whether trends are\npassive or driven, though this work can sometimes encounter\nunderdetermination issues (Turner 2009). Body size has received a lot\nof empirical attention, in part because it is easy to estimate from\nfragmentary fossil remains, and partly for the simple reason that it\nis a trait that every animal has. \nIn addition to its role in the development of macroevolutionary theory\nand its influence on scientific research, the passive/driven\ndistinction raises a number of philosophical issues. As noted already,\nthe notion of a passive trend links up with a traditional set of\nquestions about the role of chance or randomness in evolution\n(Millstein 2000). Indeed, the passive/driven distinction looks a lot\nlike the distinction between random genetic drift and selection in\npopulation genetics. Drift could be construed as a passive trend in\ngene frequencies. Grantham (1999) argues that the notion of a passive\ntrend points toward a certain sort of explanatory pluralism: a trend\nthat is best explained as a stochastic phenomenon at the macro-level\ncould receive a more deterministic explanation at a lower level, and\nthose explanations need not conflict. Turner (2014) suggests that the\nnotion of a passive trend poses a challenge to popular interventionist\nideas about causal explanation. Explaining a trend by showing that it\nis passive could turn out to be a non-causal explanatory strategy. \nOne issue that remains under-explored, philosophically, is how the\ndistinction between passive vs. driven larger-scale trends might\nintersect with philosophical disagreements about whether neo-Darwinian\nevolutionary theory is best understood as a causal theory (a view\ngiven its canonical formulation by Sober 1984) or a statistical theory\n(Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002). There may be\nsome question about whether it is best to understand the\npassive/driven distinction as a distinction between trends generated\nby different causal mechanisms, vs. a distinction between different\nsorts of statistical phenomena. \nMany paleobiologists have assumed that driven trends must be driven by\nnatural selection. For example, if body size increase is driven,\nsurely that means that larger body size has conferred some survival or\nreproductive advantage (Hone & Benton 2005). McShea (2005) and\nMcShea and Brandon (2010) have forcefully challenged that assumption.\nMcShea (2005) argues that increase in structural complexity is a\ndriven trend, but one that need not be driven by selection. That is\nbecause increasing structural complexity might just be the zero-force\ncondition for evolving systems, an idea that McShea and Brandon (2010)\ndevelop in great detail. McShea and Brandon’s zero-force\nevolutionary law—or ZFEL—has elicited critical\nresponses from other philosophers (Barrett, et al. 2012). Whereas\ntraditional evolutionary thinkers, from Darwin on down, assumed that\nnatural selection would have to explain complexity increase, McShea\nand Brandon see complexity increase as the default expectation, and\nthey invoke selection to explain deviations from that default\nexpectation—such as cases of eye loss in cave-dwelling species.\nThey treat eye loss in cave dwellers as a case where natural selection\nfavors a reduction in structural complexity. Alternatively,\nO’Malley, Wideman, & Ruiz-Trillo (2016) consider the\npotentially wide-ranging and macroevolutionary role of simplification\nin conferring “adaptive” advantage. \nMcShea and Brandon also argue that the ZFEL has the virtue of\ngiving a unified account of both micro- and macro-evolutionary\nphenomena. They invoke the ZFEL to explain a wide variety of\ndifferent patterns, ranging from complexity increase in the history of\nanimal life, as represented by the fossil record, to increasing\ngenomic heterogeneity over time. Whatever one thinks about their claim\nthat the ZFEL is “biology’s first law”,\ntheir project raises a question worth exploring: is it reasonable to\nthink that explanations of macroevolutionary patterns should take\nfundamentally the same form as explanations of patterns at vastly\ndifferent spatiotemporal scales? How much does scale matter? \nThe ZFEL also raises some fundamental philosophical questions\nabout the structure of evolutionary theory. How, for example, should\nwe determine what counts as the default expectation, or zero-force\ncondition, for an evolutionary system (Gouvêa 2015)? Is there\nany way to distinguish empirically between theories that disagree\nabout the default expectation? Is there even a fact of the matter\nabout what the default expectation should be? These questions about\ndefault expectations for evolutionary systems may link up with larger\nquestions about the function of null hypotheses in scientific\nreasoning. These questions about default assumptions in\nmacroevolutionary theory also prompt comparison with questions about,\nfor instance, neutral theory in molecular evolution (Kimura 1983) and\nin community ecology (Hubbell 2006). For relevant philosophical\ndiscussion, see e.g., Dietrich (1994); Bausman and Halina (2018). \nIf one way to think about the larger picture of the history of life on\nEarth is to focus on evolutionary trends (size increase, complexity\nincrease, etc.), another approach is to focus on major transitional\nevents in the history of life (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry\n1995; Szathmáry & Maynard Smith 1995). The point of\ndeparture for most work on major transitions has been Szathmáry\nand Maynard Smith’s (1995: 228) list of game-changing\nalterations in evolutionary history: \nOne of Maynard Smith and Szathmáry’s insights is that the\nvery mechanisms of evolution—the way evolution works—have\nchanged over the course of evolutionary history (Calcott &\nSterelny 2011). \nOne philosophical concern about the theory of major transitions is\nthat the original list was something of a mixed bag (McShea &\nSimpson 2011). For example, some of the transitions, like the\nevolution of eukaryotes and the evolution of multicellularity, seem to\ninvolve jumps in part/whole complexity. But others, like the evolution\nof sexual reproduction, do not. So it is not clear at all that these\nare transitions of the same kind. Indeed, Maynard Smith and\nSzathmáry suggest that the transitions have three features: (1)\nchanges in the way that information is stored and transmitted; (2) new\ndivision of labor; and (3) individuals that could once reproduce\nindependently can no longer do so after the transition. Criterion (3),\nin particular, links the issue of major transitions to the larger\ndebate about the nature of biological individuality. One potential\nproblem, though, is that not all the transitions on the original list\nsatisfy all three criteria. For example, the shift from primate\nsocieties to human societies clearly involves (1) and (2), but not\n(3). To complicate things further, Szathmáry (2015) revisits\nthe original list of transitions and proposes some changes. \nRelated to this worry that the major transitions do not comprise a\nunified type of evolutionary event, some theorists (e.g.,\nO’Malley 2014) argue that other significant events should be\ncount as major transitions. O’Malley & Powell (2016) think\nthat the biological oxygenation of Earth is a major transition, and\nCurrie (forthcoming) makes the case for treating mass extinctions as major\ntransitions. \nA second philosophical concern is that Maynard Smith and\nSzathmáry’s original idea looks a bit teleological, and\nin a way that likely raises the hackles of some scientists and\nphilosophers (e.g., Dawkins 1986; Dennett 1995). The transitions in\nSzathmáry and Maynard Smith’s (1995) list all seem like\nnecessary steps on the way to the evolution of humans, and cynically,\none might wonder if their relation to the later appearance of humans\nis what makes the transitions “major”. Relatedly, one\nmight wonder if the idea of major transitions comes a little too close\nto reviving pre-evolutionary thinking about the great chain of being.\nThis also connects with traditional questions about evolutionary\nprogress (Ruse 1997). While some of the concepts surveyed in this\nentry—especially passive trends and historical\ncontingency—might seem like threats to the belief in\nevolutionary progress, the theory of major transitions coheres well\nwith progressivist views about evolution. \nIn spite of these potential concerns, however, the major transitions\nreally are historical events that pose distinct explanatory\nchallenges. Arguably, our picture of macroevolution will not be\nentirely complete without tackling some of those challenges. \nIt is noteworthy that neither Maynard Smith nor Szathmáry are\npaleontologists, and so there may be a bit of a disconnect between\ntheir original proposal and the way that many paleontologists have\ncome to think about major transitions. Several of the transitions from\nthe original list must have occurred way back in the deep past; the\nfossil record is not likely to give us much insight into the origin of\neukaryotes, for instance. Molecular tools may be able to shed some\nlight on macroevolutionary queries about the deep past, however\n(O’Malley 2016). And paleontologists sometimes take a much\nbroader (and looser) view of major transitions, such that any major\nevolutionary novelty would count as a major transition. For instance,\nthe evolution of placentation in mammals, or the evolution of feathers\nin archosaurs, might count as major transitions on this broader view.\nCurrie (forthcoming) draws a distinction between theory-driven\napproaches to major transitions and phenomena-driven approaches.\nPaleontologists tend to fall in the latter camp, since they usually\nbegin by thinking about major morphological or phenotypic changes that\nshow up in the fossil record. \nOne significant and remaining challenge in the philosophy of\nmacroevolution is to work out how the various ideas about\nmacroevolution surveyed above may or may not fit together. What\nexactly is the relationship between punctuated equilibria and species\nselection? Or between PE and the major transitions? Or between species\nselection and historical contingency? Or between contingency and the\nmajor transitions? Do (some, all of) these ideas weave together to\nform a unified picture of evolution at large scales? Or do they\nrepresent something more like a heterogeneous grab bag of scientific\nideas that are more or less useful in different contexts? A further\nquestion is how the relative (dis)unity of macroevolutionary theory\nmight bear on the longstanding question of how macroevolution is\nrelated to microevolution. \nFinally, the investigation of macroevolution challenges the purported\ndistinction between the experimental and historical sciences (Sober\n1993; Cleland 2001). Investigation in this domain is historical and\noften emphasizes the deep past, to be sure, but it also involves\ntheoretical and prospective modeling, making predictions about what\nthe models will or will not find, making predictions about what\npaleontologists will or will not find, running bottle and other kinds\nof experiments, simulations, and more. The scientific study of\nmacroevolution is a philosophically rich and challenging field with\nmany deposits to mine.","contact.mail":"derek.turner@conncoll.edu","contact.domain":"conncoll.edu"},{"date.published":"2019-06-03","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/macroevolution/","author1":"Derek Turner","author1.info":"http://www.derekdturner.com","author2.info":"http://www.joycehavstad.com","entry":"macroevolution","body.text":"\n\n\nMacroevolution refers (most of the time, in practice) to evolutionary\npatterns and processes above the species level. It is usually\ncontrasted with microevolution, or evolutionary change within\npopulations. This customary way of drawing the macro/micro distinction\nis not perfect, however, because species sometimes consist of multiple\npopulations. Some evolutionary processes, such as the spread of a\ntrait from one population to another, might count as within-species\nprocesses but not within-population processes.\n Population genetics (see entry),\n which emerged during the modern synthesis of the early- to\nmid-twentieth century, explains within-population microevolutionary\nchange in terms of\n natural selection,\n genetic drift, mutation, and migration.\n\n\nOne question that looms over philosophical work on macroevolutionary\ntheory is how macroevolution and microevolution are related. One view,\nwhich is closely associated with the modern synthesis, is that\nmacroevolutionary patterns are fully explicable in terms of\nmicroevolutionary processes. On this view, macroevolution is\n“nothing but” successive rounds of microevolution (a\nformulation due to Grantham 2007). Stephen Jay Gould pejoratively\nreferred to this kind of view as “extrapolationism” (Gould\n2002). This issue links up with more general philosophical questions\nabout the potential reduction of higher-level biological phenomena to\nlower levels (Oppenheimer & Putnam 1958; Fodor 1974; Kitcher 1984;\nSarkar 1992, Rosenberg 1997).\n\n\nDuring the paleobiological revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, a number\nof paleontologists sought to establish paleontology’s status as\nan evolutionary discipline, with something to say about evolutionary\ntheory. This shift was reflected in the decision to use the term\n‘paleobiology’ (Sepkoski & Ruse 2009). For some of these\nscientists of the 1970s\nand 1980s, the disciplinary autonomy of paleobiology was closely\nlinked to ideas about macroevolution. As Steven Stanley (1975) put it,\ntheir thought was that macroevolution is “uncoupled” from\nmicroevolution, and that macroevolutionary patterns sometimes require\nexplanation in terms of macro-level processes. One early move in this\ndirection was the construction of the MBL model (Gould, Raup,\nSepkoski, Schopf, and Simberloff 1977), a computer simulation of\nmacroevolutionary processes that explicitly ignored microevolutionary\nfactors such as natural selection (Sepkoski 2012). Today, this\napproach is sometimes known as the “hierarchical\nexpansion” of evolutionary theory, and it remains the focus of\nquite a bit of theoretical work (see, e.g., Eldredge, Pievani,\nSerrelli, & Temkin 2016).\n\n\nSince the 1970s, theorizing about macroevolution has focused on\nseveral important ideas: punctuated equilibria, species selection,\nhierarchical theory, historical contingency, passive vs. driven\nevolutionary trends, major evolutionary transitions, and more recently\nthe zero-force evolutionary law (or ZFEL) defended by McShea\nand Brandon (2010). One philosophical challenge is to understand the\nrelationships among these ideas; another is to work out what they\nmight mean for the relationship between macro- and microevolution.\n\n\nThe fossil record is the chief source of empirical evidence concerning\nmacroevolutionary patterns, and so macroevolutionary theory is closely\nassociated with paleontology. In addition to questions of\nmacroevolutionary theory per se, there are also\nepistemological questions about how paleontologists infer pattern from\nprocess, and how they correct for biases in the fossil data (Bokulich\nforthcoming). In addition, the distinction between macroevolution and\nmicroevolution sometimes mirrors the distinction between paleontology,\nwith its focus on the fossil record, and neontology, with its focus on\nobservable, extant populations. For this reason, metaphysical\nquestions about the relationship between macro- and microevolution are\nsometimes difficult to disentangle from epistemological questions\nabout what sorts of things can be inferred from different evidence\nbases.\n\nThe classic paper on punctuated equilibria (PE) was co-authored by\nNiles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (1972), although Eldredge (1971)\nwas originally responsible for the idea. Their (1972) presentation of\nPE draws heavily on themes from Thomas Kuhn’s (1962) work, as\nthey present PE as a new paradigm to rival traditional Darwinian\ngradualism (Turner 2011b: chapter 2). Far from challenging the modern\nsynthesis in that early work, they present PE as a straightforward\nconsequence of allopatric speciation (speciation driven by isolating\ngeographic change). Eldredge and Gould reasoned that if speciation\nwere typically allopatric, then it would tend to happen fairly rapidly\nin geological terms, and new species would be geographically distant\nfrom parent species. Consequently, in the fossil record, one should\nnot expect to see very many cases where a fossil series documents a\nclear and gradual transition from one species to another. Eldredge and\nGould also argued that most morphological change occurs in\n(geologically) rapid spurts during speciation events and that new\nspecies, once they arise, typically exhibit stasis. \nWhen Eldredge and Gould (1972) introduced punctuated equilibria, the\nreceived view of expected morphological change via evolution was that\nof phyletic gradualism. This is a notion that can be traced all the\nway from Darwin’s Origin of Species to, for instance,\nSimpson (1970). In accepting phyletic gradualism, paleontologists had\nlong had to accept that the incompleteness of the fossil record was\nsignificantly responsible for the lack of (ideally expected)\ngeological documentation of gradual transformation in the majority of\nfossilized speciation events. What Eldredge and Gould uniquely\nrealized, however, was that the expectation of phyletic gradualism\nclashed not only with what the fossil record actually showed, but also\nwith what the dominant model of (allopatric) speciation predicted. So\nthey developed PE: an alternative view of morphological evolution (and\nstasis) intended to synthesize what allopatric speciation projected\nwith what the fossil record depicted. \nIn the Origin of Species, Darwin had attributed the lack of\nfossil series exhibiting gradual morphological transition to the\nincompleteness of the fossil record. He thought of speciation and\nmorphological evolution as gradual processes (though he did\nacknowledge variation in evolutionary rates), and thought that they\noften happen under the geological radar. As he put it: “Nature\nmay almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of\nher transitional or linking forms” (Darwin 1859 [1964: 292]).\nEldredge and Gould were, in contrast, proposing that the fossil record\nis more complete than it seems, and that we should take the rapid\nappearance of new species more or less at face value. As they\neventually put it, in designing the theory of punctuated equilibrium\nthey were “hoping to validate our profession’s primary\ndata as signal rather than void” (Gould & Eldredge 1993:\n223). One epistemological issue in play here is whether the absence of\nevidence—in this case, the absence of evidence of gradual\nevolutionary change—is really evidence of absence (Sober 2009;\nCurrie & Turner 2017). \nThe ensuing debate about punctuated equilibria proved to be complex\nand contentious. Gould, in particular, made increasingly bold and\ncontroversial claims on behalf of PE during the 1980s, and he tended\nto see PE as the opening wedge for a more ambitious critique of the\nmodern synthesis. Notoriously, Gould also flirted with non-Darwinian\naccounts of speciation, such as Richard Goldschmidt’s (1940)\nidea that new species arise from “hopeful monsters” (Gould\n1977). The stasis claim of PE was also controversial, especially since\nGould took it to mean that cumulative, directional natural selection\nis a less significant factor in evolution than many had thought. The\nreasoning was that if directional natural selection were the dominant\ndriver of evolutionary change, then you would not expect to see such\nclear patterns of stasis in the fossil record. PE elicited a great\ndeal of opposition from biologists and philosophers who were more\ncommitted to a selectionist picture of evolution (Dawkins 1986;\nDennett 1995; and see Sterelny 2001a for a useful guide to the\ncontroversy). \nIn the meantime, PE also inspired new empirical research in\npaleontology, with scientists doing statistical analysis of large\nfossil samples to try to assess the relative importance of stasis vs.\ngradual directional change. This research continues to get more\nsophisticated, and as it happens, PE has fared reasonably well,\nempirically (J. Jackson & Cheetham 1999; Hunt 2007; Uyeda, Hansen,\nArnold, & Pienaar 2011). \nOne other philosophical issue raised by PE concerns the explanation of\nevolutionary stasis (Turner 2017). Eldredge and Gould never really\noffered a very clear account of the mechanism(s) that could maintain\nstasis, a fact that critics often seized upon (e.g., Coyne &\nCharlesworth 1996). They did propose that species might be homeostatic\nsystems. To make matters worse, there is a mismatch between the fossil\nevidence (where stasis is common) and studies of extant populations\nthat show lots of directional evolutionary change (Price, Grant,\nGibbs, & Boag 1984; Endler 1986; Lenski & Travisano 1994;\nHarshman & Hoffmann 2000), a puzzle sometimes called the\n“paradox of stasis” (Hendry 2007). Many evolutionary\nbiologists (e.g. Estes and Arnold 2007) are quick to attribute stasis\nat larger scales to well-known processes such as stabilizing selection\nand/or habitat tracking, but Kaplan (2009) raises some critical\nquestions about that move. And Sterelny (2001b) has pointed out that\ncases of “coordinated stasis” in the fossil record pose\nspecial explanatory challenges. Coordinated stasis is a pattern where\na whole ecological assemblage seems to persist without change for\nmillions of years. Stasis, the idea at the heart of PE, remains an\nissue of considerable theoretical and empirical interest in\npaleontology (Lidgard & Hopkins 2015; Lidgard & Love\n2018). \nIf punctuated equilibria (PE) was the first innovative idea about\nmacroevolution to emerge during the 1970s, species selection followed\nclose on its heels. Just how the two ideas are related is itself a\ntopic of some philosophical interest (Turner 2010). According to\nEldredge and Gould (1972), driven or directional change is\nonly part of the theoretical story about the evolution of morphology;\nit is not, perhaps, even a geologically common narrative. Directional\nselection is selection that changes a population, pushing its\ndistribution of traits from one pattern of trait expression to\nanother. More typical, according the Eldredge and Gould, are cases of\neither non-directional change or even stasis. Like\ndirectional selection, nondirectional selection also changes a\npopulation, but not towards any particular distribution of\ntraits—it just moves a population from one pattern to another.\nStabilizing selection is selection that keeps a population the same,\nnudging it back to its trait distribution pattern whenever it starts\nto stray away. PE as originally formulated favors stabilizing\nselection, suggesting that both individuals and species are inherently\nstable homeostatic systems—systems that are “amazingly\nwell-buffered to resist change and maintain stability in the face of\ndisturbing influences” (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 114). On this\nview, whatever the mechanisms that “resist change and maintain\nstability” are, they are in conflict with and must be overcome\nby directional natural selection in order for natural selection to\nsuccessfully push for or “force” directional change.\nWhether natural selection is properly thought of as a force is itself\nan interesting philosophical issue (Sober 1984; Walsh 2000; Matthen\n& Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Bouchard &\nRosenberg 2004; Stephens 2004; Brandon 2006; Millstein 2006; Filler\n2009). Setting that question aside, however, allows us to consider the\nsuggestion that species might be homeostatic systems which\n“resist change by self-regulation” (Eldredge & Gould\n1972: 114)—as this is a suggestion rife with implications for\nmacroevolutionary theory. \nAt first, the idea that species are homeostatic systems may have been\na way of addressing critics of PE, who wondered what sort of\nbiological mechanisms could maintain stasis over long stretches of\ngeological time. However, it is a short step from thinking of species\nas homeostatic systems to thinking of them as the sort of thing that\ncould be a unit of selection. Eldredge and Gould thought that\nvariation introduced amongst organisms is typically isolated within\nthe population and constrained by stabilizing selection, unless\ngeographic separation creates the conditions for rapid evolutionary\nchange. During allopatric speciation events, the adaptive forces\nnegate the stabilizing ones effectively enough to disrupt the stasis\nof the species and cause the formation of a new lineage. Eventually\nthough, the stabilizing forces (re)assert themselves upon the emergent\nspecies and (re)establish stasis. Most biologists think of stabilizing\nselection as an ordinary microevolutionary process (Schmalhausen\n1949); however, the suggestion that a species is a homeostatic system\nmakes it look like some form of stabilizing selection might be\noperating (in some sense) as a mechanism that maintains equilibrium at\nthe level of populations. \nWhen modeling how these interactions generate macroevolutionary\npatterns, PE presents the dominant (i.e., equilibrium) state as one of\npopulation-level morphological stasis—a state in which\nspeciation attempts often occur but generally fail to take. These\nperiods of stasis are occasionally interrupted (i.e., punctuated) by\nperiods of population-level morphological change—periods of\nsuccessful speciation. This bifurcated model (depicting states of both\nstasis and change) is one in which species behave a little bit like\norganisms: speciation begins to look like reproduction, and extinction\nbegins to look like death. Crucial to this picture is the claim that\nonce a new species comes into existence, it mostly exhibits stasis.\nThe analogy is by no means perfect (Havstad 2016 in Other Internet\nResources), but it did open up a new field of theoretical exploration.\nWhat if the differential speciation and extinction of whole lineages\nis a lot like the differential survival and reproduction of\nindividuals in a population? PE may not logically imply species\nselection, but it does point in that direction by suggesting that\nspecies resemble organisms in relevant ways—for instance, by\nhaving comparable integration and cohesion, enough for populations to\nblock directional change in favor of stasis. \nInitially, Eldredge and Gould (1972) were quite explicit that they did\nnot see their model as entailing a new type of selection. They\nstraightforwardly wrote “we postulate no ‘new’ type\nof selection” (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 112). But in 1975, the\npaleontologist and evolutionary theorist Steven M. Stanley dubbed\nEldredge and Gould’s population-level selection process a form\nof species selection, and by 1977 the inventors of PE concurred. They\nwrote that they nonetheless understood species selection as\nrepresenting “no more than the operation of natural selection at\nhigher levels” (Gould & Eldredge 1977: 139), but still, this\ninterpretation presents a challenge to one typical way of\ninstantiating the dominant model of natural selection. \nRegarding the dominant model: classically and summarily described (see\nGodfrey-Smith 2007), evolution occurs when individuals in a population\naccumulate a change to the degree that this change becomes a feature\nin the population. On this view, natural selection requires variation,\nfitness, and heritability (Lewontin 1970; though see Brandon 1990).\nWhen all three of these things coincide within populations, and change\nresultantly accumulates, evolution occurs. Proponents of species\nselection argue that these three conditions are met at the species\nlevel. \nBut on a typical way of instantiating this rather abstract model of\nnatural selection, one can identify what plays the role of the\nindividuals in this model (organisms) and what plays the role of the\npopulations (species). This popular view treats organisms as the units\nof selection and species as the units of evolution. Species evolve,\nowing to the differential survival and reproduction of organisms. This\nemphasis on organism-level selection and species-level evolution is\nanother which dates back to Darwin’s Origin of Species,\nalthough Darwin also countenanced family selection (Darwin 1859),\nsexual selection (Darwin 1871) and group selection (Stauffer 1975).\nSome early proponents of the modern synthesis (e.g., Mayr 1942, 2001)\nalso shared this basic picture in which selection acts on organisms,\nwhile species evolve. To propose that selection occurs at the level of\nspecies as opposed to that of organisms, is to suppose that not only\ncan organisms act as the units of selection but that species can\ntoo. \nSo, if the proper way to understand natural selection casts organisms\nas the units of selection, and species as the unit of evolution, then\nGould and Eldredge’s model of PE challenges that view.\nAlternatively, if the proper way to understand natural selection\nmerely names biological individuals as the units of selection and\nbiological populations as the unit of evolution, and species can be\nbiological individuals too, then Gould and Eldredge’s model of\nPE is not really a challenge to the model of natural selection, it is\njust a new instance of it. This is because the notion of\n biological individual (see entry)\n is more expansive than that of biological organism; biological\nindividuals include but are not limited to biological organisms.\nBiofilms, coral reefs, insect colonies, obligate symbionts,\nsiphonophores, slime molds, and viruses are just a few of the many\nbiological entities that we might want to consider as individuals,\nalthough they are not organisms (see Buss 1983; J. Wilson 1999; Clarke\n2010, 2013; and R.A. Wilson & Barker 2013, among others). If\nspecies are themselves individuals (Ghiselin 1974; Hull 1976), then\nthe traditional evolutionary theorist may be able to accommodate\nspecies-level selection—in this sense, it is just another flavor\nof individual-level selection. Note that is it is very easy for this\ndispute to become an instance of what the philosopher John Beatty\n(1997) calls a “relative significance” debate—one in\nwhich proponents move from arguing about whether something is possible\n(species acting as the unit of selection) to whether that thing is\nsignificant (as opposed to a mere oddity). \nMany of these issues—such as how to understand stabilizing\nmechanisms and selection, what biological individuals are, whether\nspecies are individuals, and whether species-level selection is\nreducible to individual-level selection—are ongoing. In the\ndecades since Eldredge and Gould first outlined the theory of\npunctuated equilibria, various biological theorists have attempted to\nprovide definitive and irreducible examples of species-level\nselection—ones that cannot be recreated at lower levels such as\nthat of the organism. Species-level traits like range size (where a\nspecies may be wide-ranging even though its organisms are not; see\nJablonski 1987) and rate of speciation (where a species may be slow to\n“reproduce” although its organisms are not; see Vrba 1987)\nare especially promising candidates. In addition to the issue of\nproviding definitive examples of irreducible species selection, there\nis also the issue of providing a satisfactory definition of the\nconcept itself. The biologist Elisabeth Vrba (1984) posits that all\nproposed definitions of species selection ought to identify causes, be\nrestricted enough for testing, and employ a concept of selection that\nis consistent with how selection is understood to act at other levels\nas well. See Vrba (1984), Cracraft (1985), Grantham (1995), Jablonski\n(2008), and Turner (2011b: chapters 4 and 5) for further discussion of\nspecies selection. \nIt is worth noting that several discussions of species selection\npre-date Eldredge and Gould’s (1972) proposal (e.g., Fisher\n1929, Wright 1956; Lewontin 1970). However, it is the ensuing\ndiscussion of stabilizing selection prompted by PE—in\ncombination with a contemporaneous uptick in discussion of kin\nselection, group selection, and altruism (Haldane 1932; Wright 1945;\nWynne-Edwards 1962; Hamilton 1963; Maynard Smith 1964; Boorman &\nLevitt 1973; E.O. Wilson 1973; Levin & Kilmer 1974; D.S. Wilson\n1975; Wade 1978)—which transforms these macroevolutionary sparks\ninto an ongoing, hierarchical conflagration (see Gould 1980b, 1982,\n2002; Vrba & Eldredge 1984; Cracraft 1985; Eldredge 1985; Grantham\n1995; and Eldredge, Pievani, Serrelli, & Temkin 2016, among\nothers). Indeed, some theorists see the paleobiological revolution as\ncontributing to a “hierarchical expansion” of evolutionary\ntheory. \nEvolutionary theorists often distinguish between the unit of selection\n(Williams 1966; Franklin & Lewontin 1970; Lewontin 1970) and the\nunit of evolution (Williams 1966; Hull 1978; Ereshefsky 1991).\nExpanding the category of what can act as a unit of selection leads\ndirectly into a corresponding expansion of what can act as a unit of\nevolution. This is how a hierarchical theory of evolution is\ntheoretically generated: when theoreticians consider not just\norganisms or individuals as the\n unit of selection (see entry)\n but also species and (kin) groups, and genes (for instance), they are\nalso and correspondingly considering not just species or populations\nas the unit of evolution but also clades, and cultures, and cells or\nperhaps organisms (respectively). Each proposed unit of selection\nincurs another, higher-level candidate for the unit of evolution.\nHierarchical evolutionary theory is just the name for theories of\nevolution that admit of different units of selection and evolution\nthan that of (merely and respectively) organisms or individuals and\nspecies or populations. Hierarchical theorists see evolutionary\nprocesses (especially selection processes) unfolding simultaneously at\ndifferent biological levels and temporal scales. \nHierarchical thinking about evolution is perhaps best illustrated with\nan example. It has already been noted that one way of explaining\nmorphological stasis is stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection\nis a well-understood Darwinian mechanism that operates on organisms in\na population. Here, organisms are the units of selection while species\nare the units of evolution. But Sheldon (1996) introduced another\npotential explanation of stasis, which he called the “plus\nça change” model. Sheldon observed that in times of\nenvironmental turmoil, ecological generalists usually have lower\nextinction risk, while ecological specialists are more prone to\nextinction. Perhaps surprisingly, then, a pattern of stasis in the\nfossil record might be due to the persistence of ecological\ngeneralists during times of environmental upheaval. This model appeals\nto species selection, or to the differential extinction and\npersistence of whole species, rather than to stabilizing selection\nprocesses occurring within those species. Hierarchical theorists hold\nthat evolutionary patterns (like stasis) can be generated and\nsustained by processes operating at different biological levels. \nAltogether, hierarchical evolutionary theory is potentially inclusive\nof macroevolutionary processes (such as species selection), along with\nparadigmatic microevolutionary processes (such as organism-level\nselection), sub-microevolutionary processes (such as genic selection),\nand even super-macroevolutionary processes (like clade selection).\nLewontin (1970) considers the possibility of the following acting as\nunits of selection: molecules, cell organelles, cells themselves,\ngametes, individuals (this is the term he uses), kin groups,\npopulations, species, communities of species, and phyla. Williams\n(1966) and Dawkins (1976) are often credited with developing the\nnotion of genic selectionism.  Debate over genic selectionism—a\ntheory within which genes are both the units of heredity and the units\nof selection—has led to further philosophical discussion\nregarding what counts as a replicator as opposed to an interactor\n(Hull 1980; Brandon 1988, 1990; Lloyd 1988; Griffiths & Gray 1994,\n1997; Sterelny 1996; Sterelny, Smith, & Dickison 1996;\nGodfrey-Smith 2000; Griesemer 2000; Nanay 2002).  Various biologists\n(e.g., Mayr 1963; Gould 1980a; Lewontin 1991) have ardently disputed\nthe claim that genes act as direct targets of selection. Philosophers\nof biology have taken positions both pro (e.g., Sterelny & Kitcher\n1988; Waters 1991) and con (e.g., Sober & D.S. Wilson 1994; Lloyd\n2005) on the topic of genic selectionism. \nPhilosophical discussions of genic selection, clade selection, other\nunits of selection, and the hierarchical theory of evolution are\nextensive and ongoing (in addition to works already cited, see Wimsatt\n1980; Kitcher, Sterelny, & Waters 1990; Sober 1990; Godfrey-Smith\n& Lewontin 1993; Stanford 2001; Glennan 2002; R.A. Wilson 2003;\nWalsh 2004; Waters 2005; and Okasha 2006, among others). Another\ninteresting, relatively recent, and somewhat related development is\nthe proposal of a further, even-more-extended evolutionary synthesis,\nor EES (Jablonka & Lamb 2005; Pigliucci & Müller 2010;\nLaland et al. 2014; though see Wray et al. 2014). Proponents of EES\ncontend that phenomena such as developmental bias (Arthur 2004), niche\nconstruction (Odling-Smee, Laland, and Feldman 2003), phenotypic\nplasticity (West-Eberhard 2003), and non-genetic inheritance processes\nlike social learning and cultural transmission (Hoppitt & Laland\n2013) challenge evolutionary theory as standardly understood.\nOpponents contend that the now-traditional theoretical framework\nconstructed via the modern synthesis can accommodate all these\nphenomena and more. See Pigliucci and Finkelman (2014) for a\ndiscussion of the philosophical implications of the EES debate. \nOne meta-scientific issue raised by these macroevolutionary disputes\nis just how much a scientific theory can flex and change before it\neither becomes a different theory altogether, or it becomes a bad\nscientific theory (via too much of what Popper [1974] would call\nad hoc revisionism). \nAs an illustrative example, consider punctuated equilibrium, which has\ncertainty been articulated in many and varying ways. The two initial\npublications by Eldredge (1971) and Eldredge and Gould (1972) are\nundoubtedly the founding ones, but there are other crucial moments in\nthe development of the theory (e.g., Gould & Eldredge 1977, 1983,\n1986, 1993; Eldredge & Gould 1988; Gould 2002). At times the\nshifting nature of PE has been a target of criticism (e.g., Levinton\n1986; Coyne & Charlesworth 1997; see Eckhardt 1986 for a\nparticularly entertaining visit from “the shade of Francis\nGalton”). \nAnother dynamic theoretical dimension of PE, hierarchical theory, and\nthe like is how radically these scientific notions are\nperceived—even by their own creators. In 1982, for instance,\nGould first asked and then answered:  \nWhat would a fully elaborated, hierarchically based evolutionary\ntheory be called? It would neither be Darwinism, as usually\nunderstood, nor a smoothly continuous extension of Darwinism, for it\nviolates directly the fundamental reductionist tradition embodied in\nDarwin’s focus on organisms as units of selection. (1982: 386)\n \nBut in 2002, Gould wrote  \nI do believe that the Darwinian framework, and not just the\nfoundation, persists in the emerging structure of a more adequate\nevolutionary theory. (2002:3)  \nHe devoted much of the extensive efforts of his Structure of\nEvolutionary Theory to defending an interpretation of Darwinian\nevolutionary theory as resting on a revisable “tripod of\nnecessary support” (Gould 2002: 586)—one whose three\ncritical supports were challenged by proposed expansions to\nevolutionary theory, but which nonetheless could be buttressed via\nintegration with these challenges, rather than replacement by them. In\nshort, the later Gould argues that Darwinian evolution traditionally\nemphasizes organismic selection, adaptationism, and extrapolationism;\nthat punctuated equilibria, stabilizing selection, and species\nselection challenge the first of these supports, developmental and\nother constraints challenge the second, and major evolutionary\ntransitions challenge the third; but that all three of these\nchallenges can be accommodated by a revised but still Darwinian\nconception of evolutionary theory. \nNote that efforts to retain (or reject) the Darwinian label show up in\nother contexts as well—for instance, in discussions of\nadaptationism (e.g., Gould & Lewontin 1979) and the neutral theory\nof molecular evolution (Dietrich 1994). Darwin himself declared that\n“He who rejects these views [his] on the nature of the\ngeological record, will rightly reject my whole theory” (1859\n[1964: 342]). Whether or not Darwin’s emphatic claim is correct\nis still an open question. Additional philosophical resources on\ntheoretical and conceptual change in science include but are by no\nmeans limited to Kuhn (1962), LaPorte (2004), and M. Wilson\n(2006). \nFrom October 16th to 19th of 1980, a conference\non the subject of macroevolution was held at the Field Museum of\nNatural History in Chicago, Illinois. Shortly thereafter—in the\nNovember 21, 1980 issue of Science—an exciting report\non some events of the conference was published (Lewin 1980). The\nreport was entitled “Evolutionary Theory under Fire”, and\nit prompted a cascade of responses in the Letters section of\nScience—an exchange of scientific correspondence that\ncontinued for almost two decades. Whatever the motives behind the\nheadlining of the report, it is empirically evident that the chosen\ntitle was inflammatory. \nThe February 21, 1981 issue of Science included no fewer than\n5 separate contributions (in order of printing: Futuyma et al. 1981;\nTempleton & Giddings 1981; Carson 1981; Olson 1981; Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981). The February 4, 1983 issue of Science\ncontained a letter by critics of PE (Schopf & Hoffman 1983) and a\nreply (Gould 1983). In the March 11 issue of that same year both prior\nparties were accused of prolonging a fruitless discussion of a\n“philosophically intractable” and dubious\n“pseudoquestion” (Grant 1983: 1170). In April, one\ncorrespondent wrote in agreement with Grant (Schoch 1983) and another\nchided him for failing “to explore and appreciate the latest\nblooming in the desert of dogma” (Maderson 1983: 360). To put it\nmildly, and purely descriptively: many of the responses elicited by\nthe original report were impassioned and emotive. \nIn the February 14, 1986 issue of Science, the original\nreporter on the macroevolutionary conference fanned the flames with\nanother piece, one entitled “Punctuated Equilibrium is Now Old\nHat” (Lewin 1986). In March, Jeffrey Levinton registered an\nardent objection to Lewin’s characterization of the theory as\nwidely accepted, as well as to PE in general (Levinton 1986). In\nApril, Gould responded (Gould 1986), and in May, Robert Eckhardt\nresponded to Gould’s response (Eckhard 1986). Throughout these\nexchanges and related ones, many interesting meta-scientific charges\nwere laid and lobbed. Questions of “where is the\nevidence?” as well as accusations of dogma, religionism,\nrevisionism, sloganeering, and vagueness abounded. \nSo did references to creationism, specifically. The very first batch\nof letters in response to Lewin’s initial piece included one\nobjecting strongly to the choice of title (Armstrong & Drummond\n1981). The correspondents wrote that “this article is\nundoubtedly destined to enter the out-of-context arsenal that has\nbecome a mainstay of recent creationist literature” (Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981: 774). Incidentally, the correspondents were\ncorrect about this (e.g., Meyer 1994; Parker 2006). \nAnd in the March 10, 1995 issue, a different journalist for\nScience published another piece, this one entitled “Did\nDarwin Get It All Right?” (Kerr 1995). By May 5, a scientist had\nwritten in to protest the use of such an inflammatory headline\n(McInerney 1995), referencing Lewin’s original piece (from\n1980). McInerney wrote that Lewin’s earlier piece had\n“provided a gold mine for subsequent creationist\npropaganda” (1995: 624). He bemoaned the fact that another such\nheadline had just been published by Science, and recommended\nthat “a journal representing some 130,000 scientists be a bit\nmore judicious in its choice of headlines” (1995: 624). \nThese references to a wider social context—the one in which such\nardent macroevolutionary debate is being held—raise interesting\nissues that have perhaps been somewhat neglected by philosophers of\nscience (though see the entry on\n  the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n Do the scientists involved in this dispute, and the\nscientific journalists reporting on it, have a responsibility to\nconsider the (unintended yet foreseeable and potentially avoidable)\nuses to which their headlines might be put (by creationists and other\nparties)? Some scientific correspondents evidently think they do. And\nif such responsibility exists, does it fall upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua scientist—or upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua citizen, or scientist qua educator?\nPhilosophers focusing on the relation between science and value have\ndone some relevant work on questions like these, usually while\nfocusing on other scientific domains—work which could be applied\nto macroevolutionary instances and issues (e.g., Rudner 1953; Hempel\n1960; Longino 1990; Douglas 2000, 2009; Kourany 2010). \nThese are not the only issues of provocative linguistic expression\nawaiting further exploration by philosophers of macroevolution.\nQuestions of what it means to sit “at the high table”\n(Maynard Smith 1984; Sepkoski 2014) or to “replay life’s\ntape” (Gould 1989; Beatty 2006; Sepkoski 2016) are perhaps more\nfamiliar to philosophers of biology, but still worth exploring. \nStephen Jay Gould (1989) famously argued that evolutionary history is\ncontingent. George Gaylord Simpson (1963) foreshadowed that claim when\nhe suggested that paleontology is a distinctively historical science\nthat seeks to understand “configurational change”. Gould\nclaimed that if we could rewind the tape of history to some point in\nthe deep past and play it back again, the outcome would probably be\ndifferent. \nGould’s thinking about contingency has had significant impacts\nin both philosophy and biology. In philosophy, for instance, John\nBeatty (1995) argued that the contingency of evolutionary history\nimplies that there are no distinctively biological laws, an argument\nthat served as a touchstone for much of the subsequent debate about\nlaws in biology (Brandon 1997; Mitchell 1997, 2000, 2002; Sober 1997;\nGiere 1999; Shapiro 2000; Woodward 2000, 2001, 2004; Elgin 2003, 2006;\nand Hamilton 2007; for important precursors to Beatty 1995, see Smart\n1963; Ruse 1970; Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989; and Rosenberg\n1994). More recently, Beatty (2016) has argued that the contingency of\nevolutionary history is closely connected to narrative modes of\nexplanation. His suggestion is that narrative explanations are\nespecially well suited to historically contingent series of events.\nMcConwell (2017) argues that the contingency of evolutionary history\nexplains why we should be pluralists about biological individuality.\nIn biology, on the other hand, Gould’s argument about\ncontingency, particularly his thought experiment concerning rewinding\nand playing back the tape of history, helped to inspire research in\nlong-term experimental evolution (e.g., Travisano, Mangold, Bennett,\n& Lenski 1995). In addition to fueling interest in understanding\nthe Cambrian explosion, Gould’s work also instigated something\nof a backlash from other scientists convinced that selection-driven\nconvergence is the hallmark of evolutionary history (e.g., Conway\nMorris 2003). This debate concerning contingency and convergence\nsometimes also has theological overtones. Conway Morris has at least\nhinted that he sees convergentism about evolution as cohering\nespecially well with theism. This contrasts with Gould’s\nwell-known view that science and religion should be regarded as\n“non-overlapping magisteria” (Gould 1997). \nThere is some question about just what Gould meant by the term\n‘contingency’. Some philosophers read him as meaning that\ndownstream outcomes are sensitive to small changes in upstream\nconditions (Ben-Menahem 1997; Inkpen & Turner 2012). On this\nreading, contingency comes in degrees, and in contrast with historical\ninsensitivity to changes in upstream conditions, which we\ncould think of as historical convergence or robustness. When, for\nexample, Sterelny (1995, crediting F. Jackson & Pettit 1992) talks\nabout “robust process explanations”, he means explanations\nthat show how an outcome would have resulted from a wide range of\nupstream conditions. \nBeatty (2006), however, has shown that there are two different senses\nof ‘contingency’ in play in Gould’s work. In\naddition to what Beatty calls contingency as causal\ndependence—basically, sensitivity to initial\nconditions—there is a second form of contingency that Beatty\ninitially called contingency as unpredictability, but now calls\ncontingency per se (Beatty 2016). These two senses of\ncontingency correspond with two versions of the famous thought\nexperiment that Gould (1989) deployed. Sometimes, Gould imagines\nrewinding the tape of history, tweaking an upstream variable, and then\nplaying the tape back. On other occasions, he talks about playing the\ntape back from the same initial conditions. Beatty (2016) thinks that\nboth senses of ‘contingency’ are important, and he takes\nit that the second sense—contingency per se—must\ncommit us to some sort of causal indeterminism. On the other hand,\nTurner (2011a) has tried to give an account of this second sense of\ncontingency that is neutral with respect to determinism. His\nsuggestion is that what Gould really cared about was random or\nunbiased macroevolutionary sorting. Processes such as coin tosses, or\nrandom genetic drift, can be random or unbiased (in a sense) without\nviolating causal determinism. One way to think about this is by\nadopting a frequentist conception of probability: the outcome of a\ncoin toss could be causally determined by small-scale physical\ninfluences, but the outcome is still random or unbiased in the sense\nthat over a long series of trials, the ratio of heads to tails will\napproximate 50:50. This account is closely allied with\nSepkoski’s (2016) suggestion that Gould’s metaphor of\nreplaying the tape of history was rooted in his work on simulations of\nmacroevolution in the 1970s. Turner (2015) has also argued that there\nis a connection between contingency, thus understood, and the notion\nof a passive evolutionary trend.  \nMcConwell and Currie (2017) have added further complexity to the\ndiscussion by arguing that there is an important difference between\nabstract, source-independent accounts of contingency and\nsource-dependent accounts. The notion of sensitivity to\ninitial conditions is a good example of what they mean by a\nsource-independent account: it gives an abstract characterization of\nhistorical or biological processes without saying what the source of\ncontingency is. Does the source have something to do with genetic\ndrift? With mutational ordering? Or something else entirely? McConwell\nand Currie argue that in order to establish the autonomy of\nmacroevolutionary theory, a source-dependent account is required. \nSome commentators have noted that Gould’s defense of\nevolutionary contingency sits in tension with his arguments, in the\n1970s and early 1980s, for a more “nomothetic”\npaleobiology (e.g., Raup & Gould 1974). A more nomothetic\npaleobiology would seem to place the emphasis on laws and\npredictability. However, contingency is thought by some to mean that\nthere are no distinctively biological laws (Beatty 1995). Haufe (2015)\naddresses this puzzle by arguing that Gould was interested in\ndeveloping a “nomothetic” science of macroevolution\ninvolving generations at large spatial and (especially) temporal\nscales, but that this is compatible with saying that contingency\nreigns at other scales. One other larger theme that may help to unify\nsome of Gould’s thinking is his skepticism about the power of\nnatural selection, which is the classic example of a\nmicro-evolutionary process (see also Gould & Lewontin 1979). One\nway to limit the importance of natural selection is to insist on the\nautonomy of macroevolutionary theory, and to show that natural\nselection is insufficient to explain certain larger scale patterns.\nAnother way is to insist that evolutionary history is contingent,\nsince one would expect selection to produce convergent outcomes. \nThus, philosophers have done a lot of work on challenging conceptual\nquestions about the various senses of ‘contingency’ and\ntheir relationship to other macroevolutionary ideas. One problem\nlurking in the background of this discussion is empirical: how can\nscientists even tell whether evolutionary history is contingent or\n(say) convergent? Conway Morris (2003) assembles a whole catalog of\nexamples of evolutionary convergence in an effort to provide\ncounterevidence against Gould’s contingency thesis. One\nimportant issue here is to find a principled way of distinguishing\ncases of convergent evolution (where unrelated lineages subject to\nsimilar selection pressures evolve similar traits) from parallel\nevolution (where lineages with similar traits to start with follow\nsimilar evolutionary trajectories) (Pearce 2012). Another issue is\nthat one can multiply convergences by giving coarser-grained\ndescriptions of the traits in question—for example, by counting\nagriculture in humans and some ant species as the same trait (Sterelny\n2005). Powell & Mariscal (2015) argue that not all of the putative\nexamples of convergence really tell against the contingency thesis,\nand they try to specify more clearly what would actually count as\nevidence against contingency. \nIn developing his initial claim about evolutionary contingency, Gould\n(1989) made much of the Burgess Shale fauna, exquisite Cambrian\nfossils from western Canada first described by the American\npaleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in the early 1900s. Gould was\nwriting in the wake of what some call the “first\nreclassification” of the Burgess fossils, when work by British\npaleontologist Harry Blackmore Whittington and students Derek Briggs\nand Simon Conway Morris had placed many of the strange forms in their\nown phyla, with the idea that each phylum represented a unique body\nplan. Most of those Burgess phyla went extinct, but some (including a\nlikely ancestor of chordates) persisted. But what if that sorting had\nhappened differently? Since 1989, scientists Graham Budd, Allison\nDaley, and others using cladistic methods of classification (which\nwere slow to be adopted by paleontologists) have reclassified the\nBurgess fauna yet again, placing many of the strangest ones in stem\ngroups of existing clades (such as arthropods). So one further\nphilosophical question is whether and to what extent this change in\ntaxonomic practice matters to the argument that Gould tried to make\nabout contingency (Brysse 2008). \nThere is a closely related debate about the status of phyla. Some\ncladists see phyla as being nothing terribly special. Like any higher\ntaxa, phyla must be monophyletic, but from a cladistic perspective\nthere is nothing about the taxonomic rank of phylum that has any\nparticular importance to macroevolutionary theory. Others have argued\nthat lower ranks like order and class are evolutionarily meaningful in\na way that phyla are not (e.g., Holman 1989). Gould (1989), however,\ndrawing upon German paleontological tradition, saw phyla as\ncorresponding to stable morphological body plans (or\nBaupläne). This connects closely with his argument about\ncontingency: if different Cambrian phyla had persisted, downstream\nevolutionary history would have involved modification of totally\ndifferent body plans. Some scientists have recently tried to revive\nthe idea that there is something special about the role of phyla in\nmacroevolution (Levin, et al. 2016; though see Hejnol & Dunn\n2016). \nFinally, historical contingency is a counterfactual notion, and\nalthough this issue has not gotten as much attention as it deserves,\nthere is a nascent philosophical literature on historical\ncounterfactuals (Tucker 2004: 227ff; Nolan 2013; Radick 2016; Zhao\n2017 in Other Internet Resources). The debate about historical\ncontingency can be construed as a disagreement about the truth of\nvarious historical counterfactuals. Gould claimed that if things in\nthe Cambrian had been slightly different, there would be no\nvertebrates today, let alone humans, while other convergentists claim\nthat humanlike cognitive abilities, language, tool use, and sociality\nwould have evolved even if other things had been different in the\npast—for example, if the non-avian dinosaurs had not gone\nextinct. \nPaleontologists have long been interested in documenting and\nexplaining larger-scale evolutionary trends in the fossil record\n(McShea 1998). Perhaps the classic example of a macroevolutionary\ntrend, and one that paleontologists have studied extensively, is\nCope’s rule of size increase. Paleontologists routinely\ndistinguish within-lineage trends (e.g., average size increase within\na single lineage) from among-lineage trends (e.g., increase in the\naverage size of mammals over the Cenozoic). The latter are\ndistinctively macro-level patterns. While it might be tempting to\nthink that trends such as evolutionary size increase are generally\nattributable to natural selection, Stanley (1973) pointed out that\nthese trends could be merely statistical phenomena. Suppose that a\nclade, such as mammals, starts out at or near a fixed lower boundary\non body size. And suppose that evolutionary size increases and\ndecreases are equally probable. As the clade evolves, the mean body\nsize might do a “random walk” away from the fixed\nboundary—an idea that Gould (1996) later popularlized. Many\nscientists also think of this as a passive diffusion model of\nevolutionary change. \nThe notion of a passive trend is closely related to other themes of\nmacroevolutionary theory. Gould, in particular, was enthusiastic about\nthe possibility that Cope’s rule might be a passive trend. If\nthat were the case, then it would mean that evolutionary size increase\nis not attributable to natural selection. What’s more, if we\nexplain size increase by supposing it to be a passive trend, then the\nexplanation need not reference any micro-level causes. The fixed\nboundary in the state space could be maintained by developmental\nconstraints—another favorite theme of Gould’s. And\nfinally, a trend resulting from a random walk away from a fixed\nboundary would not seem to be progressive at all. To the extent that\nlarger-scale evolutionary trends are passive, chance looks like a more\nsignificant factor in evolutionary history, and selection looks like a\nless significant one. \nMcShea (1994) gave one widely-cited formulation of the distinction\nbetween passive and driven trends, and also suggested several\napproaches for determining, empirically, whether a trend is passive or\ndriven. One such approach is the stable minimum test: track, say, the\nbody size of the smallest members of the clade. If that increases\nsteadily over time, it is a signal that the trend is driven.\nPaleobiologists now routinely try to determine whether trends are\npassive or driven, though this work can sometimes encounter\nunderdetermination issues (Turner 2009). Body size has received a lot\nof empirical attention, in part because it is easy to estimate from\nfragmentary fossil remains, and partly for the simple reason that it\nis a trait that every animal has. \nIn addition to its role in the development of macroevolutionary theory\nand its influence on scientific research, the passive/driven\ndistinction raises a number of philosophical issues. As noted already,\nthe notion of a passive trend links up with a traditional set of\nquestions about the role of chance or randomness in evolution\n(Millstein 2000). Indeed, the passive/driven distinction looks a lot\nlike the distinction between random genetic drift and selection in\npopulation genetics. Drift could be construed as a passive trend in\ngene frequencies. Grantham (1999) argues that the notion of a passive\ntrend points toward a certain sort of explanatory pluralism: a trend\nthat is best explained as a stochastic phenomenon at the macro-level\ncould receive a more deterministic explanation at a lower level, and\nthose explanations need not conflict. Turner (2014) suggests that the\nnotion of a passive trend poses a challenge to popular interventionist\nideas about causal explanation. Explaining a trend by showing that it\nis passive could turn out to be a non-causal explanatory strategy. \nOne issue that remains under-explored, philosophically, is how the\ndistinction between passive vs. driven larger-scale trends might\nintersect with philosophical disagreements about whether neo-Darwinian\nevolutionary theory is best understood as a causal theory (a view\ngiven its canonical formulation by Sober 1984) or a statistical theory\n(Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002). There may be\nsome question about whether it is best to understand the\npassive/driven distinction as a distinction between trends generated\nby different causal mechanisms, vs. a distinction between different\nsorts of statistical phenomena. \nMany paleobiologists have assumed that driven trends must be driven by\nnatural selection. For example, if body size increase is driven,\nsurely that means that larger body size has conferred some survival or\nreproductive advantage (Hone & Benton 2005). McShea (2005) and\nMcShea and Brandon (2010) have forcefully challenged that assumption.\nMcShea (2005) argues that increase in structural complexity is a\ndriven trend, but one that need not be driven by selection. That is\nbecause increasing structural complexity might just be the zero-force\ncondition for evolving systems, an idea that McShea and Brandon (2010)\ndevelop in great detail. McShea and Brandon’s zero-force\nevolutionary law—or ZFEL—has elicited critical\nresponses from other philosophers (Barrett, et al. 2012). Whereas\ntraditional evolutionary thinkers, from Darwin on down, assumed that\nnatural selection would have to explain complexity increase, McShea\nand Brandon see complexity increase as the default expectation, and\nthey invoke selection to explain deviations from that default\nexpectation—such as cases of eye loss in cave-dwelling species.\nThey treat eye loss in cave dwellers as a case where natural selection\nfavors a reduction in structural complexity. Alternatively,\nO’Malley, Wideman, & Ruiz-Trillo (2016) consider the\npotentially wide-ranging and macroevolutionary role of simplification\nin conferring “adaptive” advantage. \nMcShea and Brandon also argue that the ZFEL has the virtue of\ngiving a unified account of both micro- and macro-evolutionary\nphenomena. They invoke the ZFEL to explain a wide variety of\ndifferent patterns, ranging from complexity increase in the history of\nanimal life, as represented by the fossil record, to increasing\ngenomic heterogeneity over time. Whatever one thinks about their claim\nthat the ZFEL is “biology’s first law”,\ntheir project raises a question worth exploring: is it reasonable to\nthink that explanations of macroevolutionary patterns should take\nfundamentally the same form as explanations of patterns at vastly\ndifferent spatiotemporal scales? How much does scale matter? \nThe ZFEL also raises some fundamental philosophical questions\nabout the structure of evolutionary theory. How, for example, should\nwe determine what counts as the default expectation, or zero-force\ncondition, for an evolutionary system (Gouvêa 2015)? Is there\nany way to distinguish empirically between theories that disagree\nabout the default expectation? Is there even a fact of the matter\nabout what the default expectation should be? These questions about\ndefault expectations for evolutionary systems may link up with larger\nquestions about the function of null hypotheses in scientific\nreasoning. These questions about default assumptions in\nmacroevolutionary theory also prompt comparison with questions about,\nfor instance, neutral theory in molecular evolution (Kimura 1983) and\nin community ecology (Hubbell 2006). For relevant philosophical\ndiscussion, see e.g., Dietrich (1994); Bausman and Halina (2018). \nIf one way to think about the larger picture of the history of life on\nEarth is to focus on evolutionary trends (size increase, complexity\nincrease, etc.), another approach is to focus on major transitional\nevents in the history of life (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry\n1995; Szathmáry & Maynard Smith 1995). The point of\ndeparture for most work on major transitions has been Szathmáry\nand Maynard Smith’s (1995: 228) list of game-changing\nalterations in evolutionary history: \nOne of Maynard Smith and Szathmáry’s insights is that the\nvery mechanisms of evolution—the way evolution works—have\nchanged over the course of evolutionary history (Calcott &\nSterelny 2011). \nOne philosophical concern about the theory of major transitions is\nthat the original list was something of a mixed bag (McShea &\nSimpson 2011). For example, some of the transitions, like the\nevolution of eukaryotes and the evolution of multicellularity, seem to\ninvolve jumps in part/whole complexity. But others, like the evolution\nof sexual reproduction, do not. So it is not clear at all that these\nare transitions of the same kind. Indeed, Maynard Smith and\nSzathmáry suggest that the transitions have three features: (1)\nchanges in the way that information is stored and transmitted; (2) new\ndivision of labor; and (3) individuals that could once reproduce\nindependently can no longer do so after the transition. Criterion (3),\nin particular, links the issue of major transitions to the larger\ndebate about the nature of biological individuality. One potential\nproblem, though, is that not all the transitions on the original list\nsatisfy all three criteria. For example, the shift from primate\nsocieties to human societies clearly involves (1) and (2), but not\n(3). To complicate things further, Szathmáry (2015) revisits\nthe original list of transitions and proposes some changes. \nRelated to this worry that the major transitions do not comprise a\nunified type of evolutionary event, some theorists (e.g.,\nO’Malley 2014) argue that other significant events should be\ncount as major transitions. O’Malley & Powell (2016) think\nthat the biological oxygenation of Earth is a major transition, and\nCurrie (forthcoming) makes the case for treating mass extinctions as major\ntransitions. \nA second philosophical concern is that Maynard Smith and\nSzathmáry’s original idea looks a bit teleological, and\nin a way that likely raises the hackles of some scientists and\nphilosophers (e.g., Dawkins 1986; Dennett 1995). The transitions in\nSzathmáry and Maynard Smith’s (1995) list all seem like\nnecessary steps on the way to the evolution of humans, and cynically,\none might wonder if their relation to the later appearance of humans\nis what makes the transitions “major”. Relatedly, one\nmight wonder if the idea of major transitions comes a little too close\nto reviving pre-evolutionary thinking about the great chain of being.\nThis also connects with traditional questions about evolutionary\nprogress (Ruse 1997). While some of the concepts surveyed in this\nentry—especially passive trends and historical\ncontingency—might seem like threats to the belief in\nevolutionary progress, the theory of major transitions coheres well\nwith progressivist views about evolution. \nIn spite of these potential concerns, however, the major transitions\nreally are historical events that pose distinct explanatory\nchallenges. Arguably, our picture of macroevolution will not be\nentirely complete without tackling some of those challenges. \nIt is noteworthy that neither Maynard Smith nor Szathmáry are\npaleontologists, and so there may be a bit of a disconnect between\ntheir original proposal and the way that many paleontologists have\ncome to think about major transitions. Several of the transitions from\nthe original list must have occurred way back in the deep past; the\nfossil record is not likely to give us much insight into the origin of\neukaryotes, for instance. Molecular tools may be able to shed some\nlight on macroevolutionary queries about the deep past, however\n(O’Malley 2016). And paleontologists sometimes take a much\nbroader (and looser) view of major transitions, such that any major\nevolutionary novelty would count as a major transition. For instance,\nthe evolution of placentation in mammals, or the evolution of feathers\nin archosaurs, might count as major transitions on this broader view.\nCurrie (forthcoming) draws a distinction between theory-driven\napproaches to major transitions and phenomena-driven approaches.\nPaleontologists tend to fall in the latter camp, since they usually\nbegin by thinking about major morphological or phenotypic changes that\nshow up in the fossil record. \nOne significant and remaining challenge in the philosophy of\nmacroevolution is to work out how the various ideas about\nmacroevolution surveyed above may or may not fit together. What\nexactly is the relationship between punctuated equilibria and species\nselection? Or between PE and the major transitions? Or between species\nselection and historical contingency? Or between contingency and the\nmajor transitions? Do (some, all of) these ideas weave together to\nform a unified picture of evolution at large scales? Or do they\nrepresent something more like a heterogeneous grab bag of scientific\nideas that are more or less useful in different contexts? A further\nquestion is how the relative (dis)unity of macroevolutionary theory\nmight bear on the longstanding question of how macroevolution is\nrelated to microevolution. \nFinally, the investigation of macroevolution challenges the purported\ndistinction between the experimental and historical sciences (Sober\n1993; Cleland 2001). Investigation in this domain is historical and\noften emphasizes the deep past, to be sure, but it also involves\ntheoretical and prospective modeling, making predictions about what\nthe models will or will not find, making predictions about what\npaleontologists will or will not find, running bottle and other kinds\nof experiments, simulations, and more. The scientific study of\nmacroevolution is a philosophically rich and challenging field with\nmany deposits to mine.","contact.mail":"jhavstad@oakland.edu","contact.domain":"oakland.edu"}]
