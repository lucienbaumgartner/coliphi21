Rather, they are\ncharacterized by the development and application of mathematical,\ncomputational, and synthetic modeling strategies in response to\ncomplex problems and challenges within the life sciences. Proponents\nof systems and synthetic biology often stress the necessity of a\nperspective that goes beyond the scope of molecular biology and\ngenetic engineering, respectively. With the emphasis on systems and\ninteraction networks, the approaches explicitly engage in one of the\noldest philosophical discussions on the relationship between parts and\nwholes, or between reductionism and holism. Such questions are,\nhowever, reframed in the new light of strategies for large-scale data\nproduction and dynamic modeling that are inspired by non-biological\ndisciplines such as engineering. Systems and synthetic biology thus\nshed new light on important discussions in philosophy of biology, but\nthey are also philosophically interesting for their own sake. By\npursuing ambitious aims such as the development of multiscale\ncomputational models and synthetic life forms, they uncover new ground\nfor philosophical analysis. Systems and synthetic biology raise\nfundamental questions about how far research can be taken through\ncomputational approaches, about the relation between living and\nartificial systems, and about the implications of interdisciplinary\nresearch for science and society.\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems biology and synthetic biology are relatively recent\ninterdisciplinary approaches that aim to improve our ability to\nunderstand, predict, and control living systems. They both capitalize\non large-scale data production in genomics and related fields and\nexplore new paths of cross-fertilization between biology and\nnon-biological disciplines such as physics, computer science,\nmathematics, chemistry, and engineering. Systems and synthetic biology\nare often described as ‘sister-disciplines’ or\n‘cousins’, focusing on the complementary and interrelated\naims of understanding (systems biology) and\ndesigning (synthetic biology) living systems. Accordingly,\nthey have been associated with knowledge-driven versus\napplication-driven epistemologies, or with the aims of analysis versus\nsynthesis. Philosophers of science examining the research practice\nhave, however, argued that understanding and design are often\ninterdependent, and that no simple distinction between basic and\napplied science can be made in this context (O’Malley 2009;\nKastenhofer 2013a,b; Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). Moreover, the\nnotions of systems and synthetic biology cover broad and highly\ndiverse spectra of interdisciplinary hybrids (Calvert & Fujimura\n2011; Gramelsberger et al. 2013). This entry will therefore aim to\nreach a balance between displaying the methodological flexibility and\nvariability within these fields and highlighting common themes. \nSystems biology can be interpreted as a response to limitations of\nresearch strategies investigating molecules and pathways in isolation.\nTo clarify the significance of their approach, systems biologists\noften stress the need to complement or go beyond what is perceived as\nreductionist strategies in molecular biology (cf., De Backer et al.\n2004; van Regenmortel 2004; Wolkenhauer & Green 2013). The\ncontrast between systems biology and molecular biology should not be\noverstated (see also\n Section 4.1).\n However, the often cited comparison reveals how systems biology is\nmotivated by the need for mathematical and computational modeling\nframeworks that are better suited for studying the dynamics and\norganization of many interconnected components (Boogerd et al. 2007;\nKitano 2001). \nMolecular biology has been extremely successful in generating\nknowledge on biological mechanisms through the twin strategies of\ndecomposition and localization of component parts and molecular\noperations (Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]). But the very\nsuccess of the detailed study of molecular pathways has also revealed\ndynamic interfaces and crosslinks between processes and components\nthat were previously assigned to distinct mechanisms or subsystems. To\naccount for a vast number of interacting components and multiple\nfeedback loops dynamic modeling is needed (Bechtel & Abrahamsen\n2012). Network modeling and computational simulations in systems\nbiology allow for the study of larger integrated systems and thus\nprovide strategies for recomposing the findings in the\ncontext of larger systems (Bechtel 2016; Gross & Green\nforthcoming). Systems in this context thus generally refer to\nlarge networks of integrated components exhibiting non-linear\ndynamics. However, there is no unified view of what constitutes a\nsystems-approach (Calvert 2010; Calvert & Fujimura 2011). As\nclarified below, systems biology comprises different research\npractices with different ties to molecular biology, genomics, as well\nas to non-biological disciplines (see also Krohs & Callebaut\n2007). \nSystems biology research is sometimes divided into a\nsystems-theoretical and a pragmatic stream\n(O’Malley and Dupré 2005). The former is historically\nrelated to the initial use of the term ‘systems biology’\nin 1968, denoting the merging of systems theory and biology\n(Mesarović\n 1968).[1]\n This definition has been taken up as providing a theoretical vision\nand reorientation also for modern systems biology (Wolkenhauer &\nMesarović 2005; Drack & Wolkenhauer 2011).\nSystems-theoretical proponents view systems biology as an opportunity\nto revive important theoretical questions that for half a century\nstood in the shade of the success of experimental biology. Examples of\nsuch questions are what characterizes living systems and whether\ngeneric organizational principles can be identified (see\n Section 3.2).\n In contrast, the pragmatic stream views systems biology as a\nsuccessor of genomics and as a powerful extension of molecular\nbiology. This stream is sometimes referred to as molecular systems\nbiology (De Backer et al. 2010), and practitioners within this field\nrelate the emergence of systems biology to the production of data\nwithin genomics and other high-throughput technologies from the late\n1990s and onwards (Güttinger & Dupré 2016). \nKrohs and Callebaut (2007) consider omics-disciplines a third\ndimension or root of systems biology due to the impact of data-rich\nmodeling strategies on the development of the\n approach.[2]\n Omics fields allowed for large-scale measurements of co-expression\nbetween vast number of genes or associated protein concentrations.\nSince modeling tools in molecular biology were considered limited for\nhandling large quantitative datasets, researchers turned to the\nexploration and further development of mathematical and computational\nstrategies developed in engineering and physics (Alberghina &\nWesterhoff 2005). Although not all systems biologists put equal\nemphasis on the prospects of big data, they share the view that\nmathematical and computational approaches are required to account for\nbiological complexity. \nThe first international conference on systems biology was held in 2000\n(at the first Systems Biology Institute in Tokyo), and thematic\njournal issues and dedicated journals quickly followed (Kitano\n2002a,b). Since then, many systems biology research institutions have\nemerged, and large-scale international collaborations have been\ninitiated. \nResearch practices in systems biology can in part be understood\nthrough an examination of characteristics and implications of\ndifferent styles of representation. Whereas textbooks and research\npapers in molecular and cell biology typically contain mechanistic\ndiagrams tracking interactions between specific genes and proteins,\nrepresentations in systems biology often display interactions between\na vast number of molecular components as abstract networks of\ninterconnected nodes and links. This difference in representational\nstyle is epistemically significant, because it highlights an\nincreasing focus on the organizational structure of the system as a\nwhole. \nBy conducting correlation-based studies of how multiple genes and\nproteins are associated with each other, and how these are connected\nto specific biological processes, systems biology research has\nrevealed common patterns in biological networks such as scale-free\nnetwork architectures and multi-level hierarchies (Ravasz et al.\n2002). Systems biologists often distinguish between two major classes\nof networks based on their connectivity distribution (how components,\nor nodes, in the network are connected to other nodes).\nExponential and scale-free network structures are\nillustrated on\n Figure 1\n (for details on the differences, see Albert et al. 2000). An\nexponential network is largely homogeneous with approximately the same\nnumber of links per node, and it is unlikely to find nodes with many\nlinks. In contrast, scale-free networks are inhomogeneous. Most nodes\nhave only a few links but some nodes (called hubs) have a large number\nof\n connections.[3] \nFigure 1: An example of a network\nrepresentation in systems biology, showing the difference between an\nexponential network and a scale-free network. Red\nnodes are the five nodes with most links, green nodes are the first\nneighbors of red nodes (from Albert et al. 2000: 379, reprinted by\npermission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature, copyright 2000). \nInterestingly, many real-world networks such as social networks, the\nWorld Wide Web, and regulatory networks in biology display scale-free\narchitectures. This raises important questions about whether\nreal-world networks can be related to more generic structural types\nwith characteristic functional capacities. The scale-free structure\nmakes the average path length between any two nodes in the network\nsmall, and this structure has therefore been associated with\ncapacities for coordinated regulation throughout the network (Albert\net al. 2000). Moreover, scale-free networks exhibit a high error\ntolerance, understood as robustness against failure of random\nnodes and links (e.g., random gene deletion). These functional\nproperties are not shared by exponential networks. However, the\nfunctional importance of hubs in scale-free networks at the same time\nresults in fragility to attacks on central notes (Albert et al. 2000;\nBarabási & Oltvai 2004). Similarly, a multi-layered network\nstructure called a bow-tie network connects many inputs and\noutputs through a central core (the knot of the bow-tie) that consists\nof a small number of elements (Kitano & Oda 2006). This structure\nhas been associated with efficient information flow, but also with\nfragility towards perturbations of the intermediate nodes in the core\nof the network. \nSome systems biologists examine network architectures in the hope that\nsmaller functional units or patterns can be identified that are akin\nto modules in electronic networks (Hartwell et al. 1999). One example\nof pattern-detection within large datasets has received special\nattention from philosophers of science, namely research on so-called\nnetwork motifs. \nNetwork motifs are defined as “patterns of interaction that\nrecurs in a network in many contexts” (Alon 2007: 268). By\ncomparing the gene regulatory network of the bacterium E.\ncoli to random networks, it was discovered that a few circuit\npatterns occurred more frequently than expected by chance (Shen-Orr et\nal. 2002). Statistically significant circuits were defined as network\nmotifs. Two examples of network motifs are shown in\n Figure 2,\n called coherent and incoherent feedforward loops (cFFL and iFFL). \nFigure 2: Two examples of network motifs, the\ncoherent and incoherent feedforward loop (cFFL and iFFL). The diagrams\nrepresent the regulation of a gene Z, via a direct path between a\ntranscription factor X to Z, and an indirect connection from X via\nanother gene or transcription factor Y to Z. Arrows represent gene\nactivation (+) and a vertical bar inactivation (-). In a coherent\nfeedforward loop (cFFL), all connections are activating. In the\nincoherent feedforward loop (iFFL), the path from Y to Z inhibites\ngene expression. (Adapted from Alon 2007: 47). \nAkin to common circuit types in electronic networks, it was\nhypothesized that the recurring wiring patterns may indicate\ngeneralizable functional behaviors. Mathematical analysis suggested\nthat the cFFL may function as a sign-sensitive delay element that\nfilters out noisy inputs for gene activation (e.g., sporadic levels of\nnutrients in the environment). In contrast, the regulatory function of\nthe iFFL was hypothesized to be an accelerator that creates a rapid\npulse of gene expression in response to an activation signal. These\npredicted functions have been experimentally demonstrated in living\nbacteria (Mangan et al. 2003). Moreover, similar and additional\nnetwork motifs have been found in other species and in other\nregulatory networks important to cell-signaling, metabolism, and\ndevelopmental processes (Alves & Sorribas 2011; Peter &\nDavidson 2015; Tyson & Novák 2010). Such results have\nsparked interesting debates on whether network motifs could be seen as\ndesign principles, whose functions are generalizable across\ndifferent biological contexts (see\n Section 2.3). \nPhilosophers and scientists alike have debated the implications of\nresearch focusing on generic properties of biological networks, rather\nthan the properties of specific molecular components (e.g.,\nBarabási 2002; Bechtel 2015a,b; Craver 2016). Among the\ncontroversial issues is how the enhanced focus on topological\nproperties relates to more traditional mechanistic explanations in\nbiology\n (Section 4.2).\n A related issue is whether functional capacities can be derived from\nan analysis of network architectures alone. Some systems biologists\nand philosophers have pointed to the limitations and possible biases\nassociated with inferences of functions from automated\npattern-detection in datasets (Calvert 2012; Keller 2005; Krohs 2012;\nsee also Prill et al. 2010). Specifically, some have called for a more\ndynamic approach that can account for the context of the whole network\nand how it changes over time. \nNetwork approaches have recently been extended to also study temporal\naspects of coordinated protein-protein interactions in cell cycles and\nevolutionary dynamics (de Lichtenberg et al. 2005; Hogeweg 2012;\nKnight & Pinney 2009). Of scientific as well as philosophical\nrelevance is whether and how these approaches can extend mechanistic\nstrategies in molecular biology by identifying how multiple biological\nprocesses are organized and coordinated in time (Green et al.\nforthcoming), and how network analysis can inform evolutionary biology\n (Section 3.3). \nWhereas engineering-inspired systems biologists search for functional\nunits or modules in biological networks, another line of research\nemphasizes the need for a ‘global’ approach inspired by\ndynamical systems theory (Huang et al. 2009; Jaeger & Crombach\n2012). Drawing on Waddington’s idea of the epigenetic landscape\nof cell differentiation, the global approach represents dynamical\nstates in a network through vectors, attractors, and trajectories in a\nstate space (Huang 2012; for a philosophical analysis, see Fagan\n2012). The framework explores how inherent mathematical properties of\nthe network architectures may constrain developmental and evolutionary\nprocesses, in a way analogous to how laws of motion constrain the\npossible planetary movements (Goodwin et al. 1993). The global\napproach is sometimes highlighted as being in opposition to\nmechanistic or “modular” engineering approaches (Huang\n2011; Fagan 2016). Controversies of this kind can reveal interesting\ndifferences in research aims as well as different standards for models\nand explanation present in systems biology\n (Section 5.1). \nSystems biologists often describe their approach as one occupied with\nfunctional, rather than evolutionary questions (Boogerd et\nal. 2007; Hofmeyr 2007). By stressing the autonomy of functional\nbiology, philosophy of systems biology can help balance the extensive\nemphasis on evolutionary biology in philosophy of biology (Pradeu\n2016). At the same time, evolutionary systems biology has\nrecently emerged as a new research approach aiming to extend both\nsystems biology and evolutionary biology\n (Section 3.3). \nAnother recent extension of systems biology is the emergence of\nsystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology.\nSystems biology has from the outset been associated with ambitiouns to\nsolve grand societal challenges. Examples are the aims to provide a\nbetter understanding of complex diseases like cancer, and the vision\nof developing patient-specific models that will allow for\nindividualized disease prediction and prevention\n (Section 5.3). \nThe aforementioned aims are often pursued through large-scale\ninternational collaborations where many research teams provide data\nand models to be integrated in complex models of whole cells (e.g.,\nThe Virtual Cell Project), whole organs (e.g., the\nVirtual Liver Project), and even the whole human body (e.g.,\nThe Virtual Physiological Human and the Physiome\nProject). Such projects raise new exciting questions for\nphilosophy of science concerning strategies for model building and\nmodel validation (Carusi 2014). Moreover, they provide new sources for\nphilosophical discussions on reduction and explanation\n (Section 4)\n and on the societal applications of big data biology\n (Section 5). \nThe term synthetic biology was used already in the 1970s and 1980s,\nbut the development of synthetic biology in its modern context is also\nconnected to genomics (Morange 2009; O’Malley 2009; Gelfert\n2013). In the wake of big data production around year 2000,\ncomprehensive gene regulatory networks could be constructed that\nallowed for more systematic and ambitious design projects. Just like\nsystems biologists commonly define their approach in opposition to the\nfocus on isolated molecules or pathways in molecular biology, so is\nsynthetic biology sometimes framed as a system-oriented approach that\nmoves beyond isolationist approaches in genetic engineering\n(O’Malley et al. 2008). Also in this context, however, the ties\nto precursors are diverse, and there are different views on whether\nmodular approaches are compatible with biological complexity (see\nbelow). \nThe term synthetic biology became an official label with the first\nSynthetic Biology Conference in 2004, organized by Drew Endy and Tom\nKnight at MIT (Bensaude-Vincent 2013). Drew Endy’s\nBioBrickTM standard has become a paradigm example of the\naim to realize an engineering program by designing and assembling\nmodular parts (Endy 2005). But the relation to engineering is complex,\nand synthetic biology displays a plurality of epistemic aims, visions\nand methodological frameworks. \nA central research aim in synthetic biology is to modify metabolic\npathways so as to control biochemical reactions and produce chemicals\nof societal value. Examples are biofuels, oils, rubber, biomedical\ncompounds, and flavoring substances such as vanillin (Jensen &\nKeasling 2015). Synthetic organisms may also be designed for\nbioremediation. Genetically modified microorganisms can for instance\nwork as biosensors that detect toxic chemicals or help clean up\ncontaminated soil and water by metabolizing toxic compounds (Khalil\n& Collins 2010). Many efforts are also directed towards\nimprovements of biomedical research and clinical practices, e.g.,\nthrough synthetic vaccines, diagnostic tools, and personalized cancer\ntreatments (Christiansen 2016b). \nMuch of synthetic biology research can be characterized as\napplication-oriented innovations that utilize and modify biological\nstructures. But not all practices fit this description. Some synthetic\nbiologists pursue a basic science approach to understand the origin of\nlife or the conditions for minimal life\n (Section 3.2).\n Others are driven by the wish to create artificial life in the lab,\ninspired by von Neumann’s (1966) vision of a self-reproducing\nautomaton. This aim may be achieved through the design of macroscale\n‘living technology’ (Bedau 2009). Examples are 3D printers\nthat can print biological tissue structures and perhaps—with\ntime—also replicate\n themselves.[4]\n Thus, synthetic biology is an umbrella term covering very diverse\nresearch practices. \nExamining the diversity of knowledge-making practices in synthetic\nbiology, O’Malley et al. (2008) suggest a distinction between\nDNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell\nengineering, and protocell creation. \nDNA-based device construction, or what Benner and Sismour\n(2005) characterize more broadly as the engineering trend, explores\nthe extent to which interchangeable and functionally distinct\ncomponents can be designed and implemented in a modular fashion. The\nBioBrick Foundation is a paradigmatic example of this approach\n(biobricks.org). The guiding principles for this approach are\nstandardization, decoupling, and abstraction of parts and functional\ndescriptions (Endy 2005). Examples of DNA-based devices are the\nrepressilator (Elowitz & Leibler 2000, see\n Section 2.1),\n the synthetic toggle switch (Gardner et al. 2000; see\n Section 2.3),\n as well as production of synthetic artemisinin for antimalarial drugs\n(Keasling 2010). The orientation towards functional devices and\nmachine-like control is also explicit in the so-called iGEM\ncompetition (Genetically Engineered Machine) where student teams\ncompete in the task of constructing genetically engineered biological\nsystems to address societal problems. Whether the ideal of\nconstructing standardized and replaceable parts is compatible with\nbiological complexity is an ongoing topic of debate\n (Sections 2\n and\n 3). \nGenome-driven cell engineering in synthetic biology departs\nfrom the modularity assumption held by practitioners of DNA-based\ndevice construction by focusing on the functioning of whole genomes or\nwhole cells (O’Malley et al. 2008). This practice includes\ntransplantation of foreign or modified genomes into empty\n‘chassis cells’ to acquire new functions (Chan et al.\n2005), and synthesizing minimal genomes (Andrianantoandro et al.\n2006). The notion of a minimal genome highlights the idea\nthat existing organisms may have genomes more complex than necessary\nfor the basic functions of survival and reproduction. The human\nparasite Mycoplasma genitalium has been considered a model\norganism for the exploration of such questions due to its small\ngenome, and it has also been the target for the first whole-cell model\nin systems biology (Karr et al. 2012). In 2010, scientists at the J.\nCraig Venter Institute (JCVI) created a synthetic genome of another\nbacterial species of the same genus, Mycoplasma mycoides\n(Gibson et al. 2010). From the synthetic DNA sequence, the researchers\ncould partly control the production of new Mycoplasma\nmycoides cells. This genome was recently further reduced to a\nworking approximation for the simplest synthetic minimal genome\n(JCVI-syn 3.0), allowing cells to function and reproduce with only 473\ngenes (Hutchison et al. 2016; see also Sung et al. 2016). At the same\ntime as lower boundaries for biological complexity are explored, other\nsynthetic biologists aim to manipulate and control the functions of\ngenomes of more complex species, such as yeast and algae (Calvert\n& Frow 2015; Georgianna & Mayfield 2012). \nThe third category of synthetic biology, protocell creation,\ntakes on the ambitious aim to construct simple approximations of\nliving cells de novo (O’Malley et al. 2008).\nResearchers within this stream are often interested in the fundamental\nquestion of what life is, and the notion of applied science may not be\nan appropriate description of this research approach (see\n Section 3.2).\n Historically, the theoretical discussion of what life is has often\nbeen coupled to wet-lab synthesis of compounds associated with early\nor minimal\n life.[5]\n Synthetic biology takes this approach further through synthesis and\nmanipulation of vesicles resembling primitive cells, as well as\nthrough advanced computational simulations of gene regulatory networks\n(Luisi 2006; Kauffman 2015). This research practice connects to\nprojects within genome-driven cell engineering investigating the\nminimal requirements for a living system to function, survive, and\nreproduce. Research on protocells may focus primarily on understanding\nthe origin of life as we know it, or aim to create synthetic life\nforms in other and simpler ways (Rasmussen et al. 2008). \nDeplazes (2009) has suggested the following extended classification of\npractices within synthetic biology: i) bioengineering, ii) synthetic\ngenomics, iii) protocell synthetic biology, iv) unnatural molecular\nbiology, and v) in silico approaches (see\n Figure 3).\n While the categories of work on protocells and synthetic genomes\noverlap with the categorization by O’Malley et al. (2008),\nDNA-based device construction is here further divided into\nbioengineering (exemplified by assembly standards like\nBioBricksTM) and unnatural molecular biology.\nUnnatural molecular biology aims to create systems with different\ncomponents, e.g., artificial nucleic acids based on a different coding\nsystem. Philosophers have debated whether the term\n‘unnatural’ distinguishes practices in synthetic biology\nfrom other bioengineering approaches (Lewens 2013; Preston 2013). But\nthe emphasis on synthetic artifacts underscores the affinity to\nsynthetic chemistry and perhaps also to the ‘chemist style of\nthinking’, emphasizing synthesis and invention in addition to\nanalysis and discovery (Bensaude-Vincent 2009, 2013, 2015). \nFigure 3: Schematic representation of\nthe five categories of synthetic biology and their connections. (From\nDeplazes 2009: 431, Copyright 2009 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nreprinted by permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). \nDeplazes’ fifth category, in silico synthetic biology,\nfocuses on the development and practical implementation of computer\nsimulations. Deplazes argues that in silico synthetic\nmodeling should be a distinct category because many of the\ncomputational models have “little or no direct reference to\nliving organisms” (Deplazes 2009: 430). As\n Figure 3\n illustrates, computer simulations are central to all research\npractices in synthetic biology. But the characteristics of various\nroles of simulations can shed new light on philosophical discussions\nof the relation between models and target systems, and between\nmodeling, experimentation, and synthesis (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013a,b; Carusi et al. 2012). \nAbstracting from the variety of research practices, a distinctive\nfeature of synthetic biology is that it aims “to go beyond mere\nmodeling and to treat biological systems as fully constructible\nobjects” (O’Malley 2009: 381; see also Schyfter 2013).\nThus, synthetic biology opens new philosophical questions concerning\nthe relation between synthesis and analysis, between artificial and\nnatural target systems, and between machine and organism (Holm &\nPowell 2013; Nordman 2015). \nSystems and synthetic biology offer new opportunities to reconsider\nthe relative prospects and limitations of engineering approaches for\nbiological research (Braillard 2015; Calcott et al. 2015). Engineering\napproaches are often considered inadequate to grasp biological\ncomplexity. Specifically, design thinking has often been associated\nwith adaptationism, i.e., the assumption that biological traits are\noptimally “designed” by natural selection (Orzack &\nForber 2010). Accordingly, critics have argued that the engineering\napproach may lead to a simplified understanding of evolution as driven\nsolely by natural selection (Lynch 2007). But whereas some approaches\nin systems biology can be described as adaptationist (Green 2014), it\ncannot be assumed that design approaches always entail adaptationist\nimplications. It has been argued that systems biologists typically\nadopt a ‘thin’ notion of design focusing primarily on the\nrelations between structures and functions (Green et al. 2015b).\nBecause research in systems and synthetic biology often is often\ndissociated from evolutionary considerations, these research practices\nmay force philosophers to reexamine the concepts of biological\nfunction and design beyond traditional aetiological\naccounts (Holm 2012; Preston 2008). \nIt is, however, still debatable whether the thin notion of design is\ncompatible with biological complexity. Some scholars have raised\nconcerns that the machine-view of organisms may lead to a neglect of\ndistinct biological features such as autonomy, evolvability, and\nintrinsic purposiveness (Nicholson 2013: 669; see also Jacob 1977;\nKogge & Richter 2013). Design approaches may implicitly enforce\nthe view that operations and outputs of specific parts are stable and\npredictable across different contexts. In biology, context-sensitivity\nand degeneracy between genotype-phenotype-relations provide severe\nlimitations to the utility of this heuristic (Boudry & Pigliucci\n2013; Güttinger 2013; see also\n Section 3.1).\n Yet, as outlined in the following sections, the ties to engineering\nare multi-faceted in both systems and synthetic biology. \nFeynman’s ‘last blackboard’ statement in 1988 that\n“what I cannot create, I do not understand” is often cited\nin the context of synthetic biology and has sparked philosophical\nreflections on the relation between understanding and design\n(O’Malley 2009; Holm 2012; Calvert & Frow 2013). Although\nsynthetic biology is distinct from systems biology in the explicit aim\nto design synthetic systems, it is often described as a practice\nrelying on systems biology as a theoretical foundation for design\n(Barrett et al. 2006). \nSynthetic and systems biology are sometimes described through the\ncomplementary aims of forward and reverse engineering. Forward\nengineering refers to the design of systems with novel functions,\noften by drawing on an existing high-level model (e.g., an existing\ncode or living cell). Forward engineering, or re-engineering, can lead\nto more complex systems, but simplicity may also be pursued through\nimplementation of a more abstract coding language or through reduction\nor rewiring of (genetic) circuits. Reverse engineering refers\nto the aim to understand the functioning of a system\n‘backwards’ by examining an existing system in contexts\nwhere consulting a design protocol is not an option. The search for\nrecurring network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is an example of how systems biologists may reverse engineer the\nstructure of a system to understand its functional capacities. Because\nfunctional features such as robustness are not only important to the\nsurvival oforganisms but also to design problems in engineering,\nreverse engineering of organizational features that underpin such\ncapacities is an important aim in both fields (Hartwell et al. 1999;\nCsete & Doyle 2002; Kitano 2004; Stelling et al. 2004). \nIn engineering, the notion of reverse engineering is often associated\nwith the aim to identify generic features of system design, or\ndesign principles, that can be reused in new systems.\nSimilarly, the notion of reverse engineering is often used in research\ncontexts in systems biology where the aim is to identify biological\ndesign principles that can increase the understanding of\nstructure-function relations across different systems (Csete &\nDoyle 2002; Doyle & Stelling 2006; Voit 2003). \nSystems and synthetic biology not only adopt mathematical tools from\nelectronic and control engineering but also a conceptual framework in\nwhich biological functions are understood in terms of control\nprinciples and generic representations such as feedback control\n(Gramelsberger 2013; MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b). The search for\nfunctional principles, with applications to different systems in\nbiology and engineering, dates back to the ideals of cybernetics and\nbiochemical systems theory (Wiener 1948; Savageau 1976). Negative\nfeedback control has long been a central principle in mechanical and\nelectronic engineering to maintain stable concentrations and minimize\nfluctuations. An important insight from cybernetics is that the same\nformalization can also describe biological processes, e.g., where a\nreaction is inhibited as a result of accumulation of the product of\nthe same reaction. An abstract model of negative feedback can\ntherefore denote a functional principle that holds for a larger class\nof systems (Green & Wolkenhauer 2013). \nCharacteristic of the search for design principles in modern systems\nbiology is that the strategy is enforced through automated\npattern-detection in network models based on large biological\ndatasets, as exemplified by the search for network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1).\n The hope is that simple control principles, using e.g., positive and\nnegative feedback, can make up basic building blocks of biological\nfunctioning such as filters, switches, oscillators, amplifiers,\ndetectors etc. (Alon 2007; Tyson et al. 2003). One such example is the\nso-called toggle-switch, a simple regulatory circuit that is\nconsidered a design principle in both systems and synthetic\nbiology. \nLike a toggle-switch that turns an electrical device ON or OFF,\ngenetic toggle-switches have been found to regulate many biological\nprocesses such as the cell cycle of budding yeast and developmental\nprocesses in fruit flies (Tyson et al. 2003; Jaeger & Crombach\n2012). A genetic toggle-switch is a double-negative feedback loop that\nshifts the system between two distinct stable states of gene\nexpression—allowing synthesis of one protein while another is\nrepressed. Synthetic biologists have succeeded in constructing a\nsynthetic toggle switch in E. coli (Gardner et al. 2000), and\nthe toggle switch is now considered part of the design composites or\n‘computational templates’ for building new synthetic\nsystems (Choffnes et al. 2011; Humphreys 2004). The dynamic behavior\nof genetic toggle-switches have also been investigated in studies of\nparameter spaces for robust functioning of network motifs (Tyson &\nNovák 2010), and in approaches combining the modeling framework\nof dynamical systems theory with reverse engineering of gene\nregulatory networks from experimental data (Huang et al. 2009; Jaeger\n& Crombach 2012). \nBecause of the abstract nature of proposed design principles, an\ninteresting philosophical question is how such strategies relate to\ndiscussions about the possibilities of laws in biology. Biological\nsystems are often taken to be too contingent, diverse, and\ncontext-dependent to allow for derivation of laws or general\nprinciples akin to those found in physics (Burian et al. 1996). The\nquest for design principles in biology is therefore an interesting\ntest case to explore whether more abstract descriptions of generic\nfeatures of functional organization can be formulated also in the\ncontext of biology (Green 2015b). A related question is how the\nenhanced focus on generic principles and topological features of\nbiological networks relates to mechanistic accounts of biological\nexplanation\n (Section 4.2). \nAn important question for such debates is whether generalizable\nfunctions can be inferred from organizational structures, relatively\nindependently of cellular, organismal, and environmental contexts.\nCommenting on the proposal of network motifs as design principles,\nsome systems biologists have questioned whether functional\n‘units’ can be meaningfully isolated from the workings of\nthe network as a whole (Huang 2011; Isalan et al. 2008). The search\nfor network motifs and other functional units make apparent that\nsystems biology research does not necessarily give up assumptions of\nmodularity. Rather, than departing from strategies of decomposition\n(Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]; see\n Section 1),\n the notion of modularity may be reconfigured via strategies for\nstructural decomposition of larger networks (Alon 2007).\nWhether systems biology presents more holistic approach to biological\ncomplexity is therefore an issue of debate in both philosophy of\nscience and systems biology itself. \nEngineering is often promoted through the idea of rational design.\nSome synthetic biologists have adopted a similar vision of synthetic\norganisms as structures that can be assembled via replaceable and\nstandardized components, akin to Lego-bricks (front cover of\nScience, 2 September 2011 [333(6047)]). Yet, philosophers\nhave argued that the actual research practices in synthetic and\nsystems biology paint a different picture (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013a, 2014). \nRather than following a fixed design protocol, research in synthetic\nbiology often progresses through what is taken to be the opposite of\nrational design, namely kludging: a solution that is klumsy,\nlame, ugly, dumb but good\nenough (O’Malley 2009, 2011b). The research process can\nperhaps be described as reverse and forward tinkering, in\nwhich opportunities for modular decomposition and recomposition are\nexplored in iterative cycles to arrive at piecemeal solutions. Some\nhave argued that synthetic biology exhibits a reflexive double bind to\nengineering, because the design assumptions guiding the construction\nof the synthetic systems are continuously reevaluated (Knuuttila &\nLoettgers 2013a). That is, synthetic biology does not only progress\nthrough similarities between biology and engineering. Through the\nexploration of engineering approaches, important differences (or\nnegative analogies) between biological and engineered systems\nare discovered (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2014) \nAn example of a possible negative analogy discussed in this context is\nthe role of noise in biological versus engineered systems. In\nengineering, oscillations are often associated with noise and lack of\nprecision, but oscillatory dynamics are characteristic of many\nbiological processes including metabolism and day and night rhythms\n(Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a; see also Bechtel 2016). To study\noscillations in gene expression, synthetic biologists at the Elowitz\nlab constructed a synthetic genetic circuit called the\nrepressilator (Elowitz & Leibler 2000). The repressilator\nwas designed to test whether the oscillatory dynamics of gene\nexpression could be mathematically described via connected feedback\nloops in a simple regulatory circuit and implemented in a synthetic\nmodel. \nInterestingly, important insights resulted from the repressilator\nbecause it failed to produce regular oscillations as\npredicted by the underlying mathematical model. The mismatch between\nthe mathematical and synthetic model led to a reevaluation of the\nassumptions underlying the deterministic mathematical model (Knuuttila\n& Loettgers 2013a, 2014). Subsequent investigation of the dynamics\nof a stochastic version of the same model suggested that noise may be\nan inherent feature of oscillations in gene expression in living\ncells. The exploration of the functional role of noise and the\npotentials for stochastic modeling has since developed into an\nimportant research program of interest to biologists and engineers\nalike (Briat et al. 2016; Munsky et al. 2009; O’Malley 2011b).\nThe repressilator and similar examples also sparked debates on whether\ndesign procedures in synthetic biology need to account for cellular\ncontexts, distributed organization of functions, and other features\nthat are unlike modular machines (Güttinger\n 2013).[6] \nTo what extent the ideal of precision engineering is pursued in\nsynthetic biology is therefore debatable. Some have stressed the\ncentrality of the engineering perspective because the construction of\nsynthetic models is guided by knowledge on which design principles can\nbe expected to create specific dynamic behaviors (e.g., Gramelsberger\n2013). Others have emphasized that synthetic modeling, as a kind of\nmaterial recomposition strategy, offer material constraints\nthat always involve open-ended aspects (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013b). The latter view highlights exploratory features of the\ntriangulation of mathematical, computational, and synthetic\napproaches. The notion of exploratory experimentation has\nalso been used to characterize research processes in systems biology\nwhere scholars search for structural and functional patterns in\nbiological networks without being driven by a specific biological\nhypothesis (O’Malley & Soyer 2012; Steinle 1997). Research\non network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is one example where engineering approaches were applied in an\nexploratory fashion to guide the generation of hypotheses on\nbiological functions (Alon 2007). Also in this context, the analysis\nmay lead to a reevaluation of design assumptions, e.g., whether the\nfunctions of network motifs are independent of the network context\nthey are embedded in (Isalan et al. 2008). \nIt should also be noted that synthetic biologists often aim to produce\nbiological technology that is more machine-like than natural organisms\n(Kastenhofer 2013a,b; O’Malley 2011b). An alternative response\nto biological complexity may therefore be to make the designed system\nsimpler, for instance through genetic rewiring that ensures a higher\ndegree of modularity (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). The explicit\naim to simplify synthetic models has been interpreted as a sign of the\nacknowledgment of biological complexity, and it is therefore debated\nwhether thecriticism of the machine-view in synthetic biology is\nmisguided (cf., Holm 2015; Nicholson 2013). The heuristic value of\ndesign approaches is, however, an ongoing topic of debate in both\nsystems and synthetic biology. \nUnlike DNA-based device construction and genome-driven cell\nengineering, synthetic biologists in the practice of protocell\ncreation engage in classical theoretical discussions on what life\nis, and how it originated and evolved (O’Malley et al. 2008;\nLuisi 2006). This research stream connects to discussions of the\nfundamental properties of life in systems biology (Cornish-Bowden\n2006; Letelier et al. 2011; Wolkenhauer and Hofmeyr 2007) and\nphilosophy (Bich 2010; Bich & Damiano 2007; Bedau & Cleland\n2010; Moreno & Mossio 2015). \nOne strand of research attempts to design minimal cells resembling\nearly cellular life-forms. Inspired by Maturana and Varela’s\n(1972/1980) formulation of autopoiesis, some synthetic biologists\nexperiment on conditions for minimal cells through chemical models\nthat combine the continuous formation and destruction of the\ncompartment (the cell membrane) with metabolic processes inside the\ncell (e.g., Zepik et al. 2001). This research program specializes in\nsynthesis of lipid compartments, such as vesicles, to study\ncoordinated processes that possibly resemble self-maintenance in the\npre-biotic world (Luisi 2006). Moreover, vesicles have been used to\nexperiment on how catalytic molecules such as ribozymes and peptides\ncould become entrapped in lipid compartments and create precursors for\nmetabolic circuits (de Souza et al. 2014). \nAn important research goal is to provide a model for the fundamental\nfeatures that distinguish living systems from the non-living. So far,\nhowever, there is no consensus on the defining features of life\n(Tirard et al. 2010). Whether this should be seen as a disappointment,\nindicating the uselessness of attempts to define life, is an ongoing\nissue of philosophical debate (Cleland 2012; Ruiz-Mirazo et al. 2010).\nDifferent views on this question may depend on different\ninterpretations of what the project of defining life entails in\nphilosophy and science, e.g., whether the aim is to establish\ndemarcate a natural kind (Cleland 2012) or to provide operational\ndefinitions of practical use in model and theory construction (Bich\n& Green 2017; Luisi 1998). More specific topics of debate are\nwhether definitions of life must include Darwinian evolution, how\nevolution and units of selection should be defined, and whether it is\nfruitful to attempt to categorize all the varieties of life forms\nunder one definition (Dupré & O’Malley 2009; Laland\net al. 2009; Szostak et al. 2001) \nSystems biologists engaging in debates on the properties of life often\nstress the relevance of insights from classical philosophers. Examples\nare references to Aristotle or Kant in discussions on whether our\ncurrent notion of causation can adequately capture how parts and\nwholes in living systems stand in reciprocal causes and effect\nrelationships (Drack & Wolkenhauer 2011; Hofmeyr 2017). Other\nimportant sources of inspiration are Rosen’s formalization of\nmetabolism-repair systems, (mathematical) general systems theory, and\ncategory theory (e.g., Drack 2015; Rosen 1991; Mesarović et al.\n2004; Letelier et al. 2011). The systems-theoretical stream is also\ninfluenced by mathematical biophysics (Rashevsky 1961),\nWaddington’s theoretical biology (Fagan 2012), Biochemical\nSystems Theory (Savageau 1976; Hofmeyr 2007), and classical\nsystems-oriented physiology (Noble 2008). \nSystems-theoretical and organizational accounts often highlight the\nfunctional roles of constraints, autonomy, and causal closure of the\nprocesses of self-maintenance (Moreno & Mossio 2015; Wolkenhauer\n& Hofmeyr 2007). While also stressing the utility of the search\nfor general principles, some prefer the term organizing\nprinciples instead of design principles (Mesarović et al.\n2004; Green & Wolkenhauer 2013). This choice of terminology\nsignals the view that understanding living systems requires a\nsystems-theoretical approach in a broader sense than cybernetics. An\nintriguing question in this context is whether a different kind of\nformal or mathematical framework is required—one that is adapted\nto biology rather than to engineering or physics (Bich & Damiano\n2008; Gramelsberger 2017; Rosen 1991). \nAnother debated issue in discussions about the fundamental properties\nof life is the relative priority of autonomy, openness and\ncollaboration. Whereas much research in philosophy and origin of life\nhas focused on individual organisms, recent insights from microbiology\nhave extended the focus on individual cells to also include the\ncollaborative interactions of cell colonies (Dupré &\nO’Malley 2009; Bich & Green 2017). A recent experiment in\nsynthetic biology investigated the dynamics of colonies of giant\noleate-based vesicles under hypothesized prebiotic conditions (Carrara\net al. 2012). The experiment showed that that the permeability of the\nvesicles to catalysts and macromolecules were much higher for the\ncolonies, compared to individual vesicles. In some cases, the colonies\nalso attracted each other and exchanged material. The results raise\nimportant questions about whether life has arisen from\n‘cooperative mechanisms’ between prebiotic systems, and\nwhether we need to rethink ontological assumptions about what\nconstitutes a ‘unity of life’. \nSystems biology is often defined as an approach primarily concerned\nwith functional questions (Boogerd et al. 2007). Evolutionary systems\nbiology (ESB) explicitly seeks to expand this focus through\ninvestigations of the evolutionary dynamics of interacting networks\n(Soyer 2012). ESB aims to put the results of systems biology in a\nproper evolutionary context and also to enhance and extend current\nevolutionary biology. Specifically, ESB aims to develop more detailed\nmodels of genotype-phenotype maps to study causal changes over\nevolutionary time-scales and to enhance the predictive potential of\nevolutionary models. These aims are pursued by combining methods from\nmolecular and evolutionary biology with in silico evolution,\ncomparative genomic analysis, as well as with dynamical modeling of\nnetwork architectures that are reverse engineered from large\nexperimental datasets (Soyer & O’Malley 2013). \nESB can be considered a meeting ground not only for systems biology\nand evolutionary biology but also for the integrated study of\ndevelopmental phenomena in an evolutionary perspective (O’Malley\net al. 2015). Systems biology complements statistical sequence\nanalysis in population genetics and studies of constraints on\nevolutionary pathways in EvoDevo through in silico modelling\nof large data-sets (Jaeger & Crombach 2012; Kim et al. 2011;\nKnight & Pinney 2009). Recently, ESB also draws on synthetic\nmodelling of intracellular networks to investigate how the\nevolutionary potential of a lineage is affected by specific\ncombinations of mutations (Palmer & Kishony 2013). \nAn important line of investigation in ESB examines the evolutionary\nbackground for global network architectures, modular structures, and\nrecurring network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1;\n see also Krohs 2009). The structures may have arisen due to natural\nselection, but ESB also takes seriously the possibilities that\npatterns can arise as side-effects of genomic evolution and drift, or\nfrom a combination of selective and non-selective factors (Knight\n& Pinney 2009; Steinacher & Soyer 2012). An example of an\ninsight from simulations of evolving yeast networks is that\nhierarchical structures with an overabundance of network motifs\n(feedforward loops) can emerge by non-selective tinkering\nwith promoter regions (Cordero & Hogeweg 2006). In extended\nmodels, the integrated effects of selective and non-selective factors\ncan be studied at multiple levels (Hogeweg 2012). With the emphasis on\npattern-generation and the potential for future evolutionary change,\nESB takes up Hugo de Vries’ challenge to explain not only the\nsurvival of the fittest but also the arrival of the\nfittest (Wagner 2012, 2014). The hope is that evolutionary simulations\ncan extend evolutionary biology by providing a forward-looking\naccount. \nEvolutionary biology has traditionally been considered as a historical\ndiscipline that provides explanations without giving predictions. ESB\noffers an opportunity to develop more detailed models of evolving\ngenotype-phenotype relations and to explore whether some evolutionary\npathways are predictable given enough information about the network\nstructures, dynamic states, and environmental conditions. Unlike\nforward engineering in synthetic biology, the aim is not to shape new\ndesigns but to understand the possible trajectories of change under\ndifferent conditions. That is, ESB goes beyond historical accounts in\nexploring the potential for evolvability or innovation—what some\nhave called the ‘tinkering potential’ of system evolution\n(Koonin & Wolf 2010). Research on evolvability can, however, also\ninform and inspire functional analysis and design in synthetic biology\n(Calvert & Frow 2015; Lewens 2013). Thus, the relation between\nbiology and engineering must also be reexamined in this context. \nThe need to account for tinkering and contingency in evolution is\noften taken to highlight the limitations of engineering approaches in\nbiology (Jacob 1977; Lynch 2007). Interestingly, however, some systems\nbiologists and philosophers emphasize that a non-adaptationist\nframework can be reached through further cross-fertilization of\nbiology and engineering (Calcott et al. 2015). ESB opens for an\nextended view on engineering by considering engineering fields with\nfocus on modification of existing systems. For instance, there are\ninteresting similarities between evolvability in biology and\na diachronic engineering goal in software engineering, where\nthe aim is to design systems that can be adapted to future functional\nrequests without having to rewrite the code from scratch (Calcott\n2014). \nThe ambition to predict evolutionary trajectories, even for simple\norganisms, may turn out to be extremely difficult. But ESB provides\nnew ways to investigate whether evolutionary pathways follow some\nrecognizable dynamical patterns. Simulations of how gene regulatory\nnetworks change over evolutionary time-scales can be coupled to\nexperimental evolution in bacteria or insects. For instance, the\ndevelopment of bacterial antibiotic resistance has been shown to be\nconstrained by interactions between different mutations (Weinreich et\nal. 2006). Such insights are expected to make evolutionary biology\ninformative also for the development and combination of antibiotics\nused in medical treatment (Toprak et al. 2012; Palmer & Krishony\n2013). \nSome proponents expect that ESB will uncover regularities or stable\nevolutionary patterns across various types of networks and species.\nSuch regularities may not resemble universal laws, but the hope is\nthat some general principles underlying evolutionary dynamics can be\nidentified, referred to as “laws of evolution” (Koonin\n2011), “evolutionary design principles” (Steinacher &\nSoyer 2012) or “generic principles” of evolution (Jaeger\n& Monk 2013). ESB thus offers excellent cases for debating the\npossibility of turning evolutionary biology into a more predictive\nfield with generalizable principles (Lobkovsky & Koonin 2012; Papp\net al. 2011). Moreover, it is a rich field for discussing the\nimplications of an ‘extended modern synthesis’ that\ncombines molecular, mathematical, computational, synthetic, and\npopulation genetic approaches to evolution (Pigliucci 2007;\nO’Malley et al. 2015). \nWith the emphasis on systems and interacting networks, both systems\nand synthetic biology explicitly engage in one of the oldest\nphilosophical discussions on the relationship between the whole and\nits parts, or between holism and reductionism. This section examines\nhow classical questions are reframed in the new light of strategies\nfor large-scale data production and dynamic modeling. \nAs mentioned in the introduction, proponents of systems biology often\nexplicitly define their approach in contrast to reductionist\nstrategies in molecular biology. Molecular biology is depicted as a\nfield studying molecular components and pathways in isolation, whereas\nsystems biology integrates the pieces of the puzzle in the context of\nthe system as a whole (van Regenmortel 2004; Keller 2005; Kitano\n2002a,b). The contrast between molecular biology and systems biology\nis often overstated, and much of systems biology research is also\nfocused on specific molecular difference-makers (De Backer et al.\n2010; Gross 2017; O’Malley & Dupré 2005). However,\nsystems biology may give a novel interpretation of Aristotle’s\ndictum that the whole is more than the sum of the parts by\nspecifying what more means in the context of contemporary\nbiology. \nWhen systems biologists criticize reduction in molecular biology, the\nissue at stake is typically the limitations of studying biological\nparts or modules in isolation. Because the target of the criticism\noften differs from the more traditional philosophical focus on\nreduction of higher-level to lower-level explanations (Brigandt &\nLove 2017, the notion of modular reductionism has been\nsuggested (Gross & Green forthcoming). An anti-reductionist stance\ntowards modular reductionism needs not reject the idea that living\nsystems can be modelled and explained bottom up. For\ninstance, while global approaches within these fields reject the\nmodularity assumption, some keep the focus on genomes and molecular\nnetworks as the primary determinants of biological functions\n(O’Malley et al.\n 2008).[7] \nMany systems biologists have, however, also argued against reduction\nof higher-level models and explanations, and there is an ongoing\ndebate about how far genomics, proteomics, etc. will take us in\nsolving complex problems like understanding cancer (cf.,\nBarabási et al. 2011; Hood et al. 2015; Wolkenhauer & Green\n2013). Similarly, researchers involved in projects aiming to simulate\nmultiscale structures like the human heart emphasize the need to\ninclude macroscale parameters as they provide functionally important\nconstraints on the behavior of microscale processes (Bassingthwaighte\net al. 2009; Kohl & Noble 2009). An interesting reframing of\nAristotle’s dictum in this discussion is that living systems at\nthe same time are more and less than the sum of the\nparts (see Hofmeyr 2017; Noble 2012). In other words, the system as a\nwhole constrains the degree of freedom of lower-level parts and\nprovides a functional organization of these that are required for some\nsystem capacities (see below). \nGiven the increasing emphasis on comprehensive multiscale models,\nsystems biology research may have a unique potential for philosophical\ninsights considering the explanatory role of macroscale properties and\ntop-down effects. Systems biologists for instance point to how enzyme\nactivity is constrained by the chemical environment and the cellular\ncontext (Hofmeyr 2017), or how the biophysical properties of muscle\nfibers and cell membranes provide functional constraints on ionic\noscillations central to the generation of heart rhythms (Noble 2012).\nInterpreting top-down effects as constraining relations may exemplify\nwhat philosophers of science have called ‘medium downward\ncausation’ (Emmeche et al. 2000), which interprets downward\ncausation as boundary conditions. Noble (2012) explicitly endorses\nsuch a view when arguing that downward causation is necessary by\npointing out how equations describing the kinetics of ion channels in\ncardiac modeling cannot be solved without defining the boundary\nconditions (e.g., the cell voltage). Multi-scale modeling may thus\nhelp to give a more concrete mathematical reinterpretation of the\ncontroversial notion of downwards causation (see also Ellis et al.\n2011; Gross & Green forthcoming). Moreover, discussions of\ndownward causation in systems biology have practical as well as\ntheoretical implications for cancer research as some proponents\ndisagree on whether cancer is a genetic or tissue-based disease\n(Bertolaso 2011; Soto et al. 2008; see also\n Section 5.3). \nDiscussions of downward causation are often connected to debates about\nwhether biological systems exhibit emergent properties.\nEmergence in the context of systems biology typically means that\nsystems properties are explanatorily irreducible to the properties of\nparts (also called synchronic emergence). However, it is debatable\nwhich sense of emergence (weak or strong) systems biology supports\n(cf., Alberghina & Westerhoff 2005; Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007;\nEmmeche et al. 2000; Kolodkin et al. 2011). Moreover, systems\nbiologists have different views on whether biological systems also\nexhibit diachronic emergence, i.e., system properties that\nare inherently unpredictable (Ellis et al. 2011). \nSome systems biologists stress that biological complexity forces life\nscientists to draw on abstract and idealized models, and that there\nare practical and in principle limitations to our ability to fully\npredict and control living systems (Noble 2012; Bassingthwaighte et\nal. 2009). Others are more optimistic that the limitations can be\novercome by upscaling computational models. Some even argue that\nsystems biology breaks with the methodological principle of\nOckham’s razor (Kolodkin & Westerhoff 2011; see also Hofmeyr\n2017; Gross 2017). These debates center on fundamental questions about\nhow far biological research can be taken by integrating more\nparameters and data points (Kolodkin et al. 2012), and how far we can\n‘extend ourselves’ through computational approaches\n(Humphreys 2004; Vermeulen 2011). \nLarge-scale modeling projects such as the Vitual Cell, the\nPhysiome Project, and the Virtual Physiological Human\noffer exciting cases for philosophical analysis of the prospects and\nchallenges associated with parameterizing and validating complex\nmodels (Carusi et al. 2012; Carusi 2014; Hunter et al. 2013).\nUltimately, such projects may push the boundaries for prediction and\ncontrol in the life science, or may reveal deeper challenges of\nbiological complexity. \nSystems biology also brings new insights to discussions of scientific\nexplanation. The integration of different disciplinary inputs and\nemphasis on mathematical modeling make systems biology a particularly\ninteresting case for discussions of whether the mechanistic account\ncan fully capture the diversity of explanatory practices in\ncontemporary biology. \nMechanistic accounts initially emphasized the differences between the\nexplanatory ideal of covering laws in physics and explanations in\nmolecular biology (Craver & Tabery 2015). Mechanistic explanations\ncite how biological functions arise from the interactions and\norganization of component parts or entities (Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Machamer et al. 2000; Glennan 2002). Since research in systems\nbiology is often integrated with research in molecular and cell\nbiology, some have argued that many cases in systems biology can\nreadily be seen as an extension of mechanistic research (Boogerd et\nal. 2013; Richardson & Stephan 2007). However, the increasingly\nimportant role of mathematical and computational modeling for\nunderstanding non-linear dynamics, cyclic organization, and complex\nfeedback relations have led some proponents to argue for a modified\naccount of dynamic mechanistic explanations (Bechtel &\nAbrahamsen 2011, 2012; Brigandt\n 2013).[8] \nInspired by network analysis in systems biology, proponents of the\ndynamical mechanistic account have further argued for increased\nattention to strategies of abstraction used to identify organizational\nfeatures and generalizable aspects of mechanisms (Bechtel 2015b; Levy\n& Bechtel 2013). The emphasis on spatial organization and mutual\nrelations between components may possibly be better described as\nconstitutive rather than causal aspects (Fagan\n2015). Whereas causal relations are often prioritized in mechanistic\naccounts (or the two aspects conflated), distinguishing between these\ncan help identify the distinct contributions of causal mechanistic\nmodeling and mathematical analysis of network dynamics. To account for\ncase examples from systems biology, Fagan (2015) suggests a joint\naccount of collaborative explanations in which diverse\nperspectives are combined to account for the mutual relations of\nspatial organization and binding among components as well as the\ncausal relations in the system. \nWhereas the aforementioned accounts emphasize the importance of\nmathematical modeling for an updated mechanistic account, others view\nthe emphasis on quantitative and dynamic aspects as a departure from\nmechanistic explanations. The interpretation of network models is\noften conducted in an abstract mathematical or engineering-inspired\nframework, and it has been stressed that it is hard or perhaps\nimpossible to reconstruct a causal story from these models (Issad\n& Malaterre 2015; Gross 2015). Insofar as mathematical models are\nprimarily used as inputs to or heuristics for mechanistic\nexplanations, e.g., as mechanistic schemas, the reliance on these\nmodeling strategies do not provide a challenge for mechanistic\naccounts (Darden 2002; Matthiessen 2015). Yet, although abstract\nmodeling is compatible with mechanistic research, an important\ncontested issue is whether abstract models are developed towards\nresearch aims that are distinct from mechanistic explanations. \nSome have pointed to examples where the modeling process does not\nproceed from abstract to more detailed models but in the opposite\ndirection, suggesting that mechanistic details may be vehicles for\nmore generic explanations rather than the other way around (Braillard\n2010; Green & Jones 2016). It has been argued that systems\nbiologists sometimes aim for non-causal explanations. One candidate of\nnon-causal explanations, called topological explanations,\nemphasizes how networks architectures generically determine dynamic\nbehaviors, independently of the causal details of the network (Huneman\n2010). Mathematical analysis of network structures underlying\nbiological robustness has been argued to exemplify this explanatory\ngoal (Jones 2014). \nAnother candidate is what Wouters (2007) in the context of comparative\nphysiology calls design explanations. Design explanations do\nnot describe how a biological function is causally produced but\nclarify why a given design (and not an alternative design) is present.\nThey do so by pointing to constraints on the possible designs that\nmake some designs good, some suboptimal, and others impossible (see\nShinar & Feinberg 2011 for a candidate example from systems\nbiology). The relevance of design explanations for systems biology\nlies in the interest to specify relations between functional\ncapacities (e.g., robustness) and system organization (e.g., integral\nfeedback control) via design principles that are independent of\nspecific contexts of implementation (Braillard 2010; Boogerd\n2017). \nOthers have discussed whether explanations in systems biology are\nmergers of mathematical explanations and mechanistic\nexplanations (Baker 2005; Brigandt 2013; Mekios 2015) or introduce a\nnew explanatory category called Causally Interpreted Model\nExplanations (Issad & Malaterre 2015). These proposals are\nnot considered as alternatives to mechanistic accounts but are\nproposed as ingredients in a pluralistic approach to biological\nexplanation (Brigandt et al. forthcoming; Mekios 2015). There is,\nhowever, currently no consensus on whether the differences are\nsufficiently significant to support an explanatory pluralism involving\nnon-mechanistic explanations. \nAlthough much, or perhaps most, of the philosophical work on systems\nbiology has focused on explanation, one cannot assume that explanation\nis the sole aim of systems biology research (MacLeod & Nersessian\n2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b). Philosophers have debated whether research\non the relation between biological robustness and integral feedback\ncontrol should be considered as a stepping-stone for mechanistic\nexplanations, or whether the perspective from control engineering\nconstitute a non-mechanistic explanatory framework (Braillard 2010;\nBrigandt et al. forthcoming; Matthiessen 2015; Green & Jones\n2016). But another important reason why some systems biologists seek\ngenerality and simplicity of their models may be that they—like\nsynthetic biologists—wish to explore whether the same function\ncould be realized in other or simpler ways (Briat et al. 2016). Thus,\nmathematical and computational modeling in synthetic and systems\nbiology also call for philosophers to examine other epistemic aims\nthan explanation. Examples are prediction, control, and design, and\nwell as theoretical and practical interests in understanding the\nminimal requirements for biological functions and life itself.  \nLarge-scale interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly\nhighlighted as a necessary requirement for addressing the grand\nchallenges of modern science and society (Vermeulen 2010; Calvert\n2010; Andersen 2016). Since interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of\nsystems and synthetic biology, both approaches offer rich sources for\nphilosophical analysis of the epistemic features of interdisciplinary\nintegration (O’Malley & Soyer 2012), interdisciplinary\nidentities (Calvert 2012), and of large-scale collaboration across\ndifferent universities (Calvert & Frow 2015; for examples of\nlarge-scale projects see the list of internet resources below). \nStudying the prospects and challenges of interdisciplinary integration\nalso offers a window to the cognitive processes involved in\ninterdisciplinary problem-solving, where research cannot rely on a\nsingle theoretical framework (MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b).\nThrough this process, different epistemic ideals operating in\ncontemporary science often become apparent. While combining different\nconceptual frameworks can lead to innovation and scientific progress,\nthe existence of different epistemic standards and values can also\npose challenges for interdisciplinary collaboration (Calvert &\nFujimura 2011; Carusi 2011; Kastenhofer 2007; Rowbottom 2011).\nPhilosophical analysis has been proposed to help facilitate\ncollaboration in situations where epistemic standards clash.\nPhilosophy of science can help explicate the differences and the\nbackgrounds for these, and uncover ‘blind spots’\nconsidering the aims, values, constraints, and challenges of other\ndisciplines (Nersessian 2017). \nOne divide that is commonly highlighted is the gap between\nexperimental biologists and modelers with a background in engineering,\nmathematics, or physics. Empirical analyses of collaborations between\nmodelers and experimentalists in systems biology show that these two\ngroups often have different views on what kinds of data and models are\nmost relevant (Nersessian 2017; Rowbottom 2011). For instance,\nmodelers may not be interested in studying biological systems at the\nsame level of detail as experimental biologists, and experimentalists\nmay find highly abstract and idealized models inspired by physics or\nengineering misleading. From the perspective of engineers or\nphysicists, the preoccupation with molecular details involves a risk\nof missing out on dynamic patterns that could be captured with more\ngeneric models (Lazebnik 2002). Experimentalists, in contrast, may\nfind that such generic models often lack specificity or merely\nreproduce current biological knowledge (Fagan 2016). These differences\nmay in part be grounded in different explanatory standards. It has\nbeen suggested that experimentalists typically aim for mechanistic\nexplanations, whereas modelers often aim for more generic models or\nformulation of law-like principles and explanations (Fagan 2016; Green\net al. 2015a). \nMaking explanatory standards and values more explicit, and clarifying\nthe relative prospects and limitations of different research\nstrategies, are ways in which philosophy of science could contribute\nto science and science education. At the same time, collaborative\npractices in synthetic and systems biology may call for an extension\nof the scope of philosophical analysis. Whereas philosophers\ntraditionally have focused on logical and argumentative relations in\nscientific texts, understanding collaborative practices in systems and\nsynthetic biology may further require the exploration of the\naesthetic, cognitive, and creative dimensions of scientific practice\n(Carusi 2011; Ginsberg et al. 2015). Important questions are which\naspects underlie choices of visualization strategies, and how the\nrepresentation of biological data through diagrams, heat maps, network\nmodels, or state spaces influence biological reasoning and\ncollaboration (Abrahamsen & Bechtel 2015; Carusi 2012; Jones &\nWolkenhauer 2012). \nThe emergence of systems biology and synthetic biology in the 21th\ncentury is to a large extent driven by the development of techniques\nand strategies for producing, digitalizing, collecting, disseminating,\nand standardizing data. A first step in these research practices is\noften to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for\ndata sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of\nexperimental datasets (Leonelli 2016). For instance, the search for\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n started with the development of network models based on data\ndownloaded from the database RegulonDB as well as other sources\n(Shen-Orr et al. 2002). Numerous databases, bio-ontologies, and\nsoftware tools have been developed, emphasizing the ideals of Open\nData and large-scale collaborative efforts (Leonelli 2013). These\npractices raise questions as to whether some projects within systems\nand synthetic biology may be described as ‘big science’\n(Vermeulen 2010), and about the epistemic and social implications of\ndata-intensive research practices and collaborations. \nA highly debated issue is the extent to which big data will radically\nchange or even revolutionize scientific methods, shifting the focus\nfrom hypothesis-driven inquiry to data-driven discoveries (e.g., Allen\n2001; Kell & Olivier 2004; Mazzocchi 2015). The massive\ndata-production and investments in collection and curation of data\nmake possible the development of more comprehensive models which some\nexpect to be more predictive (Hood et al. 2015). Data-intensive\nstrategies are sometimes application-oriented, e.g., the use of\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to identify biomarkers for\ngenomic risk profiling (Maher 2008; Hey 2015). Yet, data are often\nproduced and compiled without specific aims in mind and are used and\nreused for multiple purposes (Leonelli 2016). Data-intensive systems\nbiology research thus highlights the need to reconsider the relation\nbetween data and evidence, and between basic and applied science. \nWhereas some have seen data-intensive strategies as a more bias-free\napproach, others have criticized the idea that data can speak for\nthemselves and pointed to problematic aspects of top-down pattern\ninference from large datasets (Kell & Olivier 2004; Krohs 2012).\nImportant philosophical questions are therefore whether new insights\ncan result from data-intensive strategies, and how choices concerning\ncollection, sampling, standardization, visualization, and\ninterpretation of data affect the result of the analysis.\nSpecifically, the results of correlation-based methods such as GWAS\nare sensitive to sampling procedures and specific statistical\nthresholds, and the clinical validity and utility of genetic\nbiomarkers is a debated issue (e.g., Hey 2015; Maher 2008; McPherson\nand Tybjaerg-Hansen 2016). \nSince the aim of bio-ontologies is to provide a standardized language\nand repository for shared information, choices concerning vocabulary\nand categorizations become important philosophical topics. Since the\ncall for standardization may be compromised by context-dependencies of\ndata production and use, data-curation and the creation of data\ninfrastructures are gaining currency as topics within philosophy of\nscience and social science (Leonelli 2016). Data-intensive practices\nalso have implications for the institutional organization of science,\nas exemplified by the push for open access on one hand and commercial\ninterests in big data on the other (Calvert & Frow 2015;\nKastenhofer 2013a,b; Leonelli 2013, 2014; Royal Society 2012;\nVermeulen 2011). As contexts for ownership of data change, also\nreward-systems in terms of authorship and credits may need to be\nreconsidered (Ankeny & Leonelli 2015). \nSystems biology and synthetic biology are expected to help address\nsocietal challenges with payoffs for biomedical research, health care,\nand environmental resource management. While offering new exciting\npotentials, concerns have also been raised about the social and\nethical implications of the new techno-scientific strategies. \nSystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology, aims for\nmajor breakthroughs towards understanding of complex diseases such as\ncancer and heart conditions (Voit & Brigham 2008; Wolkenhauer et\nal. 2013). Ambitious projects within systems biology such as the\nVirtual Physiological Human raise intriguing questions about\nhow computational modeling will influence future biomedical research\n(Kohl & Noble 2009; Kolodkin et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2013).\nMulti-scale cardiac models are already being developed with important\nimplications for the potential to address physiological variability,\nand for philosophical discussions of model validation and the relation\nbetween experiment and simulation (Carusi et al. 2012; Carusi\n2014). \nOne of the important problems in contemporary medicine is how to\naccount for patient-specific variation. Systems medicine is sometimes\nhighlighted as a route to so-called personalized medicine (Hood &\nFlores\n 2012)[9]\n or digitalized medicine (Topol 2012). Proponents are optimistic that\nlarge-scale modeling of patient-specific data can result in a\nparadigm-shift from a one-size-fits-all model in traditional medicine,\ntoward a more efficient systemic approach that can tailor disease\nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment to individual patients. The aim\nto personalize medicine is as old as the medical profession itself,\nbut it is now promoted through data-intensive computational strategies\nwith exciting new potentials (Tutton 2014). Moreover, the potential\ncombination of systems medicine and synthetic biology opens for a\nconstructive personalized medicine, where predictive modeling\nand synthetic interventions could be combined (O’Malley\n2011a). \nDevelopments in systems and synthetic biology have encouraged\nphilosophers to revisit traditional conceptions of disease as\ndysfunctional states (Holm 2013, 2014), or broken mechanisms (Gross\n2011). Rather than focusing on the function or dysfunction of specific\nmechanisms, network approaches to disease may suggest a more dynamic\napproach to disease focusing on how network states can be reorganized\n(Del Sol et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2009). Since cancer research is a\nmajor priority of systems biology research, epistemic and social\nimplications of cancer research can be expected to gain more attention\nin future philosophy of systems biology (Bertolaso 2016). \nIn 2005, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was launched to catalogue\ncancer-related mutations through tumor sequencing. TCGA and similar\ndevelopments in cancer genomics have revealed an astonishing diversity\nof tumor types, suggesting that finer-grained disease-categories may\nbe needed. This line of research has opened new research venues, such\nas the development of multi-action remedies targeting numerous\ndisease-related pathways identified via genomic analysis. The\ndiscovered diversity of mutations identified in sequenced tumors has,\nhowever, also led to heated debates on whether the behavior and\nidentity of cancer cells can fully be understood through the current\nfocus on somatic mutations. Some have stressed the need to move beyond\ngene-centric or cell-centric approaches and to consider cancer as a\nproblem of tissue-organization (Soto & Sonnenschein 2011). These\ndebates have philosophical implications for discussions about\n(downward) causation and reductionism as well as practical\nimplications for how cancer should be approached experimentally\n(Bertolaso 2011; Soto et al. 2008). \nData-intensive strategies aiming to identify biomarkers and genetic\nrisk factors are expected to improve prediction, early detection, and\nprevention of common diseases (Hood & Flores 2012; Hood et al.\n2015). Against this optimism, some have raised concerns about\nuncertainties and potential harmful results associated with genetic\nrisk profiling, including the risk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary\nmedicalization of healthy individuals (Green & Vogt 2016; Vogt et\nal. 2016a,b). Since predictive modeling as envisioned in systems\nmedicine is dependent on access to patient-specific data, concerns\nregarding data security and social responsibilities are also brought\nup (Juengst et al. 2012). Philosophers and social scientists have for\ninstance critically examined how risk information is communicated to\nthe public by companies capitalizing on personalized genomics, and\ndiscussed how such information may affect health outcomes and\nperceptions of health (Bartol 2013; Prainsack 2014; Reydon et al.\n2012). More generally, systems medicine has spurred debates about\nwhether the vision to predict and control future health outcomes is\ncompatible with a humanistic approach to medicine and social\ncomplexity (Tutton 2014; Vogt et al. 2014). \nEthical implications associated with the issue of control are also\ndebated in the context of synthetic biology, e.g., through reflections\non whether the attempt to create synthetic organisms may downgrade the\nvalue of or respect for life (cf. Douglas et al. 2013; Christiansen\n2016a). Other ethical debates in synthetic biology consider the risk\nof negative consequences of specific synthetic applications.\nDiscussions often involve so-called dual-use problems where the\nbenefits of genetically modified organisms are weighted against\npotential problems and risks. Examples are biohazards associated with\nintentional or unintentional release of synthetic pathogens, or the\npossibility that synthetic production of biomedical compounds opens\nfor efficient and inexpensive production of illegal drugs\n(Christiansen 2016b). \nFinally, concerns have been raised about the commercialization of\nbiotechnologies in both systems and synthetic biology. Examples are\napplications of broad patents concerning minimal genomes or synthetic\ngenes (O’Malley et al. 2008), and vested interests in access to\nhealth data and lowering of diagnostic thresholds (Vogt et al. 2016a).\nSocioeconomic concerns have also been raised that industrial\nproduction via synthetic organisms may outcompete conventional farming\nin developing countries (Christiansen 2016b). Thus, the strong push to\naddress societal problems through systems and synthetic biology gives\nrise to new exciting possibilities but also calls for critical\nexamination from philosophers and social scientists. \nSystems and synthetic biology are often described as distinguishable\nin their emphasis on analysis versus synthesis, but the ties to\nengineering approaches are complex and multi-faceted in both fields.\nSystems and synthetic biology have been addressed together in this\nentry because many scientific and philosophical issues overlap. Both\napproaches draw inspiration from engineering, mathematics, physics,\nand computer science, but in various different ways and towards the\ndifferent aims of understanding, predicting, and modifying biological\nsystems. Accordingly, both approaches provide excellent sources for\nphilosophical discussions of interdisciplinary integration,\nparticularly the implications of the increasing embedding of\nmathematical and computational approaches in biology. Some practices\nencourage philosophers to revisit classical philosophical topics such\nas reductionism and scientific explanation, but systems and synthetic\nbiology also broaden the scope of philosophical topics to include\ndata-intensive practices and modeling strategies towards the aims of\ndesign and control. \nSince this entry has examined the philosophical implications of both\nsystems biology and synthetic biology, much attention has been given\nto the implications of engineering approaches, including the quest for\nso-called design principles. It is, however, important to note that\nsystems biology and synthetic biology cover a broad spectrum of\nresearch practices, some of which are more strongly inspired by\nchemistry or physics than engineering. This entry should thus be taken\nas an attempt to only cover some ground of the vast philosophical\nlandscape that these research fields reach into. With the rapid\ndevelopment of both approaches and their explicit aim to address grand\nscientific and societal challenges, exciting times lie ahead for\nphilosophy of biology.","contact.mail":"sara.green@ind.ku.dk","contact.domain":"ind.ku.dk"}]
