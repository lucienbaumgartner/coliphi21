Although it would be possible to accept (or reject)\nrealism across the board, it is more common for philosophers to be\nselectively realist or non-realist about various topics: thus it would\nbe perfectly possible to be a realist about the everyday world of\nmacroscopic objects and their properties, but a non-realist about\naesthetic and moral value. In addition, it is misleading to think that\nthere is a straightforward and clear-cut choice between being a\nrealist and a non-realist about a particular subject matter. Rather,\none can be more-or-less realist about a particular subject matter.\nAlso, there are many different forms that realism and non-realism can\ntake. \n\n\nThe question of the nature and plausibility of realism is so\ncontroversial that no brief account of it will satisfy all those with\na stake in the debates between realists and non-realists. This article\noffers a broad brush characterization of realism, and then fills out\nsome of the detail by looking at a few canonical examples of\nopposition to realism. The discussion of forms of opposition to\nrealism is far from exhaustive and is designed only to illustrate a\nfew paradigm examples of the form such opposition can take. Note that\nthe point of this discussion is not to attack realism, but rather to\ngive a sense of the options available for those who wish to oppose\nrealism in a given case, and of the problems faced by those main forms\nof opposition to realism. \n\n\nThere are two general aspects to realism, illustrated by looking at\nrealism about the everyday world of macroscopic objects and their\nproperties. First, there is a claim about existence. Tables,\nrocks, the moon, and so on, all exist, as do the following facts: the\ntable’s being square, the rock’s being made of granite,\nand the moon’s being spherical and yellow. The second aspect of\nrealism about the everyday world of macroscopic objects and their\nproperties concerns independence. The fact that the moon\nexists and is spherical is independent of anything anyone happens to\nsay or think about the matter. Likewise, although there is a clear\nsense in which the table’s being square is dependent on us (it\nwas designed and constructed by human beings after all), this is not\nthe type of dependence that the realist wishes to deny. The realist\nwishes to claim that apart from the mundane sort of empirical\ndependence of objects and their properties familiar to us from\neveryday life, there is no further (philosophically\ninteresting) sense in which everyday objects and their properties can\nbe said to be dependent on anyone’s linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, or whatever.\n\n\nIn general, where the distinctive objects of a subject-matter are\na, b, c, … , and the distinctive\nproperties are F-ness, G-ness, H-ness and\nso on, realism about that subject matter will typically take the form\nof a claim like the following:\n\n\nGeneric Realism:\na, b, and c and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as F-ness,\nG-ness, and H-ness is (apart from mundane empirical\ndependencies of the sort sometimes encountered in everyday life)\nindependent of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, and so on.\n\n\n\nNon-realism can take many forms, depending on whether or not it is the\nexistence or independence dimension of realism that is questioned or\nrejected. The forms of non-realism can vary dramatically from\nsubject-matter to subject-matter, but error-theories, non-cognitivism,\ninstrumentalism, nominalism,relativism, certain styles of\nreductionism, and eliminativism typically reject realism by rejecting\nthe existence dimension, while idealism, subjectivism, and\nanti-realism typically concede the existence dimension but reject the\nindependence dimension. Philosophers who subscribe to quietism deny\nthat there can be such a thing as substantial metaphysical debate\nbetween realists and their non-realist opponents (because they either\ndeny that there are substantial questions about existence or deny that\nthere are substantial questions about independence).\n\nThree preliminary comments are needed. Firstly, there has been a great\ndeal of debate in recent philosophy about the relationship between\nrealism, construed as a metaphysical doctrine, and doctrines in the\ntheory of meaning and philosophy of language concerning the nature of\ntruth and its role in accounts of linguistic understanding (see\nDummett 1978 and Devitt 1991a for radically different views on the\nissue). Independent of the issue about the relationship between\nmetaphysics and the theory of meaning, the well-known disquotational\nproperties of the truth-predicate allow claims about objects,\nproperties, and facts to be framed as claims about the truth of\nsentences. Since: \n‘The moon is spherical’ is true if and only if the moon is\nspherical,\n \nthe claim that the moon exists and is spherical independently of\nanyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices and conceptual schemes,\ncan be framed as the claim that the sentences ‘The moon\nexists’ and ‘The moon is spherical’ are true\nindependently of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes and so on. As Devitt points out (1991b: 46)\navailing oneself of this way of talking does not entail that one sees\nthe metaphysical issue of realism as ‘really’ a semantic\nissue about the nature of truth (if it did, any question about any\nsubject matter would turn out to be ‘really’ a semantic\nissue). \nSecondly, although in introducing the notion of realism above mention\nis made of objects, properties, and facts, no theoretical weight is\nattached to the notion of a ‘fact’, or the notions of\n‘object’ and ‘property’. To say that it is a\nfact that the moon is spherical is just to say that the object, the\nmoon, instantiates the property of being spherical, which is just to\nsay that the moon is spherical. There are substantial metaphysical\nissues about the nature of facts, objects, and properties, and the\nrelationships between them (see Mellor and Oliver 1997 and Lowe 2002,\npart IV), but these are not of concern here. \nThirdly, as stated above, Generic Realism about the mental or the\nintentional would strictly speaking appear to be ruled out ab\ninitio, since clearly Jones’ believing that Cardiff is in\nWales is not independent of facts about belief: trivially, it is\ndependent on the fact that Jones believes that Cardiff is in Wales.\nHowever, such trivial dependencies are not what are at issue in\ndebates between realists and non-realists about the mental and the\nintentional. A non-realist who objected to the independence dimension\nof realism about the mental would claim that Jones’ believing\nthat Cardiff is in Wales depends in some non-trivial sense on\nfacts about beliefs, etc. \nThere are at least two distinct ways in which a non-realist can reject\nthe existence dimension of realism about a particular subject matter.\nThe first of these rejects the existence dimension by rejecting the\nclaim that the distinctive objects of that subject-matter exist, while\nthe second admits that those objects exist but denies that they\ninstantiate any of the properties distinctive of that subject-matter.\nNon-realism of the first kind can be illustrated via Hartry\nField’s error-theoretic account of arithmetic, and non-realism\nof the second kind via J.L. Mackie’s error-theoretic account of\nmorals. This will show how realism about a subject-matter can be\nquestioned on both epistemological and metaphysical grounds. \nAccording to a platonist about arithmetic, the truth of the\nsentence ‘7 is prime’ entails the existence of an\nabstract object, the number 7. This object is abstract\nbecause it has no spatial or temporal location, and is causally inert.\nA platonic realist about arithmetic will say that the number\n7 exists and instantiates the property of being prime independently of\nanyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and\nso on. A certain kind of nominalist rejects the existence claim which\nthe platonic realist makes: there are no abstract objects, so\nsentences such as ‘7 is prime’ are false (hence\nthe name ‘error-theory’). Platonists divide on their\naccount of the epistemology of arithmetic: some claim that our\nknowledge of arithmetical fact proceeds by way of some\nquasi-perceptual encounter with the abstract realm (Gödel 1983),\nwhile others have attempted to resuscitate a qualified form of\nFrege’s logicist project of grounding knowledge of\narithmetical fact in knowledge of logic (Wright 1983, Hale 1987, Hale\nand Wright 2001). \nThe main arguments against platonic realism turn on the idea that the\nplatonist position precludes a satisfactory epistemology of\narithmetic. For the classic exposition of the doubt that platonism can\nsquare its claims to accommodate knowledge of arithmetical truth with\nits conception of the subject matter of arithmetic as causally inert,\nsee Benacerraf (1973). Benacerraf argued that platonism faces\ndifficulties in squaring its conception of the subject-matter of\narithmetic with a general causal constraint on knowledge (roughly,\nthat a subject can be said to know that P only if she stands\nin some causal relation to the subject matter of P). In\nresponse, platonists have attacked the idea that a plausible causal\nconstraint on ascriptions of knowledge can be formulated (Wright 1983\nCh.2, Hale 1987 Ch.4). In response, Hartry Field, on the side of the\nanti-platonists, has developed a new variant of Benacerraf’s\nepistemological challenge which does not depend for its force on\nmaintaining a generalised causal constraint on ascriptions of\nknowledge. Rather, Field argues that ‘we should view with\nsuspicion any claim to know facts about a certain domain if we believe\nit impossible to explain the reliability of our beliefs about that\ndomain’ (Field 1989: 232–3). Field’s challenge to\nthe platonist is to offer an account of what such a platonist should\nregard as a datum—i.e. that when ‘p’ is\nreplaced by a mathematical sentence, the following schema holds in\nmost instances: \nIf mathematicians accept ‘p’ then p.\n(1989: 230)\n \nField’s point is not simply, echoing Benacerraf, that no causal\naccount of reliability will be available to the platonist, and\ntherefore to the platonic realist. Rather, Field suggests that not\nonly has the platonic realist no recourse to any explanation of\nreliability that is causal in character, but that she has no recourse\nto any explanation that is non-causal in character either.  \nThis suggests the following dilemma for the platonic realist: \nTherefore, \nWhether there is a version of platonic realism with the resources to\nsee off Field’s epistemological challenge is very much a live\nissue (see Hale 1994, Divers and Miller 1999. For replies to Divers\nand Miller see Sosa 2002, Shapiro 2007 and Piazza 2011, Paseau\n2012). \nField’s alternative proposal to platonic realism (1980, 1989) is\nthat although mathematical sentences such as ‘7 is prime’\nare false, the utility of mathematical theories can be explained\notherwise than in terms of their truth. For Field, the utility of\nmathematical theories resides not in their truth but in their\nconservativeness, where a mathematical theory S is\nconservative if and only if for any nominalistically respectable\nstatement A (i.e. a statement whose truth does not imply the\nexistence of abstract objects) and any body of such statements\nN, A is not a consequence of the conjunction of\nN and S unless A is a consequence of\nN alone (Field 1989: 125). In short, mathematics is useful,\nnot because it allows you to derive conclusions that you\ncouldn’t have derived from nominalistically respectable premises\nalone, but rather because it makes the derivation of those\n(nominalistically respectable) conclusions easier than it might\notherwise have been. Whether or not Field’s particular brand of\nerror-theory about arithmetic is plausible is a topic of some debate,\nwhich unfortunately cannot be pursued further here (see Hale and\nWright 2001). \nAccording to Field’s error-theory of arithmetic, the objects\ndistinctive of arithmetic do not exist, and it is this which leads to\nthe rejection of the existence dimension of arithmetical realism, at\nleast as platonistically conceived (for a non-platonistic view of\narithmetic which is at least potentially realist, see Benacerraf 1965;\nfor incisive discussion, see Wright 1983, Ch.3). J. L. Mackie, on the\nother hand, proposes an error-theoretic account of morals, not because\nthere are no objects or entities that could form the subject matter of\nethics (it is no part of Mackie’s brief to deny the existence of\npersons and their actions and so on), but because it is implausible to\nsuppose that the sorts of properties that moral properties would have\nto be are ever instantiated in the world (Mackie 1977, Ch.1). Like\nField on arithmetic, then, Mackie’s central claim about the\natomic, declarative sentences of ethics (such as ‘Napoleon was\nevil’) is that they are systematically and uniformly false. How\nmight one argue for such a radical-sounding thesis? The clearest way\nto view Mackie’s argument for the error-theory is as a\nconjunction of a conceptual claim with an ontological claim (following\nSmith 1994, pp. 63–66). The conceptual claim is that moral facts\nare objective and categorically prescriptive facts, or, equivalently,\nthat our concept of a moral property is a concept of an objective and\ncategorically prescriptive quality (what Mackie means by this is\nexplained below). The ontological claim is simply that there are no\nobjective and categorically prescriptive facts, that objective and\ncategorically prescriptive properties are nowhere instantiated. The\nconclusion is that there is nothing in the world answering to our\nmoral concepts, no facts or properties which render the judgements\nformed via those moral concepts true. Our moral (atomic) moral\njudgements are systematically false. We can thus construe the argument\nfor the error-theory as follows: \nSo, \nSo, \nThe conclusion of this argument clearly follows from its premises, so\nthe question facing those who wish to defend at least the existence\ndimension of realism in the case of morals is whether the premises are\ntrue. (Note that strictly speaking what the argument purports to\nestablish is that there are no moral facts as-we-conceive-of-them.\nThus, it may be possible to block the argument by advocating a\nrevisionary approach to our moral concepts; or by deploying a\nRamsey-Carnap-Lewis conception of theoretical terms and arguing that\nthere are moral facts, just ones that do not answer to our concept but\nwhich (coming closer than other candidates) would best deserve the\n“moral fact” label (see Smith 1994), section 2.10 for a\ngood explanation of the application of the Ramsey-Lewis-Carnap\nconception in the moral case). \nMackie’s conceptual claim in effect amounts to the claim that\nour concept of a moral requirement is the concept of an objectively,\ncategorically prescriptive requirement. What does this mean? To say\nthat moral requirements are prescriptive is to say that they tell us\nhow we ought to act, to say that they give us reasons for acting.\nThus, to say that something is morally good is to say that we ought to\npursue it, that we have reason to pursue it. To say that something is\nmorally bad is to say that we ought not to pursue it, that we have\nreason not to pursue it. To say that moral requirements are\ncategorically prescriptive is to say that these reasons are\ncategorical in the sense of Kant’s categorical imperatives. The\nreasons for action that moral requirements furnish are not contingent\nupon the possession of any desires or wants on the part of the agent\nto whom they are addressed: I cannot release myself from the\nrequirement imposed by the claim that torturing the innocent is wrong\nby citing some desire or inclination that I have. This contrasts, for\nexample, with the requirement imposed by the claim that perpetual\nlateness at work is likely to result in one losing one’s job: I\ncan release myself from the requirement imposed by this claim by\nciting my desire to lose my job (perhaps because I find it\nunfulfilling, or whatever). Reasons for action which are contingent in\nthis way on desires and inclinations are furnished by what Kant called\nhypothetical imperatives. \nSo our concept of a moral requirement is a concept of a categorically\nprescriptive requirement. But Mackie claims further that our concept\nof a moral requirement is a concept of an objective and categorically\nprescriptive requirement. What does it mean to say that a requirement\nis objective? Mackie says a lot of different-sounding things about\nthis, and the following (as outlined in Miller 2013a) is by no means a\ncomprehensive list (references are to Ch. 1 of Mackie 1977). To call a\nrequirement objective is to say that it can be an object of knowledge\n(24, 31, 33), that it can be true or false (26, 33), that it can be\nperceived (31, 33), that it can be recognised (42), that it is prior\nto and independent of our preferences and choices (30, 43), that it is\na source of authority external to our preferences and choices (32, 34,\n43), that it is part of the fabric of the world (12), that it backs up\nand validates some of our preferences and choices (22), that it is\ncapable of being simply true (30) or valid as a matter of general\nlogic (30), that it is not constituted by our choosing or deciding to\nthink in a certain way (30), that it is extra-mental (23), that it is\nsomething of which we can be aware (38), that it is something that can\nbe introspected (39), that it is something that can figure as a\npremise in an explanatory hypothesis or inference (39), and so on.\nMackie plainly does not take these to be individually necessary: facts\nabout subatomic particles, for example, may qualify as objective in\nvirtue of figuring in explanatory hypotheses even though they cannot\nbe objects of perceptual acquaintance. But his intention is plain\nenough: these are the sorts of conditions whose satisfaction by a fact\nrenders it objective as opposed to subjective. Mackie’s\nconceptual claim about morality is thus that our concept of a moral\nrequirement is a concept of a fact which is objective in at least some\nof the senses just listed, while his ontological claim will be that\nthe world does not contain any facts which are both candidates for\nbeing moral facts and yet which play even some of the roles\ndistinctive of objective facts. \nHow plausible is Mackie’s conceptual claim? This issue cannot be\ndiscussed in detail here, except to note that while it seems plausible\nto claim that if our concept of a moral fact is a concept of\na reason for action then that concept must be a concept of a\ncategorical reason for action, it is not so clear why we have to say\nthat our concept of a moral fact is a concept of a reason for action\nat all. If we deny this, we can concede the conditional claim whilst\nresisting Mackie’s conceptual claim. One way to do this would be\nto question the assumption, implicit in the exposition of\nMackie’s argument for the conceptual claim above, that an\n‘ought’-statement that binds an agent A provides that\nagent with a reason for action. For an example of a version of moral\nrealism that attempts to block Mackie’s conceptual claim in this\nway, see Railton (1986). For defence of Mackie’s conceptual\nclaim, see Smith (1994), Ch.3 and Joyce (2001). For exposition and\ncritical discussion, see Miller (2013a), Ch.9. \nWhat is Mackie’s argument for his ontological claim? This is set\nout in his ‘argument from queerness’ (Mackie has another\nargument, the ‘argument from relativity’ (or\n‘argument from disagreement’) (1977: 36–38), but\nthis argument cannot be discussed here for reasons of space. For a\nuseful discussion, see Brink (1984)).The argument from queerness has\nboth metaphysical and epistemological components. The metaphysical\nproblem with objective values concerns ‘the metaphysical\npeculiarity of the supposed objective values, in that they would have\nto be intrinsically action-guiding and motivating’ (49). The\nepistemological problem concerns ‘the difficulty of accounting\nfor our knowledge of value entities or features and of their links\nwith the features on which they would be consequential’ (49).\nLet’s look at each type of worry more closely in turn. \nExpounding the metaphysical part of the argument from queerness,\nMackie writes: “If there were objective values, then they would\nbe entities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different\nfrom anything else in the universe.” (38) What is so strange\nabout them? Mackie says that Plato’s Forms (and for that matter,\nMoore’s non-natural qualities) give us a ‘dramatic\npicture’ of what objective values would be, if there were\nany: \nThe obtaining of a moral state of affairs would be the obtaining of a\nsituation ‘with a demand for such and such an action somehow\nbuilt into it’; the states of affairs which we find in the world\ndo not have such demands built into them, they are ‘normatively\ninert’, as it were. Thus, the world contains no moral states of\naffairs, situations which consist in the instantiation of a moral\nquality. \nMackie now backs up this metaphysical argument with an epistemological\nargument: \nIn short, our ordinary conceptions of how we might come into cognitive\ncontact with states of affairs, and thereby acquire knowledge of them,\ncannot cope with the idea that the states of affairs are objective\nvalues. So we are forced to expand that ordinary conception to include\nforms of moral perception and intuition. But these are completely\nunexplanatory: they are really just placeholders for our capacity to\nform correct moral judgements (the reader should here hear an echo of\nthe complaints Benacerraf and Field raise against arithmetical\nplatonism). \nEvaluating the argument from queerness is well outwith the scope of\nthe present entry. While Railton’s version of moral realism\nattempts to block Mackie’s overall argument by conceding his\nontological claim whilst rejecting his conceptual claim, other\nversions of moral realism agree with Mackie’s conceptual claim\nbut reject his ontological claim. Examples of the latter version, and\nattempts to provide the owed response to the argument from queerness,\ncan be found in Smith (1994), Ch.6, and McDowell (1998a), Chs\n4–10.“Companions in Guilt” style responses attempt\nto undermine Mackie’s argument by suggesting that if it were\nsound, it would undermine much more than moral realism. For an example\nof such a strategy, see Cuneo (2007). For a general discussion, see\nLillehammer (2010).  \nThere are two main ways in which one might respond to Mackie’s\nargument for the error-theory: directly, via contesting one of its\npremises or inferences, or indirectly, pointing to some internal\ntension within the error-theory itself. Some possible direct responses\nhave already been mentioned, responses which reject either the\nconceptual or ontological claims that feature as premises in\nMackie’s argument for the error-theory. An indirect argument\nagainst the error-theory has been developed in recent writings by\nCrispin Wright (this argument is intended to apply also to\nField’s error-theory of arithmetic). \nMackie claims that the error-theory of moral judgement is a\nsecond-order theory, which does not necessarily have implications for\nthe first order practice of making moral judgements (1977: 16).\nWright’s argument against the error-theory begins by suggesting\notherwise: \nWright realises that the error-theorist is likely to have a story to\ntell about the point of moral discourse, about “some norm of\nappraisal besides truth, at which its statements can be seen as aimed,\nand which they can satisfy.” (1996: 2) And Mackie has such a\nstory: the point of moral discourse is—to simplify—to\nsecure the benefits of social co-operation (1973: chapter 5 passim;\nnote that this is the analogue in Mackie’s theory of\nField’s notion of the conservativeness of mathematical\ntheories). Suppose we can extract from this story some subsidiary norm\ndistinct from truth, which governs the practice of forming moral\njudgements. Then, for example, ‘Honesty is good’ and\n‘Dishonesty is good’, although both false, will not be on\na par in point of their contribution to the satisfaction of the\nsubsidiary norm: if accepted widely enough, the former will presumably\nfacilitate the satisfaction of the subsidiary norm, while the latter,\nif accepted widely enough, will frustrate it. Wright questions whether\nMackie’s moral sceptic can plausibly combine such a story about\nthe benefits of the practice of moral judgement with the central\nnegative claim of the error-theory: \nWright thus argues that even if we concede to the error-theorist that\nhis original scepticism about moral truth is well-founded, the\nerror-theorist’s own positive proposal will be inherently\nunstable. In recent years, inspired by error-theory, philosophers have\ndeveloped forms of moral fictionalism, according to which moral claims\neither are or ought to be “useful fictions”. See Kalderon\n2005 and Joyce 2001 for examples. For a book-length treatment of moral\nerror-theory, see Olson 2014. \nThe error-theories proposed by Mackie and Field are non-eliminativist\nerror-theories, and should be contrasted with the kind of\neliminativist error-theory proposed by e.g. Paul Churchland concerning\nfolk-psychological propositional attitudes (see Churchland 1981).\nChurchland argues that our everyday talk of propositional attitudes\nsuch as beliefs, desires and intentions should eventually be abandoned\ngiven developments in neuroscience. Mackie and Field make no analogous\nclaims concerning morality and arithmetic: no claim, that is, to the\neffect that they will one day be in principle replaceable by\nphilosophically hygienic counterparts. For some discussion of the\ncontrast between eliminativist and non-eliminativist error theories,\nsee Miller (2015).  \nAlthough some commentators (e.g. Pettit 1991) require that a realistic\nview of a subject matter be non-reductionist about the distinctive\nobjects, properties, and facts of that subject matter, the\nreductionist/non-reductionist issue is really orthogonal to the\nvarious debates about realism. There are a number of reasons for this,\nwith the reasons varying depending on the type of reduction\nproposed. \nSuppose, first of all, that one wished to deny the existence claim\nwhich is a component of platonic realism about arithmetic. One way to\ndo this would be to propose an analytic reduction of talk\nseemingly involving abstract entities to talk concerning only concrete\nentities. This can be illustrated by considering a language the truth\nof whose sentences seemingly entails the existence of a type of\nabstract object, directions. Suppose there is a first order language\nL, containing a range of proper names ‘a’,\n‘b’, ‘c’, and so on, where\nthese denote straight lines conceived as concrete inscriptions. There\nare also predicates and relations defined on straight lines, including\n‘ … is parallel to …’. ‘D(\n)’ is a singular term forming operator on lines, so that\ninserting the name of a concrete line, as in\n‘D(a)’, produces a singular term\nstanding for an abstract object, the direction of a. A number\nof contextual definitions are now introduced: \n(To say that ‘… is parallel to …’ is a\ncongruence for ‘F( )’ is to say that if\na is parallel to b and Fa, then it follows\nthat Fb). \nAccording to a platonic realist, directions exist and have a nature\nwhich is independent of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, and so on. But doesn’t the availability of\n(A), (B), and (C) undermine the existence claim at the heart of\nplatonic realism? After all, (A), (B), and (C) allow us to paraphrase\nany sentence whose truth appears to entail the existence of abstract\nobjects into a sentence whose truth involves only the existence of\nconcrete inscriptions. Doesn’t this show that an analytic\nreduction can aid someone wishing to question the existence claim\ninvolved in a particular form of realism? There is a powerful\nargument, first developed by William Alston (1958), and convincingly\nresuscitated by Crispin Wright (1983, Ch.1), that suggests not. The\nanalytic reductionist who wishes to wield the contextual definitions\nagainst the existence claim at the heart of platonic realism takes\nthem to show that the apparent reference to abstract objects on the\nleft-hand sides of the definitions is merely apparent: in\nfact, the truth of the relevant sentences entails only the existence\nof a range of concrete inscriptions. But the platonic realist can\nretort: what the contextual definitions show is that the apparent\nlack of reference to abstract objects on the\nright-hand sides is merely apparent. In fact, the platonic\nrealist can say, the truth of the sentences figuring on the right-hand\nsides implicitly involves reference to abstract objects. If there is\nno way to break this deadlock the existence of the analytic reductive\nparaphrases will leave the existence claim at the heart of the\nrelevant form of realism untouched. So the issue of this style of\nreductionism appears to be orthogonal to debates between realists and\nnon-realists. \nCan the same be said about non-analytic styles of reductionism? Again,\nthere is no straightforward connection between the issue of\nreductionism and the issue of realism. The problem is that, to borrow\nsome terminology and examples from Railton 1989, some reductions will\nbe vindicative whilst others will be eliminativist.\nFor example, the reduction of water to H20 is vindicative:\nit vindicates our belief that there is such a thing as water, rather\nthan overturning it. On the other hand: \nThus, a non-analytic reduction may or may not have implications for\nthe existence dimension of a realistic view of a particular subject\nmatter. And even if the existence dimension is vindicated, there is\nstill the further question whether the objects and properties\nvindicated are independent of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic\npractices, and so on. Again, there is no straightforward relationship\nbetween the issue of reductionism and the issue of realism. \nWe saw above that for the subject-matter in question the\nerror-theorist agrees with the realist that the truth of the\natomic, declarative sentences of that area requires the existence of\nthe relevant type of objects, or the instantiation of the relevant\nsorts of properties. Although the realist and the error-theorist agree\non this much, they of course disagree on the question of whether the\nrelevant type of objects exist, or on whether the relevant sorts of\nproperties are instantiated: the error-theorist claims that they\ndon’t, so that the atomic, declarative sentences of the area are\nsystematically and uniformly false, the realist claims that at least\nin some instances the relevant objects exist or the relevant\nproperties are instantiated, so that the atomic, declarative sentences\nof the area are at least in some instances true. We also saw that an\nerror-theory about a particular area could be motivated by\nepistemological worries (Field) or by a combination of epistemological\nand metaphysical worries (Mackie). \nAnother way in which the existence dimension of realism can be\nresisted is via expressivism. Whereas the realist and the\nerror-theorist agree that the sentences of the relevant area are\ntruth-apt, apt to be assessed in terms of truth and falsity,\nthe realist and the expressivist (alternatively non-cognitivist,\nprojectivist) disagree about the truth-aptness of those sentences. It\nis a fact about English that sentences in the declarative mood\n(‘The beer is in the fridge’) are conventionally used for\nmaking assertions, and assertions are true or false depending on\nwhether or not the fact that is asserted to obtain actually obtains.\nBut there are other grammatical moods that are conventionally\nassociated with different types of speech-act. For example, sentences\nin the imperatival mood (‘Put the beer in the fridge’) are\nconventionally used for giving orders, and sentences in the\ninterrogative mood (‘Is the beer in the fridge?’) are\nconventionally used for asking questions. Note that we would not\nordinarily think of orders or questions as even apt for assessment in\nterms of truth and falsity: they are not truth-apt. Now the\nconventions mentioned here are not exceptionless: for example, one can\nuse sentences in the declarative mood (‘My favourite drink is\nBelhaven 60 shilling’) to give an order (for some Belhaven 60\nshilling), one can use sentences in the interrogative mood (‘Is\nthe Pope a Catholic?’) to make an assertion (of whatever fact\nwas the subject of the discussion), and so on. The expressivist about\na particular area will claim that the realist is misled by the syntax\nof the sentences of that area into thinking that they are truth-apt:\nshe will say that this is a case where the conventional association of\nthe declarative mood with assertoric force breaks down. In the moral\ncase the expressivist can claim that ‘Stealing is wrong’\nis no more truth-apt than ‘Put the beer in the fridge’: it\nis just that the lack of truth-aptness of the latter is worn on its\nsleeve, while the lack of truth-aptness of the former is veiled by its\nsurface syntax.(There are some very important issues concerning the\nrelationship between minimalism about truth-aptitude and expressivism\nthat we cannot go into here. See Divers and Miller (1995)and Miller\n(2013b) for some pointers. There are also some important differences\nbetween e.g. Ayer’s emotivism and more modern forms of\nexpressivism (such as those developed by Blackburn and Gibbard) that\nwe gloss over here. For a useful account, see Schroeder 2009).  \nSo, if moral sentences are not conventionally used for the making of\nassertions, what are they conventionally used for? According to one\nclassical form of expressivism, emotivism, they are\nconventionally used for the expression of emotion, feeling, or\nsentiment. Thus, A.J. Ayer writes: \nIt follows from this that: \nEmotivism faces many problems, discussion of which is not possible\nhere (for a survey, see Miller 2003a Ch.3). One problem that has been\nthe bugbear of all expressivist versions of non-realism, the\n‘Frege-Geach Problem’, is so-called because the classic\nmodern formulation is by Peter Geach (1965), who attributes the\noriginal point to Frege. \nAccording to emotivism, when I sincerely utter the sentence\n‘Murder is wrong’ I am not expressing a belief or making\nan assertion, but rather expressing some non-cognitive sentiment or\nfeeling, incapable of being true or false. Thus, the emotivist claims\nthat in contexts where ‘is wrong’ is being applied to an\naction-type it is being used to express a sentiment or feeling of\ndisapproval towards actions of that type. But what about contexts in\nwhich it is not being applied to an action type? An example of such a\nsentence would be ‘If murder is wrong, then getting little\nbrother to murder people is wrong’. In the antecedent of this\n‘is wrong’ is clearly not being applied to anything\n(compare: in uttering ‘If snow is black then it is not\nwhite’ I am not applying ‘is black’ to snow). So\nwhat account can the emotivist give of the use of ‘Murder is\nwrong’ within ‘unasserted contexts’, such as the\nantecedent of the conditional above? Since it is not there used to\nexpress disapproval of murder, the account of its semantic function\nmust be different from that given for the apparently straightforward\nassertion expressed by ‘Murder is wrong’. But now there is\na problem in accounting for the following valid inference: \nTherefore: \nIf the semantic function of ‘is wrong’ as it occurs within\nan asserted context in (1) is different from its semantic function as\nit occurs within an unasserted context in (2), isn’t someone\narguing in this way simply guilty of equivocation? In order for the\nargument to be valid, the occurrence of ‘Murder is wrong’\nin (1) has to mean the same thing as the occurrence of\n‘Murder is wrong’ in (2). But if ‘is wrong’\nhas a different semantic function in (1) and (2), then it certainly\ndoesn’t mean the same thing in (1) and (2), and so neither do\nthe sentences in which it appears. So the above argument is apparently\nno more valid than: \nTherefore: \nThis argument is obviously invalid, because it relies on an\nequivocation on two senses of ‘head’, in (4) and (5)\nrespectively. \nIt is perhaps worth stressing why the Frege-Geach problem\ndoesn’t afflict ethical theories which see ‘Murder is\nwrong’ as truth-apt, and sincere utterances of ‘Murder is\nwrong’ as capable of expressing straightforwardly\ntruth-assessable beliefs. According to theories like these, moral\nmodus ponens arguments such as the argument above from (1)\nand (2) to (3) are just like non-moral cases of modus ponens\nsuch as \nTherefore, \nWhy is this non-moral case of modus ponens not similarly\ninvalid in virtue of the fact that ‘Smith is in Glasgow’\nis asserted in (7), but not in (8)? The answer is of course that the\nstate of affairs asserted to obtain by ‘Smith is in\nGlasgow’ in (7) is the same as that whose obtaining is merely\nentertained in the antecedent of (8). In (7) ‘Smith is in\nGlasgow’ is used to assert that a state of affairs obtains\n(Smith’s being in Glasgow), and in (8) it is asserted that if\nthat state of affairs obtains, so does another (Smith’s being in\nScotland). Throughout, the semantic function of the sentences\nconcerned is given in terms of the states of affairs asserted to\nobtain in simple assertoric contexts. And it is difficult to see how\nan emotivist can say anything analogous to this with respect to the\nargument from (1) and (2) to (3): it is difficult to see how the\nsemantic function of ‘Murder is wrong’ in the antecedent\nof (2) could be given in terms of the sentiment it allegedly expresses\nin (1). \nThe Frege-Geach challenge to the emotivist is thus to answer the\nfollowing question: how can you give an emotivist account of the\noccurrence of moral sentences in ‘unasserted\ncontexts’—such as the antecedents of\nconditionals—without jeopardising the intuitively valid patterns\nof inference in which those sentences figure? Philosophers wishing to\ndevelop an expressivistic alternative to moral realism have expended a\ngreat deal of energy and ingenuity in devising responses to this\nchallenge. See in particular Blackburn’s development of\n‘quasi-realism’, in his (1984) Chs 5 and 6, (1993) Ch.10,\n(1998) Ch.3 and Gibbard’s ‘norm-expressivism’, in\nhis (1990) Ch.5, and further refined in his (2003). For criticism see\nHale (1993) and (2002), and Kölbel (2002) Ch.4. For an overview,\nsee Schroeder (2008) and Miller (2013a), Chs 4 and 5. For very useful\nsurveys of recent work on expressivism, see Schroeder (2009) and\nSinclair (2009). \nExamples of challenges to the existence dimension of realism have been\ndescribed in previous sections. In this section some forms of\nnon-realism that are neither error-theoretic nor expressivist will be\nbriefly introduced. The forms of non-realism view the sentences of the\nrelevant area as (against the expressivist) truth-apt, and (against\nthe error-theorist) at least sometimes true. The existence dimension\nof realism is thus left intact. What is challenged is the independence\ndimension of realism, the claim that the objects distinctive of the\narea exist, or that the properties distinctive of the area are\ninstantiated, independently of anyone’s beliefs, linguistic\npractices, conceptual schemes, and so on. \nClassically, opposition to the independence dimension of realism about\nthe everyday world of macroscopic objects took the form of\nidealism, the view that the objects of the everyday world of\nmacroscopic objects are in some sense mental. As Berkeley\nfamously claimed, tables, chairs, cats, the moons of Jupiter and so\non, are nothing but ideas in the minds of spirits: \nIdealism has long been out of favour in contemporary philosophy\n(though see Goldschmidt & Pearce 2017 for some recent discussion),\nbut those who doubt the independence dimension of realism have sought\nmore sophisticated ways of opposing it. One such philosopher, Michael\nDummett, has suggested that in some cases it may be appropriate to\nreject the independence dimension of realism via the rejection of\nsemantic realism about the area in question (see Dummett 1978 and\n1993). This section contains a brief explanation of semantic realism,\nas characterised by Dummett, Dummett’s views on the relationship\nbetween semantic realism and realism construed as a metaphysical\nthesis, and an outline of some of the arguments in the philosophy of\nlanguage that Dummett has suggested might be wielded against semantic\nrealism. \nIt is easiest to characterise semantic realism for a mathematical\ndomain. It is a feature of arithmetic that there are some arithmetical\nsentences for which the following holds true: we know of no method\nthat will guarantee us a proof of the sentence, and we know of no\nmethod that will guarantee us a disproof or a counterexample either.\nOne such is Goldbach’s Conjecture: \n(G) Every even number is the sum of two primes.  \nIt is possible that we may come across a proof, or a counterexample,\nbut the key point is that we do not know a method, or methods, the\napplication of which is guaranteed to yield one or the other. A\nsemantic realist, in Dummett’s sense, is one who holds that our\nunderstanding of a sentence like (G) consists in knowledge of its\ntruth-condition, where the notion of truth involved is potentially\nrecognition-transcendent or bivalent. To say that the\nnotion of truth involved is potentially recognition-transcendent is to\nsay that (G) may be true (or false) even though there is no guarantee\nthat we will be able, in principle, to recognise that that is so. To\nsay that the notion of truth involved is bivalent is to accept the\nunrestricted applicability of the law of bivalence, that every\nmeaningful sentence is determinately either true or false. Thus the\nsemantic realist is prepared to assert that (G) is determinately\neither true or false, regardless of the fact that we have no\nguaranteed method of ascertaining which. (Note that the precise\nrelationship between the characterisation in terms of bivalence and\nthat in terms of potentially recognition-transcendent truth is a\ndelicate matter that will not concern us here. See the Introduction to\nWright 1993 for some excellent discussion. It is also important to\nnote that in introducing the idea that a speaker’s understanding\nof a sentence consists in her knowledge of its truth-condition,\nDummett is packing more into the notion of truth than the\ndisquotational properties made use of in §1 above. See\nDummett’s essay ‘Truth’, in his 1978). \nDummett makes two main claims about semantic realism. First, there is\nwhat Devitt (1991a) has termed the metaphor thesis: This\ndenies that we can even have a literal, austerely\nmetaphysical characterisation of realism of the sort attempted above\nwith Generic Realism. Dummett writes, of the attempt to give an\naustere metaphysical characterisation of realism about mathematics\n(platonic realism) and what stands opposed to it (intuitionism): \nAccording to the constitution thesis, the literal content of\nrealism consists in the content of semantic realism. Thus,\nthe literal content of realism about the external world is constituted\nby the claim that our understanding of at least some sentences\nconcerning the external world consists in our grasp of their\npotentially recognition-transcendent truth-conditions. The spurious\n‘debate’ in metaphysics between realism and non-realism\ncan thus become a genuine debate within the theory of\nmeaning: should we characterise speakers’ understanding in terms\nof grasp of potentially recognition-transcendent truth-conditions? As\nDummett puts it: \nFew have been convinced by either the metaphor thesis or the\nconstitution thesis. Consider Generic Realism in the case of the world\nof everyday macroscopic objects and properties: \n(GR1) Tables, rocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape, colour,\nand so on, is (apart from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort\nsometimes encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone’s\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on.  \nDummett may well call for some non-metaphorical characterisation of\nthe independence claim which this involves, but it is relatively easy\nto provide one such characterisation by utilising Dummett’s own\nnotion of recognition-transcendence: \n(GR2) Tables, rocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape,colour,\nand so on, is (apart from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort\nsometimes encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone’s\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on. Tables,\nrocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and in general there is no\nguarantee that we will be able, even in principle, to recognise the\nfact that they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape,\ncolour, and so on. \nOn the face of it, there is nothing metaphorical in (GR2) or, at least\nif there is, some argument from Dummett to that effect is required.\nThis throws some doubt on the metaphor thesis. Moreover there is\nnothing distinctively semantic about (GR2), and this throws some doubt\non the constitution thesis. Whereas for Dummett, the essential realist\nthesis is the meaning-theoretic claim that our understanding of a\nsentence like (G) consists in knowledge of its potentially\nrecognition-transcendent truth-condition, for Devitt: \nDevitt’s main criticism of the constitution thesis is this: the\nliteral content of realism about the external world is not given by\nsemantic realism, since semantic realism is consistent with an\nidealist metaphysics of the external world. He writes: \nSuppose that Dummett’s metaphor and constitution theses are both\nimplausible. Would it follow that the arguments Dummett develops\nagainst semantic realism have no relevance to debates about the\nplausibility of realism about everyday macroscopic objects (say),\nconstrued as a purely metaphysical thesis as in (GR2)? It can be\nargued that Dummett’s arguments can retain their relevance to a\nmetaphysical debate even if the metaphor and constitution theses are\nfalse, and, indeed, even if Dummett’s view (1973: 669) that the\ntheory of meaning is the foundation of all philosophy is rejected. For\na full development of this line of argument, see Miller 2003a and\n2006. \nDummett’s main line of argument against semantic realism is the\nmanifestation argument. Here is the argument (See Dummett\n1978 and the summary in Miller 2018, chapter 9): \nSuppose that we are considering region of discourse D.\nThen: \nSuppose, for reductio, that \nNow, given \nWe can conclude \nWe then add the following premise, which stems from the\nWittgensteinian insight that understanding does not consist in the\npossession of an inner state, but rather in the possession of some\npractical ability (see Wittgenstein 1958): \nFor example, in the case of a simple language consisting of\ndemonstratives and taste predicates (such as “bitter” and\n“sweet”), applied to foodstuffs within reach of the\nspeaker, a speaker’s understanding consists in his ability to\ndetermine whether “this is bitter” is true, by putting the\nrelevant foodstuff in his mouth and tasting it (Wright 1993). \nIt now follows that: \nSo: \nSince \nIt follows that \nSo \nSo \nThis yields a contradiction with (1), whence, by reductio, we\nreject (2) to obtain: \nThe key claim here is (8). So far as an account of speakers’\nunderstanding goes, the ascription of knowledge of\nrecognition-transcendent truth-conditions is simply\nredundant: there is no good reason for ascribing it. Consider\none of the sentences introduced earlier as a candidate for possessing\nrecognition-transcendent truth-conditions ‘Every even number\ngreater than two is the sum of two primes’. The semantic realist\nviews our understanding of sentences like this as consisting in our\nknowledge of a potentially recognition-transcendent truth-condition.\nBut: \nHow can that account be viewed as a description of any\npractical ability of use? No doubt someone who understands\nsuch a statement can be expected to have many relevant practical\nabilities. He will be able to appraise evidence for or against it,\nshould any be available, or to recognize that no information in his\npossession bears on it. He will be able to recognize at least some of\nits logical consequences, and to identify beliefs from which\ncommitment to it would follow. And he will, presumably, show himself\nsensitive to conditions under which it is appropriate to ascribe\npropositional attitudes embedding the statement to himself and to\nothers, and sensitive to the explanatory significance of such\nascriptions. In short: in these and perhaps other important respects,\nhe will show himself competent to use the sentence. But the headings\nunder which his practical abilities fall so far involve no mention of\nevidence-transcendent truth-conditions (Wright 1993: 17). \nThis establishes (8), and the conclusion (12) follows\nstraightforwardly. \nA detailed assessment of the plausibility of Dummett’s arguments\nis impossible here. For a full response to the manifestation argument,\nsee Miller 2002. See also Byrne 2005. For Dummett’s other\nargument, the acquisition argument, see Miller 2003b. Wright develops\na couple of additional arguments against semantic realism. For\nthese—the argument from rule-following and the argument from\nnormativity—see the Introduction to Wright 1993. For an\nexcellent survey of the literature on Dummett’s arguments\nagainst semantic realism, see Hale 2017. For an excellent book-length\nintroduction to Dummett’s philosophy, see Weiss 2002. For a\nrobust defence of keeping issues in metaphysics sharply separate from\nissues about language, see Dyke (2008) \nSuppose that one wished to develop a non-realist alternative to, say,\nmoral realism. Suppose also that one is persuaded of the\nunattractiveness of both error-theoretic and expressivist forms of\nnon-realism. That is to say, one accepts that moral sentences are\ntruth-apt, and, at least in some cases, true. Then the only option\navailable would be to deny the independence dimension of moral\nrealism. But so far we have only seen one way of doing this: by\nadmitting that the relevant sentences are truth-apt, sometimes true,\nand possessed of truth-conditions which are not potentially\nrecognition-transcendent. But this seems weak: it seems implausible to\nsuggest that a moral realist must be committed to the potential\nrecognition-transcendence of moral truth. It therefore seems\nimplausible to suggest that a non-expressivistic and\nnon-error-theoretic form of opposition to realism must be committed to\nsimply denying the potential recognition-transcendence of moral truth,\nsince many who style themselves moral realists will deny this too. As\nWright puts it: \nSo, if the debate between a realist and a non-realist about the\nindependence dimension doesn’t concern the plausibility of\nsemantic realism as characterised by Dummett, what does it concern?\n(Henceforth a non-error-theoretic, non-expressivist style of\nnon-realist is referred to as an anti-realist). Wright attempts to\ndevelop some points of contention, (or ‘realism-relevant\ncruces’ as he calls them) over which a realist and anti-realist\ncould disagree. Wright’s development of this idea is subtle and\nsophisticated and only a crude exposition of a couple of his\nrealism-relevant cruces can be given here. \nThe first of Wright’s realism-relevant cruces to be considered\nhere concerns the capacity of states of affairs to figure ineliminably\nin the explanation of features of our experience. The idea that the\nexplanatory efficacy of the states of affairs in some area has\nsomething to do with the plausibility of a realist view of that area\nis familiar from the debates in meta-ethics between philosophers such\nas Nicholas Sturgeon (1988), who believe that irreducibly moral states\nof affairs do figure ineliminably in the best explanation of certain\naspects of experience, and opponents such as Gilbert Harman (1977),\nwho believe that moral states of affairs have no such explanatory\nrole. This suggests a ‘best explanation test’ which,\ncrudely put, states that realism about a subject matter can be secured\nif its distinctive states of affairs figure ineliminably in the best\nexplanation of aspects of experience. One could then be a\nnon-expressivist, non-error-theoretic, anti-realist about a particular\nsubject matter by denying that the distinctive states of affairs of\nthat subject matter do have a genuine role in best explanations of\naspects of our experience. And the debate between this style of\nanti-realist and his realist opponent could proceed independently of\nany questions concerning the capacity of sentences in the relevant\narea to have potentially recognition-transcendent truth values. \nFor reasons that needn’t detain us here, Wright suggests that\nthis ‘best explanation test’ should be superseded by\nquestions concerning what he calls width of cosmological role\n(1992, Ch.5). The states of affairs in a given area have narrow\ncosmological role if it is a priori that they do not contribute to the\nexplanation of things other than our beliefs about that\nsubject-matter (or other than via explaining our beliefs\nabout that subject matter). This will be an anti-realist position. One\nstyle of realist about that subject matter will say that its states of\naffairs have wide cosmological role: they do contribute to the\nexplanation of things other than our beliefs about the subject matter\nin question (or other than via explaining our beliefs about that\nsubject matter). It is relatively easy to see why width of\ncosmological role could be a bone of contention between realist and\nanti-realist views of a given subject matter: it is precisely the\nwidth of cosmological role of a class of states of affairs—their\ncapacity to explain things other than, or other than via, our beliefs,\nin which their independence from our beliefs, linguistic practices,\nand so on, consists. Again, the debate between someone attributing a\nnarrow cosmological role to a class of states of affairs and someone\nattributing a wide cosmological role could proceed independently of\nany questions concerning the capacity of sentences in the relevant\narea to have potentially recognition-transcendent truth values. \nWright thinks that it is arguable that moral discourse does not\nsatisfy width-of-cosmological role. Whereas a physical fact—such\nas a pond’s being frozen over—can contribute to the\nexplanation of cognitive effects (someone’s believing\nthat the pond is frozen over), effects on sentient, but\nnon-conceptual creatures (the tendency of goldfish to cluster\ntowards the bottom of the pond), effects on us as physically\ninteractive agents (someone’s slipping on the ice), and\neffects on inanimate matter (the tendency of a thermometer to\nread zero when placed on the surface), moral facts can only to\ncontribute to the explanation of the first sort of effect: \nThus, we have a version of anti-realism about morals that is\nnon-expressivist and non-error-theoretic and can be framed\nindependently of considerations about the potential of moral sentences\nto have recognition-transcendent truth-values: moral sentences are\ntruth-apt, sometimes true, and moral states of affairs have narrow\ncosmological role. \nThe second of Wright’s realism-relevant cruces concerns\njudgement-dependence. Suppose that we are considering a region of\ndiscourse D in which P is a typical property.\nConsider the opinions formed by the participants in that discourse\nunder cognitively ideal conditions: call such opinions best\nopinions, and the cognitively ideal conditions the\nC-conditions. Suppose that the best opinions covary with the\nfacts about the instantiation of P. Then there are two ways\nin which we can explain this covariance. First, we might take best\nopinions to be playing at most a tracking role: best opinions\nare just extremely good at tracking independently constituted\ntruth-conferring states of affairs. In this case, best opinion plays\nonly an extension-reflecting role, merely reflecting the\nindependently determined extensions of the relevant properties.\nAlternatively, rather than viewing best opinion as merely tracking the\nfacts about the extensions of the relevant properties, we can view\nthem as themselves determining those extensions. Best\nopinions, on this sort of view, do not just track independently\nconstituted states of affairs which determine the extensions of the\nthe properties that form the subject matter of D: rather,\nthey determine those extensions and so to play an\nextension-determining role. When we have this latter sort of\nexplanation of the covariance of best opinion and fact, we’ll\nsay that the truth about the instantiation of the relevant properties\nis judgement-dependent; when we have only the former sort of\nexplanation, we’ll say that the truth about their instantiation\nis judgement-independent. \nHow do we determine whether the truth about the instantiation of the\ntypical properties that form the subject matter of a region of\ndiscourse are judgement-dependent? Wright’s discussion proceeds\nby reference to what he terms provisional equations. These\nhave the following form: \n(PE) ∀x[C → (A suitable subject\ns judges that Px ↔Px)]  \nwhere ‘C’ denotes the conditions (the\nC-conditions) which are cognitively ideal for forming the\njudgement that x is P. The property P is\nthen said to be judgement-dependent if and only if the provisional\nequation meets the following four conditions: \nThe A Prioricity Condition: The provisional equation must be\na priori true: there must be a priori covariance of\nbest opinions and truth. (Justification: ‘the truth, if it is\ntrue, that the extensions of [a class of concept] are constrained by\nidealised human response—best opinion—ought to be\navailable purely by analytic reflection on those concepts, and hence\navailable as knowledge a priori’ (Wright 1992: 117)).\nThis is because the thesis of judgement-dependence is the claim that,\nfor the region of discourse concerned, best opinion is the\nconceptual ground of truth). \nThe Substantiality Condition The C-conditions must\nbe specifiable non-trivially: they cannot simply be described\nas conditions under which the subject has ‘whatever it\ntakes’ to form the right opinion concerning the subject matter\nat hand.(Justification: without this condition, the truth about any\nproperty will turn out to be judgement-dependent, since for any\nproperty Q it is going to be an a priori truth that\nour judgements about whether x is Q, formed under\nconditions which have ‘whatever it takes’ to ensure their\ncorrectness, will covary with the facts about the instantiation of\nQ-ness. We thus require this condition on pain of losing the\ndistinction between judgement-dependent and judgement-independent\ntruth altogether). \nThe Independence Condition: The question as to whether the\nC-conditions obtain in a given instance must be logically\nindependent of the class of truths for which we are attempting to give\nan extension-determining account: what makes an opinion best must not\npresuppose some logically prior determination of the extensions\nputatively determined by best opinions. (Justification: if we have to\nassume certain facts about the extension of P in the\ndetermination of the conditions under which opinions about P\nare best, then we cannot view best opinions as themselves constituting\nthose facts, since whether a given opinion is best would then\npresuppose some logically prior determination of the very\nfacts the judgement-dependent account wishes to view as constituted by\nbest opinions). \nThe Extremal Condition: There must be no better way of\naccounting for the a priori covariance: no better account,\nother than according best opinion an extension-determining role, of\nwhich the satisfaction of the foregoing three conditions is a\nconsequence. (Justification: without this condition, the satisfaction\nof the foregoing conditions would be consistent with the thought that\ncertain states of affairs are judgement-independent even though\ninfallibly detectable, “states of affairs in whose determination\nfacts about the deliverances of best opinions are in no way implicated\nalthough there is, a priori, no possibility of their\nmisrepresentation” (Wright 1992: 123).) \nWhen all of the above conditions can be shown to be satisfied, we can\naccord best opinion an extension-determining role, and describe the\ntruth about the subject matter as judgement-dependent. If these\nconditions cannot collectively be satisfied, best opinion can be\nassigned, at best, a merely extension-reflecting role. \nTwo points are worth making. First, it is again relatively easy to see\nwhy the question of judgement-dependence can mark a bone of contention\nbetween realism and anti-realism. If a subject matter is\njudgement-dependent we have a concrete sense in which the independence\ndimension of realism fails for that subject matter: there is a sense\nin which that subject matter is not entirely independent of our\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, and so on. Second, the debate about the\njudgement-dependence of a subject matter is, on the face of it at\nleast, independent of the debate about the possibility of\nrecognition-transcendent truth in that area. \nWright argues (1989) that facts about colours and intentions are\njudgement-dependent, so that we can formulate a version of\nanti-realism about colours (intentions) that views ascriptions of\ncolours (intentions) as truth-apt and sometimes true, and truth in\nthose areas as judgement-dependent. In contrast to this, Wright argues\n(1988) that morals cannot plausibly be viewed as judgement-dependent,\nso that a thesis of judgement-dependence is not a suitable vehicle for\nthe expression of a non-expressivistic, non-error-theoretic, version\nof anti-realism about morality.  \nFor discussion of further allegedly realism-relevant cruces, such as\ncognitive command, see Wright 1992 and 2003. For critical discussion\nof Wright on cognitive command, see Shapiro and Taschek 1996. See also\nMiller 2004 and the papers in section III of Coliva (ed.) 2012.It is\nthe availability of these various realism-relevant cruces that makes\nit possible to be more-or-less realist about a given area: at one end\nof the spectrum there will be areas that fall on the realist side of\nall of the cruces and at the opposite end areas that fall on the\nnon-realist side of all of the cruces, but in between there will be a\nrange of intermediate cases in which some-but-not-all of the cruces\nare satisfied on the realist side.  \nSome of the ways in which non-realist theses about a particular\nsubject matter can be formulated and motivated have been described\nabove. Quietism is the view that significant metaphysical debate\nbetween realism and non-realism is impossible. Gideon Rosen nicely\narticulates the basic quietist thought: Quietism about the\n‘debate’ between realists and their opponents can take a\nnumber of forms. One form might claim that the idea of a significant\ndebate is generated by unsupported or unsupportable philosophical\ntheses about the relationship of the experiencing and minded subject\nto their world, and that once these theses are exorcised the\n‘debate’ will gradually wither away. This form of quietism\nis often associated with the work of the later Wittgenstein, and\nreceives perhaps its most forceful development in the work of John\nMcDowell (see in particular McDowell 1994 and 2007). Other forms of\nquietism may proceed in a more piecemeal fashion, taking constraints\nsuch as Wright’s realism-relevant Cruces and arguing on a\ncase-by-case basis that their satisfaction or non-satisfaction is of\nno metaphysical consequence. This is in fact the strategy pursued in\nRosen 1994. He makes the following points regarding the two\nrealism-relevant Cruces considered in the previous section. \nSuppose that: \n(F) It is a priori that: x is funny if and only if\nwe would judge x funny under conditions of full information\nabout xs relevant extra-comedic features  \nand suppose that (F) satisfies (in addition to a prioricity) the\nvarious other constraints that Wright imposes on his provisional\nequations ((F) is actually not of the form of a provisional equation,\nbut this is not relevant to our purposes here). Rosen questions\nwhether this would be enough to establish that the facts about the\nfunny are in some metaphysically interesting sense ‘less\nreal’ or ‘less objective’ than facts (such as,\narguably, facts about shape) for which a suitable equation cannot be\nconstructed. \nIn a nutshell, Rosen’s argument proceeds by inviting us to\nassume the perspective of an anthropologist who is studying us and who\n‘has gotten to the point where he can reliably determine which\njokes we will judge funny under conditions of full relevant\ninformation’ (1994: 302). Rosen writes: \nHow plausible is this attempt to deflate the significance of the\ndiscovery that the subject matter of a particular area is, in\nWright’s sense, judgement-dependent? Argument—as opposed\nto the trading of intuitions—at this level is difficult, but\nRosen’s claim here is very implausible. Suppose we found out\nthat facts about the distribution of gases on the moons of Jupiter\nsupervened directly on facts about our minds. Would the threat we then\nfelt to the objectivity of facts about the distribution of gases on\nthe moons of Jupiter be at all assuaged by the reflection that facts\nabout the mental might themselves be susceptible to realistic\ntreatment? It seems doubtful. Fodor’s Psychosemantics\nwould not offer much solace to realists in the world described in\nBerkeley’s Principles. Rosen’s claim derives some\nof its plausibility from the fact that he uses examples, such as the\nfunny and the constitutional, where our pre-theoretical attachment to\na realist view is very weak: it may be that the judgement-dependence\nof the funny doesn’t undermine our sense of the objectivity of\nhumour simply because the level of objectivity we pretheoretically\nexpect of comedy is quite low. So although there is no knock-down\nargument to Rosen’s claim, it is much more counterintuitive than\nhe might be willing to admit. \nRosen also questions whether there is any intuitive connection between\nconsiderations of width of cosmological role and issues of realism and\nnon-realism. Rosen doubts in particular that there is any tight\nconnection between facts of a certain class having only narrow\ncosmological role and mind-dependence in any sense relevant to the\nplausibility of realism. He writes: \nHowever it seems that, at least in the first instance, Wright has a\nrelatively quick response to this point at his disposal. Waiving the\npoint that in any case the width of cosmological role constraint\napplies to classes of properties and facts, he can point out\nthat in the example constructed by Rosen the narrowness of Q’s\ncosmological role is an a posteriori matter. Whereas what we\nwant is that the narrowness of cosmological role is an a\npriori matter: one does not need to conduct an empirical\ninvestigation to convince oneself that facts about the funny fail to\nhave wide cosmological role. \nWright thus has the beginnings of answers to Rosen’s quietist\nattack on his use of the notions of judgement-dependence and width of\ncosmological role. It is not possible to deal fully with these\narguments here, let alone with the other quietist arguments in\nRosen’s paper, or the arguments of other quietists such as\nMcDowell, beyond giving a flavour of how quietism might be motivated\nand how those active in the debates between realists and their\nopponents might start to respond. For a further discussion of quietism\nby Wright, see Wright 2007. \nThis discussion of realism and of the forms that non-realist\nopposition may take is far from exhaustive, and aims only to give the\nreader a sense of what to expect if they delve deeper into the issues.\nIn particular, nothing has been mentioned about the work of Hilary\nPutnam, his characterisation of ‘metaphysical realism’,\nand his so-called ‘model-theoretic’ argument against it.\nPutnam’s writings are extensive, but one could begin with Putnam\n1981 and 1983. For critical discussion, see Hale and Wright 2017 and\nWright 2001; see also the entries on\n scientific realism\n and\n challenges to metaphysical realism.\n Nor have issues about the metaphysics of modality and possible worlds\nbeen discussed. The locus classicus in this area is Lewis 1986. For\ncommentary, see Divers 2002 and Melia 2003; see also the entries on\n David Lewis’s metaphysics\n and the\n epistemology of modality.\n And the very important topic of scientific realism has not been\ntouched upon. For an introductory treatment and suggestions for\nfurther reading, see Bird 1998 Ch. 4; see also, the entries on\n scientific realism\n and\n structural realism.\n Finally, it has not been possible to include any discussion of\nrealism about intentionality and meaning (but see the entries on\n intentionality\n and\n theories of meaning.)\n The locus classicus in recent philosophy is Kripke 1982. For a\nrobustly realistic view of the intentional, see Fodor 1987. For a\ncollection of some of the central secondary literature, see Miller and\nWright 2002, and for a robust defence of Kripke’s interpretation\nof Wittgenstein, see Kusch (2006). For an entertaining defence of\nmetaphysical realism, see Musgrave 2001 (exercise for the reader: do\nany of the forms of opposition to realism described in this entry rely\non what Musgrave calls word-magic?). For an alternative approach to\nmapping the debates about realism involving conceptions of\nindependence more distinctively metaphysical than those focussed on\nhere, see Fine (2001) and the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.\n For good introductory book length treatments of realism, see Kirk\n1999 and Brock and Mares 2006. Greenough and Lynch (2006) is a useful\ncollection of papers by many of the leading lights in the various\ndebates about realism.
