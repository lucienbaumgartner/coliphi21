Furthermore, the\nnotion of a deity often plays a central role in these cosmological\ntheories. According to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole\ncreator and sustainer of the universe.\n\nBut the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of\ncosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the\ndemarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific\ncosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is\nformalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What\nhas this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often\ntheistic) cosmologies?  Has the new cosmology replaced the older\ncosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older\ncosmologies?\n\nOur subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to\nthe case of western monotheism—Judaism, Christianity, and\nIslam—and even more specifically to variants of\nChristianity. Even so, we note a wide range of diversity among\nChristian beliefs and Christian attitudes towards science in general,\nand towards scientific cosmology in particular. At one extreme, we\nfind ultra-traditional versions of Christianity that emphasize literal\ninterpretation of Scripture, and that often interpret theological\ndoctrines in terms of ancient Greek philosophical categories (e.g., God\nas eternal, unchangeable, etc.). Even within this more traditional\ncamp, we find differences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount\nof flexibility with regard to traditional theological\ndoctrines. (e.g., there are ongoing debates among traditional\ntheologians about the relation of God to time.) At another extreme, we\nfind more recent incarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on\nideas from German idealism and/or process philosophy. There are also\nsubtle, but not negligible, differences in attitude among Protestant,\nRoman Catholic, and Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not\nthink of theism as one fixed set of doctrines that is simply\nconsistent or inconsistent with scientific cosmology.\n                                                                                         \nFurthermore, even though most theological interactions with\ncosmology have taken place within the Christian tradition, it has\nrarely—if ever—been the case that the defining feature\nof Christianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any\nexplicit role in these interactions.\n\nChristianity and other monotheistic religions (Islam and Judaism)\nassume a transcendent and sovereign God who created the universe and\ncontinually maintains its existence. The world only exists because of\nan ultimate and supernatural cause which is, as Newton said,\n“not blind and fortuitous, but very well skilled in Mechanicks\nand Geometry” (Cohen 1978, 282). Whether in a general\nphilosophical sense or in a scientific sense, cosmology has always\nbeen part of theism, but it is only relatively recently that cosmology\nbased on physics and astronomy has entered the discussion concerning\nthe existence and role of God. A limited application of physics to the\nstudy of the universe can be found in the second half of the\nnineteenth century when the cosmological consequences of the law of\nentropy increase were eagerly discussed in relation to the Christian\ndoctrines of a world with a beginning and end in time. However,\nphysical cosmology is essentially a twentieth century science which\nemerged as a result of the discovery about 1930 that the universe is\nin a state of expansion that possibly started a finite time\nago. Cosmology as a subdiscipline of physics differs in some respects\nfrom mathematical, philosophical and classical observational\ncosmology, but of course the different approaches are in constant\ninteraction. In a modern sense, physical cosmology became established\nafter the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 which\nquickly turned the hot big bang model into the standard model of the\nuniverse. Jim Peebles' Physical Cosmology of 1971,\npossibly the first book with this title, may be taken as the beginning\nof modern physical cosmology. Although physical cosmology based on general relativity theory and\nelementary particle physics is thus a modern science, many of the\ntheologically relevant questions related to current cosmology are\nold. Has the universe come into existence a finite time ago? Will it\ncome to an end? Why are the cosmic evolution and the laws of nature of\njust such a kind that they permit intelligent life to exist? These and\nother questions of obvious relevance to theism are currently being\ndiscussed in the light of the most recent cosmological theories and\nobservations, but the questions themselves (and, indeed, many of the\nanswers) were familiar to medieval philosophers and theologians. This\nis also the case with the question that is sometimes considered the\nultimate one: Why is there a cosmos? There is no reason to expect that\ntoday's advanced physical cosmology, or the even more advanced\nof tomorrow, will provide final answers that satisfy theists and\natheists alike. Einstein's general theory of relativity shows that the\nstructure of spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to\ncausal influence by the material constituents of the universe. Indeed,\nEinstein immediately saw the potential to apply general relativity to\nlarge-scale cosmological questions.  The first cosmological model of\nEinstein (1917) described a static universe, i.e. one whose spatial\ngeometry is constant over time. Such a model was not consistent with\nthe original field equations; thus Einstein modified the equations by\nthe addition of a cosmological constant Λ.  Although Einstein\nlater regretted the introduction of the cosmological constant, in\nrecent years there have emerged independent reasons for introducing it\ninto the equations. Be that as it may, Einstein's static universe was empirically\ninadequate: it cannot account for the redshift data gathered by Edwin\nHubble and others in the 1920s. The redshift data indicates that\ndistant stars are moving away from us, and moving faster in direct\nproportion to their distance. Thus, the data indicate an expanding\nuniverse. In the 1920s and 1930s, a number of cosmological models of general\nrelativity were proposed that predict the expansion of the\nuniverse. The most accurate account of the data is given by the family\nof Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The key characteristic of\nthese models is that space is homogeneous, and hence\nisotropic (i.e. looks the same in all directions). From the\nhomogeneity assumption, it follows that the entire 4-dimensional\nspacetime divides neatly into a stack of 3-dimensional\n“spaces” each of which has constant curvature. The three\npossibilities for this curvature correspond to the three classical\ngeometries: Euclidean (flat), spherical (positive), or hyperbolic\n(negative). In a given FRW spacetime, the geometry of space at one\ntime is related to the geometry at any other time by means of a scale\nfactor S(t).  Indeed, pick a reference time T,\nsuch as 2011, pick two reference galaxies, and let d(T)\nbe the distance between these galaxies at time T.  Then the\ndistance between the two galaxies at any other time t is given\nby d(t)=S(t)d(T), where we\nset S(T)=1.  This number S(t) is called\nthe scale factor, and its behavior encodes the dynamics of a FRW\nuniverse. In those FRW spacetimes that can reasonably be thought to model our\ncosmos (e.g., those with massive objects), the time parameter t\nhas an absolute lower bound t0. In particular,\nas t decreases towards t0, the scale\nparameter S(t) goes to zero. What happens when t\nreaches t0?  In short, these models cannot say what\nhappens, because there are no points of spacetime with time\ncoordinate t0. That is, t0 is an\nideal point that is never reached: the universe exists at all times\nafter t0, but not before or at time\nt0.  A spacetime model with this feature is\ncalled singular, and the ideal point that is never reached is\ncalled a singularity.  In other words, the big bang is a\nsingularity in a FRW spacetime. The FRW spacetimes are extremely accurate descriptions of the large\nscale structure of our universe.  Since these models describe a\nuniverse with a finite lifetime, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat the universe has not always existed. But many physicists and philosophers hesitate to draw this\nconclusion. In fact, the standard view in the 1950s and early 1960s\nwas that the singularities of the FRW models were consequences of\nfalse idealizing assumptions, namely assumptions of perfect isotropy\nand homogeneity. But this escape route from singularities was\ndefinitely closed when Robert Geroch, Stephen Hawking, and Roger\nPenrose proved the “singularity theorems,” according to\nwhich almost all spacetimes are singular, and in particular,\nalmost all cosmological models describe a finitely old universe. A number of theists take the past-singular nature of cosmological\nmodels as confirmation of the claim that God created the\nuniverse ex nihilo. The list of advocates of this “big\nbang theology” includes Pope Pius XII, Francis Collins\n(director, US National Institutes of Health), and apologists William\nLane Craig and Hugh Ross. And indeed, big bang cosmology does\nprovide prima facie support for theism. After all, big bang\ncosmology says that the universe has a finite age, and (traditional)\ntheism says that God created the universe out of nothing. Does big\nbang cosmology not confirm traditional theism? We give several reasons\nto be cautious about such claims. Advocates of big bang theology are most interested in the claim\nthat the universe is finitely old. Thus, the chain of inferential\nsupport should run as follows: \nBefore discussing the first supposed inferential relation, we note\nthat not all theists are committed to the claim that the universe is\nfinitely old. For example, Aquinas claims (in several places,\nincluding the\nSumma Theologica) that Reason cannot demonstrate the finitude\nof the universe. But Aquinas also thinks that Reason can demonstrate\nthe existence of God; therefore Aquinas does not think that the very\nconcept of God as creator implies that the universe is finitely\nold. (Contrary to some contemporary theologians, though, Aquinas\nclaims that a Christian theist should believe that the\nuniverse is finitely old.  For Aquinas, the finite age of the universe\nis a revealed doctrine, like the divinity of Christ.)  Contemporary\ntheologians Arthur Peacocke and Ian Barbour also claim that the\ndoctrine of the “creation” of the universe is best\ninterpreted as one of the universe's timeless dependence on God, and\nthat such dependence does not demand a temporal creation event.  This\nis also the view of William Stoeger (2010), a Jesuit priest and\ncosmologist, who argues that scientific cosmology can purify theology\nbut never be in conflict with what theology legitimately asserts.  For\nthe remainder of this chapter, we will not discuss further the\nquestion of whether theism requires, or strongly supports, the claim\nthat the universe is finitely old. (Arguments for this claim are\nassessed in (Copan & Craig 2004).) For now we focus on versions of\ntheism that are committed—in a perhaps naive way—to\ncreation ex nihilo. Even on this understanding of theism, there are\nstill reasons to exercise caution in seeing the big bang as confirming\nthe prediction that God created the universe. The big-bang theologian argues that the claim provides evidential support for theism.  But there are many theists\nfor whom the discovery that the universe is 13 billion years old would\nactually serve as a disconfirmation of their theistic belief.  For\nexample, Bishop Ussher of Ireland (1581–1656) claimed to derive from\nthe Bible that the universe was created in 4004 B.C.; and even in the\ntwenty-first century, some Christian thinkers claim Biblical warrant\nfor an age of the universe much less than 13 billion years (see Kelly\n2000 and Byl 2001).  For these thinkers, then, the big bang would\ndisconfirm theism—or at least their version of theism, which is\ncommitted to the literal accuracy of the Biblical account of creation.\nMore strongly, it seems that Christian theism is committed to a belief\nin a finitely old universe primarily on the basis of its commitment to\nthe accuracy of Biblical accounts of creation.  Thus, if a theist\ncomes to believe the big-bang account of the universe's origin, and\nhence to doubt the literal Biblical account, then she will lose one\nreason—and possibly her only reason—for believing that\nthe universe is finitely old. Of course, there are also theists who interpret Genesis\n  metaphorically as implying that the universe was created, but not\n  indicating a specific age for the universe.  For these theists,\n  finding that the universe is finitely old might confirm rather than\n  undermine their belief. According to traditional Christian theism, creation ex\nnihilo is miraculous—something which the laws of nature\ncannot explain. But then why should a theist expect to be able to\nderive creation ex nihilo from the laws of nature?  Compare\nwith other supposed miracles, e.g., within Christianity the claim that\nJesus changed water into wine. Do Christian theists claim that\nchemistry should predict that water can transform into wine? Of course\nnot: God is supposed to be able to transcend the laws of nature, and\nthe laws of nature are defeasible when it comes to describing what\nactually did happen (since God could have intervened). But then\ncouldn't the best (most explanatory, most elegant) cosmological theory\nposit an infinite past, whereas in reality God created it some finite\ntime in the past? The puzzle we have just encountered trades on the special status of\ncosmology as a historical, yet law-based science, with only one actual\nmodel. While theists would certainly not expect the laws of chemistry\nto predict that water can transform into wine, they do believe that an\naccurate historical account would include reference to those miracles\nthat did occur.  So, is cosmology more like history, or more like\nchemistry?  If God did create the universe, should a cosmological\ntheory report (or predict or entail) such a fact? Or should cosmology\nonly be required to provide laws for universes, laws which might in\nfact have been broken in our universe? Suppose that the theist takes a harder line and says that\ntheism requires (or favors) cosmological models with a finitely old\nuniverse. In this case, the time parameter in our cosmological models\nshould never take values lower than some fixed number, which we can\nconveniently set to zero. But the interval (0,t) is topologically isomorphic to\n(−∞,t), suggesting that duration of time (finite\nversus infinite) might lack intrinsic physical or theological\nsignificance. Such a point was made already by E.A. Milne in\n1935, and then independently by Charles Misner in 1969. In particular,\nMisner replaces the time parameter t with the negative of\nits logarithm (i.e., −log t) in order to assuage worries\nthat a bounded time parameter makes no sense. According to Misner (1969, 1331),\neven in models that begin with singularities, “the Universe is\nmeaningfully infinitely old because infinitely many things have\nhappened since the beginning.” Interestingly, Misner's\nmove can hardly be motivated by a desire to obviate the need for a\ncreator: Misner is a self-described Catholic Christian. The possibility that the finite/infinite time distinction is\nconventional was noted by the catholic philosopher of science Ernan\nMcMullin, who concludes that the theological doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo must not be given a metric interpretation (McMullin\n1981). Rather, claims McMullin, the ex nihilo doctrine should be\ninterpreted order-theoretically: the time series has a first\npoint. But this order-theoretic criterion will not help theism, at\nleast not in regard to current cosmological models. On the one hand,\nFRW cosmological models fail the order-theoretic criterion:\nthey have no first moment of time. On the other hand, an ideal first\nmoment of time could be adjoined to any spacetime, even those\nthat have a metrically infinite past (see Earman 1995). Thus, a simple\norder-theoretic criterion is a bad guide to whether cosmological\nmodels are consistent with the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. A more adequate criterion of when a cosmological model is consonant\nwith creation ex nihilo would require a detailed analysis of\nsingular spacetimes (for extensive discussion of the latter topic, see\nEarman 1995). The best current account of when a spacetime is truly\nsingular (as opposed to merely being described with inadequate\ncoordinates) is when it contains inextendible geodesics of finite\nlength.  Intuitively, a geodesic is the path that would be followed by\na clock in freefall.  If a clock were travelling on a\npast-inextendible geodesic, then at some finite time in the past, the\nclock did not exist; more strongly, spacetime itself did not exist.\nThus, the big-bang theologian would do best to claim that\ncreation ex nihilo is confirmed precisely by those\ncosmological spacetimes that have inextendible geodesics.  (Indeed,\nthis criterion does hold for FRW models.) The main problem with such a\nproposal is that it ties a robust, intuitive theological doctrine down\nto an extremely precise technical feature of Lorentzian manifolds (as\ndescribed by differential geometry). The risk then is that by doing\nso, one would add extraneous content to the theological doctrine: a\nfuture model might fail the technical criterion while still being\nconsistent with the theological doctrine.  Furthermore, many Christian\ntheists claim that core theological doctrines are \nperspicuous—in particularly, not understood exclusively by an elite class of\npriests or scholars. But the notion of a Lorentzian manifold having\nincomplete geodesics can hardly be said to be accessible to the\naverage layperson. Finally, big-bang theology overreaches if it says that\ngeneral relativity and the singularity theorems have settled once and\nfor all that the universe had a beginning in time. In fact,\nrelativistic cosmology predicts its own invalidity for times close to\na dynamic singularity, such as the big bang. (For a dissenting\nopinion, see Misner 1969.)  The reason that relativistic cosmology\npredicts its own own invalidity is that in the neighborhood of\nsingularities, gravitational effects are intense, and quantum effects\ncan be expected to play a predominant role. But general relativity\ndoes not incorporate quantum effects, and indeed it is untested in\nsuch regimes of intense gravitational force. Thus, there is little\nreason to believe that the singularity theorems make a valid\nprediction about the structure of a future successor theory of general\nrelativity that includes quantum effects. We discuss this issue\nfurther in Section 4. Most philosophers and physicists have thought that big\nbang cosmology is either neutral towards, or supportive of,\ntraditional theism. Thus, atheists have usually taken a defensive\nstance, trying to defeat the arguments of the big-bang\ntheologians. But a vocal minority—we might call them\n“big-bang atheologians”—have made the stronger\nclaim that big bang cosmology disconfirms theism. The most visible\nproponents of this big-bang atheology are the philosophers Adolf\nGrünbaum and Quentin Smith. In the case of Smith, quantum\ncosmologies are taken to provide even stronger evidence against\ntheism. In putting forward their arguments, big-bang atheologians make a\nnumber of points that seem to have been overlooked by their theistic\ncounterparts. One such point is that FRW cosmological models have no\nfirst state. Thus, a theist who invokes the big bang cannot say that\nthere is a state of the universe, say Α, such that God created\nthe universe in state Α. He or she will have to invoke a more\nsophisticated notion of God creating initial temporal intervals, or\nsomething like that. Are these more sophisticated developments still\nconsonant with traditional theology? Big-bang atheologians also argue that it makes no sense to accept\nboth that there were no times before the big bang (since time itself\ncomes into existence with the universe) and that the universe was\ncaused. Of course, many theists claim that God causes the universe\ntimelessly, and they would attempt to defend the coherence of such a\nnotion in the face of these criticisms.  The case of quantum cosmology provides further complications for\ntheology. Without going into excessive detail of specific proposals, a\ncommon theme of many quantum cosmologies is that they postulate a\nprobability distribution over universes themselves. In other words,\nquantum cosmologies provide a measure of likelihood that certain sorts\nof universes exist. Some older quantum cosmologies\n(e.g., Hawking's early proposals) still predict that the\nuniverse is finitely old. And yet, one might consider their further\nexplanatory power—over and above classical general \nrelativity—as undermining theistic explanations of the universe. In\nparticular, quantum cosmology predicts with a high probability that a\nuniverse like ours would exist. Seen from this perspective, one might\ntake quantum cosmologies to offer a competing, non-theistic\nexplanation for the origin of the universe. Theists have argued, in response, that quantum cosmologies do not\nprovide unconditional probabilities for the existence of the\nuniverse. For example, Craig (1997), Deltete & Guy (1997), and Oppy\n(1997) argue that quantum cosmologies provide only conditional\nprobabilities for the existence of some universe configurations given\nother universe configurations. Smith (1998) responds by defending the\nclaim that the probabilities in quantum cosmology are\nunconditional. But neither side of this debate has attended to the\nspecial complications involved in interpreting quantum,\nrather than classical, probabilities. For example, Smith treats the\nuniversal wavefunction\nΨ(hi j, f) as providing a\nprobability distribution over universe configurations\n(hi j, f). But we know, from\nelementary quantum mechanics, that it is literally inconsistent (i.e.,\nleads to contradictions) to treat a wavefunction as giving\nprobabilities in an absolute sense. (This contradiction is derived by\nthe famous Kochen-Specker theorem.)  We conclude that in order for the\nmetaphysical significance of quantum cosmologies to be assessed, a\nmore nuanced consideration of the interpretation of quantum mechanics\nwill be required. Aristotle's cosmology belonged to the class of steady-state\ntheories in so far that his universe was changeless and eternal. When\nEinstein in 1917 proposed the first relativistic model of the\nuniverse, he unwittingly pictured a universe which had qualitative\nfeatures in common with Aristotle's: it was finite in space, but\ninfinite in time. The discovery of the expansion of the universe\nexcluded the steady state from relativistic cosmology, but not from\nother forms of cosmology. Robert Millikan, Nobel laureate and famous\nphysicist, was among those who in the 1930s favored an eternally\nrecurrent universe with a continual creation of matter and energy to\ncounter the increase of entropy. He thought that such an eternal and\nevolving universe revealed the creator's continual activity and\nexplicitly presented his cosmological view as support for the\ndoctrines of Christianity in general and for the immanence of God in\nparticular. Contrary to the earlier ideas of a steady-state universe, the\ntheory that Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold introduced in\n1948 accepted that the universe is expanding. Conceptually the theory\nwas founded on the “perfect cosmological principle,” that\nis, the postulate that the universe in its large-scale features is not\nonly spatially but also temporally homogeneous. Although this\nclassical steady-state theory was abandoned in the 1960s because of\nits inability to account for new discoveries (such as the cosmic\nmicrowave background and the redshifts of quasars), it remains an\ninstructive case in the cosmology-theology discussion.  Moreover, the\ntheory is not quite dead yet, as some of its characteristic features\nsurvive in the quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) still defended by\nJayant Narlikar and a few other cosmologists. This model does not\nsatisfy the perfect cosmological principle, but it assumes an\nindefinite cosmic time scale during which matter is continually\ncreated. In this respect it is an alternative to the big-bang theory\nand its supposed association with divine creation. In 1994, at a time\nwhen he was developing the QSSC model, Hoyle referred to big-bang\ncosmology as “a form of religious fundamentalism” (Hoyle\n1994, 413). According to the classical steady-state theory, the\nuniverse has expanded for an infinity of time and will continue to do\nso for ever; yet the average density of matter remains constant\nbecause matter, or rather matter-energy, is continually being created\nout of nothing. (In later versions of the theory, matter creation was\nnot ex nihilo.) Both features—the infinite time scale and the\ncontinuous creation of matter—were controversial and caused\nconcern of a philosophical and also a theological nature. It was widely assumed in the 1950s that the steady-state universe\nwas contrary to theism or at least made God superfluous as a creator\nof the cosmos. After all, how can God have created a universe which\nhas existed in an infinity of time? According to the astronomer,\nscience popularizer and non-believer Carl Sagan, “this is one\nconceivable finding of science that could disprove a \nCreator—because an infinitely old universe would never have been\ncreated” (1997, 265).  However, although the argument may seem\nto pose a real problem for theism, the theologians were well \nprepared—it had been discussed since the thirteenth century when Thomas\nAquinas suggested that God could indeed have created an infinitely old\nuniverse.  Moreover, theological responses to an infinitely old\nuniverse were far from new, for they had already been developed in\nrelation to eternally cyclic models, either in the more speculative\nversions of the nineteenth century or the relativistic models that\nwere proposed in the 1930s onwards. According to the Thomistic doctrine of creatio continuans,\nGod causes things to exist in the sense that their existence depends\nwholly on his power. If they were left to themselves they would turn\ninto, or return into, nothingness. From this point of view creation is\nbasically a metaphysical rather than a physical and temporal concept,\nand an eternal yet created universe is perfectly\npossible. Interestingly, the leading steady-state physicist William\nMcCrea was also a devout Christian who argued that cosmology, in\nwhatever form, must necessarily include the postulation of a divine\ncreator. As theologians in the 1950s, both Protestants and Catholics,\nwere quick to point out, Hoyle's eternal universe was not\nparticularly heretical, for it was still in need of a creator. Not\nonly did they mobilize the old concept of continual divine creation,\nemphasizing that cosmic creation is primarily about the ontological\ndependence of the world on God, they also stressed that faith in God\nhas little to do with physical cosmology in whatever of its\nversions. Erich Mascall, a priest and philosopher of religion, saw no\nreason why the steady-state model should cause worry among the\nfaithful. As he said in 1956, “The whole question whether the\nworld had a beginning or not is, in the last resort, profoundly\nunimportant for theology” (Mascall 1956, 155). Views similar to Mascall's have been held by many later theologians\nand Christian philosophers, but not by all. There is disagreement\nabout how solidly based in the Bible the concept of atemporal\ncontinual creation is, and also about the significance of an absolute\nbeginning of the world (for opposite views, see Copan and Craig 2004\nand May 1994). The view that cosmology is essentially irrelevant to\nChristian belief has not gone uncontested. As Ernan McMullin has\npointed out, Christian doctrines are more than metaphysics and codes\nfor moral conduct; they are also cosmic claims that say something\nabout the universe and what it contains of things. For this reason\ntheologians need to pay attention to cosmology in particular and to\nscience in general. Some Christian scientists and philosophers have seen the continual\ncreation of matter, as posited by the steady-state theory, as a\nmanifestation of perpetual divine creation. Thus, the Catholic\nphilosopher Philip Quinn (1993) has adopted the old notion of creatio\ncontinuans to the case of steady-state cosmology. The argument is\nessentially that since ex nihilo creation of matter violates energy\nconservation, there must be an external creative cause that accounts\nfor the violation, and this cause he identifies with perpetual divine\ncreation. This kind of reasoning has been severely criticized by Adolf\nGrünbaum, who flatly dismisses the claim that underlies the idea of\nperpetual divine creation, namely that nothingness is the natural\nstate of the universe. This claim has also been argued in detail by\nRichard Swinburne (1996), who finds it extraordinary that there exists\nanything at all and from the fact that something exists infers the\nexistence of God. But according to Grünbaum there is no room for\ndivine creation in either big-bang or steady-state\ncosmology. “Steady-state cosmology,” he concludes,\n“is indeed logically incompatible with [the] claim that\ndivine creative intervention is causally necessary for the\nnonconservative popping into existence of new matter in the\nsteady-state universe” (Grünbaum 1996, 529). Whereas steady-state cosmology is at least problematical from the\npoint of view of traditional theology, it goes well together with the\nideas of process theology or philosophy, where God is seen as\ninteracting creatively and incessantly with natural processes. In a\ngeneral sense, Whitehead's philosophy is more in harmony with\nthe steady state than the big bang universe. The prominent British\nastronomer Bernard Lovell (1959), a devoted Christian inspired by\nprocess thinking, was in sympathy with the steady-state theory and saw\nno reason why it should be a threat to belief in a divine being. To\nhim, the creation of matter was a sure sign of God's\nactivity. As we mentioned previously, there are reasons to suspect the\ninvalidity of classical general relativity in regions near a\nsingularity—most importantly, for times very close to the big\nbang. In particular, when lengths are very small, and curvature and\ntemperatures are very high, then—if the gravitational force\nbehaves like all other known forces of nature—quantum effects\nwill take over, and we should accordingly expect different\noutcomes. This observation is itself sufficient to utterly destroy the\naspirations of big-bang theology—unless there are good reasons\nto think that the finite-age prediction of relativistic cosmology will\nbe preserved in a quantum gravity or in string theory. In this\nsection, we briefly review the known data about singularities in\ntheories that attempt to unify gravity and quantum mechanics. Our\nreview supports two conclusions: (1) We do not know yet if the best\nmodel will predict a finitely old universe, but (2) there are good\nreasons to think that the big bang is not necessarily an absolute\nbeginning. There have been a number of proposed theories of quantum\ncosmology. Perhaps best known of these is the proposal of Stephen\nHawking, which results in a universe with no \nboundary—motivating the famous question, “what place, then, for a\ncreator?” The bearing of Hawking's cosmology on theism has\nalready been discussed extensively by Craig & Smith (1995),\nDeltete & Guy (1997), Craig (1997), and Smith (1998). But it would\nbe ill advised to take Hawking's theory as giving the final\nversion of quantum cosmology. As noted by Drees (1990),\nHawking's approach is just one among several competing attempts\nto incorporate quantum effects into relativistic cosmology, and we are\nnot compelled to accept its idiosyncratic metaphysical picture. More\nto the point, Hawking's cosmological model is ad hoc in the\nsense that it does not flow from a more comprehensive unification of\ngeneral relativity quantum theory. In this section we turn to two\ncosmological theories that do result from systematic and comprehensive\nunifications of general relativity and quantum theory: loop quantum\ncosmology and string cosmology. Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is an approach to cosmology within the\nframework of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) program (Rovelli 2004),\nwhich itself starts with the idea that unifying quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity will require “quantizing” the\ngravitational field—and hence the structures of spacetime\nitself. Roughly speaking, to quantize a theory means that the\nquantities (e.g., position, momentum, scalar curvature, etc.) are\nreplaced by “matrices,” or more generally with\n“operators on a Hilbert space.” This replacement can have\nprofound physical consequences, most particularly the spectrum of a\nquantity (i.e., the numerical values it can possess) can become\ndiscretized where it was previously continuous, or bounded where it\nwas previously unbounded, and quantities can be forced to obey a\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. For our purposes, the important question is what happens to those\nquantities (e.g., spatial curvature) that grow unboundedly large\nin classical FRW spacetimes as the time parameter t\napproaches the initial boundary time\nt0?  To answer this question requires going\nthrough intricate technicalities involving domains of definition of\noperators, etc.. To summarize, however, the most prominent proposal\n(championed primarily by Martin Bojowald and collaborators; see\nBojowald 2009) results in a scale parameter S(t) that\nis bounded away from zero, entailing that curvature is bounded from\nabove. More is true: the dynamical equations of LQC extend through the\nbig bang, i.e., the universe existed before the big\nbang. It would be premature to take loop quantum cosmology as having\ndecisively overturned the big-bang, finite-age cosmological\nmodel. Nonetheless, there is a non-negligible probability that it will\ndo so in the near future; and hence there is a non-negligible\nprobability that the big bang is not the beginning of the universe,\nand a fortiori, not the creation event (even if there was one). However, loop quantum gravity is not the most popular—in\nterms of sheer number of researchers—approach to unifying\nquantum theory and gravity. The title of most popular belongs to\nstring theory, and so string theory's perspective on the big\nbang event is of crucial interest for those wishing to assess the\nbearing of physical cosmology on traditional theological\ndoctrines. All indications from string cosmology point to the fact that the\nuniverse existed before the big bang.  In particular, string theory\nclaims that if we apply fundamental symmetry transformations to\ncosmological models of the recent universe, then we get a copy of the\nuniverse (with important quantities inverted) that might be called the\n“pre-big-bang universe.” In this scenario, the absolute\nbig bang disappears and is replaced by a saddle point in the dynamical\nevolution of spacetime curvature: before this point, curvature is\nincreasing, and after this point, it is decreasing. According to Gasperini (2008), string cosmology's prediction\nof a pre-big-bang universe results from a principled application of\nsymmetry principles. Furthermore, string theory has a built in\nmechanism (namely a minimum string length) that seems to rule out\nsingularities of infinite curvature or spatial length shrinking to\nzero. As was the case in LQC, the values of physical quantities in\nstring theory are constrained by quantum mechanical laws; and so some\nquantities that grew beyond bounds in classical theory are\nwell-behaved in quantized versions of that theory. We currently lack the empirical data that would distinguish between\ncompeting models of quantum cosmology. But these models make different\nempirical predictions from each other, and they also make different\npredictions from classical relativistic cosmology. Hence, it is an\nempirical, rather than a metaphysical, question whether the big bang\nwas the beginning of the universe. However, just as the big-bang is not unambiguously friendly to\ntheism, so quantum cosmology is not unambiguously hostile to\ntheism. Indeed, Chris Isham (1993, 405) has suggested that quantum\ncosmology's description of a boundary-free universe accords\nquite well with theism's insistence that God sustains the\nuniverse at all times. (See also the discussion in Drees 1988, 1990,\n1991.) Clearly, theism has shown some flexibility in integrating its\ndoctrines with prevailing scientific worldviews—as evidenced,\ne.g., in the integration of Aristotelian cosmology, and in the\nexploitation of big-bang cosmology. Should we expect the situation to\nbe any different with quantum cosmology? Apart from the quantum-based cosmologies mentioned above, there are\nseveral other theories of the universe that differ from the generally\naccepted big bang theory and are, in this sense,\n“non-standard.” A few of these models have been discussed\nwithin a religious context. We shall limit ourselves to two groups of\ntheories, cyclic cosmologies and multiverse theories. Origen, a third-century Christian philosopher, speculated that God,\nbefore he created our universe, had busied himself with the creation\nof an endless series of earlier worlds. His idea of an eternal cyclic\nuniverse was however condemned by the church and has since then\ngenerally been regarded as associated with atheism and\nmaterialism. Indeed, from about 1850 to 1920 the classical cyclic or\nrecurrent universe was popular among many atheistic thinkers who found\nit to be incompatible with Christian doctrines.  Nonetheless, some\ntheists have endorsed such a universe, e.g., Joseph Smith's claim that\n“as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so\nshall another come” (Mormon Book of Moses 1:38). Although Einstein's cosmological field equations do not justify a\nseries of pulsating universes, many cosmologists have suggested ways\nin which a collapsing universe can reappear from a nonsingular state\nand thus give birth to a new universe, perhaps ad infinitum. It should\nbe pointed out that Lemaître, the cosmologist-priest,\ndid not suggest such a “Phoenix universe,” in\nspite of numerous claims to the opposite. In some cases atheism has\nbeen part of the motivation for proposing singularity-free models with\nan unlimited past and future. For example, the British physicist\nWilliam Bonnor considered the new big bang theory “the\nopportunity Christian theology has been waiting for ever since science\nbegan to depose religion from the minds of rational men” (Bonnor\n1964, 117). His own favored candidate, a universe oscillating smoothly\nand eternally between two states of finitely high density, avoided a\ndivine miracle and theistic exploitation of cosmology, in which\nrespect it was similar to the steady-state theory. Steven Weinberg\nnoticed the similarity: “Some cosmologists are philosophically\nattracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the\nsteady-state model, it nicely avoids the problem of Genesis”\n(Weinberg 1977, 154). Classical-relativistic cyclic models presupposed a closed universe\ndisagreeing with current observations, for which reason they are no\nlonger considered viable alternatives. But the twenty-first century\nhas witnessed several new proposals, of which we shall mention only\ntwo: the “conformal cyclic cosmology” developed by Roger\nPenrose, and the “new cyclic cosmology” developed by Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok. In his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, Penrose claims that as\nthe big bang is approached, massive objects play a negligible role, so\nthat the physics is governed by degrees of freedom that are invariant\nunder rescaling of lengths and times. Such degrees of freedom are\ncalled “conformal invariants.” Thus, Penrose claims, we\nmake a mistake to model the early universe by a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a metric (as is done in classical general relativity). Rather,\nspacetime should be described by a conformal manifold, which\nis essentially a conformal equivalence class of general relativistic\nspacetimes. The “cyclic” part of Penrose's cosmology\ncomes from noticing that the future of one ever-expanding universe can\nbe smoothly bridged to the past of another big-bang universe by means\nof such a conformal manifold. In this case, the big bang is not a true\nbeginning, but only a sort of phase change from one\n“epoch” to another (Penrose 2010). The new cyclic cosmology of Steinhardt and Turok develops ideas\nfrom string theory to describe a universe without inflation going\nthrough an endless sequence of cycles—in which case, the big\nbang is not the beginning of time (Steinhardt and Turok 2007). In this\nrespect the model is similar to the steady-state model, and Steinhardt\nand Turok has indeed described it as a “remarkable\nreincarnation” of Hoyle's old theory. Although the new\ncyclic model has attracted a fair amount of attention, it is not\nwidely accepted. Nor is this the case with the pre-big-bang bouncing\ncosmology argued by Gabriele Veneziano and Maurizio Gasperini on the\nbasis of string theory. According to the pre-big-bang model the\nuniverse is not only eternal into the future, it is also eternal into\nthe past, the two cosmic phases (contracting and expanding) being\nseparated by a non-singular big bang. Eternal bouncing models qualitatively similar to the pre-big-bang\nscenario have been proposed earlier, either on the basis of the\nrelativistic field equations or on the idea of a plasma\nuniverse. According to the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfvén, a Nobel\nlaureate of 1970 who developed the latter idea, the plasma universe\nwas an alternative to the theistic big bang theory. Since none of the\nmodels considered in this section operate with an absolute beginning,\nthey may seem to be problematic from a theistic point of\nview. However, the theist can always appeal to perpetual divine\ncreation, just as in the case of the steady-state universe. The modern idea of the multiverse is theologically more\ncontroversial. In its so-called landscape version, which since 2002\nhas been promoted and developed by Leonard Susskind and many other\nphysicists, it is based on the apparent non-uniqueness of the\nequations of string theory. The solutions of the equations describe,\nin a sense, possible worlds with different physical parameters,\ninteractions, types of particles, and even dimensionality; the\nmultitude of solutions are then identified with really existing worlds\nwhich generally are causally separate from ours. As a mechanism for\ngenerating the huge number of universes, multiverse physicists make\nuse of the eternal inflation scenario.  Moreover, the multiverse is\nclosely associated with anthropic reasoning: we find ourselves in our\nuniverse, with its particular physical laws and content of particles,\nnot because other universes are impossible or improbable, but because\nour kind of life cannot exist in other universes.  The theory of the\nmultiverse has seductively great explanatory power (while it has\nalmost no predictive power), which is a major reason why many\nphysicists and cosmologists find it attractive. On the other hand,\nother physicists dismiss it as pseudoscience because it is practically\nuntestable. It is common among supporters of the multiverse to conceive it as\nan alternative to a divinely created world and ideas of natural\ntheology. Because it represents our universe as a chance universe,\nspecial only by the fact that we live in it, the multiverse has been\nlikened to another and more famous anti-design theory,\nneo-Darwinianism. Weinberg puts it as follows: “Just as Darwin\nand Wallace explained how the wonderful adaption of living forms could\narise without supernatural intervention, so the string landscape may\nexplain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values\nsuitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent\ncreator” (Weinberg 2007, 39). At least to some theists, the\nmultiverse stands in sharp contrast to Christian belief. As Richard\nSwinburne sees it, “To postulate a trillion trillion other\nuniverses, rather than one God in order to explain the orderliness of\nour universe, seems the height of irrationality” (Swinburne\n1996, 68). Swinburne joins several other philosophers and physicists in seeing\nphysical cosmology as providing key data for a new design argument.\nThe strength of such \n fine-tuning\n  arguments continues to be a hotly\ncontested issue among philosophers (see Collins 2009, Colyvan et\nal. 2005, McGrew et al. 2001, White 2000). On the other hand, there is no one-to-one correspondence between\nthe multiverse and belief in a divine creator. Several philosophers\nhave argued that if theism is true, we should expect the actual world\nto be a multiverse: being a perfect being, God would create a\nmultiverse rather than just a single universe (Kraay 2010). It is\npossible to answer affirmatively to the question, “does God love\nthe multiverse?”, such as the physicist Don Page did at a\nsymposium in 2008 (see Page 2008). Even if there are\n10500 universes (but not, perhaps,\nif there are an infinite number of them), they could have been\nprovidentially created by the almighty God with a purpose we cannot\nfathom. Why not? It has even been suggested (by Paul Davies) that\nmultiverse explanations are reminiscent of divine explanations and\nunintentionally reintroduce a transcendent creator. Mormon theology differs in several respects drastically from the\ntheology of traditional Christianity. Not only is God personal and\nheld to have been created by a prior god (who was again created by a\nprior god, etc.), according to the central doctrine of “eternal\nprogression” human beings will ultimately become like God\nhimself. There is an infinite number of beings and it takes an\neternity for them to become gods. Standard big bang cosmology, based\nas it is on a universe of finite age, is incompatible with Mormonism,\nwhere existence has neither beginning nor end. Whereas traditional\ntheologians have no problem with a universe created ex\nnihilo, and many subscribe to this doctrine, Mormons flatly\nreject it. In order to overcome the conflict with physical cosmology,\nsome Mormon thinkers have turned to the multiverse. Realizing that the\nattempt to harmonize the Mormon dogma of eternal progression with\nmodern cosmology is problematic, Kirk Hagen says: “For\nMormonism, a compelling reason to consider a multiverse cosmology is\nto attempt a reconciliation of modern cosmological ideas and the\ncentral tenet of Mormon doctrine” (Hagen 2006, 28). The anthropic principle, an integral part of multiverse cosmology,\nhas similarly been discussed in theological contexts and, again\nsimilarly, without any consensus emerging from the many\ndiscussions. In its most common version, called the weak anthropic\nprinciple, it states that what we observe is selected by our existence\nin a universe with just such properties that allow us to\nexist. Swinburne and some other theists in favor of design arguments\nfind the anthropic principle to be, at best, unnecessary and\nobfuscating. To them, the values of the cosmic parameters and\nconstants of nature appear to be fine-tuned because they are\nfine-tuned, the designer being God. The atheist Richard Dawkins goes\nfurther, arguing that the anthropic principle is an alternative to the\ndesign hypothesis and provides strong evidence for a world without\nGod. However, theists do not generally see anthropically based\narguments as a problem for a divinely created world. William Lane\nCraig and John Polkinghorne are among those who hold that the\nanthropic principle is compatible with divine design and can even be\nseen as indirect support for theism. According to the South-African\ncosmologist (and Quaker) George Ellis, anthropic fine-tuning is the\nresult of a purposeful design of the universe. He has suggested a\n“Christian anthropic principle” as the basis for an\nultimate understanding of the universe that combines scientific and\nreligious perspectives (Ellis 1993). In relation to the design argument, as reinvigorated by the\ndiscussions of the anthropic principle, some physicists and\nphilosophers have returned to an old objection to it, namely that it\nis not an argument for the Christian God; it is at best an\nargument for a cosmic architect in a deistic sense, or for that matter\nseveral such architects. On the other hand, theists have replied that\neven if this objection be true it does not constitute a proof that the\nGod of theism does not exist. Although design arguments frequently\noccur in connection with the anthropic principle, it needs to be said\nthat they were not part of the original anthropic program initiated by\nBrandon Carter in 1974. Cosmological theory has gone through many phases and proposals over\nthe past 100 years.  Some have included universes with infinite pasts\nand these were mentioned previously.  However, for the past forty\nyears there has been a strong consensus on the modern big bang theory\nwhich has a finite past.  But even if the universe is temporally\nfinite in the past, it may well be spatially and materially\ninfinite. If space is infinite and the cosmological principle is\nassumed to be valid, the universe will contain an infinite number of\ngalaxies, stars, atoms and everything else.  Such actual infinities\nnot only cause philosophical and logical problems, they may also cause\nproblems of a theological nature. In his thought experiment known as\n“Hilbert's hotel” the famous mathematician David Hilbert\ndemonstrated that (countable) actual infinities are so bizarre that\nthey cannot have anything to do with the real world we live in. In\nthis thought experiment, Hilbert imagines that he arrives at a hotel\nwith an infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied.  The desk\nclerk claims nonetheless that there is a vacancy.  He then proceeds to\nask each guest to move to the room with the next highest number in the\nsequence (see Oppy 2006, 8; Kragh 2014, Other Internet Resources). Hilbert himself was uninterested in religion, but later\nphilosophers and theologians have occasionally used his peculiar hotel\napologetically, as an argument for the existence of God and also for\nthe finitude of the universe. The theological problems related to an infinitely large universe\nare not specifically related to modern physical cosmology but have\nbeen discussed since the early days of Christianity. On the other\nhand, they may be seen as even more relevant today, when the favored\ncosmological model has zero curvature, meaning that space is\nflat. Although a flat cosmic space does not necessarily imply an\ninfinite universe, many cosmologists assume that the universe is\nindeed spatially infinite. The theological implications of an infinite universe were discussed\nby the church fathers and, in greater detail, by Johannes Philoponus\nin the sixth century. Many of the arguments were of the same kind as\nthose used in the attempts to prove the impossibility of a temporal\ninfinity. At the time of the scientific revolution it was commonly\nassumed that physical space cannot be truly infinite, only\nindefinitely large.  Infinity was seen as a divine attribute not to be\nfound elsewhere; to claim that nature is infinite would be to endow it\nwith divinity, a heretical view characteristic of pantheism. While the\ngenerally accepted view among theists was, and to some extent still\nis, that an infinite universe is philosophically absurd and\ntheologically heretical, there was no consensus on the issue. In fact,\nseveral Christian thinkers, from Descartes in the seventeenth century\nthrough Kant in the eighteenth to Edward Milne in the twentieth, have\nargued that an infinite universe is in better agreement with\nGod's will and omnipotence than a finite one. According to\nMilne, “It requires a more powerful God to create an infinite\nuniverse than a finite universe; it requires a greater God to leave\nroom for an infinity of opportunities for the play of evolution than\nto wind up a mechanism, once and for all” (Milne 1948, 233). The\ncorrelation between finitism and theism, and infinitism and atheism,\nshould be seen as historically contingent rather than justified by\neither scientific or theological reasons. During the early period of modern cosmology, relativistic models\nwith zero or negative curvature were sometimes associated with\nmaterialism and atheism because they implied a universe of infinite\nsize.  Conversely, Einstein's closed and finite universe was\nwelcomed by theists. According to Ernest W. Barnes, the mathematically\ntrained bishop of Birmingham, infinite space was “a scandal to\nhuman thought,” as he said in 1931 (Barnes 1931, 598). His\nargument was epistemic as well as theological: only if God's\nuniverse is finite can we hope to understand the full range of his\nactivity. Lemaître thought likewise that the universe had to be finite\nin order to be comprehensible. In agreement with his later warning\nagainst the “nightmare of infinite space” (Kragh 2004,\n139), both of his two innovative cosmological models, the expanding\nmodel of 1927 and the big-bang model of 1931, were spatially\nclosed. The steady-state model of the 1950s was not only unpopular\namong Christians because of its lack of a cosmic creation, but also\nbecause it implied a homogeneous universe of infinite\nextent. According to Stanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and historian\nof science, the infinite universe is a scientific cover-up for\natheism.  Mormons do not agree, though, for they need a universe which\nis infinite in both time and space. The present consensus model of a geometrically flat accelerating\nuniverse is usually taken to imply an infinite cosmos. The general\nattitude of cosmologists is to ignore the troublesome philosophical\nproblems and speak of the infinite universe as just an indefinitely\nlarge one. They rarely reflect on the weird epistemic consequences of\nan actual infinity and even more rarely on the theological\nconsequences. Ellis is an exception to the rule. He and his\ncollaborators have argued forcefully against an infinite universe,\nsuggesting that the flat space of the consensus model is probably an\nabstraction that does not hold physically (Ellis, Kirchner and Stoeger\n2004). If the universe is really infinite and uniform it can be (and\nhas been) argued that there will be an infinity of identical copies of\nall human beings and indeed of everything. Such a consequence, as\ndiscussed by Ellis, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth and others, clearly is\ntheologically disturbing. Even more disturbing, says Ellis, is it that God may then not be\nable to keep track of and give attention to the infinite number of\nbeings in the universe. Moreover, if there is a multitude of cosmic\nregions, each of which is inhabited with intelligent beings, one may\nneed to contemplate a multitude of Christ-figures, incarnations and\ncrucifixions. Ellis was not only willing to consider such a scenario,\nhe also thought that it strengthened the case for a finite universe,\nfor then “we would have to countenance only a finite number of\ncivilizations needing redemption. Surely an infinite number of\nChrist-figures must be too much, no matter how one envisages\nGod” (Ellis 1993, 394). The cosmological field equations are time-symmetric and the\nfundamental laws of physics are assumedly valid at any time. Thus,\nmodern cosmology is not only about the past of the universe, it also\noffers scenarios about its far future, including speculations about\nthe fate of intelligent life. Given that the apocalyptic passages in\nthe Bible speak of an end of the world and a possible new creation\n(e.g., 2 Peter 3:10–13), the cosmic future may seem to offer another\npoint of contact between cosmology and theistic religion. But can\nthere be a secular or scientific eschatology? Scientifically based speculations about the state of the cosmos in\nthe far future and the possibility of endless life were first\ndiscussed in the late nineteenth century in connection with the\ncontroversy over the heat death predicted by the second law of\nthermodynamics. Some of the German scientists involved in the\ncontroversy argued that life might persist even in the very\nhigh-entropic environment of the far future, and they explicitly\nreferred to the eschatological aspects of\ncosmology. Characteristically, while the heat death scenario was\nwelcomed by Christian authors, it was vehemently opposed by\nmaterialists and atheists who argued for an eternal universe with\neternal life. As Eddington, a Quaker and an advocate of the inevitable\nheat death, later asked: “Since when has the teaching that\n‘ heaven and earth shall pass away’ become\necclesiastically un-orthodox?” (Eddington 1935, 59). Since the 1970s “physical eschatology” has emerged as a\nnew subfield of astrophysics and cosmology, pioneered by Freeman\nDyson, Jamal Islam and others (see the survey in Kragh 2011,\n325–353). The field deals primarily with the state of the universe in\nthe remote future as based on extrapolations of cosmological models\nand the assumption that the presently known laws of physics will\nremain indefinitely valid. The favored scenario is the open\never-expanding universe where extrapolations typically result in an\nultimate future (at about 10100\nyears from now!) in which the universe consists of nothing but an\nexceedingly thin electron-positron plasma immersed in a cold radiation\nof neutrinos and photons. Other studies presume a closed universe\ncollapsing in a big crunch and others again investigate the nearer\nfuture of humankind, say a few million years from now. While many of\nthese studies are not concerned with the final state of life, some\nare, and it is this latter group that constitutes physical eschatology\nproper. According to John Barrow and Frank Tipler, the research field\nis, “the study of the survival and the behavior of life in the\nfar future” (Barrow & Tipler 1986, 658). Physical eschatologists usually ignore the religious associations\nof their studies or deny that they exist. Tipler is a controversial\nexception, however. Not only does he argue that some kind of life can\ncontinue forever in a closed universe, he also claims that it is the\nvery collapse of the universe that permits eternal life. When the\nfinal eternity has been reached at what he calls the “omega\npoint,” life becomes omniscient and the temporal becomes\natemporal.  According to Tipler, the final singularity is God and\n“theology is nothing but physical cosmology based on the\nassumption that life as a whole is immortal” (Tipler 1995, 17).\nIn his book The Physics of Christianity (Tipler 2007), he\ncontinues his idiosyncratic exploration of modern cosmotheology\naccording to which theology is merely a branch of\nphysics. Tipler's views are undoubtedly extreme, but (and\nperhaps for this reason) they have caused much discussion among\ntheologians. The term physical eschatology indicates a connection to biblical\neschatology, but it is far from clear that the two are related in any\nmeaningful sense. The message of the Bible is not so much the end of\nthe physical universe as it is about the imminent return of Christ,\nthe transformation of humans from flesh to spirit, and the final\nkingdom of God. It is about the ultimate destiny and goal of humans,\nnot of self-reproducing robots. As Jefferson Davis (1999) notes, the\nultimate hope which is crucial in theology cannot be supplied\nby the laws of physics. The scenario of a closed universe, such as\nargued by Tipler, may appear to be more compatible with the biblical\nview than the case of the ever-expanding universe, but even in the\nformer case it is hard to establish a meaningful connection. While the\nend of the world does not conflict with the Bible, the claims of\nimmortality of intelligent life forms (not necessarily humans) do. The\nBible says that God alone is immortal and that all his created beings\nare doomed to extinction unless God decides otherwise. Several theologians have expressed concern about the\ncosmologists' scenarios of the end of the universe and stressed\nthat there is a world of difference between these scenarios and proper\neschatology. According to Wolfhart Pannenberg the Christian\naffirmation of an imminent end of the world is scarcely reconcilable\nwith the cosmological extrapolations of the state of the universe\nzillions of years ahead. Karl Peters probably speak for the majority\nof theologians when he writes: “If the expanding universe is\nindeed open, expanding forever, then how can one speak of God\nrecreating the universe? If the universe is closed, then it is likely\nto end in a ‘big crunch’ of mammoth black-hole\nproportions. Again, it is difficult to see how a new creation can take\nplace” (Schwarz 2000, 180). According to Peters, the physical\nend of the universe would in effect imply the non-existence of God as\nunderstood in the Christian tradition. Whereas Pannenberg, Peters,\nArthur Peacocke and others tend to think that physical and Christian\neschatology are either contradictory or incommensurable, Craig has\ntaken a more reconcilable view. According to him, the\ncosmologists' versions of secular eschatology furnish grounds\nfor taking seriously the hypothesis of a transcendent creative and\nomnipotent agent. This agent may not be the classical God, but more\nlikely God in a panentheistic version. Finally, Robert Russell (2008) argues that the potential conflict\nmight be resolved by appealing to God's omnipotence and freedom\nto perform miracles: the future of the universe would have\nbeen what science predicts had God not decided to act at Easter and\nbring about, and will continue to bring about, the new creation. This\nview is allegedly not in conflict with science, but only with the\nphilosophical assumption that the events predicted by science must\nhappen, and this assumption Russell sees no reason to accept. The question, “why does the universe exist?” admits of\nanswers from traditional religions as well as from contemporary\ncosmological theories.  However, according to Bede Rundle (2004),\nneither of these answers are needed, for philosophical analysis is\nsufficient to prove the existence of a physical universe.  While some\nclaim that the scientific answer has superseded all theological\nanswers, others claim that the scientific answer reinforces the claim\nthat God created the universe. Indeed, the story of the interaction\nbetween scientific cosmology and theology is by no means a simple tale\nof a better theory replacing an inferior; nor a simple tale of the\nconvergence of diverse sources of knowledge. A naive or ideological\nreading of twentieth century cosmology might count big bang cosmology\nas providing new support for theism, and alternatives such as\nsteady-state cosmology as atheistic backlashes. (And of course, the\nwork of apologists such as W.L. Craig lends credence to this sort of\npicture.) But such a view misses many nuances, both in the historical\nrecord, as well as in the logical structure of these issues. From a\nhistorical point of view, there has been little correlation between\nreligious views of scientific cosmologists and their proposed\ncosmological models. From a epistemological point of view, there are\nnumerous obstacles to claiming that the big bang confirms the\nhypothesis that God exists. And from a metaphysical point of view,\nGod's hand is not manifest even in big bang models: these models have\nno first state for God to create, and these models have no time for\nGod to exist in before the big bang. By pointing out some of the subtleties in the relationship between\nscientific cosmology and theology, we do not intend to claim that the\ntwo are nonoverlapping magisteria (to borrow a phrase from Stephen Jay\nGould). To the contrary, contemporary cosmology is fascinating\nprecisely because it has such intricate logical relations with\ntraditional metaphysical and theological issues.","contact.mail":"hhalvors@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"},{"date.published":"2011-10-24","date.changed":"2017-04-05","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-theology/","author1":"Hans Halvorson","author2":"Helge Kragh","author1.info":"http://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors","entry":"cosmology-theology","body.text":"\n\nAs long as humans have been trying to make sense of the universe,\nthey have been proposing cosmological theories.

According to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole\ncreator and sustainer of the universe.\n\nBut the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of\ncosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the\ndemarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific\ncosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is\nformalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What\nhas this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often\ntheistic) cosmologies?  Has the new cosmology replaced the older\ncosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older\ncosmologies?\n\nOur subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to\nthe case of western monotheism—Judaism, Christianity, and\nIslam—and even more specifically to variants of\nChristianity. Even so, we note a wide range of diversity among\nChristian beliefs and Christian attitudes towards science in general,\nand towards scientific cosmology in particular.

Even within this more traditional\ncamp, we find differences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount\nof flexibility with regard to traditional theological\ndoctrines. (e.g., there are ongoing debates among traditional\ntheologians about the relation of God to time.) At another extreme, we\nfind more recent incarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on\nideas from German idealism and/or process philosophy. There are also\nsubtle, but not negligible, differences in attitude among Protestant,\nRoman Catholic, and Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not\nthink of theism as one fixed set of doctrines that is simply\nconsistent or inconsistent with scientific cosmology.\n                                                                                         \nFurthermore, even though most theological interactions with\ncosmology have taken place within the Christian tradition, it has\nrarely—if ever—been the case that the defining feature\nof Christianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any\nexplicit role in these interactions.\n\nChristianity and other monotheistic religions (Islam and Judaism)\nassume a transcendent and sovereign God who created the universe and\ncontinually maintains its existence. The world only exists because of\nan ultimate and supernatural cause which is, as Newton said,\n“not blind and fortuitous, but very well skilled in Mechanicks\nand Geometry” (Cohen 1978, 282). Whether in a general\nphilosophical sense or in a scientific sense, cosmology has always\nbeen part of theism, but it is only relatively recently that cosmology\nbased on physics and astronomy has entered the discussion concerning\nthe existence and role of God. A limited application of physics to the\nstudy of the universe can be found in the second half of the\nnineteenth century when the cosmological consequences of the law of\nentropy increase were eagerly discussed in relation to the Christian\ndoctrines of a world with a beginning and end in time. However,\nphysical cosmology is essentially a twentieth century science which\nemerged as a result of the discovery about 1930 that the universe is\nin a state of expansion that possibly started a finite time\nago. Cosmology as a subdiscipline of physics differs in some respects\nfrom mathematical, philosophical and classical observational\ncosmology, but of course the different approaches are in constant\ninteraction. In a modern sense, physical cosmology became established\nafter the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 which\nquickly turned the hot big bang model into the standard model of the\nuniverse. Jim Peebles' Physical Cosmology of 1971,\npossibly the first book with this title, may be taken as the beginning\nof modern physical cosmology. Although physical cosmology based on general relativity theory and\nelementary particle physics is thus a modern science, many of the\ntheologically relevant questions related to current cosmology are\nold. Has the universe come into existence a finite time ago? Will it\ncome to an end? Why are the cosmic evolution and the laws of nature of\njust such a kind that they permit intelligent life to exist? These and\nother questions of obvious relevance to theism are currently being\ndiscussed in the light of the most recent cosmological theories and\nobservations, but the questions themselves (and, indeed, many of the\nanswers) were familiar to medieval philosophers and theologians. This\nis also the case with the question that is sometimes considered the\nultimate one: Why is there a cosmos? There is no reason to expect that\ntoday's advanced physical cosmology, or the even more advanced\nof tomorrow, will provide final answers that satisfy theists and\natheists alike. Einstein's general theory of relativity shows that the\nstructure of spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to\ncausal influence by the material constituents of the universe. Indeed,\nEinstein immediately saw the potential to apply general relativity to\nlarge-scale cosmological questions.  The first cosmological model of\nEinstein (1917) described a static universe, i.e. one whose spatial\ngeometry is constant over time. Such a model was not consistent with\nthe original field equations; thus Einstein modified the equations by\nthe addition of a cosmological constant Λ.  Although Einstein\nlater regretted the introduction of the cosmological constant, in\nrecent years there have emerged independent reasons for introducing it\ninto the equations. Be that as it may, Einstein's static universe was empirically\ninadequate: it cannot account for the redshift data gathered by Edwin\nHubble and others in the 1920s. The redshift data indicates that\ndistant stars are moving away from us, and moving faster in direct\nproportion to their distance. Thus, the data indicate an expanding\nuniverse. In the 1920s and 1930s, a number of cosmological models of general\nrelativity were proposed that predict the expansion of the\nuniverse. The most accurate account of the data is given by the family\nof Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The key characteristic of\nthese models is that space is homogeneous, and hence\nisotropic (i.e. looks the same in all directions). From the\nhomogeneity assumption, it follows that the entire 4-dimensional\nspacetime divides neatly into a stack of 3-dimensional\n“spaces” each of which has constant curvature. The three\npossibilities for this curvature correspond to the three classical\ngeometries: Euclidean (flat), spherical (positive), or hyperbolic\n(negative). In a given FRW spacetime, the geometry of space at one\ntime is related to the geometry at any other time by means of a scale\nfactor S(t).  Indeed, pick a reference time T,\nsuch as 2011, pick two reference galaxies, and let d(T)\nbe the distance between these galaxies at time T.  Then the\ndistance between the two galaxies at any other time t is given\nby d(t)=S(t)d(T), where we\nset S(T)=1.  This number S(t) is called\nthe scale factor, and its behavior encodes the dynamics of a FRW\nuniverse. In those FRW spacetimes that can reasonably be thought to model our\ncosmos (e.g., those with massive objects), the time parameter t\nhas an absolute lower bound t0. In particular,\nas t decreases towards t0, the scale\nparameter S(t) goes to zero. What happens when t\nreaches t0?  In short, these models cannot say what\nhappens, because there are no points of spacetime with time\ncoordinate t0. That is, t0 is an\nideal point that is never reached: the universe exists at all times\nafter t0, but not before or at time\nt0.  A spacetime model with this feature is\ncalled singular, and the ideal point that is never reached is\ncalled a singularity.  In other words, the big bang is a\nsingularity in a FRW spacetime. The FRW spacetimes are extremely accurate descriptions of the large\nscale structure of our universe.  Since these models describe a\nuniverse with a finite lifetime, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat the universe has not always existed. But many physicists and philosophers hesitate to draw this\nconclusion. In fact, the standard view in the 1950s and early 1960s\nwas that the singularities of the FRW models were consequences of\nfalse idealizing assumptions, namely assumptions of perfect isotropy\nand homogeneity. But this escape route from singularities was\ndefinitely closed when Robert Geroch, Stephen Hawking, and Roger\nPenrose proved the “singularity theorems,” according to\nwhich almost all spacetimes are singular, and in particular,\nalmost all cosmological models describe a finitely old universe. A number of theists take the past-singular nature of cosmological\nmodels as confirmation of the claim that God created the\nuniverse ex nihilo. The list of advocates of this “big\nbang theology” includes Pope Pius XII, Francis Collins\n(director, US National Institutes of Health), and apologists William\nLane Craig and Hugh Ross. And indeed, big bang cosmology does\nprovide prima facie support for theism. After all, big bang\ncosmology says that the universe has a finite age, and (traditional)\ntheism says that God created the universe out of nothing. Does big\nbang cosmology not confirm traditional theism? We give several reasons\nto be cautious about such claims. Advocates of big bang theology are most interested in the claim\nthat the universe is finitely old. Thus, the chain of inferential\nsupport should run as follows: \nBefore discussing the first supposed inferential relation, we note\nthat not all theists are committed to the claim that the universe is\nfinitely old. For example, Aquinas claims (in several places,\nincluding the\nSumma Theologica) that Reason cannot demonstrate the finitude\nof the universe. But Aquinas also thinks that Reason can demonstrate\nthe existence of God; therefore Aquinas does not think that the very\nconcept of God as creator implies that the universe is finitely\nold. (Contrary to some contemporary theologians, though, Aquinas\nclaims that a Christian theist should believe that the\nuniverse is finitely old.  For Aquinas, the finite age of the universe\nis a revealed doctrine, like the divinity of Christ.)  Contemporary\ntheologians Arthur Peacocke and Ian Barbour also claim that the\ndoctrine of the “creation” of the universe is best\ninterpreted as one of the universe's timeless dependence on God, and\nthat such dependence does not demand a temporal creation event.  This\nis also the view of William Stoeger (2010), a Jesuit priest and\ncosmologist, who argues that scientific cosmology can purify theology\nbut never be in conflict with what theology legitimately asserts.  For\nthe remainder of this chapter, we will not discuss further the\nquestion of whether theism requires, or strongly supports, the claim\nthat the universe is finitely old. (Arguments for this claim are\nassessed in (Copan & Craig 2004).) For now we focus on versions of\ntheism that are committed—in a perhaps naive way—to\ncreation ex nihilo. Even on this understanding of theism, there are\nstill reasons to exercise caution in seeing the big bang as confirming\nthe prediction that God created the universe. The big-bang theologian argues that the claim provides evidential support for theism.  But there are many theists\nfor whom the discovery that the universe is 13 billion years old would\nactually serve as a disconfirmation of their theistic belief.  For\nexample, Bishop Ussher of Ireland (1581–1656) claimed to derive from\nthe Bible that the universe was created in 4004 B.C.; and even in the\ntwenty-first century, some Christian thinkers claim Biblical warrant\nfor an age of the universe much less than 13 billion years (see Kelly\n2000 and Byl 2001).  For these thinkers, then, the big bang would\ndisconfirm theism—or at least their version of theism, which is\ncommitted to the literal accuracy of the Biblical account of creation.\nMore strongly, it seems that Christian theism is committed to a belief\nin a finitely old universe primarily on the basis of its commitment to\nthe accuracy of Biblical accounts of creation.  Thus, if a theist\ncomes to believe the big-bang account of the universe's origin, and\nhence to doubt the literal Biblical account, then she will lose one\nreason—and possibly her only reason—for believing that\nthe universe is finitely old. Of course, there are also theists who interpret Genesis\n  metaphorically as implying that the universe was created, but not\n  indicating a specific age for the universe.  For these theists,\n  finding that the universe is finitely old might confirm rather than\n  undermine their belief. According to traditional Christian theism, creation ex\nnihilo is miraculous—something which the laws of nature\ncannot explain. But then why should a theist expect to be able to\nderive creation ex nihilo from the laws of nature?  Compare\nwith other supposed miracles, e.g., within Christianity the claim that\nJesus changed water into wine. Do Christian theists claim that\nchemistry should predict that water can transform into wine? Of course\nnot: God is supposed to be able to transcend the laws of nature, and\nthe laws of nature are defeasible when it comes to describing what\nactually did happen (since God could have intervened). But then\ncouldn't the best (most explanatory, most elegant) cosmological theory\nposit an infinite past, whereas in reality God created it some finite\ntime in the past? The puzzle we have just encountered trades on the special status of\ncosmology as a historical, yet law-based science, with only one actual\nmodel. While theists would certainly not expect the laws of chemistry\nto predict that water can transform into wine, they do believe that an\naccurate historical account would include reference to those miracles\nthat did occur.  So, is cosmology more like history, or more like\nchemistry?  If God did create the universe, should a cosmological\ntheory report (or predict or entail) such a fact? Or should cosmology\nonly be required to provide laws for universes, laws which might in\nfact have been broken in our universe? Suppose that the theist takes a harder line and says that\ntheism requires (or favors) cosmological models with a finitely old\nuniverse. In this case, the time parameter in our cosmological models\nshould never take values lower than some fixed number, which we can\nconveniently set to zero. But the interval (0,t) is topologically isomorphic to\n(−∞,t), suggesting that duration of time (finite\nversus infinite) might lack intrinsic physical or theological\nsignificance. Such a point was made already by E.A. Milne in\n1935, and then independently by Charles Misner in 1969. In particular,\nMisner replaces the time parameter t with the negative of\nits logarithm (i.e., −log t) in order to assuage worries\nthat a bounded time parameter makes no sense. According to Misner (1969, 1331),\neven in models that begin with singularities, “the Universe is\nmeaningfully infinitely old because infinitely many things have\nhappened since the beginning.” Interestingly, Misner's\nmove can hardly be motivated by a desire to obviate the need for a\ncreator: Misner is a self-described Catholic Christian. The possibility that the finite/infinite time distinction is\nconventional was noted by the catholic philosopher of science Ernan\nMcMullin, who concludes that the theological doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo must not be given a metric interpretation (McMullin\n1981). Rather, claims McMullin, the ex nihilo doctrine should be\ninterpreted order-theoretically: the time series has a first\npoint. But this order-theoretic criterion will not help theism, at\nleast not in regard to current cosmological models. On the one hand,\nFRW cosmological models fail the order-theoretic criterion:\nthey have no first moment of time. On the other hand, an ideal first\nmoment of time could be adjoined to any spacetime, even those\nthat have a metrically infinite past (see Earman 1995). Thus, a simple\norder-theoretic criterion is a bad guide to whether cosmological\nmodels are consistent with the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. A more adequate criterion of when a cosmological model is consonant\nwith creation ex nihilo would require a detailed analysis of\nsingular spacetimes (for extensive discussion of the latter topic, see\nEarman 1995). The best current account of when a spacetime is truly\nsingular (as opposed to merely being described with inadequate\ncoordinates) is when it contains inextendible geodesics of finite\nlength.  Intuitively, a geodesic is the path that would be followed by\na clock in freefall.  If a clock were travelling on a\npast-inextendible geodesic, then at some finite time in the past, the\nclock did not exist; more strongly, spacetime itself did not exist.\nThus, the big-bang theologian would do best to claim that\ncreation ex nihilo is confirmed precisely by those\ncosmological spacetimes that have inextendible geodesics.  (Indeed,\nthis criterion does hold for FRW models.) The main problem with such a\nproposal is that it ties a robust, intuitive theological doctrine down\nto an extremely precise technical feature of Lorentzian manifolds (as\ndescribed by differential geometry). The risk then is that by doing\nso, one would add extraneous content to the theological doctrine: a\nfuture model might fail the technical criterion while still being\nconsistent with the theological doctrine.  Furthermore, many Christian\ntheists claim that core theological doctrines are \nperspicuous—in particularly, not understood exclusively by an elite class of\npriests or scholars. But the notion of a Lorentzian manifold having\nincomplete geodesics can hardly be said to be accessible to the\naverage layperson. Finally, big-bang theology overreaches if it says that\ngeneral relativity and the singularity theorems have settled once and\nfor all that the universe had a beginning in time. In fact,\nrelativistic cosmology predicts its own invalidity for times close to\na dynamic singularity, such as the big bang. (For a dissenting\nopinion, see Misner 1969.)  The reason that relativistic cosmology\npredicts its own own invalidity is that in the neighborhood of\nsingularities, gravitational effects are intense, and quantum effects\ncan be expected to play a predominant role. But general relativity\ndoes not incorporate quantum effects, and indeed it is untested in\nsuch regimes of intense gravitational force. Thus, there is little\nreason to believe that the singularity theorems make a valid\nprediction about the structure of a future successor theory of general\nrelativity that includes quantum effects. We discuss this issue\nfurther in Section 4. Most philosophers and physicists have thought that big\nbang cosmology is either neutral towards, or supportive of,\ntraditional theism. Thus, atheists have usually taken a defensive\nstance, trying to defeat the arguments of the big-bang\ntheologians. But a vocal minority—we might call them\n“big-bang atheologians”—have made the stronger\nclaim that big bang cosmology disconfirms theism. The most visible\nproponents of this big-bang atheology are the philosophers Adolf\nGrünbaum and Quentin Smith. In the case of Smith, quantum\ncosmologies are taken to provide even stronger evidence against\ntheism. In putting forward their arguments, big-bang atheologians make a\nnumber of points that seem to have been overlooked by their theistic\ncounterparts. One such point is that FRW cosmological models have no\nfirst state. Thus, a theist who invokes the big bang cannot say that\nthere is a state of the universe, say Α, such that God created\nthe universe in state Α. He or she will have to invoke a more\nsophisticated notion of God creating initial temporal intervals, or\nsomething like that. Are these more sophisticated developments still\nconsonant with traditional theology? Big-bang atheologians also argue that it makes no sense to accept\nboth that there were no times before the big bang (since time itself\ncomes into existence with the universe) and that the universe was\ncaused. Of course, many theists claim that God causes the universe\ntimelessly, and they would attempt to defend the coherence of such a\nnotion in the face of these criticisms.  The case of quantum cosmology provides further complications for\ntheology. Without going into excessive detail of specific proposals, a\ncommon theme of many quantum cosmologies is that they postulate a\nprobability distribution over universes themselves. In other words,\nquantum cosmologies provide a measure of likelihood that certain sorts\nof universes exist. Some older quantum cosmologies\n(e.g., Hawking's early proposals) still predict that the\nuniverse is finitely old. And yet, one might consider their further\nexplanatory power—over and above classical general \nrelativity—as undermining theistic explanations of the universe. In\nparticular, quantum cosmology predicts with a high probability that a\nuniverse like ours would exist. Seen from this perspective, one might\ntake quantum cosmologies to offer a competing, non-theistic\nexplanation for the origin of the universe. Theists have argued, in response, that quantum cosmologies do not\nprovide unconditional probabilities for the existence of the\nuniverse. For example, Craig (1997), Deltete & Guy (1997), and Oppy\n(1997) argue that quantum cosmologies provide only conditional\nprobabilities for the existence of some universe configurations given\nother universe configurations. Smith (1998) responds by defending the\nclaim that the probabilities in quantum cosmology are\nunconditional. But neither side of this debate has attended to the\nspecial complications involved in interpreting quantum,\nrather than classical, probabilities. For example, Smith treats the\nuniversal wavefunction\nΨ(hi j, f) as providing a\nprobability distribution over universe configurations\n(hi j, f). But we know, from\nelementary quantum mechanics, that it is literally inconsistent (i.e.,\nleads to contradictions) to treat a wavefunction as giving\nprobabilities in an absolute sense. (This contradiction is derived by\nthe famous Kochen-Specker theorem.)  We conclude that in order for the\nmetaphysical significance of quantum cosmologies to be assessed, a\nmore nuanced consideration of the interpretation of quantum mechanics\nwill be required. Aristotle's cosmology belonged to the class of steady-state\ntheories in so far that his universe was changeless and eternal. When\nEinstein in 1917 proposed the first relativistic model of the\nuniverse, he unwittingly pictured a universe which had qualitative\nfeatures in common with Aristotle's: it was finite in space, but\ninfinite in time. The discovery of the expansion of the universe\nexcluded the steady state from relativistic cosmology, but not from\nother forms of cosmology. Robert Millikan, Nobel laureate and famous\nphysicist, was among those who in the 1930s favored an eternally\nrecurrent universe with a continual creation of matter and energy to\ncounter the increase of entropy. He thought that such an eternal and\nevolving universe revealed the creator's continual activity and\nexplicitly presented his cosmological view as support for the\ndoctrines of Christianity in general and for the immanence of God in\nparticular. Contrary to the earlier ideas of a steady-state universe, the\ntheory that Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold introduced in\n1948 accepted that the universe is expanding. Conceptually the theory\nwas founded on the “perfect cosmological principle,” that\nis, the postulate that the universe in its large-scale features is not\nonly spatially but also temporally homogeneous. Although this\nclassical steady-state theory was abandoned in the 1960s because of\nits inability to account for new discoveries (such as the cosmic\nmicrowave background and the redshifts of quasars), it remains an\ninstructive case in the cosmology-theology discussion.  Moreover, the\ntheory is not quite dead yet, as some of its characteristic features\nsurvive in the quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) still defended by\nJayant Narlikar and a few other cosmologists. This model does not\nsatisfy the perfect cosmological principle, but it assumes an\nindefinite cosmic time scale during which matter is continually\ncreated. In this respect it is an alternative to the big-bang theory\nand its supposed association with divine creation. In 1994, at a time\nwhen he was developing the QSSC model, Hoyle referred to big-bang\ncosmology as “a form of religious fundamentalism” (Hoyle\n1994, 413). According to the classical steady-state theory, the\nuniverse has expanded for an infinity of time and will continue to do\nso for ever; yet the average density of matter remains constant\nbecause matter, or rather matter-energy, is continually being created\nout of nothing. (In later versions of the theory, matter creation was\nnot ex nihilo.) Both features—the infinite time scale and the\ncontinuous creation of matter—were controversial and caused\nconcern of a philosophical and also a theological nature. It was widely assumed in the 1950s that the steady-state universe\nwas contrary to theism or at least made God superfluous as a creator\nof the cosmos. After all, how can God have created a universe which\nhas existed in an infinity of time? According to the astronomer,\nscience popularizer and non-believer Carl Sagan, “this is one\nconceivable finding of science that could disprove a \nCreator—because an infinitely old universe would never have been\ncreated” (1997, 265).  However, although the argument may seem\nto pose a real problem for theism, the theologians were well \nprepared—it had been discussed since the thirteenth century when Thomas\nAquinas suggested that God could indeed have created an infinitely old\nuniverse.  Moreover, theological responses to an infinitely old\nuniverse were far from new, for they had already been developed in\nrelation to eternally cyclic models, either in the more speculative\nversions of the nineteenth century or the relativistic models that\nwere proposed in the 1930s onwards. According to the Thomistic doctrine of creatio continuans,\nGod causes things to exist in the sense that their existence depends\nwholly on his power. If they were left to themselves they would turn\ninto, or return into, nothingness. From this point of view creation is\nbasically a metaphysical rather than a physical and temporal concept,\nand an eternal yet created universe is perfectly\npossible. Interestingly, the leading steady-state physicist William\nMcCrea was also a devout Christian who argued that cosmology, in\nwhatever form, must necessarily include the postulation of a divine\ncreator. As theologians in the 1950s, both Protestants and Catholics,\nwere quick to point out, Hoyle's eternal universe was not\nparticularly heretical, for it was still in need of a creator. Not\nonly did they mobilize the old concept of continual divine creation,\nemphasizing that cosmic creation is primarily about the ontological\ndependence of the world on God, they also stressed that faith in God\nhas little to do with physical cosmology in whatever of its\nversions. Erich Mascall, a priest and philosopher of religion, saw no\nreason why the steady-state model should cause worry among the\nfaithful. As he said in 1956, “The whole question whether the\nworld had a beginning or not is, in the last resort, profoundly\nunimportant for theology” (Mascall 1956, 155). Views similar to Mascall's have been held by many later theologians\nand Christian philosophers, but not by all. There is disagreement\nabout how solidly based in the Bible the concept of atemporal\ncontinual creation is, and also about the significance of an absolute\nbeginning of the world (for opposite views, see Copan and Craig 2004\nand May 1994). The view that cosmology is essentially irrelevant to\nChristian belief has not gone uncontested. As Ernan McMullin has\npointed out, Christian doctrines are more than metaphysics and codes\nfor moral conduct; they are also cosmic claims that say something\nabout the universe and what it contains of things. For this reason\ntheologians need to pay attention to cosmology in particular and to\nscience in general. Some Christian scientists and philosophers have seen the continual\ncreation of matter, as posited by the steady-state theory, as a\nmanifestation of perpetual divine creation. Thus, the Catholic\nphilosopher Philip Quinn (1993) has adopted the old notion of creatio\ncontinuans to the case of steady-state cosmology. The argument is\nessentially that since ex nihilo creation of matter violates energy\nconservation, there must be an external creative cause that accounts\nfor the violation, and this cause he identifies with perpetual divine\ncreation. This kind of reasoning has been severely criticized by Adolf\nGrünbaum, who flatly dismisses the claim that underlies the idea of\nperpetual divine creation, namely that nothingness is the natural\nstate of the universe. This claim has also been argued in detail by\nRichard Swinburne (1996), who finds it extraordinary that there exists\nanything at all and from the fact that something exists infers the\nexistence of God. But according to Grünbaum there is no room for\ndivine creation in either big-bang or steady-state\ncosmology. “Steady-state cosmology,” he concludes,\n“is indeed logically incompatible with [the] claim that\ndivine creative intervention is causally necessary for the\nnonconservative popping into existence of new matter in the\nsteady-state universe” (Grünbaum 1996, 529). Whereas steady-state cosmology is at least problematical from the\npoint of view of traditional theology, it goes well together with the\nideas of process theology or philosophy, where God is seen as\ninteracting creatively and incessantly with natural processes. In a\ngeneral sense, Whitehead's philosophy is more in harmony with\nthe steady state than the big bang universe. The prominent British\nastronomer Bernard Lovell (1959), a devoted Christian inspired by\nprocess thinking, was in sympathy with the steady-state theory and saw\nno reason why it should be a threat to belief in a divine being. To\nhim, the creation of matter was a sure sign of God's\nactivity. As we mentioned previously, there are reasons to suspect the\ninvalidity of classical general relativity in regions near a\nsingularity—most importantly, for times very close to the big\nbang. In particular, when lengths are very small, and curvature and\ntemperatures are very high, then—if the gravitational force\nbehaves like all other known forces of nature—quantum effects\nwill take over, and we should accordingly expect different\noutcomes. This observation is itself sufficient to utterly destroy the\naspirations of big-bang theology—unless there are good reasons\nto think that the finite-age prediction of relativistic cosmology will\nbe preserved in a quantum gravity or in string theory. In this\nsection, we briefly review the known data about singularities in\ntheories that attempt to unify gravity and quantum mechanics. Our\nreview supports two conclusions: (1) We do not know yet if the best\nmodel will predict a finitely old universe, but (2) there are good\nreasons to think that the big bang is not necessarily an absolute\nbeginning. There have been a number of proposed theories of quantum\ncosmology. Perhaps best known of these is the proposal of Stephen\nHawking, which results in a universe with no \nboundary—motivating the famous question, “what place, then, for a\ncreator?” The bearing of Hawking's cosmology on theism has\nalready been discussed extensively by Craig & Smith (1995),\nDeltete & Guy (1997), Craig (1997), and Smith (1998). But it would\nbe ill advised to take Hawking's theory as giving the final\nversion of quantum cosmology. As noted by Drees (1990),\nHawking's approach is just one among several competing attempts\nto incorporate quantum effects into relativistic cosmology, and we are\nnot compelled to accept its idiosyncratic metaphysical picture. More\nto the point, Hawking's cosmological model is ad hoc in the\nsense that it does not flow from a more comprehensive unification of\ngeneral relativity quantum theory. In this section we turn to two\ncosmological theories that do result from systematic and comprehensive\nunifications of general relativity and quantum theory: loop quantum\ncosmology and string cosmology. Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is an approach to cosmology within the\nframework of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) program (Rovelli 2004),\nwhich itself starts with the idea that unifying quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity will require “quantizing” the\ngravitational field—and hence the structures of spacetime\nitself. Roughly speaking, to quantize a theory means that the\nquantities (e.g., position, momentum, scalar curvature, etc.) are\nreplaced by “matrices,” or more generally with\n“operators on a Hilbert space.” This replacement can have\nprofound physical consequences, most particularly the spectrum of a\nquantity (i.e., the numerical values it can possess) can become\ndiscretized where it was previously continuous, or bounded where it\nwas previously unbounded, and quantities can be forced to obey a\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. For our purposes, the important question is what happens to those\nquantities (e.g., spatial curvature) that grow unboundedly large\nin classical FRW spacetimes as the time parameter t\napproaches the initial boundary time\nt0?  To answer this question requires going\nthrough intricate technicalities involving domains of definition of\noperators, etc.. To summarize, however, the most prominent proposal\n(championed primarily by Martin Bojowald and collaborators; see\nBojowald 2009) results in a scale parameter S(t) that\nis bounded away from zero, entailing that curvature is bounded from\nabove. More is true: the dynamical equations of LQC extend through the\nbig bang, i.e., the universe existed before the big\nbang. It would be premature to take loop quantum cosmology as having\ndecisively overturned the big-bang, finite-age cosmological\nmodel. Nonetheless, there is a non-negligible probability that it will\ndo so in the near future; and hence there is a non-negligible\nprobability that the big bang is not the beginning of the universe,\nand a fortiori, not the creation event (even if there was one). However, loop quantum gravity is not the most popular—in\nterms of sheer number of researchers—approach to unifying\nquantum theory and gravity. The title of most popular belongs to\nstring theory, and so string theory's perspective on the big\nbang event is of crucial interest for those wishing to assess the\nbearing of physical cosmology on traditional theological\ndoctrines. All indications from string cosmology point to the fact that the\nuniverse existed before the big bang.  In particular, string theory\nclaims that if we apply fundamental symmetry transformations to\ncosmological models of the recent universe, then we get a copy of the\nuniverse (with important quantities inverted) that might be called the\n“pre-big-bang universe.” In this scenario, the absolute\nbig bang disappears and is replaced by a saddle point in the dynamical\nevolution of spacetime curvature: before this point, curvature is\nincreasing, and after this point, it is decreasing. According to Gasperini (2008), string cosmology's prediction\nof a pre-big-bang universe results from a principled application of\nsymmetry principles. Furthermore, string theory has a built in\nmechanism (namely a minimum string length) that seems to rule out\nsingularities of infinite curvature or spatial length shrinking to\nzero. As was the case in LQC, the values of physical quantities in\nstring theory are constrained by quantum mechanical laws; and so some\nquantities that grew beyond bounds in classical theory are\nwell-behaved in quantized versions of that theory. We currently lack the empirical data that would distinguish between\ncompeting models of quantum cosmology. But these models make different\nempirical predictions from each other, and they also make different\npredictions from classical relativistic cosmology. Hence, it is an\nempirical, rather than a metaphysical, question whether the big bang\nwas the beginning of the universe. However, just as the big-bang is not unambiguously friendly to\ntheism, so quantum cosmology is not unambiguously hostile to\ntheism. Indeed, Chris Isham (1993, 405) has suggested that quantum\ncosmology's description of a boundary-free universe accords\nquite well with theism's insistence that God sustains the\nuniverse at all times. (See also the discussion in Drees 1988, 1990,\n1991.) Clearly, theism has shown some flexibility in integrating its\ndoctrines with prevailing scientific worldviews—as evidenced,\ne.g., in the integration of Aristotelian cosmology, and in the\nexploitation of big-bang cosmology. Should we expect the situation to\nbe any different with quantum cosmology? Apart from the quantum-based cosmologies mentioned above, there are\nseveral other theories of the universe that differ from the generally\naccepted big bang theory and are, in this sense,\n“non-standard.” A few of these models have been discussed\nwithin a religious context. We shall limit ourselves to two groups of\ntheories, cyclic cosmologies and multiverse theories. Origen, a third-century Christian philosopher, speculated that God,\nbefore he created our universe, had busied himself with the creation\nof an endless series of earlier worlds. His idea of an eternal cyclic\nuniverse was however condemned by the church and has since then\ngenerally been regarded as associated with atheism and\nmaterialism. Indeed, from about 1850 to 1920 the classical cyclic or\nrecurrent universe was popular among many atheistic thinkers who found\nit to be incompatible with Christian doctrines.  Nonetheless, some\ntheists have endorsed such a universe, e.g., Joseph Smith's claim that\n“as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so\nshall another come” (Mormon Book of Moses 1:38). Although Einstein's cosmological field equations do not justify a\nseries of pulsating universes, many cosmologists have suggested ways\nin which a collapsing universe can reappear from a nonsingular state\nand thus give birth to a new universe, perhaps ad infinitum. It should\nbe pointed out that Lemaître, the cosmologist-priest,\ndid not suggest such a “Phoenix universe,” in\nspite of numerous claims to the opposite. In some cases atheism has\nbeen part of the motivation for proposing singularity-free models with\nan unlimited past and future. For example, the British physicist\nWilliam Bonnor considered the new big bang theory “the\nopportunity Christian theology has been waiting for ever since science\nbegan to depose religion from the minds of rational men” (Bonnor\n1964, 117). His own favored candidate, a universe oscillating smoothly\nand eternally between two states of finitely high density, avoided a\ndivine miracle and theistic exploitation of cosmology, in which\nrespect it was similar to the steady-state theory. Steven Weinberg\nnoticed the similarity: “Some cosmologists are philosophically\nattracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the\nsteady-state model, it nicely avoids the problem of Genesis”\n(Weinberg 1977, 154). Classical-relativistic cyclic models presupposed a closed universe\ndisagreeing with current observations, for which reason they are no\nlonger considered viable alternatives. But the twenty-first century\nhas witnessed several new proposals, of which we shall mention only\ntwo: the “conformal cyclic cosmology” developed by Roger\nPenrose, and the “new cyclic cosmology” developed by Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok. In his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, Penrose claims that as\nthe big bang is approached, massive objects play a negligible role, so\nthat the physics is governed by degrees of freedom that are invariant\nunder rescaling of lengths and times. Such degrees of freedom are\ncalled “conformal invariants.” Thus, Penrose claims, we\nmake a mistake to model the early universe by a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a metric (as is done in classical general relativity). Rather,\nspacetime should be described by a conformal manifold, which\nis essentially a conformal equivalence class of general relativistic\nspacetimes. The “cyclic” part of Penrose's cosmology\ncomes from noticing that the future of one ever-expanding universe can\nbe smoothly bridged to the past of another big-bang universe by means\nof such a conformal manifold. In this case, the big bang is not a true\nbeginning, but only a sort of phase change from one\n“epoch” to another (Penrose 2010). The new cyclic cosmology of Steinhardt and Turok develops ideas\nfrom string theory to describe a universe without inflation going\nthrough an endless sequence of cycles—in which case, the big\nbang is not the beginning of time (Steinhardt and Turok 2007). In this\nrespect the model is similar to the steady-state model, and Steinhardt\nand Turok has indeed described it as a “remarkable\nreincarnation” of Hoyle's old theory. Although the new\ncyclic model has attracted a fair amount of attention, it is not\nwidely accepted. Nor is this the case with the pre-big-bang bouncing\ncosmology argued by Gabriele Veneziano and Maurizio Gasperini on the\nbasis of string theory. According to the pre-big-bang model the\nuniverse is not only eternal into the future, it is also eternal into\nthe past, the two cosmic phases (contracting and expanding) being\nseparated by a non-singular big bang. Eternal bouncing models qualitatively similar to the pre-big-bang\nscenario have been proposed earlier, either on the basis of the\nrelativistic field equations or on the idea of a plasma\nuniverse. According to the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfvén, a Nobel\nlaureate of 1970 who developed the latter idea, the plasma universe\nwas an alternative to the theistic big bang theory. Since none of the\nmodels considered in this section operate with an absolute beginning,\nthey may seem to be problematic from a theistic point of\nview. However, the theist can always appeal to perpetual divine\ncreation, just as in the case of the steady-state universe. The modern idea of the multiverse is theologically more\ncontroversial. In its so-called landscape version, which since 2002\nhas been promoted and developed by Leonard Susskind and many other\nphysicists, it is based on the apparent non-uniqueness of the\nequations of string theory. The solutions of the equations describe,\nin a sense, possible worlds with different physical parameters,\ninteractions, types of particles, and even dimensionality; the\nmultitude of solutions are then identified with really existing worlds\nwhich generally are causally separate from ours. As a mechanism for\ngenerating the huge number of universes, multiverse physicists make\nuse of the eternal inflation scenario.  Moreover, the multiverse is\nclosely associated with anthropic reasoning: we find ourselves in our\nuniverse, with its particular physical laws and content of particles,\nnot because other universes are impossible or improbable, but because\nour kind of life cannot exist in other universes.  The theory of the\nmultiverse has seductively great explanatory power (while it has\nalmost no predictive power), which is a major reason why many\nphysicists and cosmologists find it attractive. On the other hand,\nother physicists dismiss it as pseudoscience because it is practically\nuntestable. It is common among supporters of the multiverse to conceive it as\nan alternative to a divinely created world and ideas of natural\ntheology. Because it represents our universe as a chance universe,\nspecial only by the fact that we live in it, the multiverse has been\nlikened to another and more famous anti-design theory,\nneo-Darwinianism. Weinberg puts it as follows: “Just as Darwin\nand Wallace explained how the wonderful adaption of living forms could\narise without supernatural intervention, so the string landscape may\nexplain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values\nsuitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent\ncreator” (Weinberg 2007, 39). At least to some theists, the\nmultiverse stands in sharp contrast to Christian belief. As Richard\nSwinburne sees it, “To postulate a trillion trillion other\nuniverses, rather than one God in order to explain the orderliness of\nour universe, seems the height of irrationality” (Swinburne\n1996, 68). Swinburne joins several other philosophers and physicists in seeing\nphysical cosmology as providing key data for a new design argument.\nThe strength of such \n fine-tuning\n  arguments continues to be a hotly\ncontested issue among philosophers (see Collins 2009, Colyvan et\nal. 2005, McGrew et al. 2001, White 2000). On the other hand, there is no one-to-one correspondence between\nthe multiverse and belief in a divine creator. Several philosophers\nhave argued that if theism is true, we should expect the actual world\nto be a multiverse: being a perfect being, God would create a\nmultiverse rather than just a single universe (Kraay 2010). It is\npossible to answer affirmatively to the question, “does God love\nthe multiverse?”, such as the physicist Don Page did at a\nsymposium in 2008 (see Page 2008). Even if there are\n10500 universes (but not, perhaps,\nif there are an infinite number of them), they could have been\nprovidentially created by the almighty God with a purpose we cannot\nfathom. Why not? It has even been suggested (by Paul Davies) that\nmultiverse explanations are reminiscent of divine explanations and\nunintentionally reintroduce a transcendent creator. Mormon theology differs in several respects drastically from the\ntheology of traditional Christianity. Not only is God personal and\nheld to have been created by a prior god (who was again created by a\nprior god, etc.), according to the central doctrine of “eternal\nprogression” human beings will ultimately become like God\nhimself. There is an infinite number of beings and it takes an\neternity for them to become gods. Standard big bang cosmology, based\nas it is on a universe of finite age, is incompatible with Mormonism,\nwhere existence has neither beginning nor end. Whereas traditional\ntheologians have no problem with a universe created ex\nnihilo, and many subscribe to this doctrine, Mormons flatly\nreject it. In order to overcome the conflict with physical cosmology,\nsome Mormon thinkers have turned to the multiverse. Realizing that the\nattempt to harmonize the Mormon dogma of eternal progression with\nmodern cosmology is problematic, Kirk Hagen says: “For\nMormonism, a compelling reason to consider a multiverse cosmology is\nto attempt a reconciliation of modern cosmological ideas and the\ncentral tenet of Mormon doctrine” (Hagen 2006, 28). The anthropic principle, an integral part of multiverse cosmology,\nhas similarly been discussed in theological contexts and, again\nsimilarly, without any consensus emerging from the many\ndiscussions. In its most common version, called the weak anthropic\nprinciple, it states that what we observe is selected by our existence\nin a universe with just such properties that allow us to\nexist. Swinburne and some other theists in favor of design arguments\nfind the anthropic principle to be, at best, unnecessary and\nobfuscating. To them, the values of the cosmic parameters and\nconstants of nature appear to be fine-tuned because they are\nfine-tuned, the designer being God. The atheist Richard Dawkins goes\nfurther, arguing that the anthropic principle is an alternative to the\ndesign hypothesis and provides strong evidence for a world without\nGod. However, theists do not generally see anthropically based\narguments as a problem for a divinely created world. William Lane\nCraig and John Polkinghorne are among those who hold that the\nanthropic principle is compatible with divine design and can even be\nseen as indirect support for theism. According to the South-African\ncosmologist (and Quaker) George Ellis, anthropic fine-tuning is the\nresult of a purposeful design of the universe. He has suggested a\n“Christian anthropic principle” as the basis for an\nultimate understanding of the universe that combines scientific and\nreligious perspectives (Ellis 1993). In relation to the design argument, as reinvigorated by the\ndiscussions of the anthropic principle, some physicists and\nphilosophers have returned to an old objection to it, namely that it\nis not an argument for the Christian God; it is at best an\nargument for a cosmic architect in a deistic sense, or for that matter\nseveral such architects. On the other hand, theists have replied that\neven if this objection be true it does not constitute a proof that the\nGod of theism does not exist. Although design arguments frequently\noccur in connection with the anthropic principle, it needs to be said\nthat they were not part of the original anthropic program initiated by\nBrandon Carter in 1974. Cosmological theory has gone through many phases and proposals over\nthe past 100 years.  Some have included universes with infinite pasts\nand these were mentioned previously.  However, for the past forty\nyears there has been a strong consensus on the modern big bang theory\nwhich has a finite past.  But even if the universe is temporally\nfinite in the past, it may well be spatially and materially\ninfinite. If space is infinite and the cosmological principle is\nassumed to be valid, the universe will contain an infinite number of\ngalaxies, stars, atoms and everything else.  Such actual infinities\nnot only cause philosophical and logical problems, they may also cause\nproblems of a theological nature. In his thought experiment known as\n“Hilbert's hotel” the famous mathematician David Hilbert\ndemonstrated that (countable) actual infinities are so bizarre that\nthey cannot have anything to do with the real world we live in. In\nthis thought experiment, Hilbert imagines that he arrives at a hotel\nwith an infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied.  The desk\nclerk claims nonetheless that there is a vacancy.  He then proceeds to\nask each guest to move to the room with the next highest number in the\nsequence (see Oppy 2006, 8; Kragh 2014, Other Internet Resources). Hilbert himself was uninterested in religion, but later\nphilosophers and theologians have occasionally used his peculiar hotel\napologetically, as an argument for the existence of God and also for\nthe finitude of the universe. The theological problems related to an infinitely large universe\nare not specifically related to modern physical cosmology but have\nbeen discussed since the early days of Christianity. On the other\nhand, they may be seen as even more relevant today, when the favored\ncosmological model has zero curvature, meaning that space is\nflat. Although a flat cosmic space does not necessarily imply an\ninfinite universe, many cosmologists assume that the universe is\nindeed spatially infinite. The theological implications of an infinite universe were discussed\nby the church fathers and, in greater detail, by Johannes Philoponus\nin the sixth century. Many of the arguments were of the same kind as\nthose used in the attempts to prove the impossibility of a temporal\ninfinity. At the time of the scientific revolution it was commonly\nassumed that physical space cannot be truly infinite, only\nindefinitely large.  Infinity was seen as a divine attribute not to be\nfound elsewhere; to claim that nature is infinite would be to endow it\nwith divinity, a heretical view characteristic of pantheism. While the\ngenerally accepted view among theists was, and to some extent still\nis, that an infinite universe is philosophically absurd and\ntheologically heretical, there was no consensus on the issue. In fact,\nseveral Christian thinkers, from Descartes in the seventeenth century\nthrough Kant in the eighteenth to Edward Milne in the twentieth, have\nargued that an infinite universe is in better agreement with\nGod's will and omnipotence than a finite one. According to\nMilne, “It requires a more powerful God to create an infinite\nuniverse than a finite universe; it requires a greater God to leave\nroom for an infinity of opportunities for the play of evolution than\nto wind up a mechanism, once and for all” (Milne 1948, 233). The\ncorrelation between finitism and theism, and infinitism and atheism,\nshould be seen as historically contingent rather than justified by\neither scientific or theological reasons. During the early period of modern cosmology, relativistic models\nwith zero or negative curvature were sometimes associated with\nmaterialism and atheism because they implied a universe of infinite\nsize.  Conversely, Einstein's closed and finite universe was\nwelcomed by theists. According to Ernest W. Barnes, the mathematically\ntrained bishop of Birmingham, infinite space was “a scandal to\nhuman thought,” as he said in 1931 (Barnes 1931, 598). His\nargument was epistemic as well as theological: only if God's\nuniverse is finite can we hope to understand the full range of his\nactivity. Lemaître thought likewise that the universe had to be finite\nin order to be comprehensible. In agreement with his later warning\nagainst the “nightmare of infinite space” (Kragh 2004,\n139), both of his two innovative cosmological models, the expanding\nmodel of 1927 and the big-bang model of 1931, were spatially\nclosed. The steady-state model of the 1950s was not only unpopular\namong Christians because of its lack of a cosmic creation, but also\nbecause it implied a homogeneous universe of infinite\nextent. According to Stanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and historian\nof science, the infinite universe is a scientific cover-up for\natheism.  Mormons do not agree, though, for they need a universe which\nis infinite in both time and space. The present consensus model of a geometrically flat accelerating\nuniverse is usually taken to imply an infinite cosmos. The general\nattitude of cosmologists is to ignore the troublesome philosophical\nproblems and speak of the infinite universe as just an indefinitely\nlarge one. They rarely reflect on the weird epistemic consequences of\nan actual infinity and even more rarely on the theological\nconsequences. Ellis is an exception to the rule. He and his\ncollaborators have argued forcefully against an infinite universe,\nsuggesting that the flat space of the consensus model is probably an\nabstraction that does not hold physically (Ellis, Kirchner and Stoeger\n2004). If the universe is really infinite and uniform it can be (and\nhas been) argued that there will be an infinity of identical copies of\nall human beings and indeed of everything. Such a consequence, as\ndiscussed by Ellis, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth and others, clearly is\ntheologically disturbing. Even more disturbing, says Ellis, is it that God may then not be\nable to keep track of and give attention to the infinite number of\nbeings in the universe. Moreover, if there is a multitude of cosmic\nregions, each of which is inhabited with intelligent beings, one may\nneed to contemplate a multitude of Christ-figures, incarnations and\ncrucifixions. Ellis was not only willing to consider such a scenario,\nhe also thought that it strengthened the case for a finite universe,\nfor then “we would have to countenance only a finite number of\ncivilizations needing redemption. Surely an infinite number of\nChrist-figures must be too much, no matter how one envisages\nGod” (Ellis 1993, 394). The cosmological field equations are time-symmetric and the\nfundamental laws of physics are assumedly valid at any time. Thus,\nmodern cosmology is not only about the past of the universe, it also\noffers scenarios about its far future, including speculations about\nthe fate of intelligent life. Given that the apocalyptic passages in\nthe Bible speak of an end of the world and a possible new creation\n(e.g., 2 Peter 3:10–13), the cosmic future may seem to offer another\npoint of contact between cosmology and theistic religion. But can\nthere be a secular or scientific eschatology? Scientifically based speculations about the state of the cosmos in\nthe far future and the possibility of endless life were first\ndiscussed in the late nineteenth century in connection with the\ncontroversy over the heat death predicted by the second law of\nthermodynamics. Some of the German scientists involved in the\ncontroversy argued that life might persist even in the very\nhigh-entropic environment of the far future, and they explicitly\nreferred to the eschatological aspects of\ncosmology. Characteristically, while the heat death scenario was\nwelcomed by Christian authors, it was vehemently opposed by\nmaterialists and atheists who argued for an eternal universe with\neternal life. As Eddington, a Quaker and an advocate of the inevitable\nheat death, later asked: “Since when has the teaching that\n‘ heaven and earth shall pass away’ become\necclesiastically un-orthodox?” (Eddington 1935, 59). Since the 1970s “physical eschatology” has emerged as a\nnew subfield of astrophysics and cosmology, pioneered by Freeman\nDyson, Jamal Islam and others (see the survey in Kragh 2011,\n325–353). The field deals primarily with the state of the universe in\nthe remote future as based on extrapolations of cosmological models\nand the assumption that the presently known laws of physics will\nremain indefinitely valid. The favored scenario is the open\never-expanding universe where extrapolations typically result in an\nultimate future (at about 10100\nyears from now!) in which the universe consists of nothing but an\nexceedingly thin electron-positron plasma immersed in a cold radiation\nof neutrinos and photons. Other studies presume a closed universe\ncollapsing in a big crunch and others again investigate the nearer\nfuture of humankind, say a few million years from now. While many of\nthese studies are not concerned with the final state of life, some\nare, and it is this latter group that constitutes physical eschatology\nproper. According to John Barrow and Frank Tipler, the research field\nis, “the study of the survival and the behavior of life in the\nfar future” (Barrow & Tipler 1986, 658). Physical eschatologists usually ignore the religious associations\nof their studies or deny that they exist. Tipler is a controversial\nexception, however. Not only does he argue that some kind of life can\ncontinue forever in a closed universe, he also claims that it is the\nvery collapse of the universe that permits eternal life. When the\nfinal eternity has been reached at what he calls the “omega\npoint,” life becomes omniscient and the temporal becomes\natemporal.  According to Tipler, the final singularity is God and\n“theology is nothing but physical cosmology based on the\nassumption that life as a whole is immortal” (Tipler 1995, 17).\nIn his book The Physics of Christianity (Tipler 2007), he\ncontinues his idiosyncratic exploration of modern cosmotheology\naccording to which theology is merely a branch of\nphysics. Tipler's views are undoubtedly extreme, but (and\nperhaps for this reason) they have caused much discussion among\ntheologians. The term physical eschatology indicates a connection to biblical\neschatology, but it is far from clear that the two are related in any\nmeaningful sense. The message of the Bible is not so much the end of\nthe physical universe as it is about the imminent return of Christ,\nthe transformation of humans from flesh to spirit, and the final\nkingdom of God. It is about the ultimate destiny and goal of humans,\nnot of self-reproducing robots. As Jefferson Davis (1999) notes, the\nultimate hope which is crucial in theology cannot be supplied\nby the laws of physics. The scenario of a closed universe, such as\nargued by Tipler, may appear to be more compatible with the biblical\nview than the case of the ever-expanding universe, but even in the\nformer case it is hard to establish a meaningful connection. While the\nend of the world does not conflict with the Bible, the claims of\nimmortality of intelligent life forms (not necessarily humans) do. The\nBible says that God alone is immortal and that all his created beings\nare doomed to extinction unless God decides otherwise. Several theologians have expressed concern about the\ncosmologists' scenarios of the end of the universe and stressed\nthat there is a world of difference between these scenarios and proper\neschatology. According to Wolfhart Pannenberg the Christian\naffirmation of an imminent end of the world is scarcely reconcilable\nwith the cosmological extrapolations of the state of the universe\nzillions of years ahead. Karl Peters probably speak for the majority\nof theologians when he writes: “If the expanding universe is\nindeed open, expanding forever, then how can one speak of God\nrecreating the universe? If the universe is closed, then it is likely\nto end in a ‘big crunch’ of mammoth black-hole\nproportions. Again, it is difficult to see how a new creation can take\nplace” (Schwarz 2000, 180). According to Peters, the physical\nend of the universe would in effect imply the non-existence of God as\nunderstood in the Christian tradition. Whereas Pannenberg, Peters,\nArthur Peacocke and others tend to think that physical and Christian\neschatology are either contradictory or incommensurable, Craig has\ntaken a more reconcilable view. According to him, the\ncosmologists' versions of secular eschatology furnish grounds\nfor taking seriously the hypothesis of a transcendent creative and\nomnipotent agent. This agent may not be the classical God, but more\nlikely God in a panentheistic version. Finally, Robert Russell (2008) argues that the potential conflict\nmight be resolved by appealing to God's omnipotence and freedom\nto perform miracles: the future of the universe would have\nbeen what science predicts had God not decided to act at Easter and\nbring about, and will continue to bring about, the new creation. This\nview is allegedly not in conflict with science, but only with the\nphilosophical assumption that the events predicted by science must\nhappen, and this assumption Russell sees no reason to accept. The question, “why does the universe exist?” admits of\nanswers from traditional religions as well as from contemporary\ncosmological theories.  However, according to Bede Rundle (2004),\nneither of these answers are needed, for philosophical analysis is\nsufficient to prove the existence of a physical universe.  While some\nclaim that the scientific answer has superseded all theological\nanswers, others claim that the scientific answer reinforces the claim\nthat God created the universe. Indeed, the story of the interaction\nbetween scientific cosmology and theology is by no means a simple tale\nof a better theory replacing an inferior; nor a simple tale of the\nconvergence of diverse sources of knowledge. A naive or ideological\nreading of twentieth century cosmology might count big bang cosmology\nas providing new support for theism, and alternatives such as\nsteady-state cosmology as atheistic backlashes. (And of course, the\nwork of apologists such as W.L. Craig lends credence to this sort of\npicture.) But such a view misses many nuances, both in the historical\nrecord, as well as in the logical structure of these issues. From a\nhistorical point of view, there has been little correlation between\nreligious views of scientific cosmologists and their proposed\ncosmological models. From a epistemological point of view, there are\nnumerous obstacles to claiming that the big bang confirms the\nhypothesis that God exists. And from a metaphysical point of view,\nGod's hand is not manifest even in big bang models: these models have\nno first state for God to create, and these models have no time for\nGod to exist in before the big bang. By pointing out some of the subtleties in the relationship between\nscientific cosmology and theology, we do not intend to claim that the\ntwo are nonoverlapping magisteria (to borrow a phrase from Stephen Jay\nGould). To the contrary, contemporary cosmology is fascinating\nprecisely because it has such intricate logical relations with\ntraditional metaphysical and theological issues.","contact.mail":"helge.kragh@nbi.ku.dk","contact.domain":"nbi.ku.dk"}]
