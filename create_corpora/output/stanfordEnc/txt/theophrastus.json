He\nwrote many treatises in all areas of philosophy, in order to support,\nimprove, expand, and develop the Aristotelian system.\n\n\nDiogenes Laertius is our main source for Theophrastus’ life and\nworks. In his Life of Theophrastus V. 36–38 (fr. 1\nFHS&G: for this abbreviation, see Primary Literature\nBibliography), he reports that Theophrastus was born in Eresos on the\nisland of Lesbos around 371 BCE and his original name was Tyrtamus,\nbut Aristotle changed it to Theophrastus because of the godlike manner\nof his speech (theos-phrazein). According to Diogenes\nLaertius, early in his life Theophrastus was a student of an otherwise\nunheard of Alcippus in his native city and then of Plato in the\nAcademy, where he met Aristotle, who was not more than fifteen years\nhis senior and with whom he had a relationship of colleagues or\nassociates rather than one of teacher and pupil. After Plato’s\ndeath in 347 BCE, Theophrastus travelled with Aristotle to Assos in\nAsia Minor, back to Lesbos, and later on to Macedonia, because\nAristotle was summoned there as tutor of Alexander. Around 335 BCE\nthey both returned to Athens. Aristotle founded his school at the\nLyceum but he had to leave again, when Alexander died in 323 BCE, due\nto the increasing anti-Macedonian feelings. Theophrastus succeeded\nAristotle at the school, which during the next thirty-five years,\nunder his headship, acquired a more institutionalized character. It is\nreported that he lectured to as many as two thousand pupils at a time\nat the Peripatos, among whom we find the Academic skeptic Arcesilaus,\nwho left him for Polemo’s Academy, the comic poet Menander and\nthe politician Demetrius of Phalerum. So, when Demetrius became\ngovernor of Athens in 317 BCE in the Macedonian interest, he protected\nand helped Theophrastus, whose situation had become precarious, as is\ntestified by a prosecution of impiety that was brought against him by\na certain Agnonides.  After Demetrius’ expulsion in 307 BCE, he\nwas again persecuted, more seriously this time, when a law was passed\nforbidding anyone to open a school of philosophy without a government\nlicense; Theophrastus as well as many other philosophers left Athens,\nand he returned only when the law was repealed a year later. He died\naround 287 BCE and in his will, which survives in a copy provided by\nDiogenes Laertius (V. 51–57), he left all his books to his\ndisciple Neleus, including the manuscripts of Aristotle’s works,\nwhich he had inherited when he took over the Lyceum. \nDiogenes attributes to Theophrastus well over two hundred\nseparate treatises in different styles, of varying length and on a\nvery wide range of topics, totaling 232,808 lines; of these less than\nten per cent survives. Some works seem to have been intended for use\nwithin the school as basis for Theophrastus’ lectures, while\nothers were intended for a wider audience and they were, therefore,\nwritten in a popular style or in dialogue form. Judging from the\nsurviving material and from their titles, some works were on the same\ntopics as ones by Aristotle, whereas others seem to have dealt with\ntopics related to those of the Aristotelian treatises but not covered\nby them. \nUnfortunately, only a few Theophrastean works are extant, mainly\nbecause they seem to have been particularly influential in later\nperiods, and were recopied then for that reason: \nApart from these extant works, we know that Theophrastus wrote\ntreatises on many more subjects in all areas of philosophy, but of\nthose we have only their titles, some fragments, and few reports and\nparaphrases. The ancient authors who refer to Theophrastus’\nwritings are diverse and vary greatly in their reliability. For\ninstance, traces of Theophrastus’ doctrines can be found in the\nworks of Plutarch, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Galen, Sextus Empiricus,\nDiogenes Laertius, Pliny the Elder, Priscian, Simplicius, Themistius,\nPhotius as well as in Arabic authors (Averroes,\nal-Fārābī, Ibn-an-Nadīm) and Latin sources (Albert\nthe Great, Thomas Aquinas). The following list of titles of\nTheophrastus’ writings\ngives an idea of his prolific philosophical production: \nDue to the scattered character of our evidence, it remains a challenge\nto reconstruct Theophrastus’ views and to piece together his\nphilosophical preoccupations. The central question which has puzzled\nscholars is, understandably, his relation to Aristotle; that is to\nsay, the question whether he should be treated as a loyal follower of\nAristotle or as an original thinker who was prepared to diverge\nconsiderably from him. Boethius (fr. 72A FHS&G) and Simplicius\n(fr.  151B FHS&G) describe him as someone who systematized\nAristotle’s doctrines, by ordering them and filling their real\nor apparent gaps, whereas Quintillian (fr. 694 FHS&G) reports that\nTheophrastus was accustomed to dissent from Aristotle. It seems,\nhowever, that neither the portrait of Theophrastus as a disciple who\nsimply added footnotes to Aristotle’s work without making any\noriginal contribution of his own, nor the image of him as an innovator\nwho introduced radical changes in the Aristotelian system can be\nupheld. It is true that Theophrastus pointed out difficulties and\nobscurities with regard to some of Aristotle’s theories, but he\ndid not explicitly abandon them or put anything different in their\nplace; his modifications were most likely intended as suggestions\nwithin the Aristotelian framework, and his efforts seem to have been\ndirected at developing the Aristotelian system as well as at meeting\nvarious objections against it. After all, Theophrastus did not adopt\nthe same approach in all of his works and in all subjects. It is\nprobably safe to say that he always began where Aristotle left off,\nbut sometimes his treatment of particular issues did not only expand\nAristotle’s thought but also presented a challenge to it. Even\nin such cases, though, the problems raised by him should not be seen\nas a rejection of the general Aristotelian context, but as specimens\nof a philosophical inquiry that is in line with Aristotle’s\nteaching (see Sharples 1988; Gottschalk 1998; Sorabji 1998). \nThe aporetic character of many of his writings, especially on\nmetaphysics, physics and psychology, exemplify Theophrastus’\ndialectical method, which is designed to encourage further\ninvestigation rather than to drive towards an exposition of a\nfull-fledged theory. That is to say, Theophrastus\nintroduced in his treatises the various and conflicting views of\nprevious philosophers, and then subjected them to a series of\ncriticisms, but he did not offer solutions of his own, though he often\nmade it clear that he thought of some views as more plausible than\nothers. It is also important to note that Theophrastus’ aim in\nusing such a method should not be understood merely as polemical and\ncritical, or as a pure logical exercise, but as providing the\npreliminary steps of a constructive inquiry that often sets aside\ngeneral theoretical questions in order to concentrate on the detail\n(see Baltussen 2000). \nTo this purpose, Theophrastus amassed all the possible information in\nconnection with a particular subject and tried to find some\nexplanatory order within it. His empirically minded investigations\nthus departed from some of the speculative aspects of the Aristotelian\nwork, given that his attention was centered on the description and\nexplanation of actual phenomena more than on the construction of\nover-arching theories. It is striking, for instance, that he devoted\nseparate treatises to marriage and drunkenness, and that he found it\nimportant to tell us everything from demands made by audiences on\nlecturers to penalties from withdrawing from an agreed property\ndeal. Coupled with all this, there is also an emphasis on strange and\nremarkable phenomena, which he studied with an interest to find a\nsuitable explanation for them; for example, the changing in colour of\nthe chameleon and the octopus (fr. 365 FHS&G; see Sharples 2006;\nIerodiakonou 2020). But the urge to compile a complete and\nwide-ranging set of specific cases did not stop Theophrastus entirely\nfrom drawing theoretical generalizations or from issuing practical\ninstructions. In methodological matters, for instance, he advocated\nthat the possibility of causal explanation cannot be the same for all\nlevels of beings and for all subjects; for instance, in the case of\nthe inquiry about first movers, the heavenly bodies and their final\ncauses, it is more likely that reason should provide the answers,\nwhile in the case of animals, plants or inanimate things, order has to\nbe less apparent and a limit needs to be set to the explanatory\nrequirements. He also defended the principle of multiple explanations,\naccording to which no single cause is sufficient to explain a\nphenomenon that results from many factors all of which should be taken\ninto account, and he applied it much more widely than Aristotle had\ndone (see Wöhrle 1985; Daiber 1992; Gottschalk 1998). \nTheophrastus wrote more logical treatises than Aristotle, though most\nof them deal with topics similar to those of the Aristotelian\ntreatises. The fragments and later testimonies that have survived from\nhis contributions to logic are mainly to be found in the ancient\ncommentaries of Aristotle’s logical works. Theophrastus is\nreported there to have improved over some parts of the Aristotelian\nsyllogistic, but he is also supposed to have introduced a number of\ninnovations, sometimes independently sometimes working together with\nhis colleague Eudemus of Rhodes. \nTheophrastus abandoned some of Aristotle’s statements about\npropositions, and in particular his account of the quantifiers (see\nBrunschwig 1982; Mignucci 1998). He distinguished, for instance,\nbetween singular and particular propositions, maintaining that the\nformer are definite while the latter are indefinite; that is to say,\nhe considered propositions AiB and AoB to\nbe indefinite, because in cases such as “Some man is\njust” and “Not every man is just” the quantifier\npicks up at least one individual without specifying which one (frs.\n82A–E FHS&G). Moreover, Theophrastus claimed that the\nproposition “Not every B is A” has a\ndifferent meaning from the proposition “Some B is not\nA”, since the latter means that there is at least one\nB which is not A, whereas the former implies that there\nare several Bs which are not As (fr. 83 FHS&G).\nFinally, he used the expression “by transposition”\n(kata metathesin / ek metatheseōs) to indicate\naffirmative propositions whose predicates are indefinite, e.g.,\n“A man is not-just” (frs. 87A–F FHS&G), and he\nestablished the convertibility of universal negative sentences (frs.\n90A–B FHS&G). \nTheophrastus is reported to have added to the four syllogisms of the\nfirst figure another five (Baralipton, Celantes, Dabitis,\nFapesmo, and Frisesomorum), which Aristotle had just\nmentioned in the second book of his Prior Analytics (frs.\n91A–E FHS&G). In this way, he redefined the first figure, so\nthat it includes every syllogism in which the middle term is subject\nof one premise and predicate of the other. Furthermore, he put the\nsyllogisms of the second and third figure in a different order from\nthat chosen by Aristotle, listing them according to the type and\ncomplexity of the proof needed for reducing them to the syllogisms of\nthe first figure. For instance, his discussion of Ferison precedes\nthat of Bocardo, since the latter is proved by reductio ad\nabsurdum while the former by conversion of the minor premise\n(frs. 96A–B FHS&G). \nMore interestingly, Theophrastus introduced the so-called\n“prosleptic” (kata proslēpsin) syllogisms\nthat have prosleptic premises, i.e., propositions with three terms of\nwhich two are definite and the other indefinite (frs. 110A–D\nFHS&G). The following are prosleptic premises: \nIn fact, these three types of prosleptic premises are used in\nconstructing three figures of prosleptic syllogisms, which are\ncomposed of one prosleptic and one categorical premise; for instance,\nthe following is a first figure prosleptic syllogism: \nTheophrastus claimed that certain prosleptic premises were equivalent\nto categorical propositions; for instance, “A holds of\nall of that of all of which B holds” is equivalent to\n“A holds of all B”. Nevertheless, since\nthere are prosleptic premises that are not equivalent to categorical\npropositions, many prosleptic syllogisms cannot be reduced to\ncategorical syllogisms (see Lejewski 1961, 1976; Kneale and Kneale\n1972). \nThere has been a scholarly debate about whether Theophrastus\nrecognized arguments in modus ponens, modus tollens,\nmodus ponendo tollens and modus tollendo ponens: \nWhile earlier commentators doubted that Theophrastus ever considered\nanything of the sort (see Bocheński 1947), recent scholars have\nmaintained that he studied such arguments, or at least that he studied\narguments which can be regarded as their forerunners (see Barnes 1985;\nMignucci 1998; Bobzien 2002, 2004). More specifically, our sources\nreport that Theophrastus and Eudemus, being inspired by\nAristotle’s syllogisms “from a hypothesis” (ex\nhupotheseōs: Prior Analytics 1.44), discussed\n“hypothetical” (hupothetikoi) syllogisms, i.e.,\narguments at least one of whose premises is hypothetical, that is a\nproposition compounded of at least two propositions.\nTheophrastus’ hypothetical propositions mark either a\nconnectedness or a separateness, i.e., they are either conditional or\ndisjunctive propositions (with exclusive “or”), and his\nhypothetical syllogisms have the following forms (frs. 111–112\nFHS&G): \nTheophrastus also considered relative quantified propositions such as\nthose containing “more”, “less” and\n“equal”, and seems to have considered syllogisms built\nfrom such premises (fr. 111E FHS&G). But however innovative his\nadditions to Aristotle’s syllogistic may have been,\nTheophrastus’ hypothetical syllogisms cannot be said to form\npart of an elaborate and comprehensive system of propositional logic,\nand thus he cannot be credited with the invention of a logical\ncalculus similar to that of the Stoics. \nTheophrastus also developed the so-called “wholly\nhypothetical” (di’ holou hypothetikoi)\nsyllogisms, which were abbreviated categorical arguments of the\nfollowing form (frs. 113A–D FHS&G): \nIn parallel to the Aristotelian syllogistic, Theophrastus\ndistinguished three figures of wholly hypotheticals, each with sixteen\nmodes. He claimed that all second and third figure syllogisms could be\nreduced to first figure syllogisms, and he also regarded some of them\nas reducible to Aristotle’s categorical syllogisms, presumably\nby way of the equivalence to “Every A is B”\n(see Bobzien 2000). \nFinally, in modal logic, Theophrastus seems to have deviated from the\nAristotelian doctrine. In contrast to Aristotle, Theophrastus defined\npossibility as no longer entailing non-necessity (fr. 101 FHS&G).\nHe recognized that the problematic universal negative proposition\n“A possibly holds of no B” converts, just as\nthe assertoric universal negative and the necessary proposition do\n(frs. 102A–C FHS&G). Furthermore, he introduced the in\npeiorem rule for mixed modal syllogisms, according to which the\nconclusion always has the same modal character as the weaker of the\npremises, assuming that possibility is weaker than actuality, and\nactuality is weaker than necessity (frs. 106–107 FHS&G). \nTheophrastus’ short treatise Metaphysics or On\nFirst Principles is an inquiry into the foundations of natural\nscience; it studies the first principles of nature as well as their\nrelationship to the world of perceptible and changeable entities. It\nis recognized by scholars as an integral and independent work, which\nwas most probably written during Theophrastus’ stay in Assos or,\nat the latest, at the very beginning of Aristotle’s final stay\nin Athens; that is to say, in the period between 347 and 334 BCE. The\nearly date of the composition of this treatise has been argued mainly\non the basis of the following two considerations: (i) Theophrastus\nseems to have known nothing of the central and latest books of\nAristotle’s Metaphysics, and thus concentrated all his\ncomments on the older books, and especially on book Lambda. (ii) Some\nof the puzzles raised by Theophrastus in this treatise are resolved in\nAristotle’s works On the Parts of Animals and On\nthe Generation of Animals; had the Aristotelian works been\navailable to him, he would not have made these remarks (see Most 1988;\nDevereux 1988; Huby 2015). \nTo investigate the first principles of nature, Theophrastus depended\non various observations of natural phenomena as well as on existing\ntheories by earlier and contemporary thinkers, which are presented in\nthis treatise sometimes in a sketchy manner and sometimes in more\ndetail. In the case of the Academy, for instance, we find allusions to\nimportant metaphysical views introduced by Plato, but also by\nSpeusippus and Xenocrates. These references cannot be said to\nconstitute mere doxography, since they seem to have served the purposes of\na dialectical examination. Theophrastus subjected the views of other\nphilosophers to a series of objections and criticisms, while he\navoided making definitive assertions; this gives the whole treatise an\naporetic character, which has been compared both with\nAristotle’s Metaphysics B, but also with the style of\nMetaphysics A. \nThe first and main subject, occupying more than half of\nTheophrastus’ Metaphysics, is the nature and properties\nof first principles. More specifically, this treatise begins by\ndemarcating the study of first principles as distinct from the objects\nof nature to which they are to be related. Next, it\ndiscusses the nature, number, identity and causality of first\nprinciples; the motion of celestial spheres, and how these connect to\nthe sublunar world; the properties of first principles, i.e., whether\nthey are indeterminate, determinate, or both, and how to understand\ntheir property of being at rest. The first part is followed by two\nextensive appendices, investigating problems relating to the main\nsubject: (i) on epistemology, i.e., on determining the methods of\nknowing everything from first principles down to inanimate beings, and\nhence the nature of the connection between intelligibles and\nsensibles; and (ii) on teleology, i.e., on testing the alternative\nviews of the application to the universe of a certain first principle,\nnamely the principle that everything has a final cause and that nature\ndoes nothing in vain. It is particularly noteworthy that, in his\nMetaphysics, Theophrastus seems not to have been interested\nto explore some of the central themes of Aristotle’s thought,\nnamely those concerned with the being qua being, the relation\nbetween form and matter and the problem of universals (see Sharples 2015). \nThe subject of Theophrastus’ take on Aristotle’s teleology\nhas been at the centre of contemporary scholarship.\nTheophrastus’ Metaphysics refers to passages in\nAristotle’s writings that reveal him struggling to explain\ncertain phenomena in terms of his teleological principle, when it may\nhave been better for him to admit that such explanations are simply\ninappropriate. For instance, Theophrastus claimed that natural\nphenomena such as extremely dry and moist seasons, the size of the\ndeer’s horns, or the insects that only live for a day seem to\nviolate the principle that all things in nature are for the sake of\nsomething. He thus suggested that such instances should urge us to\nquestion whether teleological reasons should be put forward in all\ncases without qualification, as well as to acknowledge that there may\nbe limits to the determination of causes. This does not mean, however,\nthat Theophrastus failed to recognize the role of necessity in nature\nnor that he rejected all teleological explanations, though it is true\nthat in his surviving works there are few such examples. So, his\nattitude in this issue should rather be interpreted as showing nothing\nbut caution towards an indiscriminate application of the principle\nthat nature does nothing in vain (see Lennox 1985; Repici 1990; van\nRaalte 1993: 491–2; Gourinat 2015). \nAristotle’s teleological worldview seems to give way, in\nTheophrastus’ Metaphysics, to a conception of the\nuniverse as an organism, according to which the cosmos is a single,\ncomplete and coherent entity compared to a living creature. The key\nTheophrastean term for the relationship between intelligibles and\nsensibles is “connection” (sunaphē), which\nis to be understood as a particular kinship characteristic of entities\nthat are inseparable parts of a continuous whole, bound by some\n“partnership” (koinōnia) of a hierarchical\nbut also reciprocal nature. Hence, by claiming that the universe is a\nsingle system subject to one set of laws, Theophrastus questioned\nAristotle’s division between the sublunary and the celestial\nspheres as well as Plato’s tendencies towards dualism. Most\nimportantly, since his unified and coherent cosmos is thought of as an\nensouled and divine being, whose movement becomes the product of\nforces inherent in its different parts, Theophrastus did not think\nthere is need for any additional principle. In other words, it seems\nthat Theophrastus preferred to locate the cause of the movement of the\nheavens in the heavens themselves, rather than in their desire for\nsomething else, and he thus abandoned the Prime Unmoved Mover\npostulated by Aristotle. But although it is generally agreed that\nTheophrastus deviated in this respect from Aristotle, it has also been\nargued that Theophrastus may have been mainly interested to point out\nthe need to supplement this postulate with explanations of perceptible\nmovements, since the Unmoved Mover could never by itself determine all\nof them in full. Besides, it has also been pointed out that Aristotle\ndid not himself believe in an Unmoved Mover of the heavens throughout\nhis career, and other Aristotelians, for instance Alexander of\nAphrodisias, continued later to question whether an Unmoved Mover\nactually plays an essential part in the movement of the heavens (see\nSharples 1985a; Lefebvre 2015; Berti 2015). \nTheophrastus discussed the first principles of nature not only in his\nMetaphysics, but also in his various treatises on natural\nphilosophy; there are passages from Simplicius’ and\nPhiloponus’ commentaries on Aristotle’s Physics\n(frs. 144A–B FHS&G), which suggest that physics, according\nto Theophrastus, is just as much concerned with the first principles\nof nature as with its causes and elements. Many titles of\nTheophrastus’ works on natural philosophy are mentioned in our\nsources, e.g., Physics, Opinions of the Natural\nPhilosophers or Opinions in Natural Philosophy, On\nNature, On the Heavens, Meteorology, though it\nis difficult to determine from their few surviving fragments whether\nthey are collections of doxographical material or whether they present\nTheophrastus’ own theories (see Mansfeld 1992; Zhmud 2001, 2006:\n117–65). But even in his role as a doxographer, Theophrastus\nseems to have been careful in expounding accurately the physical\ndoctrines of his predecessors, and presumably more careful than\nAristotle, whether he agreed with them or not (see McDiarmid 1953;\nSchofield 2002). \nConcerning Theophrastus’ account of the four elements, it has\nbeen debated to what extent this conforms to the Aristotelian\ndoctrine. In particular, it is not clear whether Theophrastus followed\nAristotle in holding that the heavens are made of a fifth element, the\nether, distinct from the four sublunary elements, or whether he\nclaimed that the heavens are simply made of fire (frs. 158–168\nFHS&G). It has been argued, for instance, that Theophrastus\nabandoned the fifth element, but used it only in arguments against\nPlato without endorsing it himself (see Steinmetz 1964). There is no\ndoubt, on the other hand, that he gave prominence to the element of\nfire. In his short treatise On Fire, Theophrastus\ndistinguished heavenly fire from terrestrial fire, which is always\nmixed with other elements, and pointed out that, in contrast to the\nother three elements, terrestrial fire can be generated artificially\nand constantly requires refuelling. Most importantly, Theophrastus\npostulated that fire, or heat, is active while the other three\nelements are passive (fr. 177 FHS&G). In fact, this Theophrastean\nview has been interpreted as a serious departure from\nAristotle’s physics, according to which hot and cold are active\nwhile moist and dry are passive. Against this interpretation, however,\nit has been remarked that, since the Aristotelian biology postulates\nonly the hot as active, Theophrastus did nothing but extend\nAristotle’s view to physics in general (see Longrigg 1975).\nFurthermore, although some scholars have presented the action of the\nhot as constituting for Theophrastus the reason for the interchanges\nbetween the elements, others have counterclaimed that these should be\nunderstood as qualitative and not just due to a mechanical mixture\n(see Steinmetz 1964; Gottschalk 1967). \nBut there are occasions in which Theophrastus’ explanations of\nphysical phenomena clearly differ from Aristotle’s. He explains,\nfor instance, the composition of the winds entirely by dry exhalations\n(frs. 186–194 FHS&G); the sideways motion of the winds by\nthe rotation of the heavens (fr. 186 FHS&G); the saltiness of the\nsea by dry exhalation from the land being carried down again in the\nrain (fr. 220 FHS&G); the rainfall and condensation by direct\nphysical pressure rather than by the effect of cooling (fr. 211\nFHS&G). \nFinally, although it seems that Theophrastus’ account of time as\nan accidental attribute of motion is a fairly minor amendment of the\nAristotelian thesis that time is the number of motion (frs.\n151A–C FHS&G), his analysis of place is more interesting.\nSimplicius reports in his commentary on Aristotle’s\nPhysics that Theophrastus indicated a number of difficulties\nresulting from the Aristotelian definition of place as the inner\nboundary of the surrounding body (fr. 146 FHS&G), and thus\nquestioned whether place may be not something that exists in its own\nright, but rather the arrangement and position of a thing as part of\nan ordered whole (fr. 149 FHS&G). Simplicius, moreover, refers to\na passage from Theophrastus’ Physics which he takes to\nbear witness to the relational theory of place that Simplicius himself\nadopts, following his teacher Damascius. In fact, this has been the\ntraditional interpretation of Theophrastus’ account of place,\nnamely that he developed a relational theory of place as a full-blown\nalternative to Aristotle’s defective theory of an absolute\nconcept of place.\n\nNevertheless, a qualified version of the traditional view has been put\nforward as more plausible, according to which Theophrastus’\naccount should not be read as a fully developed conception of place,\nbut as an objection specifically directed against Aristotle’s\nnotion of natural place; that is to say, Theophrastus only attempted\nto provide a new account of natural place within a wider world order,\nrather than of place, in general, as an abstract and quasi-geometrical\nconcept (see Sorabji 1988). Against this interpretation, it has been\nargued that Theophrastus did not have as his target Aristotle’s\nnotion of natural place; in fact, Theophrastus never developed a\ndetailed and coherent alternative theory of place, and the phrasing of\nhis account points most probably to a dialectical context (see Algra\n1992). Lastly, it has also been suggested recently that Theophrastus\ndid not think that his objections to the Aristotelian theory of place\nwere insoluble, and the text cited by Simplicius as bearing witness to\nDamascius’ view is not inconsistent with Aristotle’s\naccount of place; hence, Theophrastus did not offer a new or competing\ntheory of place, but rather shared Aristotle’s view of what\nplace is (see Morison 2010). \nTheophrastus is reported to have written a treatise with the title\nOn the Soul, which was a commentary on Aristotle’s\nOn the Soul and comprised at least two books. Nearly all we\nknow about this Theophrastean work comes from Themistius’\nparaphrase of Aristotle’s On the Soul, which was used\nheavily in Arabic philosophical writings, as well as from Priscian of\nLydia’s paraphrase of Theophrastus’ work. In this\ntreatise, just like in his Metaphysics, Theophrastus pointed\nout difficulties in Aristotle’s text, suggested conceptual\ndistinctions and clarified the implications of obscure Aristotelian\ndoctrines like, for instance, the definition of perception as\nassimilation of the sensible form of an object without its matter (see\nLaks 2002, 2019; Caston 2019). It is debatable, however, whether\nTheophrastus also offered clear and unambiguous solutions to the\nproblems he raised. \nIn particular, it has been proposed that his questions and remarks\nconcerning Aristotle’s theory of the intellect do not pose\nserious challenges (frs. 307–327 FHS&G). Theophrastus\naccepted the basic Aristotelian assumptions and simply tried to\nelucidate the opaque statements in Aristotle’s On the\nSoul 2.5–3.5. For instance, he raised the issue of how the\nintellect differs from matter; how the descriptions of the intellect\nas passive and as productive can both be true of one and the same\nentity; whether the passive intellect is actualized by the\nintelligibles or by the productive intellect; what the relation is\nbetween the intellect and the intelligibles; why is it that the\nintellect sometimes thinks and sometimes does not. Every question\nraised in this treatise receives an answer, or at least a suggestion\nof an answer. For instance, Theophrastus replied that while matter\nreceives individual forms, intellect receives universal forms. As to\nhis suggestion concerning the relation between the passive and the\nproductive intellect, different interpretations have been offered; it\nhas been argued that Theophrastus treated them both as immanent parts\nof the soul, but it has also been argued that he thought of the\nproductive intellect as a transcendent separate entity. Also, he seems\nto have claimed that the productive intellect is the principle of\nthought, not by operating directly on the passive intellect but by\nactualizing the intelligibles, and thus by enabling them to affect the\npassive intellect; in this way, the productive intellect is\nresponsible for thought just like light, which actualizes colours and\nrenders them perceptible, is responsible for vision. All such\nTheophrastean suggestions, however, were most probably not intended as\ndiversions from nor as developments of Aristotle’s views, but\nrather as reformulations and clarifications of the Aristotelian\ndoctrine (see Barbotin 1954; Devereux 1992; Magrin 2011). \nIn addition, we are fortunate to have some information about\nTheophrastus’ theory of knowledge, mainly thanks to a passage in\nSextus Empiricus’ Against the Logicians, in which\nSextus presents the different views of preceding philosophers on the\ncriterion of truth (fr. 301A FHS&G). There are many ambiguous\nstatements in this passage, but it clearly ascribes to Theophrastus\nthe view that sensation (aisthēsis) and thought\n(noēsis) are the sources of knowledge, while\nself-evidence (to enarges) is the basic criterion for both.\nSo, Theophrastus is said to have claimed that our senses are moved by\nthe sense object and, when the sensation is self-evident, a reliable\nmemory of the sensation and an appearance or an imagination\n(phantasia) of the sense object follow; for instance, the\nmemory and the phantasia of Socrates existing in the minds of\nthose who knew him directly. A third movement is added, namely\nrational phantasia, which results from our judgement and\nchoice, and which involves the production of a model by the\naggregation of individuals in the universal, for instance the rational\nphantasia of man; hence, rational phantasia\nconstitutes, with regard to being potential, understanding\n(dianoia) and, with regard to being actual, intellect\n(nous). Finally, from understanding and intellect concepts\narise, and thus knowledge (epistēmē) and skill\n(technē). Sextus’ passage has been used as\nevidence for the interpretation, according to which Theophrastus\nmanaged to sort out an ambiguity in Aristotle’s use of the term\nphantasia, by distinguishing the rational phantasia,\nwhich is tied up with speech and reason, from the formation of the\nphantasia, which is nothing but a by-phenomenon of sensation\n(see Huby 1989). \nThe other Theophrastean treatise in psychology has the title On\nthe Senses or On Sensations (peri\naisthēseōn). This work survived for the most part\nintact and was edited by Hermann Diels, in his Doxographi\nGraeci (1879), as part of Theophrastus’ Opinions of the\nNatural Philosophers or Opinions in Natural Philosophy;\nit was, therefore, treated as a mere source for the physical doctrines\nof previous philosophers and considered as the origin of the rest of\nthe doxographic tradition. It is rather recently that scholars have\neventually recognized it as an independent work, whose study would\nprobably benefit from a new critical edition (see McDiarmid 1962;\nBaltussen 2019; Mansfeld 2019). More specifically, On the\nSenses or On Sensations deals with the theories of sense\nperception put forward by Parmenides, Empedocles, Alcmaeon,\nAnaxagoras, Cleidemus, Diogenes of Apollonia, Plato and Democritus. It\npresents and criticizes the views of these philosophers about the\nsenses and their objects, among which vision and colour occupy a\ncentral place; it also discusses pain and pleasure, as well as the\nphysiology of thought. Theophrastus applied throughout this work the\nmethod of division: The first and main division, already found in\nAristotle, is between those who believe sense perception to be by\nsimilarity, i.e., in accordance with the principle “like by\nlike”, and those who assume it is through contrast. But another\ndivision that is not Aristotelian also plays a part, namely between\nthose who believe that sense perception differs from thought, and\nthose who do not. The last philosopher whom this treatise discusses is\nDemocritus and not Plato, because Democritus argued, in\nTheophrastus’ view, both that sense perception is by like and\nthat it is by unlike, and so failed to fit the main division (see\nMansfeld 1996; Johansen 2019). \nTheophrastus’ reconstruction of previous theories has been at\nthe centre of the scholarly discussion on this work. Detailed studies\nconcerning the way he summarized preceding opinions have been written,\nand it has been interestingly suggested that he often proves to have\nbeen more reliable and careful than Aristotle in expounding accurately\nwhat each one of his predecessors advocated (see McDiarmid 1959a,\n1959b, 1960; Sedley 1985, 1992; Sharples 1985b; Laks 1990; Long 1996;\nBredlow 2011; van Raalte 2015; Ierodiakonou 2019b; Rudolph 2019). In\naddition, more attention has lately been given to Theophrastus’\nown analysis of earlier arguments as well as to his critical\nevaluations, so that this treatise is no longer thought of as a mere\nreport of past doctrines but rather as a document of Peripatetic\ndialectic (see Baltussen 2000). \nTheophrastus’ extensive monographs on botany fortunately\nsurvive, but we have very few of his works in human\nphysiology—namely, On Sweat, On Fatigue, On\nDizziness—and only summaries and reports of his works in\nzoology, apart from one that is preserved in manuscripts, the short\ntreatise On Fish. \nConcerning the human body and its functions (frs. 328–349\nFHS&G), Theophrastus seems to have followed Aristotle in\npostulating four basic qualities (hot, cold, dry, wet), and in\nascribing to the heart a central role. He also emphasized the function\nof breath or spirit (pneuma), which is meant to keep the body\nand the soul of human beings together, linking psychic functions with\nphysical motions (fr. 346 FHS&G). In fact, it has been argued that\nin this case, too, Theophrastus diverged from Aristotle, since\nAristotle thought that pneuma was concentrated in the area of\nthe heart while Theophrastus claimed that it extends throughout the\nbody; however, Aristotle’s position on this issue is\ncontroversial (see Longrigg 1993: 173–6). \nThe titles of Theophrastus’ zoological treatises, as well as our\ntestimonies with regard to his research in this area, suggest that he\ndid not pursue Aristotle’s interest in the anatomical structure\nof living creatures, but tried to supplement the Aristotelian approach\nwith observations on animal behaviour and its causes. The variations\nin animals resulting from different local environments, the generation\nof swarming creatures and the nuisance caused by them, the\npsychological qualities shared by animals with humans, and hibernation\nand reproduction, are some of the themes in Theophrastus’\nzoological works that our secondary sources discuss (frs.\n350–383 FHS&G). Some of these Theophrastus introduced as\nstrange and paradoxical, for some he offered multiple explanations, in\nsome cases he simply repeated the Aristotelian view, in others it is\ndisputable whether or not his account differed considerably from\nAristotle’s. For instance, in the case of spontaneous\nreproduction (frs. 376–383 FHS&G), some scholars have\nclaimed that Theophrastus shared Aristotle’s views, while others\nhave insisted that he is certainly more sceptical than Aristotle. It\nhas also been suggested that Theophrastus agreed with the Aristotelian\ndoctrine in the Metaphysics (Ζ 7 1032a30), according to\nwhich the same plants and animals can come either from seed or\nspontaneously, but not with Aristotle’s view in his biology that\nthere is a sharp distinction between the plants and animals that are\ngenerated from inanimate matter and those that never are (e.g., On\nthe Generation of Animals 1.1 715b8–15); in fact, this\nsuggestion has been presented as evidence in favour of the thesis that\nsome of Theophrastus’ zoological works may have been written\nbefore Aristotle’s biological treatises (see Balme 1962). \nInterestingly enough, Theophrastus’ comments on animal behaviour\nhave often raised the question of how far he considered it to be\nanalogous to human behaviour. By showing, in particular, an interest\nin intelligent animal behaviour, he seems to have somewhat effaced the\nline between humans and other animals. According to Porphyry’s\ntreatise On Abstinence From Eating Meat, Theophrastus\nstressed a natural relationship (oikeiotēs) among all\nhuman beings, but also between human beings and other animals. This\nrelationship, however, is not to be confused with Stoic\noikeiōsis; for the latter starts as an innate and\nself-regarding impulse of newly born creatures that is modified over\ntime, so that an individual comes to realize the priority of virtue\nover soundness of body, whereas Theophrastus’ notion designates\na kinship based on common bodily and psychical characteristics (see\nBrink 1956; Long 1998). So, in the case of the relationship between\nhumans and other animals, Theophrastus claimed that humans are akin to\nanimals because they are made of the same skin, flesh and fluids, and\nmost importantly because their souls are no different in desires,\nangry impulses, reasonings and above all sensations (fr. 531\nFHS&G). But if the mention here of reasonings or calculations\n(logismoi) is pressed, then Theophrastus can be understood as\nseriously deviating from Aristotle, who stated in his treatise On\nthe soul (3.10 433a12) that animals did not have the ability of\nreasoning. Also, at the beginning of his treatise Enquiry into\nPlants, Theophrastus stated that animals differ from plants\nbecause they act (prattein). But assuming that Theophrastus\nshared Aristotle’s requisite for action (praxis),\nnamely that in acting one exercises one’s reason, his ascription\nof actions to animals implies that they have a reasoning faculty of at\nleast some sort, though it is not entirely clear how he supported this\nclaim. \nThis relationship between animals and humans stands behind\nTheophrastus’ aversion to animal sacrifice as an unjust act\nincompatible with holiness (fr. 584A FHS&G). In his treatise\nOn Piety (see Pötscher 1964), Theophrastus argued that\nthere are three reasons humans offer sacrifices to gods: to show\nhonour, or gratitude, or to get a favour. But humans cannot show\nhonour, or gratitude, or expect a favour, by doing harm and by\ncommitting an injustice. And since sacrificing an animal does cause\nharm, for it robs the animal of its soul, it should be considered as\nunjust. In fact, the idea that animals can be treated unjustly is\nrather important, since it suggests that in this respect, too,\nTheophrastus departed from Aristotle, who had claimed in his ethical\nwritings that animals are not moral agents, and cannot be recipients\nof injustice. It is worth pointing out, however, that\nTheophrastus’ different approach to animal intelligence and\ncharacter has been interpreted more as a matter of different emphasis\nthan as a deliberate divergence. That is to say, it has been argued\nthat while Aristotle had underlined dissimilarities between humans and\nother animals, Theophrastus stressed deep underlying similarities, so\nthat the chasm that Aristotle had recognized between humans and other\nanimals became for Theophrastus less important than the chasm between\nanimals and plants (see Browning Cole 1992). \nTheophrastus’ two main botanical treatises, Enquiry into\nPlants and Plant Explanations, have stood the test of\ntime better than Aristotle’s zoological works. Especially, the\nEnquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) is\nconsidered as one of the most important books of natural history in\nantiquity, along with Pliny the Elder’s Natural History\nand Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica. It was written some\ntime between c. 350 and c. 287 BCE in ten volumes, of which nine\nsurvive. Theophrastus seems to have continually revised the\nmanuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death.\nJudging from its condensed style and the many lists of examples,\nTheophrastus may have used it as notes for teaching purposes, rather\nthan intending it to be read as a book. He investigated in it over 550\nspecies of plants and showed great interest in their structure, growth\nand reproduction, their varieties around the world, the wood of\ndifferent trees and the effects of climate on it, the wild and\ncultivated plants, the classification and uses of herbs, cereals and\nlegumes; finally, in book 9 he presented the medicinal uses of plants,\ndescribed the juices, gums and resins extracted from them, and\nexplained how to gather them from different regions (see Desautels\n1988). \nThe purpose of Theophrastus’ botanical treatises seems the same\nas that of Aristotle’s zoological writings; first, in the\nEnquiry into Plants, he aimed at identifying the plants and\nat gathering all the available information about them, then, in the\nPlant Explanations, he proceeded to account for their common\nor distinctive characteristics. So, Theophrastus methodically laid out\nall the differences among plants, by distinguishing major categories\nand by drawing successive subdivisions within each of these\ncategories; this involved the close study of the parts of plants,\ntheir morphology and reproduction, as well as relevant factors of\nhabitat and cultivation. On the basis of such research, he\nsubsequently undertook to discover their causes, and thus to acquire\nbetter understanding (see Wöhrle 1985, 2019: 31–56). It is\nno exaggeration to say that the history of botany owes to Theophrastus\nthe first systematic classification and explanation of plants and\ntheir uses. \nFrom the titles of Theophrastus’ ethical works as well as from\nthe surviving second-hand reports, it becomes clear that his interests\nin ethics covered a wide range of topics, some similar to\nAristotle’s, e.g., virtue, happiness, emotions, pleasure,\nfriendship, but also others of a more particular concern, e.g.,\nmarriage, old age, wealth, retribution (frs. 436–437\nFHS&G). \nTheophrastus adopted Aristotle’s analysis of virtue as a mean\ndisposition in regard to emotional response and action; that is, for\neach individual virtue there are two co-ordinate vices, one of excess\nand the other of deficiency (fr. 449A FHS&G). To illustrate virtue\nas the mean disposition relative to us, Theophrastus referred to the\ngarrulous person who says too much, his opposite who says too little,\nand the virtuous person who lays hold upon due measure (see also,\nCharacters 3 and 7). He also gave similar accounts for\ntemperance, courage and the other moral virtues. In the case of\ntemperance, for instance, he claimed that the insensitive person fails\nto desire what is in accordance with nature, the intemperate person is\nmarked by excessive desire, whereas the temperate person enjoys\npleasures to the extent he ought and in accordance with nature. It is\nworth noting that in his account of justice, in particular, he seems\nto have followed more closely Aristotle’s Eudemian\nEthics rather than the better-known Nicomachean Ethics\n(see Fortenbaugh 1983); justice is treated as a standard mean\ndisposition co-ordinate with an excess and a deficiency, since neither\nthe man who distributes the larger quantity to himself nor the man who\ndistributes the lesser is considered as just, but the man who\ndistributes the equal portion. Furthermore, in line with the\nAristotelian conception of virtue as the mean which is determined by\nreason and such as the practically wise man would determine it,\nTheophrastus emphasized that a person must learn to reason correctly\nor, in other words, to acquire practical wisdom which is, in his view,\ninseparable from moral virtue (fr. 460 FHS&G); for instance, those\nwho have been insulted may be quite justified in feeling angry and\nseeking revenge, but without practical wisdom they may choose the\nwrong course of action and fail to achieve their goal (frs. 526,\n527A–B FHS&G). \nApart from the fragments of his ethical treatises, in which\nTheophrastus presented with few modifications the Aristotelian account\nof virtue, we also have his extremely influential book\nCharacters, in which he went beyond his Aristotelian\ninheritance and focused on vicious human behaviour. More precisely,\nTheophrastus’ Characters is a collection of thirty\nbrief, often humorous descriptions or sketches, or even caricatures,\nof unattractive moral behaviour; for instance, loquacity,\ninsensitivity, flattery, shamelessness, obnoxiousness, superstition.\nEach sketch is preceded by a definition of the personality type, and\nthe entire collection is preceded by a spurious prologue which\nindicates that the Characters came to be used for moral\ninstruction. \nIndeed, many interpretations have been put forward with regard to the\ncomposition and purpose of this book. It has been regarded by some\nscholars as an independent work, while others have argued that it is a\ncollection of extracts from one or more writings of Theophrastus that\nwere brought together and edited after his death; but the coherence\nand stylistic unity of the collection suggest that its parts cannot\nhave been derived from unconnected works (see Diggle 2004:\n4–26). Theophrastus’ main interest, here, seems to have been limited to\nmerely portraying superficial behavioural patterns, without any\nconsideration of the various desires and beliefs that may underlie\nthese character traits; for Theophrastus, in contrast to Aristotle,\nhardly gave any explanation of why people behave in these ways or what\nmotivates them (see Fortenbaugh 2003b). It is not surprising that his\nsketches of immoral and corrupt characters have often been linked with\nthe stage characters of his pupil and comic writer Menander, such as\nSicon, the garrulous cook in the Dyscolus, or Polemon, the\nvehement person in the Perikeiromene (see Fortenbaugh 2003d).\nMoreover, the Characters have also been closely connected to\nrhetorical instruction as well as to actual rhetorical practice, since\nit is plausible to believe that this book would have been of use to\nthe student of rhetoric as well as to the rhetorician who wished to\nstudy and narrate emotional behaviour; it is indicative, after all,\nthat it was preserved in rhetorical manuscripts (see Fortenbaugh\n2003c). But whatever one thinks about the purpose of the\nCharacters, there is no doubt that Theophrastus’ book\nconstitutes a valuable testimony to the culture and society of his\ncontemporary Athens, by vividly depicting the complex etiquette\nconsidered appropriate for Athenian citizens in their homes, streets\nand other public places of their city (see Millett 2007). \nTheophrastus stressed the importance of education and development of\ngood habits in producing moral characters; education, he claimed,\ntames the human soul (fr. 465 FHS&G). In particular, early\neducation trains us in the appropriate emotional response, but also\nhelps us acquire moral principles that are both action-guiding and\ngood in themselves; for instance, in acquiring courage one learns not\nonly to confront danger steadfastly, but also to do so because\nsteadfastness in the face of danger is noble. In addition,\nTheophrastus claimed that education helps us acquire practical reason,\nso that we carefully investigate how we should live and act\naccordingly. \nBut virtue can be lost, according to Theophrastus, and adverse\nexternal circumstances may influence a person’s moral character\n(frs. 462–463 FHS&G). Indeed, he is reported to have said\nthat it is very difficult to decide on, to choose, and especially to\nremain steadfast to the best life (fr. 476 FHS&G). Besides, if we\nare to accept Cicero’s testimony, Theophrastus did not think\nthat virtue is sufficient for happiness, since happiness partly\ndepends on factors over which an individual has no control and they\ncan make a person’s life miserable, such as tortures,\nbanishments, bereavements (frs. 495–499 FHS&G). In fact, he\nwas criticized for endorsing, in his book Callisthenes or\nOn Grief, the maxim “Fortune rules life, not\nwisdom”. (fr. 493 FHS&G). But even if Theophrastus stressed\nmore than Aristotle the power of chance to ruin a human life, he still\nassigned special importance to the life of contemplation, which he\nthought of as similar to the life of the gods. In fact, Cicero reports\nthat Theophrastus was involved in a great controversy with another\nPeripatetic philosopher, namely Dicaearchus, who ranked more highly\nthe practical life than that of leisured study, but it may well be the\ncase that this debate is nothing but Cicero’s own creation (frs.\n481–482 FHS&G; see Fortenbaugh 2013). \nRegarding his treatment of emotions, Theophrastus agreed with\nAristotle that emotions are complex phenomena involving bodily\nchanges, which manifest themselves as painful or pleasant sensations,\nthought or belief, desire, and in many cases goal-directed behaviour.\nTo take, for instance, the case of anger that features predominantly\nin our sources, it is said to involve the thought that insult has\noccurred, which causes the boiling of blood and warmth around the\nheart, but it also involves changes in countenance and voice, as well\nas the desire for revenge (frs. 271, 441, 446–447, 526, 542\nFHS&G). On the other hand, Theophrastus seems to have diverged\nfrom Aristotle, when he discussed closely related emotions in terms of\nthe more and the less. Using again the example of anger, Theophrastus\npostulated that while anger is characterized by bodily changes and\npainful sensations, the thought that some injustice has occurred, and\nthe wish for retribution, rage involves these same features to a\ngreater degree and faultfinding to a lesser degree (fr. 438\nFHS&G). However, due to the meagre evidence available, it is not\nclear whether Theophrastus thought of difference in degree as merely\ncompatible with difference in kind, or actually determinant of\ndifference in kind (see Fortenbaugh 1985a). \nThe interest in politics Theophrastus acquired, most likely, from\nAristotle. It has even been claimed that, in some cases, it was\nAristotle who suggested to Theophrastus the topics of his books on\npolitics and prepared with him the relevant material before his death;\nbut the evidence on this point is not conclusive (see Podlecki 1985).\nOn the other hand, the titles of Theophrastus’ political\ntreatises indicate that in some of them he dealt with topics similar\nto Aristotle’s—e.g., Politics,\nLaws—while in others he introduced new ones—e.g.,\nPolitical Customs, On Kingship, On the Education\nof a King. Not much has survived from these writings, but from\nthe little we know it seems that in politics, too, Theophrastus used\nthe same research methods as in the other disciplines, namely taking\ninto consideration the particular circumstances as well as\nconscientiously collecting and recording all relevant information (see\nWöhrle 2019: 93–6). \nTo take his treatise Laws, for instance, Theophrastus treated\nin its twenty-four books all the branches of legislation by comparing,\ndiscussing and criticizing the laws of all Greek states in connection\nwith each and every legal institution (fr. 590 FHS&G). There is\ninteresting material, here, on legal procedures like those of\nimpeachment, retrial and ostracism, but also regulations concerning\nproperty and commerce. In fact, this treatise seems to have been\nintended as a practical guide or an encyclopedia for legislators,\nwhich could be consulted to insure that a prospective law was the best\none available. Furthermore, Theophrastus recognized that legislators\ncan never fully control the course of future events; they legislate in\nresponse to a limited set of circumstances and are likely to overlook\nconditions which may arise in the future and justify exceptions to the\nlaw. So, he talked of the “right moment” (kairos)\nand of politicians who in special circumstances permitted injustice\nfor the benefit of their city-state (frs. 614–615, 617,\n628–630 FHS&G). It has been argued, however, that\nTheophrastus’ treatment of political issues is not always\nsystematic; sometimes it lacks a rigorous point-by-point development\nand is characterized by a rather speculative examination of the\ntheories behind the laws (see Szegedy-Maszak 1981). \nThe titles of Theophrastus’ works on rhetoric as well as their\nfew surviving fragments suggest that they were probably written to\nserve different purposes: The treatise On the Art of\nRhetoric, for instance, seems to have been rather theoretical in\nscope, Rhetorical Precepts may have been a practical guide to\ncomposing speeches, Introductions could have contained a\ncollection of sample prooemia for imitation, On Judicial\nSpeeches is likely to have been a discussion of courtroom\nspeeches. There is plenty of evidence that in this area, too,\nTheophrastus’ writings were influential: they are often\nmentioned by later writers. For instance, Cicero and Quintilian take\nnotice of his contributions to rhetoric (frs. 667–670\nFHS&G), his diction is cited occasionally by lexicographers (frs.\n449B, 464, 494A–B FHS&G), he is repeatedly referred to as\nsomeone who wrote in an attractive manner (frs. 5B, 50–54, 497,\n669 FHS&G), and later rhetoricians made use of his\nCharacters for instruction in the schools (see Fortenbaugh\n2003c). It proves difficult, however, to determine Theophrastus’\nown input to rhetoric, especially when compared to those of Aristotle\nand the other Peripatetics, since he seems to have been building\nextensively on their work. \nTheophrastus closely followed Aristotle in distinguishing between\ndeliberative, judicial and epideictic rhetoric, as well as in dividing\na speech into parts (fr. 671 FHS&G). He also distinguished between\naudience-oriented speech and fact-oriented speech; the former is\nillustrated by poetry and rhetoric, which are characterized by their\nornamented style, while the latter is illustrated by philosophy, which\nis concerned with truth and methods of argument (fr. 78 FHS&G).\nAlthough the originality of this classification and his acceptance of\nthe legitimacy of affective prose may be limited to a simple\nmodification of Aristotle’s views, Theophrastus thus managed to\neliminate the last traces of Plato’s hostility to rhetoric. In\nhis treatise On Style, on the other hand, he seems to have\ntried to improve over the Aristotelian tripartite division of good\nstyle into clarity, appropriateness and ornamentation\n(Rhetoric 3.2–12), by adding a fourth virtue of speech,\nnamely that of speaking correct Greek (hellenismos), which he\nplaces before the others; it is likely that his interest in it\nreflects the development at the time of grammar as an independent\nsubject. So, it is the combination of precisely these four qualities\nthat is meant, according to Theophrastus, to achieve in style the\ndesired mean, which he also advocated in diction, rhythm and sentence\nstructure (see Innes 1985). \nConcerning rhetorical delivery, Theophrastus gave the subject\nrecognition and paid more attention to the actual performance than\nAristotle had done before him. It is true, of course, that Aristotle\ntouched on delivery both in his Rhetoric and in his\nPoetics, but his remarks were quite brief and largely\nsubordinate to accounts of style. In contrast, Theophrastus composed a\nspecial treatise On Delivery, which is unfortunately lost;\nthere are at least a few texts among our sources that provide us with\ninformation about Theophrastus’ views on delivery, but none of\nthese texts actually refers by title to the treatise On\nDelivery. Still, it is safe to say that in his rhetoric\nTheophrastus attributed primary importance to the pitch of voice as\nwell as to bodily movement (fr. 712 FHS&G). He also emphasized the\neffects of facial expression and, in particular, those resulting from\na fixed gaze or a blank stare (fr. 713 FHS&G). It is worth adding\nthat, by giving importance and independent treatment to the subject of\ndelivery, Theophrastus succeeded in influencing the subsequent\ndevelopment of rhetoric, for delivery came to be recognized as its\nfourth part coordinate with style, invention and arrangement (see\nFortenbaugh 1985b). \nLike Aristotle, Theophrastus discussed prose rhythm, too. He drew a\nsharp distinction between verse and rhythm, arguing that verse has no\nplace in prose and suggesting that a colon or a period can be\nrhythmical without having too precise a rhythm. More specifically, he\nshowed a preference for periods in which the final colon is longer\nthan the preceding one (fr. 701 FHS&G), and betrayed a fondness\nfor the paeon, which he considered as most flexible and at the same\ntime most magnificent (frs. 702–704 FHS&G). \nTheophrastus seems to have been well known in antiquity as a writer on\nmusic (frs. 715–721B FHS&G), and there are Arabic sources\nthat refer to a tradition of musical theory that was believed to be\ntraceable to him (frs. 722–725 FHS&G). But although his work\non the subject was apparently respected, we know rather little of its\ncontent. Theophrastus’ writings on music—namely, On\nMusic, On the Musicians and Harmonics—are\nlost, and it is only thanks to Porphyry that a single verbatim\nquotation from his treatise On Music is preserved (fr. 716\nFHS&G), in which we find some of Theophrastus’ views (see\nBarker 1985; Sicking 1998). \nTheophrastus advocated that all previous musical theories, which tried\nto provide a basis for the analysis of differences of pitch in\nquantitative terms, were to be rejected. That is to say, he argued\nagainst the Pythagoreans, Plato and Aristotle, because they all had\ndefended the view that, since pitches differ in a quantitative manner\nand a melody is a series of different pitches, music itself consists\nin quantities and relations between quantities. Theophrastus claimed\ninstead that differences in pitch are essentially qualitative, but it\nproves very difficult to reconstruct in detail the doctrine about\npitch that he himself suggested in place of the quantitative account.\nHowever, the important question about music, for Theophrastus, seems\nto be the extent to which it is possible to identify in audible pitch\nsequences qualities that are the same as or analogous to qualities of\npsychic states. Plato and Aristotle believed that music has an\nimportant role to play in the process of educating the human soul to\nvirtue, for music is not only pleasant but also expressive of\ncharacter. Theophrastus, on the other hand, limited the role of music\nto a significant degree; in his view, only in the case of children\ndoes music contribute to virtue, while with others it may even\ncontribute to vice (fr. 720 FHS&G). On the other hand, it seems\nthat Theophrastus assigned to music a cathartic effect; according to\nhim, music cures many of the ills that affect the soul and the body,\nsuch as fainting, fright and prolonged disturbances of mind (fr. 726\nFHS&G). \nThe impact of Theophrastus’ various writings cannot be\nexaggerated; his treatises were read and respected by subsequent\ngenerations of philosophers and others, whose works contain sometimes\nclear and sometimes latent signs of his influence. To start with the\nHellenistic period, Epicurus took careful note of Theophrastus’\nwritings and seems to have made use both of his reports concerning the\ntheories and arguments of previous philosophers as well as of his\nobjections against them. In physics, in particular, it has been shown\nthat Epicurus owes a direct and positive debt to Theophrastus’\nexclusion of divine causes as well as to his principle of multiple\nexplanation. It is noteworthy, however, that Theophrastus’\nacceptance of multiple explanations differs from that of Epicurus;\nTheophrastus seems to have correlated different explanations with\ndifferent forms of a phenomenon in our experience, whereas Epicurus\nclaimed that any possible explanation will be true somewhere in the\ninfinite Atomist universe (see Sedley 1998). \nRegarding, on the other hand, Theophrastus’ influence on\nStoicism, at least in its earliest years, it has been argued that it\nwas probably minimal in all three parts of Stoic philosophy: Stoic\nethics presented happiness as entirely independent of external\ncircumstances or chance events, while the Stoics’ account of\nphysical phenomena was mainly influenced by Heraclitus and\nPlato’s Timaeus. In logic, finally, it may be true that\nTheophrastus elaborated a logic of propositions, but there is no doubt\nthat he considered the categorical syllogism as primary, and never\ncame close to developing Chrysippus’ sophisticated hypothetical\nsyllogistic. Therefore, it is not the case that the early Stoics put\nforward positions that they could scarcely have adopted without the\nhelp of Theophrastus’ doctrines or methods, even if it proves\nthat he left a stronger imprint on Chrysippus than on\nChrysippus’ Stoic predecessors (see Barnes 1985; Long 1998). \nCicero often refers to Theophrastus together with Aristotle in matters\nof ethics, politics and rhetoric. Although he gives Theophrastus a\nsubordinate role, he regards the encyclopedic research carried out by\nhim as a guide containing useful directives to politicians and\nrhetoricians, but also as a helpful example in his attempt to present\nGreek philosophy to the Roman society (see Gigon 1988; Runia 1989;\nFortenbaugh 2005). The encyclopedic character of Theophrastus’\nwritings, and in particular of his treatise Opinions of the\nNatural Philosophers or Opinions in Natural Philosophy,\nhas also been assumed to be the source for much of the material on the\nPresocratics in later doxographic accounts. In his seminal work\nDoxographi Graeci (1879), Hermann Diels argued that\ndoxography proper began with the Theophrastean writings; according to\nhim, the fragmentary information on the Presocratics found in his\nreconstructed Aëtius’ Placita\n(1st/early 2nd cent.), though debased and\nmodified in the course of transmission, is linked to\nTheophrastus’ treatises in a direct and vertical line of\ndescent. He further argued that also a number of doxographical\npassages in Hippolytus’ Refutatio Omnium Haeresium\n(early 3rd cent.), in Diogenes Laertius’\nLives (early 3rd cent.), in the\nStromateis preserved by Eusebius (early 4th cent.)\nand in a few other works of minor importance, in some way or other for\nthe most part go back to Theophrastus himself. By and large Hermann\nDiels’ argument as pertaining to Aëtius, though in need of\nrevision, has been judged as correct; but the relation of the\ndoxographical sections in the person-oriented overviews of the later\nauthors to the topic-oriented work of Theophrastus seems to be more\ncomplicated than he believed. Moreover, Diels has also been criticized\nfor having failed to take into account the possibility that already\nbefore Aëtius more than a single tradition existed, or mutually\ndiverging witnesses belonging to the same tradition may have been\navailable (see Mansfeld 1992, 1998). \nIn the Arabic sources we find many references to Theophrastus’\nlife, works and sayings, but only the translations of two genuine\nTheophrastean texts have been preserved; namely, the\nMetaphysics or On First Principles and the\nMeteorology. It is not surprising, however, that\nTheophrastus’ works were neither extensively copied nor much\nquoted in the Arabic philosophical literature. One of the reasons\nsuggested is the fact that from 900 to 1050 the promotion of Aristotle\nby the school of Baghdad as the most important philosopher eclipsed\nother Peripatetics, whose works were not seen to be commentaries on\nthe Aristotelian treatises. In addition, Theophrastus’ treatises\nwith their aporetic nature and identical titles with those of\nAristotle were hardly appropriate for constructing a dogmatic\nAristotelian system, which the Baghdad Peripatetics were seeking.\nFinally, after 1050 the crushing influence of Avicenna caused the\ndisappearance of manuscript copies even of Aristotle’s works,\nlet alone of Theophrastus (see Gutas 1985, 1999; Daiber 1985). \nByzantine scholars, on the other hand, appreciated and cited\nTheophrastus’ works, and it is thanks to their efforts that some\nof his works survived. The Patriarch Photius (9th cent.),\nfor instance, refers both in his Lexicon and in his\nLibrary to a number of Theophrastus’ treatises.\nByzantine rhetoricians incorporated the Characters within a\ncollection of rhetorical writings of Hermogenes and Aphthonius, whose\ndiscussions of ēthos they were taken to illustrate, and\nthus contributed to the survival of this book (see Diggle 2004: 13;\n38). In the twelfth century the polymath John Tzetzes and the\narchbishop of Thessaloniki Eustathius drew material from\nthe Characters and imitated its style, while Michael of\nEphesus used Theophrastus’ ethical and biological writings when\ncompiling his comments on Aristotle’s treatises. Finally, there\nis clear evidence that in the fifteenth century Cardinal Bessarion was\nwell familiar with Theophrastus’ views and his testimony may be\nused as a reliable source (see Lautner 1995). \nDuring the Western Middle Ages, direct knowledge of\nTheophrastus’ writings was very limited, and it was not until\nthe fifteenth century that some of his more important works were\nrecovered and translated into Latin, even though not all of them also\nappeared in print (see Schmitt 1971). Two Theophrastean treatises were\ntranslated by Bartolommeo da Messina for King Manfred of Sicily during\nthe years 1278–1266, namely De principiis and De\nsignis; at first they were thought to be Aristotle’s and\ntheir influence was scant, but in the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies they were finally attributed to Theophrastus and attained\nsome importance. During the Renaissance, though, the fortuna\nof Theophrastus’ writings changed considerably: The Latin\ntranslations by Theodore of Gaza of the two major botanical works,\nEnquiry into Plants and Plant Explanations, were\nprinted in 1483, even before the edition of the Greek text from the\npress of Aldus Manutius in 1495–1498. In 1644 Johannes Bodaeus\npublished in Amsterdam a frequently cited folio edition of these works\nwith commentaries and woodcut illustrations. The Latin version of the\nMetaphysics by Cardinal Bessarion was published in 1515,\nwhile the classical scholar Adrianus Turnebus began publishing Latin\ntranslations of Theophrastus’ opuscula in 1553.\nFinally, the Latin translation of the Characters by Lapo da\nCastiglionchio was produced around 1430 and appeared in print in 1517.\nIt is worth adding that the Characters became the inspiration\nfor the literary genre of the character study, and found many\nimitators in the seventeenth century, notably Bishop Joseph Hall, Sir\nThomas Overbury, Bishop John Earle and the French satirist Jean de La\nBruyère; finally, George Eliot was also inspired by this\nTheophrastean work, and wrote her own book of caricatures,\nImpressions of Theophrastus Such, which was first published\nin 1879.","contact.mail":"ierokaterina@phs.uoa.gr","contact.domain":"phs.uoa.gr"}]
