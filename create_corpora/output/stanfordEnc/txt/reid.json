In these and other areas he offers\nperceptive and important criticisms of the philosophy of Locke,\nBerkeley and especially Hume. He is also well known for his criticisms\nof Locke's view of personal identity and Hume's view of\ncausation. Reid also made influential contributions to philosophical\ntopics including ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. The\nlegacy of Thomas Reid's philosophical work is found in contemporary\ntheories of perception, free will, philosophy of religion, and widely\nin epistemology.\n\n\nAfter studying at the University of Aberdeen, Reid entered the\nministry in New Machar in 1737. In 1748 he published a short essay\nentitled “An Essay on Quantity” concerning\nHutcheson's Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of Beauty and\nVirtue. Although this was his only published work, he was given a\nprofessorship at King's College Aberdeen in 1752. There he\npublished An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of\nCommon Sense (or ‘IHM’) in 1764. Later he received a prestigious\nprofessorship at the University of Glasgow. He resigned from this\nposition in 1781 in order to give himself more time to write, and\npublished Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (or ‘EIP’)\nin 1785 and Essays on the Active Powers of Man (or ‘EAP’) in\n1788. These three books, along with four additional books composed of\npapers, essays and more, have been recently republished in the\nEdinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid.\n\n\nIn the Inquiry, a methodologically pioneering work due to its\nextensive and rigorous use of observational data to justify claims\nabout perception, Reid examines each of the five senses and discusses\nthe ways in which we achieve knowledge of the world by employing\nthem. Intellectual Powers expands his system beyond the\napprehension of the world through the senses to consideration of\nmemory, imagination, knowledge, the nature of judgment, reasoning and\ntaste. The Active Powers examines a collection of topics\nconcerning ethics, the nature of agency generally, and the distinctive\nfeatures of human agency.\n\n\n\nReid often articulates his theoretical positions in terms defending\ncommon sense and the “opinions of the vulgar”. Indeed, he\nis often described as a “common sense philosopher”. This\nreputation owes less to the philosophical uses Reid makes of common\nsense than to fellow Scotsman James Beattie, who popularized common\nsense in his very widely read An Essay on The Nature and\nImmutability of Truth In Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism\n(1770). Even today it is easy to overestimate and to misunderstand the\nrole of common sense in Thomas Reid's philosophical system. \n\nThe most important use of the term “common sense” in Reid\noccurs in the context of his epistemology and his philosophical\nmethod. Here it refers to a select set of intuitive judgments. Reid\ncalls these variously “first principles, principles of\ncommon sense, common notions, [or] self-evident\ntruths” (Essays on the Intellectual Powers,\nabbreviated ‘EIP’, 6.4, 452). Common sense first principles are\nidentifiable because they typically possess a suite of additional\ntraits (traits, note, not necessary conditions) as follows. Denial of\na common sense principle is not only false but absurd (EIP 6.4,\n462). A common sense judgment is “necessary to all men for\ntheir being and preservation, and therefore it is unconditionally\ngiven to all men by the Author of Nature” (EIP 4.6, 412). Common\nsense intuitive judgments are “no sooner understood than they\nare believed. The judgment follows the apprehension of them\nnecessarily, and both are equally the work of nature, and the result\nof our original powers” (EIP 6.4, 452). \n\nCommon sense principles possess “the consent of ages and\nnations, of the learned and unlearned, [which] ought to have great\nauthority with regard to first principles, where every man is a\ncompetent judge” (EIP 6.4, 464).  Common sense principles are\ncommon sense because, but not only because, they are common to\nhumanity. Reid's account of common sense does not itself approach the\nstatus of a philosophical or psychological theory. Though his\ncommitment to common sense forms a key component in his philosophical\nmethod, a deeper methodological principle clearly underlies his appeal\nto common sense. Reid attempts to build his fallibilist,\nfoundationalist account of empirical knowledge while working under an\nempiricist constraint that prohibits speculative use of a priori\nreason. As a result, Reid's reference to beliefs held in common across\ntime and place, across culture and religion, functions as an\nempirically justified generalization about species-typical features of\nhuman cognition. \n\nThough this marks a point commonly neglected in the interpretation of\nReid, one can often find, in his discussion of common sense, emphasis\non empirical generalizations from observable data about what people\nbelieve and how they behave. For example, he writes, “The\nuniversality of these opinions, and of many such that might be named,\nis sufficiently evident, from the whole tenor of human conduct, as far\nas our acquaintance reaches, and from the history of all ages and\nnations of which we have any records” (EIP 6.4, 466). Laying\nstress upon his claim about the universality of certain beliefs across\nour species has opened Reid up to tiresome criticism that began in his\nlifetime and continues to the present of the following sort: Reid's\nappeals to common sense are little more than affirmations of majority\nopinion or appeals to the masses, but these are fallacious, so his\ninferences from such principles are defeated. Reid corrects this\nmisunderstanding by emphasizing the fact that his first principles are\npsychological generalizations about belief formation applicable to\nmost of our species (EIP 6.4, 464–5). \n\nReid often appeals to the structure of languages as evidence for\ngeneralizations about human cognition, belief, and descriptive\nmetaphysics. Language, being something so widely shared, offers an\nabundance of data for observation. Reid finds many commonalities\nacross languages. (The connection between ordinary language and common\nsense that Reid espouses was of great influence on such later\nphilosophers as G. E. Moore and J. L. Austin.) Reid does not believe,\nhowever, that every feature of ordinary language is indicative of some\nimportant tenet of common sense (EIP 1.1, 26–27). Reid often suggests\nthat the relevant features are those that can be found in “the\nstructure of all languages”, suggesting that the linguistic\nfeatures of relevance are features of syntactic structure shared among\nlanguages. Reid says there is some important difference between the\nactive and the passive, since “all languages” have a\npassive and active voice. All languages distinguish between qualities\nof things and the things themselves (EIP 6.4, 466). This suggests that\ncertain universal features of the syntactic structure of languages\ninform us of a common sense cognitive commitment, even if it is\nimplicit. \n \nMost of Reid's first principles of contingent truth take the form of\nPrinciple 5, which reads “That those things do really exist\nwhich we distinctly perceive by our senses, and are what we perceive\nthem to be” (EIP 6.5, 476). Such common sense first principles\nare intended to be more than merely generalizations about how\nhumans across cultures form beliefs. Reid intends these general\nprinciples to provide evidence for particular beliefs. Thus\nPrinciple 5 issues in the self-evident belief, for example, that I\nperceive a computer before me (Van Cleve 1999). As a result, Reid's\nphilosophical method accords with common sense insofar as everyday\nperceptual beliefs are evident or self-evident. \n\nAn implication of Reid's application of his common sense method to\nfirst principles is that Reid is not concerned to answer questions of\njustification that appear pressing to contemporary epistemologists. He\nis not, for instance, interested in providing a refutation of\nskepticism about the external world by appeal to first\nprinciples. Reid believes he can refute skeptical hypotheses--such as\nDescartes's hypothesis of an evil demon who makes us believe that the\nworld is the way we take it to be when it is really vastly\ndifferent--simply by showing that such a hypothesis is no more likely\nto be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the\nway we perceive it to be. Since the belief in the external world is a\ndictate of common sense, it is, Reid thinks, as justified as it needs\nto be when it is shown to be on the same footing as any\nalternative. Justification, therefore, does not necessarily require\nproviding positive reasons in favor of common-sensical beliefs; common\nsense beliefs could be adequately justified simply by undermining the\nforce of the reasons in favor of alternatives to common sense. In\nfact, as we move through this entry, we will witness Reid's repeated\ndeployment of this strategy in the form of burden-of-proof arguments\nagainst his major foil, the Way of Ideas. Common sense constrains,\nrather than dictates, acceptable philosophical positions. \n \nA number of additional problems remain in accounting for Reid's appeal\nto common sense and in his treatment of first principles. For example,\na number of comments Reid makes indicate that he appears to have a\npsychological conception of evidence whereby what is evident forces\nassent. He writes, “[The different kinds of evidence] seem to me\nto agree only in this, that they are fitted by nature to produce\nbelief in the human mind” (EIP 2.20, 292). Just what he means,\nthen, by terms “evident” and “self-evident”\n(terms he greatly prefers to the more contemporary\n“justification” and “knowledge”) is an issue\nmeriting further research. \n\nThe relations between one's first principles, the perceived\naims—and limits—of natural philosophy, and one's religious\nbackground came together in eighteenth-century Great Britain to issue\nin a number of different philosophical stances. Typically these\nstances are framed as various commitments to Newton and\nNewtonianism. Hume and MacLaurin believe the mind's\noperations are to be studied with broadly observational Newtonian\nmethods, though this leads them to forms of local\nskepticism. Priestley and Hartley apply Newtonianism not only to the\noperations of the mind but to the mind's substance via\nmaterialist commitments. Reid's teacher George Turnbull adopted\nNewtonianism and was led to Berkeleyan idealism by many of Berkeley's\nown common-sense commitments. Wanting both the world and knowledge of\nit in his philosophical system, Reid was at pains to articulate his\naccount of both common sense and Newtonianism. Unlike most British\nEmpiricists, Reid read, understood, and taught Newton's writings. To\nunderstand Reid's philosophical method, not to mention his philosophy\nof science, one must understand core features of Reid's Newtonianism\n(Callergård, 2010) and, perhaps, how Reid altered Newton's own\nmethod (Ducheyne 2006). \n\nFirst, Reid is committed to the positive role of mathematics in\nstating and testing theories. Only in that field do we “find no\nsects, no contrary systems, and hardly any disputes” (EIP 6.4,\n457). Newton's greatness lies in part due to the fact that he places\nphysics upon firm mathematical ground, in sharp contrast to Cartesian\nphysics, its leading competitor of the time.  Second, Reid says that\nissues about causation are not issues physics should attempt to\nresolve. This counterintuitive commitment is explained by the fact\nthat Reid believes causes, when that term is used properly,\nare efficient causes (The Correspondence of Thomas\nReid, abbreviated ‘Correspondence’ below, 2006,\n158). Not only this, efficient causes are only ever agents (EAP 1.5,\n30–32; for more about this, see 4. Causation and\nFree Will, below). Reid attributes this position to Newton. Reid\nmentions on many occasions, and with a certain pride, that Newtonian\nscience does not permit knowledge of causes of phenomena, for example,\nthe motion of the compass needle or the attraction of two bodies. Here\nand elsewhere Reid frequently speaks with the scientists and uses\n‘cause’ in a colloquial way to refer to physical causes; in doing so,\nhe explicitly follows David Hume's lead. More often, however, Reid\nurges readers to think of scientific explanation in terms of laws, as\nNewton had done. Laws are true general propositions used to explain\nappearances (Thomas Reid on the Animate Creation 1996,\n187). Physics does not aim to find efficient causes. By dispensing\nwith causes and amplifying the explanatory value and empirical\njustification of statements of laws, Reid's account is regarded as a\nforerunner to a deductive-nomological model of explanation. \n\nThird, related, when one event produces another event, e.g. fertilizer\nenables better plant growth, Reid strongly resists describing that\ninteraction as necessary (The Correspondence of Thomas\nReid 2006, 234, 243). One event may be constantly conjoined to\nanother event, but it is a mistake to believe that this forms any\nnecessity. Fourth, unlike nearly all other Early Modern philosophers\ntraditionally taught in the canon, Reid was an avowed experimentalist,\nmade so by borrowing Newton's methods in Opticks, and\nconducted experiments to provide evidence for his claims about the\nnature of the mind, perception and agency. Reid was active in his\ncommunity, bringing his penchant for knowledge through experimentation\nto meetings in Aberdeenshire in which experimental techniques in\nfarming were debated. Fifth, Reid understands Newtonian physics to\noffer partial confirmation to some beliefs about God and God's\nrelation to the world. Newtonian natural science's role in this\nconnection is to provide evidence for belief that our solar system is\norderly and well-governed. (See 8. Philosophy of\nReligion below). \n\nStating central features of Reid's commitment to Newtonianism goes a\nlong way to understanding Reid's empiricism and science since Reid\nattributes most of his own views about these matters to\nNewton. Despite the fact that with a few notable exceptions Reid\nscholars have neglected issues in his philosophy of science, a few key\ncontroversies have emerged and merit brief mention. First, Reid was\nembroiled in clashes with other thinkers and correspondents about the\nscope of Newton's Regulae Philosophandi. Interpretations\ndiffered considerably, as did the translations and restatements of the\nrules themselves. Given that after Bacon's work,\nNewton's Regulae formed the most important statement on\nmethod in natural philosophy to be found in the Early Modern period,\nReid was quick to defend his interpretation of these rules against\nalternate uses by Priestley and others. \n\nReid translates Newton's first rule from Latin as “No more\ncauses, nor any other causes of natural effects ought to be admitted,\nbut such as are both true, and are sufficient for explaining their\nappearances” and adds in his own voice, “This is a golden\nrule; it is the true and proper test, by which what is sound and solid\nin philosophy may be distinguished from what is hollow and vain”\n(EIP 1.3, 51). Reid expands the intended scope of this rule saying\nthat it is a “fundamental principle in our enquiries into the\nstructure of the mind, and its operations” (EIP 1.3,\n51). Occurring in the introductory portion of his Essays on\nIntellectual Powers, he would go on to use and reuse it countless\ntimes in what followed. He also describes Newton's first rule as\n“a dictate of common sense” (EIP 2.6, 102). Proponents of\nthe Way of Ideas fail to abide by Newton's first rule when they\nendorse the existence of ideas because the existence of ideas is an\nhypothesis and lacks evidence. \n \nAnother area of controversy in Reid's empiricism involves the\ngrounding of his belief to the effect that ether does not exist. Ether\nappears to represent just the sort of posit (originally by Descartes\nin Principles of Philosophy) that Newtonians often enjoyed\nsweeping into the trash. Lacking any observational evidence for ether,\nDescartes posits ether as a medium through which forces can act on\nbodies that are not in direct contact. But does Reid reject ether\ntheory on the grounds that it is unobservable and therefore\ndoes not belong in a Newtonian science, or does he reject ether\ntheory because scientists as yet lack justificatory observations\non its behalf? Reid's apparent hostility to\n“hypotheses” in philosophy and “efficient\ncauses” in natural philosophy gives rise to the belief that Reid\ndoes not believe that forces should be allowed into philosophy. The\nanswer to this question can resolve that issue and assist in locating\nReid's philosophy of science on the positivist/realist spectrum. \n\nThe first rule does not entail that unobservables like ether, subtile\nfluids, or forces do not or cannot have explanatory force, let alone\nthat unobservables do not exist. Reid is explicit that questions about\nthe existence of ether were open questions that were not settled by a\npriori (EIP 2.3, 82). Physical forces and causes do exist and may\nyield their secrets to science in the form of purely physical forces\nof attraction (An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of\nCommon Sense, abbreviated to ‘IHM’, 7, 211). This has two\ncorollaries of considerable importance for understanding Reid's\nmethods. First, the fact that Reid admits that these forces of\nattraction—unobservable, immaterial forces—may be physical\nimplies that he is comfortable with a physical explanation of\ngravitation that does not entail the existence of God. Second,\nphysical forces will not yield their secrets to an impoverished\nCartesian science. This criticism is made on the grounds that\nCartesians were attempting to understand gravitational attraction in\nterms of only extension, figure and motion—for Reid, a\ncatastrophic mistake. In fact, Reid's criticism of the Cartesians has\nprovided a clue for an account of Reidian forces as irreducible\nproperties of matter (Callergård 2005, 2010). \n\nReid's theory of conception is at the heart of his philosophical\nsystem and his faculty psychology. The term ‘faculty psychology’\nrefers, at least for Reid, to both the distinction of certain\nbelief-forming systems from others, and the explanatory utility\npurchased with such a set of distinctions. While faculty psychology\nappears to be an obvious way to scientifically study the senses,\nReid's study of intellectual powers—memory, judgment,\nabstraction—under the umbrella of faculty psychology was not\nobvious. Reid would face pointed criticism for multiplying faculties,\nbut this consequence was more than outweighed by the explanatory\nutility of separating mental powers—their inputs, their\noperations, and their outputs—from one another. \n  \nThe most ubiquitous mental power is that of conception. Our\nsuite of intellectual faculties supports a wide variety of mental\nevents. Acts of conceiving are embedded in most of them. Whether\njudging that there is a tree before me, imagining there is a tree\nbefore me, or reasoning to a generalization that all trees have roots,\nthese mental events employ the faculty of conception. It is in virtue\nof conception that the first of these mental states is about the\nproposition there is a tree before me; that the second mental state\ntakes as its object a non-existent tree; and that the third uses a\ngeneral conception of ‘tree’. The Way of Ideas teaches, wrongly, that\nacts of perception temporally begin with an act of simple apprehension\n“and that after we have got simple apprehensions, by comparing\nthem together, we perceive agreements or disagreements between\nthem,” but, Reid continues, “this appears to me to be all\nfiction, without any foundation in nature” (IHM 2.4,\n29). Instead, simple apprehension—the basic form of\nconception—is bundled within typical acts of perception. The\nmodel of conception received from the Way of Ideas marks its first\nlong step into two types of skepticism. \n \nNote that the set of commitments that Reid refers to as “The Way\nof Ideas” and the “Ideal Theory” is drawn form the\nwork of Locke, Berkeley, Hume and many others going back to Plato and\nAristotle. Its principle commitment is to mental representations,\ncalled ‘ideas’ or ‘images’, that are believed to mediate all our\nexperience of the world—from conception to memory and\nperception. Reid regards the Way of Ideas as founded on a flawed,\nanti-Newtonian methodology, is unscientific, and he argues that it has\nhighly undesirable consequences. \nConception lies at the heart of the operations of the intellectual\nfaculties because conception provides the intentional\ncontent—the ‘aboutness’—to mental states. Reid\ndistinguishes between several functions of conception. A rudimentary\nform of conceiving, which Reid often calls ‘simple apprehension,’\nrefers to “the bare conception of a thing without any judgment\nor belief about it” (EIP 4.1, 295). This “enters as an\ningredient in every operation of the mind” (EIP 4.1, 296). In\norder to believe, or remember or perceive, I must perform an act of\nsimple apprehension in order to get something in mind.  \n\nWe explain Reidian conception by contrast with the Way of\nIdeas. First, Reid presupposes that the mind has an irreducible\ncapacity for intentional conception in which our mental states are\nuniquely about specific objects. This faculty cannot be explained in\nterms of further non-intentional states. How intentional conception\ncan be explained is mysterious—Reid is well aware of this. Yet\nif “we were unable to give any account how we first got the\nconception of power, this would be no good reason for denying that we\nhave it” (Reid 2001, “Of Power,” 5). In a\ncontrasting methodological move, Hume suggests that intentional\ncontent through ideas is built up from the operation of the laws of\nassociation—contiguity in time and space, resemblance and\nperceived causation—working upon impressions and images in the\nmind (see Treatise 1.1.1.7, 4; 1.2.3.2, 33; 2.1.11.8,\n319; Enquiry 7.2.6, 74). \n \nConception takes as its intentional objects items with varied\nontologies, including physical objects and propositions (EIP 1.1,\n24–5) as well as fictional beings like Brienne of Tarth. The fact that\nconception takes physical objects as (direct) intentional objects\nmarks a key contrast with the Way of Ideas since, on the Way of Ideas,\nconception, perception, judgment and belief are “only different\nways of perceiving ideas in our own minds” (EIP 4.1, 298). (Note\nthat, according to Reid, the Way of Ideas fails to adopt a proper\nfaculty psychology since all mental powers—memory, perception,\nabstraction, etc.—only ever take ideas as intentional objects.)\nConsiderable work in the secondary literature has been devoted to\ndetermine just what the content of conceptions are or can be. \n \nThe state of conception is not a ‘quantitative’ state for Reid, as are\nideas according to Hume, who writes that some ideas are lively, others\nnot, and others partially lively (Treatise 1.1.1). Hume uses\nthese valences to determine which faculty is at work conceiving the\nidea. If I perceive an idea of a tree, my conception is lively and\nvivacious. If I remember the same idea of a tree, my conception is\nfaint. Instead, Reid offers an account of a distinct\nfaculty—conception—whose objects are embedded in other\nacts of the intellectual powers. \n\nReid's is an act-based theory of conception, in contrast to the Way of\nIdeas' object-based theory. Conceptions are ways of being aware of\nobjects. To conceive of an object is to be aware of that\nobject as the bearer of some particular property. So I can\nconceive that Brienne of Tarth is tall, or that Brienne\nof Tarth is female, or that Brienne of Tarth is a tall\nfemale. Being tall and being female are different properties, and\ntheir difference signals something important about Reidian\nconception. Being tall is a relational property since height is a\ntrait that is assessed relative to some further thing or standard. To\nforeshadow, this subtle feature of conception will become important\nfor Reid in his discussion of vision, especially his discussion of the\nrelational property of visible figure. \n\nReid affirms human beings know what are the intentional contents of\ntheir thoughts. If I think about a tree, then I am (defeasibly)\njustified that I am thinking about a tree. But the Way of Ideas\njeopardizes Reid's commitment to the obviousness of our introspective\nability to identify what we are thinking about. Like the more familiar\nveil of perception created by the representational role of\nideas (see 3.1 The Way of Ideas and Representational\nTheories of Perception ), there is also a veil\nof conception. The seeds of Reid's argument are in Hume's\ncandid remark that, given the Way of Ideas, mental events “seem\nentirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never\ncan observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never\nconnected. ... [T]he necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no\nidea of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely\nwithout any meaning” (Enquiry 7.2.6, 74;\nsee Treatise 1.2.6.8, 67). Hume's causal explanation of\nreverberating impacts on impressions in the mind does not explain the\ncontent of our thoughts. Hume describes his theory of thought as\ncorpuscular because impressions are atomic and separable mental states\nwithout any determinate intentional link to anything else. Note that\nHume appears to be led to this position by way of his attempt to\nrepurpose Newtonian mechanics, as it applies to bodies, to formulate a\nscience of the mind. \n \nTroubled by the statement from Hume, Reid constructs a reductio\nargument against Hume's theory of thought that plays upon the\nimplications just noted. Reid presents this argument about the\nintentionality of thought through an analogy about the meaning of\nlanguage, specifically, about someone who is blind to the meaning of\nthe language in a book. Suppose I see unfamiliar ink marks on paper. I\nneither know what they mean nor even that they are meaningful to\nanyone. The meanings of these words are not intrinsic to the\nrepresentations of the words, whether those representations are\non paper or are sound waves, just like the intentional content of\nideas is not intrinsic to the ideas themselves. Reid writes: \n\nUninterpreted impressions are syntactic and purportedly\nrepresentational. But “Symbols without interpretation have no\nvalue” (Philosophical Orations, Reid 1937, 35 and Reid\n1989, 62). The resulting veil of conception implies that my\nimpressions risk having no meaning for me. As a result, I do not know\nthe contents of my own thoughts. Since this is absurd, Reid rejects\nthe Way of Ideas' premise that leads to it. This fascinating argument\nhas been explored and its affinities with John Searle's Chinese Room\nargument have been noted (Haldane 1989, 1993 & Nichols 2007,\nch. 2), but it merits further development. \n\nReid's reductio of the Way of Ideas' theory of thought is intended to\nbuttress Reid's claims that conceiving is irreducibly intentional and\nthat, because of this, we have knowledge of the contents of our\nthoughts. Hume refrains from this claim in part because he sees no\nplausible metaphysics to support it. That is, if intentionality is\nendemic to thought, then the mind must not be what we think it\nis—a part of nature whose ideas operate on impact principles\nfamiliar from Newtonian mechanics. Reid is aware of this problem and\nprepares to bite the bullet. He describes our ability to apprehend one\nthing and not another as being “a natural kind of magic”\n(IHM 5.3, 59–60). In an effort to explicate this mysterious conceptual\nability, Reid examines theories of thought of Aristotle and medieval\nphilosophers. These theories posit substantial forms that conjoin\nthoughts to their intentional objects (Philosophical\nOrations, Reid 1937, 38 and Reid 1989, 66). Yet Reid judges them\nharshly and finds their ontology “incomprehensible” (EIP\n2.8, 114). He withholds further speculation about the metaphysics that\nmust undergird the claim that intentionality is primitive. This move\nillustrates a feature of Reid's philosophical method: common sense and\nknowledge are conceptually and explanatorily prior to metaphysical\ncommitments. \n\nReid is a nominalist about universals, which means that Reid does not\nbelieve that universals exist independently of the set of individual\nthings that instantiate the shared property. (A universal is a\nproperty shared by many individuals, each of which instantiates the\nuniversal. In addition to opposing arguments for universals, he also\nopposes the form of nominalism advocated by Berkeley and Hume. Reid\nconcludes that universals are general terms, not abstract or general\nideas. \n\nAs usual, Reid builds his theory by learning from mistakes of earlier\ntheories. Medieval philosophers argued, by Reid's account, that a\nuniversal exists independently of individual things. Some of these\nphilosophers argued that the independent existence of a universal was\nexistence as a form, a venerable philosophical\nterm. Addressing this, Reid says it is impossible that “a\ntriangle should really exist which has no precise proportion of sides\nand angles” and, generally, it is “impossible that any\nbeing should exist which is not an individual being” (EIP 5.6,\n396). The principal philosophical error that led to the reification of\nuniversal properties as independent existents is the conflation of the\nobjects of conception with the objects of perception (EIP 4.1,\n302–3). The metaphysics required to undergird the existence of\nuniversals is anathema to Reid's commonsense commitments and his\nempirical method. \n\nNext Reid considers a theory he associates with Locke, namely that\nuniversals do not exist as metaphysical forms but rather universals\nare abstract ideas. Abstract ideas arise through a process in which\nfacts about time and space are stripped away from particular members\nof a class of thing leaving the abstract idea that represents common\ncharacteristics (EIP 3.2). Reid argues that there can be no such\nabstract ideas and that abstract ideas cannot represent members of a\nclass of particulars (EIP 5.6, 391–3). Reid recognizes his great debt\nto Berkeley's criticisms of Lockean abstract ideas in these\nconnections. \n\nIn effect, Reid arrives at his own theory by endorsing Berkeley's\nnominalism and attempting to remove from it reference to ideas. Reid\nreplaces talk of abstract ideas with the term ‘general conception.’ As\nto the ontology of general conceptions, Reid says that human minds\ncreate them, not nature; this reconfirms Reid's nominalism about kind\nterms. General terms are the linguistic manifestation of general\nconceptions. General terms are general due to their referents, but\nthey are particular token conceptions of individuals (EIP 5.2,\n360). General terms refer to species or to attributes. When we\nconceive of general terms like ‘lion’ or ‘felony’ or ‘unicorn’,\n“the meaning of the word is the thing conceived” (EIP 5.2,\n364). The term ‘lion’ does not resemble what it is about; it\nrepresents the class of lions by convention. \n\nThis leads to Reid's explanation of how general conceptions are\nformed. Reid says this typically happens via induction through\ntestimony and not via definitions (EIP 5.2, 363). For Reid, forming\ngeneral conceptions is typically a public process and a product of\nsocial practices, in contrast to Locke, Berkeley and Hume, for whom\nforming abstract ideas is typically a private process. (Though we do\nnot enter into discussion of the role of testimony and social\nknowledge anywhere in this entry, it is especially prominent in Reid.)\nHowever, one may also form a general conception on one's own. In this\ncase, in the first stage one analyses a subject into its attributes\nand names them, which Reid compares to a chemist analyzing a compound\n(EIP 5.3, 370). Next one observes that similar token attributes are\npossessed by many objects. Third is “combining into one hole a\ncertain number of those attributes...and giving a name to that\ncombination” (EIP 5.3, 365). The name that results may be the\nsame as the name for a particular attribute, e.g. ‘whiteness,’ but\nused as a general term, ‘whiteness’ “implies no existence, but\nmay be predicated of everything that is white, and in the same\nsense” (EIP 5.3, 367). This way of putting the point—that\nthe general term whiteness may be predicated of everything that is\nwhite—has inspired a dispositional interpretation of Reidian\ngeneral conceptions (Castagnetto 1992). Reid's writing on general\nconceptions and abstraction are areas—like the next topic,\nconception of non-existent objects—that have not been given much\nattention. \n\nReid believes that we can conceive of non-existent objects. This does\nnot appear to comport with his alleged common-sense philosophy,\ncreating an interesting conundrum for Reid interpreters. The best\napproach to understanding why Reid says we can conceive of\nnon-existent objects is to put this in the context of Reid's\nopposition to skepticism. In the face of ‘veil of conception’\nskepticism, Reid is intent on defending the transparency and\nself-knowledge of our thoughts. This leads him to argue that we can\nconceive of non-existent, fictional objects: “I conceive a\ncentaur. This conception is an operation of the mind, of which I am\nconscious, and to which I can attend. The sole object of it is a\ncentaur, an animal which, I believe, never existed” (EIP 4.2,\n321; see EIP 2.12, 160). Suppose when I think I am conceiving of a\ncentaur, I am conceiving of something else, like an image of a\ncentaur. If so, then I do not know the contents of my thoughts. This\nyields skepticism about the contents of my thoughts, which Reid\nbelieves is false. So, by reductio he concludes that we are able to\nconceive of objects that do not exist. \n\nThe factual claim that I know what I am thinking appears to be\nobviously true insofar as anyone familiar with the meaning of\n‘centaur’ conceives of centaurs when reading sentences that predicate\nproperties of centaurs. Representational theories of thought like the\nWay of Ideas imply in this case that I do not conceive of centaurs\nbut rather I conceive of mental representations of\ncentaurs—images of them or words about them (EIP 4.2,\n312). But Reid is asserting something different: I conceive of a\ncentaur itself—not a mental representation of a\ncentaur. Appreciating this point is necessary for understanding how\nstrange Reid's theory appears to be. \n\nReid understands the Way of Ideas' error theory of the conception of a\ncentaur: “The [proponent of the Way of Ideas] says, I cannot\nconceive a centaur without having an idea of it in my mind.... Perhaps\nhe will say, that the idea is an image of the animal, and is the\nimmediate object of my conception, and that the animal is the mediate\nor remote object.” Reid first responds that when he introspects\nhe is aware of only one object of conception, not two. Second, the\nobject of conception, he writes, \n\nEven in difficult cases of thoughts about things like centaurs or\ncircles (EIP 4.3, 323–4), their intentional contents are so\ntransparent in a moment's reflection that we can identify them without\nmistake. Reid presses this epistemological point into heavy service in\nthe context of the conception of non-existent objects. As with Reid's\nappeal to the irreducible intentionality of conception, Reid's\nposition regarding the conception of non-existent objects has proven\nchallenging to explain and to defend, but starts have been made (David\n1985–6; Nichols 2002). Though his commitment to the importance of\nself-knowledge and the transparency of thought is obvious, Reid\njeopardizes his allegiance to common sense by asserting we think of\nnon-existent objects directly and without thinking of a mental\nintermediary. \n\nWhen discussing Reidian conception, we contrasted Reid's analysis of\nthis faculty with the Way of Ideas'. For Reid, conceptions or ‘simple\napprehensions’ possess intentional content in virtue of which these\nmental states are about other things. Conceptions can be about a wide\nvariety of thing: I can conceive of pain, a shooting pain Descartes'\nfoot, penne, and fictional characters like Podrick Payne. However,\naccording to the Way of Ideas, I can conceive only of one type of\nthing: Ideas. According to the Way of Ideas, this holds true not\nonly for conception but for all other faculties. If I tactilely\nperceive a pillow, my perceptual mental state is not about the pillow\nbut rather it is about my idea or mental representation of the\npillow. The basic structure of the representational theory of\nperception (and conception, memory, etc.) is explicitly endorsed by\nDescartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and many other Early Modern\nphilosophers, as well as many living philosophers. We doubt that there\nis any other philosophical commitment that more exercised Reid's mind\nthan this one, which he thought to be a source of ruin for many\nreasons. Both Reid and Richard Rorty see the Way of Ideas'\nrepresentationalism as the key player in the story of Early Modern\nWestern philosophy (Rorty 1981), which would continue as the story of\ncontemporary analytic philosophy. \n\nTo the basic structure of the representational theory of perception,\none of many components can be added to explain how we are ‘aware’ of\nexternal, physical objects even though the immediate object of\nperception is an idea. Here are three possibilities: (1) we are aware\nof external objects directly by perceiving\nrepresentations of them, ideas; (2) we infer the existence\nand nature of external objects by perceiving ideas of them; or (3)\nthere is no distinction between external objects and ideas, and, thus,\nwhen we perceive ideas we are perceiving external objects. \n \nOn option (1), the representationalist would need to offer an\nexplanation of what it is that is so special about ideas that makes it\nthe case that whenever we are perceiving an idea, we are directly\naware of that which it represents. If this burden can be discharged,\nthen it is possible to say that we are aware of external objects and\nremain consistent with the representational theory. In the history of\nphilosophy Reid documents a series of failed efforts to explain how it\nis that perception of something in the mind could amount to any direct\nperception or awareness of some external object. These attempts make\nthe mistake, he thinks, of giving unexplained and unexplainable powers\nto ideas: how could they possibly, all by themselves, attach our minds\nto objects whenever they are perceived? This question cannot be\nanswered, so he thinks. \n\nAs to (2), Reid thinks that nobody who has absorbed Hume's lessons\nregarding causation would think that we can avoid skepticism about the\nexternal world while insisting that we infer its nature from the\nfeatures of directly perceived ideas. On the representational model,\nexternal objects are the causes of our ideas. But if Hume is right\nabout causation then we can only infer the nature of a particular\nunobserved cause of a particular observed effect when we have had\nrepeated experience of conjunction of similar causes with similar\neffects. But according to the Way of Ideas we have never in fact had\nany experience of the relevant causes, namely physical objects and\ntheir qualities; we have only experienced their effects on our minds,\nideas. Therefore, we can infer nothing about external objects by\nexamination of the ideas which they cause in us. Option (2) appears to\ngive skepticism a foothold. \n\nAs to (3), Reid believes that it amounts to an endorsement of\nidealism. Reid finds this theory implausible on its own, and in\nviolation of a host of common sense principles, despite the fact that\nhe admires Berkeley's efforts to pursue its full implications. Reid's\narguments against representationalist attempts to recover the\nawareness of the external world through perception via options (1),\n(2) and (3) are by no means all of his arguments against the\nrepresentationalist theory of perception or the Way of Ideas. We now\nintroduce a few additional considerations for which Reid rejects that\ntheory. \n\nFirst, note that proponents of the Way of Ideas commit themselves not\nonly to the existence of ideas but to pressing ideas into a number of\nfunctional roles in the mental lives of human beings. But, according\nto Reid, the underlying rationale for these commitments is typically\nnot even stated by proponents of the Way of Ideas; it is most often\ntaken for granted, or supported with demonstrably weak arguments. As a\nresult, the rationale for commitments to an ontology of ideas and to\ntheir functional roles in the mind does not confer upon that\ncommitment much epistemic justification. In the context of a passage\nin which Reid imagines a dialogue between “the vulgar” or\nthe common person on the one hand and “the philosopher” on\nthe other, Reid develops this reasoning as follows: \n\nThe Way of Ideas philosopher must talk the man on the street out of\nthe belief that “When I perceive an apple in front of me, the\napple is the very thing I'm perceiving.” The philosopher's\nresponse—that this is a mistake, that the object of perception\nis an idea of the apple—is predicated upon a rejection of the\nvulgar's conception of everyday thoughts about objects. But this\nrejection appears to rest in the opinion of philosophers rather than\nin the entailment of some as yet unstated but decisive argument. As a\nresult, the rationale for commitments to an ontology of ideas and to\ntheir functional roles in the mind appears to Reid to be as dubious,\nif not more, than the man on the street's original commitment to a\ndirect form of perception. If Reid is correct, then this shifts the\nburden of proof back upon the advocate of ideas. \n\nSecond, in a structurally similar argument, Reid observes something\nimportant about the intended explanatory power of the representational\ntheory of perception. That theory is intended to explain the fact that\nour mental states manage to connect to real objects, manage to\nbe about real objects. However, this fact about\nbeliefs is only explained by the model if the model is less obscure\nthan the phenomena to be explained by it. But, Reid observes, if we\nnotice that we do not understand how it is that we manage to connect\nour minds to objects in the world, then it cannot help to say that we\ndo this by first connecting our minds to mental representations unless\nwe understand how it is that we manage to connect our minds to those\nmental representations. This consideration gives the following\nquestion its force: Why is the perception of a mental intermediary\nlike an idea supposed to be more intelligible than the direct\nperception of a physical object? If it is no more intelligible, then\nthe representational theory is not serving to explain what it was\nintended to explain. (See EIP 2.14, 185.) \n\nIn addition to burden of proof arguments against the Way of Ideas and\nthe representational theory of perception, Reid also deploys a number\nof detailed arguments against specific components of these theories\nand against commitments they presuppose to be true. Though these\narguments are unsuitable for recapitulation in the format of an\nencyclopedia entry, we report one such argument in brief in an effort\nto offer a hint at the robust detail, nuanced reasoning, and attention\nto physiological facts in Reid's theory of perception. \n\nIn one of a small handful of arguments that David Hume explicitly\noffers for a representational theory of perception, he concludes that\n“nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or\nperception” (Enquiry 12.9; see Treatise\n1.4.1.12, 187) by reasoning from considerations having to do with what\nis known as ‘perceptual relativity’. Hume writes, “The table,\nwhich we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: but the\nreal table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: it\nwas, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the\nmind. These are the obvious dictates of reason”\n(Enquiry 12.9). This is perhaps the most compelling argument\nfor the representational theory of perception. \n \nReid responds to this argument with several objections. First, Reid's\nanalysis of each of the senses in Inquiry convince him that\nsome senses do not represent physical objects in the same way that all\nthe others do. Touch (IHM ch. 6), for example, presents qualities of\nobjects to the mind in ways more direct than does vision (IHM ch. 7),\nresulting in what has been referred to as Reid's hybrid theory of\nperception. A conclusion generalized to all the senses (“nothing\ncan ever be present...”) but based solely on one sense is\ntherefore invalid. \n \nThe next of Reid's objections is more involved, requiring introduction\nof a key distinction Reid makes on the basis of his attention to the\nphenomenology of visual experience. First, though, notice Hume's use\nof the term ‘table’ and ‘the real table’ in the argument above.\nFollowing Berkeley's New Theory of Vision, Reid distinguishes\nbetween visible figure from tangible figure (IHM 6.2, 81–2), or later,\nwhich is virtually the same distinction, between ‘apparent magnitude’\nand ‘real magnitude’ (EIP 2.14, 181). The tangible or real figure of\nan object is measured by yards or inches, but the visible figure is\nnot. Instead, the visible figure depends for its geometric\nproperties—the surface area that the table occupies in the\nvisual field—upon properties of the tangible figure, including\nits shape and its distance from the eyes. Reid recognizes the obvious\nphenomenon of perceptual relativity, for example, that when I see a\ntable at 10 yards and at 100, its “visible appearance, in its\nlength, breadth, and all its linear proportions, is ten times less in\nthe last case than it is in the first” (IHM 6.2, 81–2). The\ntangible figure is measured by different means, sensed by a different\nfaculty, and is extended in three dimensions. This leads Reid to argue\nthat “The ingenious author has imposed upon himself by\nconfounding real magnitude with apparent magnitude,” that is,\nHume equivocates (EIP 2.14, 182). \n \nA pressing question arises at this juncture: Hasn't Reid now adopted a\nposition according to which there are perceptual intermediaries in the\nvisual perception process? If so, doesn't this imply that Reid's\ntheory will share many of the foibles with which he charges the Way of\nIdeas? Most answers to these two questions have proven to be\ncontentious in part because Reid's interpreters often bring to this\nissue prefabricated, a priori definitions of ‘intermediary’,\n‘representation’ and ‘directness’. While Reid's theory of visual\nperception implies that visible figures are seen, visible figures are\nradically unlike ideas. Visible figure is not merely a\nrepresentational intermediary; it is a relational property between\nphysical objects and eyes of perceivers. Only because ideas lack these\ncharacteristics is Hume able to reason from the claim that\nmind-independent tables are not immediate objects of awareness to his\nstated conclusion above that we immediately perceive only ideas or\nrepresentations. That is the first of two important points in response\nto the first question. \n \nThe second enters into Reid's development of a consistent geometry for\nvisible space, perhaps the most technically brilliant piece of writing\nby any major British empiricist. This work allows Reid a crucial reply\nto advocates of representational theories. Reid discovered and\nmathematically described a law-like variation in the visible figure of\nan external object with intrinsic (shape, size) and extrinsic\n(distance, angle of orientation) properties of the tangible\nfigure. Reid summarizes his conclusion writing:  \n \nHume assumes that the relationship between a visible figure and a\ntangible figure is subjective and mind-dependent. Not only is\nthat erroneous, but, given Reid's work, the systematic variation of\nthe visible figure with the tangible figure is in fact evidence for\nthe objectivity of its independence from one's mind. \n\nReid further argues that this objective relationship between, for\nexample, seeing the visible figure of a coin\nand conceiving of the coin becomes automated over time\nthrough repeated experience. Perhaps the first time I saw a coin it\nwas presented to me at an angle, its visible figure an ellipse. I\nmight mistakenly form a perceptual belief about an elliptical object,\neven though the coin is circular. Over time, this process is\nhabituated through a process that Reid describes with the help of a\ndistinction between original and acquired perceptions. In short, my\nfaculty of visual perception, if given experience, will successfully\nmodel the geometrically demonstrable relationship between visible\nfigure and tangible figure. \n\nThis family of arguments has received considerable attention due to a\nnumber of its complexities. These involve attempts to answer questions\nincluding the following: As we have seen, through his science of\nperspectival shapes of objects Reid argues that they are geometrically\nequivalent to shapes projected onto surfaces of spheres. What is\nReid's formal proof for this, and is it valid (Yaffe 2002)? Does Reid\noffer the first recorded non-Euclidean geometry in the history of\nmathematics (Daniels 1972)? What is the bearing of Reid's repeated\nattempts to derive Euclid's parallel postulate from the axioms of\nincidence on an interpretation of the geometry of visible space as\nnon-Euclidean (Grandi 2005)? Where does Reid's theory of perception\nand geometry of visibles leave the ontology of visible figure (Nichols\n2007, ch. 4)? In what ways is visible figure the object of visual\nperception, and in what ways not (Yaffe 2003; Falkenstein and Grandi\n2003)? Does Reid's geometry of visible space jeopardize his theory's\nability to avoid a representational theory of visual perception (Van\nCleve 2002)? Does visible figure and awareness of it preclude\nnon-inferential perceptual knowledge from vision, or rather, what is\nthe relationship between original and acquired perceptions and visible\nfigure (Nichols 2007, ch. 8)? \n \nNow that we know how and why Reid argues against the Way of Ideas'\nrepresentational theory of perception, we needn't address these\nquestions in order to continue with a discussion of the components of\nReid's own more direct theory of perception. Here we need to keep in\nmind the fact that, though contemporary philosophers write a priori\nabout perception, sensation, and knowledge, Reid does not offer\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for perception or for its\ncomponent processes. Consistent with his Newtonian empiricism, Reid is\naiming for something else altogether: observations and accurate\nexperiments that reduce to general rules (EIP 1.3, 49–50; EIP 2.8,\n120–1). Though operations of our intellectual powers are not definable\nor analyzable a priori, it is possible to describe the operations Reid\nhas in mind. \n \nAccording to Reid, the perceptual process operates as\nfollows. Individuals with functioning sensory organs and a developed\nbrain interact with physical objects in the world. These objects cause\nsensory experiences in individuals. These sensations function as\nnatural signs for qualities of the objects. The experience of a\nsensation orients my cognition so as to form a conception of a quality\nof a mind-independent object. Sometimes, though rarely, an\nindividual's perception of an object will not only cause a sensation\nbut will also cause the person to become aware of the\nsensation—perhaps even at the exclusion of any further awareness\nof primary qualities of the object. For example, when I get hit by a\nbaseball thrown 90 mph I focus on my pain sensations, not the\nqualities of the ball. To perceive an object is to be aware of the\nobject or its quality in a particular way, as the possessor of a\nparticular quality, and, at the same time, to be\nconvinced that the object exists and is as it is conceived it to\nbe. To defend a common sensical theory of perception that is supported\nby observation and experiment, and that is capable of delivering\nknowledge of real objects, Reid thinks he needs to show that we\nare directly aware of real objects, in contrast to key\nfeatures of the Way of Ideas' representational theory of\nperception just discussed. While there is debate over the precise\nsense in which, for Reid, we are directly aware of objects, this much\nseems clear: whatever the sense of “direct” is in which\nthe subscribers to the representational theory take us to be directly\naware of ideas, it is in that sense that Reid takes us to be\ndirectly aware of real objects. \n\nIn addition to being a Newtonian empiricist, Reid is an expert\nphenomenologist, acutely aware to finely grained features of our\nexperience, especially our sensory experience. When we touch a table,\nwhile we conceive of it and often form beliefs about it, we also sense\nit. (See 2.1 Conceiving) The immediate\neffect that objects have on us is to\ncause sensations. Sensations are always associated with a\nparticular organ of sense; they are always distinctly of, for\ninstance, touch or vision. Sensations are the feelings that are the\nimmediate mental causal consequences of the influence of objects on\nus. We become aware of the qualities of objects following the\nsensations that those objects cause. However, for Reid, the\nconceptions of objects that follow from our sensations are\nnot derived from our sensations since they do not\nbear any kind of resemblance to the qualities which cause\nthem. Awareness of sensations are not, for Reid, essential\nintermediaries for formation of perceptual beliefs. So what is the\nprecise relationship between sensory experiences and conceptual\ncontent? This is a delicate question for Reid since the directness of\nhis theory of perception depends upon advocacy of a physiologically\nand phenomenally real theory that accounts for our experience while\navoiding theoretical pitfalls that risk dragging his theory much\ncloser to a representational theory than Reid would like. \n\nAs we have often in this entry, we begin with historical context since\nReid's theory of the relation between sensations and qualities will\nappear stranger than it is without background. According to the Way of\nIdeas, ideas and images are mental representations in an individual's\nmind, and my perceptual awareness of a table depends upon my prior\nawareness of these ideas of sensation. This veil of perception is why\nadvocates of the Way of Ideas struggled to provide epistemic\njustification for beliefs about external, mind-independent, qualities\nof physical objects, and avoid skepticism. But besides the epistemic\nproblem, advocates of ideas faced a difficulty accounting for the\norigins of the contents of our very ideas of external\nobjects. Though not easy to appreciate, this problem it is quite\nimportant. \n\nReid argues that advocates of the Way of Ideas do not have a plausible\nsolution to this problem. Hume says bluntly that “[E]very simple\nidea has a simple impression, which resembles it”\n(Treatise 1.1.1.5, 3), which is a statement of what is known\nas the Copy Principle: ideas have the content that they do because\nthey are copies, and resemblances, of impressions. Think of a\ntable. For Hume, your thought of a table is derivative and copied from\na sensory impression that you have had of that very table. The\nexplanation of the content of the idea of that table thus concerns the\ncontents of your simple impression of the corresponding physical\ntable. The Copy Principle is an exceedingly powerful tool on behalf of\nthe Way of Ideas for a variety of reasons, but Reid is unimpressed\nwith the evidence on its behalf, especially as presented by Hume\nin Treatise. Reid's response to Hume leads to an argument,\nwhich we can call his ‘Sensory Deprivation Argument’. \n\nReid's Sensory Deprivation Argument proceeds as follows. First, Hume's\nstated justification for the Copy Principle is inductive: he\nchallenges people to find an idea that is not derived from a sensory\nimpression, after he says that it appears all his ideas are copied\nfrom sensory impressions. But that, says Reid, is an exceedingly weak\njustification (EAP 1.4, 23). Besides, Hume's claim that the principle\nis “certain” is mistaken because the argument he sets out\nfor the principle is inductive (IHM 5.7, 69–70, 75–6). After those\nground clearing moves, Reid begins the argument proper with a thought\nexperiment. Exhibiting affinities with Condillac's\nremarkable Treatise on Sensations (1754), Reid asks his\nreaders to imagine a blind adult subject. Not only has he lost his\nsight, but he has “lost all the experience, and habits, and\nnotions he had got by touch; [he lacks] the least conception of the\nexistence, figure, dimensions, or extension, either of his own body,\nor of any other; but to have all his knowledge of external things to\nacquire anew, by means of sensation, and the power of reason, which we\nsuppose to remain entire” (IHM 5.6, 65). Reid imagines\nintroducing this blind experimental subject to a number of tactile\nsensations, one by one, from the most simple to the most involved: a\nsingle pin prick in a split second of time; a blunt object pushed\nagainst a small surface area of skin; the same object pushed against\nskin over a period of time “with a force gradually increased\ntill it bruises him”; an object covering a large surface area of\nskin, applied over a period of time, and so on. Reid's emphasis on\ntactile sensations is important to understand: he uses this running\nexample because ideas of primary qualities are the most important for\ngaining knowledge of the world and are the ideas essential for any\nscience. \n \nOnce a handful of skin cells are stimulated for the briefest of\nmoments by a pin, the subject has received a sensory\nimpression—or in Reid's language, he has had a\nsensation—but, Reid argues, this does not equip the individual\nto formulate an idea of extension or figure, space or motion, all\nprimary qualities of the pin. He writes, “[The primary\nqualities] have no resemblance to any sensation, or to any operation\nof our minds; and, therefore, they cannot be ideas either of sensation\nor of reflection” (IHM 5.6, 67). For each subsequent iteration\nof tactile sensations, Reid argues that those sensations too are\nincapable of delivering to the subject ideas of extension, figure,\nspace or motion. His conclusion has two parts. First, the Way of\nIdeas's story about the relation between sensations and the\nintentional contents of conceptions is mistaken. Second, with an eye\ntoward developing his own theory of sensations, he writes, \n\nThe process by which sensations give rise to our conceptions of\nobjects is something Reid calls ‘suggestion’. Sensations in this\nprocess he calls ‘signs’. The qualities of objects are ‘suggested’ by\nour sensations when they function as signs, so when we have sensations\nwe come to be aware of those objects as possessing those qualities.\nBut what is suggestion supposed to be? The first thing to notice is\nthat the suggestion relation or the ‘sign-signified’ relation is\ncontingent. Whereas philosophers prefer necessities, Reid does not\nbelieve the messiness of the actual perceptual process contains any\nnecessity at this juncture. Second, suggestion is a pseudo-linguistic\nnotion for Reid. Signs suggest conceptions of that which they\nsignify. The word “dogs”, for instance, leads those who\nare familiar with the word to think of certain domesticated animals\nwho are also man's best friends. \n\nBut for those who already know the term, this does not happen by\nhearing the word “dogs” then deriving or inferring some\nobject that has some peculiar fitness to the word. The relation of\nsigns to things they signify in spoken and written language is almost\nalways arbitrary in the sense that there is no similarity between dogs\nand the word “dogs”. In this sense, “dogs” is\nan artificial or artifactual sign, for Reid, in\ncontrast to natural signs. Blushing signifies one of\na small number of mental states because blushing is caused by events\nof embarrassment, anger, or romantic stimulation. Blood rushing\nthrough the subcutaneous circulatory system in the face reliably\noccurs, across members of our species, in response to a small set of\nstimuli with apparent universality, making blushing a natural sign. We\ndiscover this relationship by observation and experience. \n \nHowever, according to Reid, a subset of natural signs lead us to think\nof what they signify without any prior experience. Members of\nthis category “which, though we never before had any notion or\nconception of the things signified, do suggest it, or conjure it up,\nas it were, by a natural kind of magic, and at once give us a\nconception, and create a belief of it” (IHM 5.3, 60). Put your\nhand on a table, pause and experience the sensation of hardness. This\ntactile sensation leads us immediately to conceive of that which\ncaused it as being hard, as having a certain resistive\nconstruction. But we are aware of the table's hardness, which caused\nthe sensation, automatically. We do not understand why it is that we\nthink of this special kind of physical constitution after having this\nkind of tactile sensation. Nonetheless, we must “conclude, that\nthis connection is the effect of our constitution, and ought to be\nconsidered as an original principle of human nature” (IHM 5.3,\n61). This is the defining feature of the kind of natural signs of\nwhich the tactile sensation of hardness is an instance: these signs\nlead us to conceive of what they signify simply because we are built\nin such a way as to have such conceptions on encountering such\nsigns. Reid's approach to this relationship contrasts sharply with\nthat taken by most advocates of the Way of Ideas, who attempted to\nposit a strong relationship between ideas of sensation and qualities\nof physical objects. \n\nPlacing my hand on a table, my tactile sensation immediately leads my\nmind to a conception or apprehension that I am touching a hard\nobject. When does one's conception of an object as having a particular\nquality amount to a perception, a conception accompanied by a\nconviction of its accuracy? The answer is: when one comes to have that\nconception because one has encountered a natural sign which leads one\nto the conception, and that natural sign leads one to the conception\nmerely because of one's constitution. Conviction in the accuracy of a\nconception is bestowed on the conception, Reid thinks, just when the\nrelevant conception comes about because of our nature or\nconstitution. When we conceive of an object in a particular way merely\nbecause it is in our nature to conceive of the object that way, then\nthe conception is non-optional, unavoidable, and is thus one that we\ncannot help but trust. Perceptions, then, are dictates of common\nsense: to be aware of an object in perception is to have a belief\nwhich you cannot give up given your constitution. \n\nReid believes that our minds come to be connected to the\nmind-independent world in something like the way that we come to grasp\nobjects through a language designed for the purpose. However, when we\ncome to be aware of objects through our senses, we do so by utilizing\nsomething like a language embedded in our constitutions: our\nsensations function like a language that nature has constructed. While\nit is in a sense only a metaphor to say that we know about the world\nbecause the world speaks to us, it is a metaphor that illuminates the\nfacts as Reid sees them. \n\nIntertwined with Reid's arguments that we can be immediately aware of\nobjects through their relational properties—such as their\napparent magnitudes—are Reid's arguments regarding the\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities. As we would\nexpect, Reid approaches this distinction as a scientist of the mind\nrather than as a metaphysician, and, as we would also expect, Reid's\nentrance into this terrain is paved with references to earlier\nthinkers. \n \nLocke thought that our ideas of “primary\nqualities”—shapes, sizes, motions, textures and physical\nconstruction—resemble the qualities which cause them. However,\naccording to Locke, our ideas of a variety of other\nqualities—colors, sounds, tastes and smells—do not. Ideas\nof colors, sounds, tastes and smells, or “secondary\nqualities,” are caused by certain complex configurations of\nprimary qualities that bear no resemblance to the ideas which they\ncause. Reid is deeply struck by Berkeley's attack on this distinction\nat Principles of Human Knowledge 1.9–15. He agrees\nwith Berkeley that no mental state or object could possibly resemble\nanything that is not, itself, a mental state or object. In Berkeley's\nfamous words, “An idea can be like nothing but an idea”\n(Principles of Human Knowledge 1.8). Mental states and\nobjects have only mental properties, but only something that is,\nitself, a mental state or object can have a mental property. Hence,\nnothing can resemble—that is, share a property in common\nwith—a mental state or object other than another mental state or\nobject. Berkeley took this point to show\nthat no non-mental cause of an idea could resemble\nit, whether the relevant idea were an idea of a shape or a\ncolor. Berkeley concludes that Locke's distinction between primary and\nsecondary qualities is a grand mistake. \n\nReid accepts, for roughly Berkeley's reasons, that sensations cannot\npossibly resemble their causes—a fact that Reid deploys in his\nSensory Deprivation Argument discussed above. Further, he accepts\nBerkeley's objections to Locke, and takes them to show that no mental\nevents or states, whether sensations or the conceptions of objects\nthat follow them, could possibly resemble any non-mental\nobject. Another reason that Reid cannot draw the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities in the way that Locke did is that he\ndenies that conceptions of objects which we have following sensory\nexperiences are to be analyzed as perceptions of ideas. Instead, these\nconceptions function to make us aware of qualities in objects that\ncaused the sensations. All of this would make it seem that Reid would\nsimply side with Berkeley and deny that there is any important\ndifference between primary qualities and qualities like colors,\nsounds, tastes and smells. Instead, Reid defends the distinction\nbetween primary and secondary qualities on grounds quite different\nfrom Locke's, grounds that he takes to be immune to Berkeley's\ncriticisms of the distinction. \n\nReid accepts that the qualities which we ordinarily conceive objects\nto have—whether shapes, sizes and motions, on the one hand, or\ncolors, sounds, tastes and smells, on the other—are genuinely\npossessed by those objects (barring illusions and disorders of various\nsorts, which are, incidentally, difficult for any direct theory of\nperception like Reid's to explain). He thinks that shapes, sizes and\nmotions are intrinsic properties of objects while colors, sounds,\ntastes and smells are relational properties of objects. But neither\nsecondary nor primary qualities resemble the sensory experiences that\nthey immediately cause in us. Colors, sounds, tastes and smells are\npowers to produce certain characteristic sensations in us in normal\nconditions. To believe that a rose has an agreeable smell or a red\ncolor is not to perceive any intrinsic qualities of the object, but\nis, rather, to perceive that the object bears a certain relation to\nsomething else—our minds. Reid writes, \n\nPhysical structures of the rose in front of me—the anther in the\nrose's stamen—produce pollen, which has a certain molecular\ncomposition that results in my sensation of its odor. Other molecules\nin the petals of the rose reflect light at a certain wavelength which\nin turn causes in me a certain characteristic visual sensation of\nred. If I am speaking correctly when I say “That rose smells\ngood”, I am reporting the fact that I conceive of the rose as\npossessing a particular relational property: I am aware that the rose\nhas the property of\nbeing-such-as-to-cause-in-me-sensations-of-a-sweet-smelling-odor. Ultimately,\nthe rose possesses this relational property because of facts about its\nmolecular structure that account for its producing this odor in a\ncertain way, and facts about me that account for the fact\nthat these pollen molecules enter my nasal cavity, eventually reaching\nthe olfactory bulb, and cause certain sensations in my mind. But when\nI am aware of the odor of the rose, I am aware of none of that; I am\naware only of the fact that there is something about the rose that\nmakes it cause in me certain sensations in normal conditions.  \n\nOur conceptions of qualities such as smells and colors are to be\ncontrasted with our conceptions of primary qualities or configurations\nof primary qualities, such as hardness. Say I'm holding the rose's\nstem in my hand while I'm looking at it. I am having two importantly\ndifferent sensations: a visual sensation of red, and a tactile\nsensation of hardness. For Reid, neither sensation resembles anything\nin the object; both give rise to conceptions of the object as\npossessing certain properties. The visual sensation gives rise to a\nconception of the object as possessing a particular relational\nproperty: its power to produce certain sensations in me in normal\nconditions. The tactile sensation gives rise to a conception of the\nrose's stem as possessing a particular intrinsic property: the complex\nconfiguration of primary qualities that is hardness. \n\nFor both Locke and Reid, we are aware of objects as they are\nintrinsically only when our awareness is caused by the primary\nqualities of objects. But for Reid, and not for Locke, we are\ngenuinely aware of objects as they are when our awareness results from\nthe secondary qualities of objects; but we are aware of those objects\nonly as they are relative to us, and not as they\nare in themselves. \n\n“When a primary quality is perceived, the sensation immediately\nleads our thought to the quality signified by it, and is itself\nforgot.” (EIP 2.17, 204) \n\n“[T]here appears to be a real foundation for the distinction;\nand it is this—that our senses give us a direct and a distinct\nnotion of the primary qualities, and inform us what they are in\nthemselves. But of the secondary qualities, our senses give us only a\nrelative and obscure notion. They inform us only, that they are\nqualities that affect us in a certain manner—that is, produce in\nus a certain sensation; but as to what they are in themselves, our\nsenses leave us in the dark.” (EIP 2.17, 201) \n\n“[T]he sensations belonging to secondary qualities are an object\nof our attention, while those which belong to the primary are\nnot.” (EIP 2.17, 204) \n\nSecondary and primary qualities are characterized by their relations\nto the mind perceiving them and to the physical qualities in objects\nthat they signify. Primary qualities stand out as qualities of which\nwe have “direct” and “distinct” notions. This\nis not so for secondary qualities. To return to Reid's rose, he writes\nof the smell of the rose that \n\nReid does defend a primary/secondary quality distinction, but,\nunusually, Reid's distinction is drawn not in metaphysical terms but\nin epistemic terms premised upon discussion of the differing\nways that secondary and primary qualities relate to our minds (Nichols\n2007, ch. 6). \n \nAn important note at this juncture is that Reid very infrequently uses\ncontemporary epistemological terms such as “knowledge”,\n“rational”, or “justified”, and even when he\ndoes, he does not offer necessary and sufficient conditions for their\ndefinition. Reid says above that sensations caused by primary\nqualities “inform us” of the qualities in the objects that\ncaused them. One ought not look to Reid's epistemology for a detailed\nformal apparatus clearly identifying his externalism about\njustification, for example, even though he can be credited with\nbringing what we now call externalism about justification into Early\nModern philosophy. \n\nWe are now in a position to understand the force of Reid's most\nimportant response to any argument purporting to show that the\nexternal world either might not exist, or might not be anything like\nthe way we take it to be. In one canonical statement of his position,\nReid says, \n\nThe mistake that the skeptic makes, according to Reid, is to deny the\ntruth of something that is demanded by our constitutions. To perceive\nan object as possessing a particular property is to have a conception\nof the object delivered by one's constitution. What makes us convinced\nof the accuracy of the conceptions of objects involved in perception\nis that they arise from our constitutions. But, asks Reid here, why do\nwe find skeptical arguments so compelling? Why would someone sincerely\naccept the radical skeptical conclusions following from Descartes's\nhypothesis of the evil demon? \n \nUltimately, we think that such arguments lead to their conclusions\nbecause we accept certain logical principles—such as the law of\nnon-contradiction, or modus ponens—which appear to us to be\nself-evident. But to say that such principles are self-evident is just\nto say that we cannot help but accept them. It is not to offer any\nnon-circular justification of those principles. But the\nirresistibility of a belief is a very good indicator, Reid thinks,\nthat we hold that belief merely because of the way we are built,\nmerely because of our constitution. But then the skeptic has merely\nplaced the skeptical conclusion on the same footing as the common\nsense belief about the external world: both rest on something that we\nare compelled to believe by our constitutions. However, in order to\noverthrow common sense, the skeptic must place the skeptical\nconclusion, rather, on a firmer footing than the common\nsense conclusion. Thus, the skeptic gives us no reason to reject\ncommon sense beliefs about the external world. Reid has defended\ncommon sense through construction of a direct theory of perception\nthat avoids the pitfalls of the Way of Ideas' representational\ntheory. Rather than landing in the “coal pit” of\nskepticism, as Reid calls it, his theory purports to deliver knowledge\nof the external world. \n\nReid develops his account of causation in light of Hume's account. As\nReid sees it, Hume starts with the assumption that if we are to learn\nwhat causation is, we must first determine from what aspect of our\nsensory experience the concept of causation is derived. Hume would put\nthe point in terms of the Way of Ideas as follows: we must determine\nfrom what impression our idea of causation is copied. However, Hume\nbelieved he had discovered that there is nothing in our sensory\nexperience corresponding to our ordinary notion of the causal\nrelation. In an inversion of the empiricist method attributed to Reid\nabove, Hume believed that causes necessitate their effects,\nthen he followed this commitment by arguing that we lack sensory\nawareness of this necessitation. We see the first billiard ball hit\nthe second. We see the second move. We do not see the movement of the\nfirst assure, or necessitate, the movement of the second. So\nHume concludes that causation must be something different from what we\ntake it to be ordinarily.  \n\nBut what is it? To answer this question, we must determine from what\nsensory experiences we derive the idea of causation. It turns out, as\nReid reads Hume, that the sensory experiences that give rise to our\nidea of causation are sensory experiences of what Hume\ncalls constant conjunction. The heating of the water is\nregularly followed by the water's boiling. To say that the one event\ncauses the other is just to say that the two events always co-occur,\nor that there is a brute law linking them. This is not to say that the\nfirst event necessitates the second. The necessitation that we\nordinarily take to be involved in causation is not in the world; it is\nin our heads as an expectation arising due to previous experience. \n \nReid accepts much of the negative side of Hume's view of causation\nwhile rejecting Hume's assertions of the import of those negative\ndiscoveries. Reid agrees, that is, that we have no sensory experience\nof the necessitation of an effect by its cause. But this does not\nimply our ordinary concept of causation is mistaken. Instead, Reid\nthinks, the concept of causation is not an idea copied from a sensory\nimpression in the first place. Reid's complex thoughts here are tied\nto perception and the role of sensations in\nperception. (See 3.2 Reid's Arguments Against\nRepresentationalism, above.) For him, sensations never bear\nresemblance to the qualities they help us to perceive. It is hardly a\nsurprise, then, that the sensory experiences from which our thoughts\nabout causation spring bear no resemblance to the causal relation. But\nthis fact no more undermines our concept of causation than the lack of\nresemblance between our sensory experiences of ordinary physical\nobjects and those objects themselves undermines our thoughts about\nsuch objects. Like our thoughts about objects, our thoughts about the\ncausal relation are genuinely about the causal relation, despite the\nfact that the sensations from which those thoughts spring, i.e.the\nsensations of the relation of constant conjunction, bear no\nresemblance to the relation they lead us to think about. We have no\nsensations resembling necessitation, and, yet, causes necessitate\ntheir effects. \n\nHowever, Reid also offers criticisms of Hume's view of causation that\ncan be accepted independently of the Reidian view of perception and\nsensation. Two of his most influential criticisms are of Hume's view\nthat our ordinary concept of causation is reducible to the relation of\nconstant conjunction. \n \nOf the first he writes, “[I]t would follow from [Hume's\ndefinition of causation], that whatever was singular in its nature, or\nthe first thing of its kind, could have no cause” (EAP 4.9,\n250). Reid's point is that if the relation of causation is really that\nof constant conjunction, then the first time that two types of event\nare conjoined, the first cannot be the cause of the second. If there\nis no history of conjunction, there is no causation. It would seem to\nfollow from Hume's definition, for instance, that if an earthquake\nrazes Mexico City, and no earthquake has ever done so before, then the\nearthquake is not, in fact, the cause of the city's fall, an absurd\nimplication. This objection might not show Hume's theory is\nmistaken—we omit consideration of it further here—but it\ndoes pose a question with which any Humean must wrestle: Which\nconstant conjunctions are the genuine ones on the basis of which the\ncausal relation can be said to hold, and which are not? The more\nspecifically any two events are described, the more likely that there\nwill be no history of conjunction of the relevant sorts of events. But\nwhat degree of specificity or generality in description is the right\ndegree? \n\nThe problem is made clearer by Reid's second objection to Hume's\nanalysis of causation and constant conjunction. He writes, “It\nfollows from [Hume's] definition of a cause, that night is the cause\nof day, and day the cause of night. For no two things have more\nconstantly followed each other since the beginning of the world”\n(EAP 4.9, 249). Since we don't ordinarily think that day is the cause\nof night, or vice versa, Hume must deny that the two are actually\nconstantly conjoined, or, rather, he must insist that the constant\nconjunction between the two of them is not of the right sort for the\nrelation between them to be one of causation. Hume thinks that there\nis causation between two events just in case there is a law linking\nthem and also thinks that there is a law linking two events just in\ncase they are constantly conjoined. Reid's first objection\nshows that it is not the case that wherever there is no constant\nconjunction there is no law. His second objection shows that\nit is not the case that wherever there is constant conjunction there\nis a law. Constant conjunction is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nthe presence of a genuine law. The hard problem that remains for the\nHumean, then, is to produce criteria for distinguishing genuine laws\nfrom regularities that are not laws at all. \n \nThese criticisms lead Reid to hold that there is a legitimate causal\nrelation between two events whenever the two are conjoined by a law of\nnature, even if laws of nature do not simply amount to constant\nconjunctions. He uses the term physical causation to refer to\nthe relation that holds between two events just in case they are\nconjoined by natural law. He takes the discovery of the physical\ncauses of phenomena to be central both to the sciences and to ordinary\nlife (see IHM 6.12, 122; EAP 1.5, 28–9; EAP 4.3, 211–2). But he also\nholds that genuine causation, what he calls efficient\ncausation, is not reducible to physical causation. The reason is\nthat, for him, a law of nature is not a brute conjunction between\nevents. Rather, it is a regularity in the behavior of the efficient\ncause of observed phenomena. Consistent with remarks above\n(see 1.2 Newtonianism and Empiricism), Reid\nwrites, \n\nIt is a law that unsupported objects close to the earth will\nfall. What this means, Reid thinks, is that the physical cause of the\nfall of an object regularly causes objects to fall when they are\nunsupported. Physical causation, for him, is parasitic upon the more\nbasic kind of causation, namely efficient causation. But what is\nefficient causation? Reid writes, “In the strict and proper\nsense, I take an efficient cause to be a being who had power to\nproduce the effect, and exerted that power for that purpose”\n(Letter to James Gregory, in Correspondence 174). Efficient\ncausation is necessitation of the sort that Hume thought not to\nexist. To efficiently cause an event is to be capable of seeing to it\nthat the event occurs, and to make an effort to see to it that it\ndoes. Thus, at the bottom of Reid's theory of causation are his\nnotions of power and exertion. \n\nReid is clear that power is not the sort of thing that admits\nof a logical definition. We cannot reduce it to some set of simpler\nqualities. However, this doesn't mean that we can't say anything about\nwhat power is. On the contrary, Reid makes a variety of claims about\npower. Importantly, he claims that power is the quality that, when\ncoupled with exertion, necessitates a particular effect. Taking a cue\nfrom ordinary language, he holds that it is a contradiction to say\nthat an entity has the power to do something, and exerts that power,\nand yet the effect fails to come about. If the effect fails to come\nabout when the entity exerts itself, we might say, what that shows is\nthat the entity only seemed, but didn't actually, have the power to\nbring about the effect. Reid also claims that any agent who has the\npower to do something also has three other inter-related powers: the\npower not to do the thing, the power to try to do that thing\n(that is, the power to exert his power to do the thing), and the\npower not to try to do that thing. He claims further that any\nagent who has the power to do something must believe himself to have\nthat power. \n \nAny one of these claims can be questioned, even if Reid is right that\nthey are embedded in our ordinary concept of power. Take, for\ninstance, the claim that an agent who has the power to do something\nalso has the power not to do it. Locke offers the following example,\nwhich seems to be a counterexample to this claim: \n\nThe man in Locke's example seems to have the power to stay in the\nroom, while lacking the power not to stay. Reid would probably deny\nthat Locke's prisoner actually has the power to stay in the room, and\nthere is some intuitive force to this view. The man, it seems, is in\nthe hands of forces outside of his control. For Reid, what is in a\nperson's power and what is ‘up to’ him or her are the same. Since it\nis not up to the man whether he stays (even if he thinks it is), it is\nnot in his power to stay. \n\nReid endorses the idea that what is in our power is just what is up to\nus. He claims that the only entities that can have power are entities\nwith minds. That is, sticks and stones are never invested with power,\nand are not, therefore, ever the efficient causes of any events. The\nearthquake might be the physical cause of the fall of the city, but it\nis not the efficient cause, Reid thinks, because it does not have a\nmind. Since it is not up to the earthquake whether or not the city\nfalls, the earthquake lacks the power to raze the city. Reid offers\nvarious reasons for thinking that wherever there is power there is a\nmind. One of the most compelling is expressed in the following\npassage: \n\nReid's idea is that the only conception we can have of the exertion of\npower is of that distinctive sort of mental effort in which we engage\nwhen we will to do something. Since he holds that the power to act is\nalways accompanied with the power to exert that power, it follows that\nthe only entities that can have power are those who are capable of\nengaging in the peculiar sort of mental effort with which we are all\nfamiliar from our own case. But then it follows that the only entities\nthat can have power are those with minds. When coupled with the claim,\nthat Reid also makes, that every event is efficiently caused, it\nfollows that every event in nature is directed towards an end;\neverything that happens is chosen to occur. In fact, Reid holds that\nall and only our free actions are those events of which we are the\nefficient causes. An agent who has the power to bring about a\nparticular action is said, by Reid, to have ‘moral liberty’. \n\nThere is a puzzle that one encounters when trying to make sense of\nReid's notion of power and which sheds some light on Reid's concept of\nmoral liberty. The puzzle is this: Say that I have the power to do a\ncartwheel. According to Reid it follows that if I exert my power and\nthereby do a cartwheel, then I will be the efficient cause of my\ncartwheel. Imagine that I do this and imagine that every event is\nefficiently caused. Is my exertion of my power to do the cartwheel an\nevent? If so, then it must have an efficient cause. Am I the efficient\ncause of the exertion? If not, then it doesn't seem that my cartwheel\nis a free action. After all, if I'm not the efficient cause of the\nexertion, then it wasn't up to me whether or not I tried to do the\ncartwheel, and it seems to follow that it wasn't up to me whether or\nnot I did it. So, Reid seems forced to say that I am the efficient\ncause of the exertion to do the cartwheel. But then it follows from\nthe definition of efficient causation that I exerted my power to exert\nmyself to do the cartwheel. And, therefore, we can ask if I am the\nefficient cause of my exertion to exert myself to do the cartwheel. If\nnot, then I didn't do the cartwheel freely; if so, then we will find\nourselves having to ask about the efficient cause of the exertion to\nexert my power to exert. In short, Reid's views of power, efficient\ncausation and moral liberty appear to be inconsistent with one\nanother. \n\nThe way out of the puzzle is to see that the relation between an agent\nand the event he or she efficiently causes is not the same as the\nrelation between the agent and her exertion of power. Trying, on this\nview, is not something that an agent does in order to do something\nelse; it is not a separate action on the way to performing another\nact. If I am going to build a birdhouse, I first have to buy\nnails. Buying nails is a distinct act from building the birdhouse that\nmust be done on the way to building the birdhouse. But trying\nto buy the nails is not distinct from buying them in the way that\nbuying them is distinct from building the birdhouse. If I manage to\nbuy the nails, I haven't done two things, buy them and try to, but\nonly one. But if I manage to build the birdhouse, then I did do two\nthings: buy the nails, and build the birdhouse. So, there is something\nwrongheaded about even asking whether the agent is the efficient cause\nof the exertion of power. The agent is the efficient cause of the act,\nand there is no separate act, the exertion, of which he or she needs\nto be the efficient cause in order to have acted freely. \n\nIt is on the basis of this, or some other closely related line of\nthought, that Reid is often described as having an ‘agent causal’\ntheory of freedom. Agent-causation is the kind of causation that\noccurs when an object or agent, rather than an event, causes a\nchange. Many people believe that there is no agent-causation. They\nhold that there are only causal relations between events, and every\ncase of apparent agent-causation is merely apparent; every such case\nis actually a veiled case of event-causation. Philosophers who hold\nthat free human actions require that certain events be agent-caused,\nand also believe that some human actions are free, hold that there are\nsome events that are caused by agents but not by any events; they hold\nthat there is a basic causal relation between agents and events that\nis instantiated every time a person acts freely. Given that, for Reid,\nthe relation between an agent and the action of which the agent is the\nefficient cause must be a basic causal relation—it does not\nconsist, not even in part, in some further distinct relation between\nthe agent and the exertion of power—it follows that Reid holds\nan agent-causal view of free action. \n\nWhy should we believe that human beings have moral liberty, i.e. why\nshould we think that we are endowed with power to produce our actions?\nWe have reason to think that we are not the efficient causes of our\nown behavior. Our actions seem to come about according to\npsychological laws linking them to prior motives for action. Jealous,\ngenerous, prideful and benevolent motives lead in apparently law-like\nways to various characteristic behaviors. If it is a fact that our\nconduct comes about according to laws, then it seems that the author\nof the laws, if there is one, is the real author of our actions.  \n \nReid denies that there are laws linking motives with behavior, or in\nhis terms he denies that motives are the physical causes of action. He\noffers a variety of fascinating arguments for this claim. The most\nimportant of these arguments is summarized quite clearly in Reid's\ncorrespondence, and presented at greater length in Essays on the\nActive Powers 4.4. In the correspondence he writes:  \n\nReid assumes that anybody who holds that there is a law linking\nmotives and behaviors will thereby accept the claim that human beings\nalways act on the strongest of their motives. However, Reid claims\nthat there are various ways in which the notion of the strongest\nmotive can be defined—there are various measures of\nstrength of motive—and depending which definition is employed we\nfind that it is either false or trivial and uninformative to say that\npeople always act on the strongest motive. \n\nReid identifies three particularly important senses in which the\nstrength of a motive can be measured: by, to use his terms, its\n‘prevalence’, its ‘animal strength’, or its ‘rational\nstrength’. According to the view that associates strength with\nprevalence, the strongest motive is just the motive on which the agent\nacts. Under this view, there is no way of assessing the strength of\nmotives prior to seeing what the agent does. The animal strength of a\nmotive is the degree to which it is felt, the degree to which the\nagent might be said to have an urge for its object. The\nrational strength of a motive is the degree to which the act it\ndictates is judged to be worthwhile by the agent.  \n\nAs Reid puts the point in the above quotation, the claim that people\nalways act on their strongest motive when strength is associated with\nprevalence is ‘an identical proposition.’ It is true but trivial, and\nit fails to show that people are not the efficient causes of their own\nbehavior. After all, under the view of strength as prevalence, the\nterm ‘strongest motive’ can be replaced with the term ‘the motive on\nwhich the agent acts’ and thus ‘People always act on their strongest\nmotive’ becomes ‘People always act on the motive on which they\nact’. True, but hardly the sort of truth from which anything\ninteresting follows.  \n\nOn the other hand, under either the view that the strongest motive is\nthe strongest animal motive, or the view that the strongest motive is\nthe strongest rational motive, it is false that people always act on\nthe strongest motive, thinks Reid. People sometimes do what they judge\nto be right, even though they have a much stronger urge to do\nsomething else. And people sometimes give in to their urges, contrary\nto their better judgment. Both of these claims can be questioned. We\nmight say, for instance, that people who act as dictated by their\njudgment actually have an urge to do so, an urge that counterbalances\ntheir urge to do otherwise. And, we might say that people who act on\ntheir urges, and counter to their best judgment, don't actually judge\nthe alternative to be better, but do so only in some watered-down\nsense. Notice, however, that anyone who objects to Reid on either of\nthese two grounds seems to already accept that people always act on\nthe strongest of their motives in one sense or another. It is that\nprior acceptance that motivates the objection. Reid, by contrast,\ntakes the facts that we sometimes act as dictated by our urges,\nsometimes as dictated by our judgments, to be a prior fact that any\ntheory must account for, rather than a consequence of a theory of\nmotivation. Hence, he takes any theory that does not allow for these\nconsequences to be flawed, and takes himself to have shown that there\nis no satisfactory sense in which people always act on the strongest\nof their motives.  \n\nReid's argument does not decisively settle the question of whether or\nnot human conduct comes about in accordance with laws linking it to\nprior motives. Rather, what he has shown is that we cannot accept the\nclaim that human conduct is law governed through simple reflection\nfrom the armchair. We do need to do careful conceptual work in order\nto provide a non-trivial definition of strength that is different from\neither the animal or rational definitions; but we also need to do\ncareful empirical work in behavioral psychology in order to determine\nif people do, indeed, always act on the strongest of motives in the\nsense of strength that we develop. His argument, then, makes a\ncontribution to the question of whether or not people are the\nefficient causes of their own behavior by posing a further, and\ndifficult problem for those, like Hume, who deny it on the grounds\nthat our behavior is law-governed. \n\nReid does not rest content to defend the claim that human beings are\nthe efficient causes of their own behavior by responding to the best\nobjections to it; he also provides three positive arguments for the\nclaim which he labels the ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third argument for\nmoral liberty’. (The arguments appear in Essays on the Active\nPowers 4.6–8.) \n\nThe first argument for moral liberty parallels Reid's response to\nexternal world skepticism (see 3.5 Responding to\nSkepticism about the External World, above). Reid claims that the\nbelief that we are endowed with power to produce our own actions is a\nfirst principle and then employs his general form of defense of first\nprinciples in order to argue that it must be so. We naturally and\nnon-inferentially believe ourselves to be endowed with power since\nvarious activities in which we engage would make no sense if we did\nnot believe ourselves to be endowed with power. For instance, he\nclaims that the activity of deliberating, of weighing reasons for and\nagainst various possible actions, proceeds under the assumption that\nwe have power; if we didn't believe that, he thinks, then we would not\nbother deliberating. \n\nWhat gives Reid's claim appeal is the fact that when we deliberate we\nthink that what we are deliberating about is up to us, and for Reid,\nwhat is up to us is identical to what is in our power. However, it's\nnot clear that we have to think of actions as being in our power in\norder to be motivated to deliberate; the thought that our actions are\n‘up to us’, a thought which is undeniably involved in deliberation,\nmight be understood in some way which does not presuppose power. For\ninstance, in thinking that what we do is ‘up to us’, we might just be\nthinking that if we're sufficiently motivated to do it, we will. By\nway of example, note that it's generally true that people who\ndeliberate before they act do things that are more in their interests\nthan those who simply act impulsively, without deliberation. Hence, if\nyou are motivated to avoid impulsive action, that motive might lead\nyou to deliberate, and your deliberation might, in turn, lead you to\ndo something better than you would have done had you not\ndeliberated. It is not clear that a person who was motivated to\ndeliberate for this reason would be presuming himself or herself to be\nendowed with power in Reid's sense. Such a person might think merely\nthat deliberation will produce motives that happen to give rise, for\nreasons entirely out of the agent's control, to better actions. In\nshort, if we think of deliberation as motivated action, and if we can\nimagine a person being motivated to engage in it even in the absence\nof the belief that he or she is endowed with power, then Reid is\nwrong. \n\nStill, it is quite possible that Reid is right. The question turns on\nwhether or not it is possible to provide an adequate picture of the\npsychology of deliberation without appeal to the belief that we are\nendowed with power. What the first argument from moral liberty serves\nto do is not to silence the opposition, but instead to force the\nopposition not to oversimplify the phenomena. Those who deny that\nhuman beings are endowed with power in Reid's sense need to explain\nwhat we are thinking when we deliberate. That explanation must not\ngloss over the complexity of ordinary deliberation, but also must not\nshow us to be thinking ourselves to be endowed with power in Reid's\nsense whenever we deliberate about what to do (see Yaffe 2004,\nch. 1). \n\nIn the second argument for moral liberty, Reid claims that none of our\nmoral practices—our practices of holding ourselves and others\naccountable for their behavior—would make any sense if we did\nnot believe ourselves and others to be endowed with power over\nconduct. He claims, in short, that the very concept of a morally\naccountable being presupposes that that being has power over his\nconduct. Since we are, he thinks, morally accountable beings, it\nfollows that we are endowed with power over our conduct. \n\nThe first argument for moral liberty depends upon the inadequacy of\nany account of deliberation that leaves out the belief that our\nconduct is in our power. So the second depends upon the inadequacy of\nany account of what makes a person morally accountable that does not\ninclude the power to control action. Someone who wished to deny that\nhuman beings have power over their conduct, but are still morally\naccountable, might note, for instance, that one of the primary\npurposes of certain forms of punishment, most notably imprisonment, is\nto prevent the offender from acting similarly in the future. However,\nsuch a purpose does not presuppose that the person has power over his\nor her conduct. If the thief is going to steal again, then that's\nreason enough to imprison him, we might say. This is so even if he is\ngoing to steal only because his desires will inevitably give rise to\nsuch behavior and not because he has power that he is resolved to\nexercise objectionably in the future. Reid's second argument for moral\nliberty fails if purposes of this sort exhaust the purposes of\npunishment. The second argument turns, that is, on a retributivist\nconception of punishment—a conception according to which a\npunishment is appropriate only if it is deserved—and a\nfurther claim to the effect that a punishment is never deserved in the\nretributivist's sense if the crime was not efficiently caused by the\nagent to whom the punishment is issued. It remains an open question\nwhether or not a retributivist conception of punishment could be\ncoherently married to a view that denies that human beings are endowed\nwith power. Reid's second argument for moral liberty raises this\nquestion in a powerful form. \n\nIn the third argument for moral liberty, which is the most obscure of\nthe three, Reid claims that a person could not engage in planned\nconduct if not endowed with power. Since it's obvious, he thinks, that\nwe do engage in planned conduct, it follows that we must have power\nover our actions. Reid links the third argument for moral liberty with\nthe argument from design for God's existence. According to the\nargument from design, God must exist since the world is so complex,\nand yet so orderly, that there must have been an all-powerful,\nall-knowing being who designed it and made it according to\nplan. Similarly, Reid argues, planned conduct is at once so\ncomplicated and so orderly that there must have been some author of\nit. He then claims that since it is obvious that we think up our own\nplans, we must also execute them. So, he thinks, we must be endowed\nwith power (see Hatcher 2013). \n\nThere is room to object not just to the third argument, but also to\nthe argument from design, by noting that ordered complexity can arise\nthrough mechanisms other than a guiding hand. Most of us think, for\ninstance, that the mechanisms of natural selection result in the\nproduction of enormously complicated and yet ordered biological\nstructures, like the human eye. If natural selection is causally\nresponsible for the human eye, then there is no designer of these\nstructures who efficiently caused them. We don't need power, in Reid's\nsense, in order to execute our plans; we just need to be the sorts of\ncreatures whose minds are hooked up to their bodies in such a way that\nthey do what they plan. It could be, that is, that by forming plans we\nengage powers that are not our own by engaging laws linking plans with\nexecution, laws of which we are not the authors. \n\nThis is a powerful objection, but it is not the end of the\ndebate. Notice that someone who rejects the argument from design is\nlikely to think both that there is no efficient cause of the complex\norder which we encounter in nature, and that nobody planned\nthe order that we find. But there is no doubt that when a person, say,\nbuilds a house that there was somebody who formed the plan to build\nthe house. The question is whether or not that person must have had\nthe power to build it in order to bring the plan to fruition. Reid's\npoint is that our attribution of the wisdom to form the plan goes\nhand-in-hand with the attribution of the power to execute it. We might\nthink that nobody was either wise enough or powerful enough to create\nthe world; but if we do think someone was wise enough, then we must\nalso think that person powerful enough. In the case of planned\nconduct, we know that there is a person wise enough—namely the\nperson whose plan it was—so surely we must also think that\nperson powerful enough. As he puts the point: \n\nEven this point—that where there's wisdom there's\npower—can be questioned, but there is surely something right\nabout it. Traits of character, of which wisdom is an example, are both\ncognitive and volitional: we think of a person who has one as both\ncapable of understanding things, and of doing them. To be wise isn't\njust to know how to do something, but also to be able to do it. So,\nwhen we ascribe someone with the intelligence to think up a complex\nplan, and on those grounds take the person to be wise, we are also\ntaking the person to have the power to execute the plan. This is the\nidea that drives Reid's third argument for moral liberty. \n\nNone of Reid's arguments for moral liberty are decisive. Each,\nhowever, lays bare a manner in which the notion of power is naturally\nconstrued to be implicated in our ordinary beliefs and our ordinary\npractices. While it remains possible that what is implicated is\nactually something less, something that can be described and explained\nwithout appeal to Reid's very strong notion of power, Reid's arguments\nnonetheless make clear what an account of human agency that does\nwithout power would need to account for if it is to be\nsatisfactory. (For Reid on causation and free will, see Yaffe\n2004.) \n\nReid constructs a theory of personal identity in opposition to Locke's\naccount, which appeals to psychological continuity as a necessary\ncondition for sameness of person over time. Reid argues that Locke has\nmisunderstood the relationship between consciousness and memory. Reid\ndevelops a direct theory of memory according to which the objects of\nmemory are events in the past, not mental representations. Reid\nattempts to provide sufficient continuity of the self through time to\nground sameness of person without lapsing into Humean skepticism about\nthe self. \n\nConsistent with Reid's faculty psychology, memory is a faculty of its\nown and it takes a unique set of objects. Just as the faculty of\nperception takes as its objects mind-independent bodies, the faculty\nof memory takes as its objects events in the past. Reid develops this\ninto a direct theory of memory akin to his direct theory of\nperception, and in contrast to the Ideal Theory and account of memory\n(Copenhaver 2006). \n\nThe objects of memory are events in the past. Just like perceptions,\nmemories are accompanied by their own phenomenology and sensory\nexperience. When one remembers hitting a game-winning serve in a\nvolleyball match, one may experience memory-images of the court and\nfeelings of triumph. However, the imagery and emotion accompanying the\nmemory are not identical to the memory. To suggest that they are\nidentical to the memory is to confuse the psychological means by which\nthe memory occurs with the content of the memory belief. In Reid's day\nthe theory of memory endorsed by proponents of the Theory of Ideas\nmade a similar confusion, in his opinion, by claiming that memories\nare mental events in which a past idea is compared to a present\nidea. According to Reid, these philosophers confused the act of\nremembering with the thing remembered (see EIP 3.1). \n\nThe direct theory distinguishes personal memory from factual memory\n(Hamilton 2003). “I remember hitting the winning serve” is\nan example of personal memory, which does not take form as a\npropositional attitude. Those memories that do take form as\npropositional attitudes, e.g. “I remember that I hit the winning\nserve,” are not necessarily personal memories. This is because I\nmay remember hitting the winning serve only because my best friend has\nreminded me of that over the years. In that case my memory is not\nknown directly by virtue of the fact that I have not thought in the\nfirst-person of an event in my past; instead, this memory arises\nthrough inference from testimony. \n\nReid's advocacy of a direct theory of memory requires a commitment to\nthe claim that memories take past events as their objects, which\ncontrasts with Locke's theory. Reid explains this contrast with an\nexample having to do with the fact that, yesterday, he has smelled a\ncertain rose, and that, today, he remembers smelling the rose's\nfragrance: \n\nPersonal memories are present-tense mental states with first-person\nperspective that take past events as intentional objects. \n\nTo clarify the epistemology of memory, Reid distinguishes between\ndistinct and indistinct memories. He says distinct memories are\n“real knowledge” and indistinct memories are not:\n“Memory is always accompanied with the belief of that which we\nremember, as perception is accompanied with the belief of that which\nwe perceive,” which emphasizes the structural similarity between\nthe two faculties. He adds, “in mature years, and in a sound\nstate of mind, every man feels that he must believe what he distinctly\nremembers, though he can give no other reason of his belief, but that\nhe remembers the thing distinctly” (EIP 3.1, 254). This final\nremark gestures at the unaccountability of memory. \n\nReid exemplifies his commitment to the unaccountability of memory\nexperience by placing a first principle about memory in his set of\nfirst principles of contingent truths: “That those things did\nreally happen which I distinctly remember” (EIP 6.5, 474). Reid\nillustrates the cogency of this first principle by describing a\ncourtroom scene in which a defense attorney appeals to global\nskepticism about the reliability of memory in an effort to undermine\nthe devastating testimony of eyewitness about the actions of his\nclient. The argument “would have no other effect upon the judge\nor jury, than to convince them that he was disordered in his\njudgement” (EIP 6.5, 475). The canonization of memory in his set\nof first principles indicates that Reid does not believe that the\nreliability of the faculty of memory can be justified in a\nnon-circular way since any attempt to demonstrate its reliability will\npresuppose its reliability (EIP 6.4, 481; IHM 2.3, 28). \n\nReid attempts to explain why memory is unaccountable: The knowledge which I have of things past by my memory,\nseems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would be of\nthings to come; and I can give no reason why I should have the one and\nnot the other, but that such is the will of my Maker. (EIP 3.2,\n255–6) When I believe that I washed my hands and face this morning, there\nappears no necessity in the truth of this proposition. It might be, or\nit might not be. A man may distinctly conceive it without believing it\nat all. How then do I come to believe it? I remember it\ndistinctly. This is all I can say. (EIP 3.2, 256) \n\nWhen Reid says ‘memory is unaccountable’ he means that we don't know\nwhy distinct memory is always accompanied by belief; we don't know why\nit reliably produces true belief; and we can't established that memory\nbeliefs are true in a non-circular fashion (van Woudenberg\n2004). Further analysis of the epistemology of memory belief is\nprevented by virtue of this unaccountability. This insight about the\nepistemology of memory belief indicates subtlety about the limits of\nanalysis, which has drawn favorable comparisons to Wittgenstein\n(Wolterstorff 2000, ch. 9). \n\nReid's theory of memory informs his theory of personal identity, as\ndoes his three criticisms of Locke's theory of personal\nidentity. First, Reid argues that Locke's account is misleading due to\nconfusion between the concepts of consciousness, memory and personal\nidentity (IHM 1.3, 17; see John Locke, Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding 2.27.24, 345). Reid believes that using\n‘consciousness’ to describe awareness of past events is a misnomer\nbecause we are only conscious, in such cases, of our remembrance of\nthose events. Second, Reid offers his ‘Brave Officer’ thought\nexperiment as a counterexample to Locke's account (EIP 3.6, 276). The\npoint of the thought experiment is to show that Locke's theory does\nnot adequately preserve the transitivity of the personal identity\nrelation. Put in other words, Reid argues that ‘identity’ in Locke's\ntheory of personal identity cannot refer to numerical identity. Third,\nReid follows Bishop Butler in arguing that Locke's justification of\nhis theory of personal identity is circular (EIP 3.6, 277). Reid's\nopposition to Locke (and to Hume's bundle theory) inform Reid's\ncommonsense account of personal identity. \n\nReid affirms that humans have diachronic personal identity, and denies\nHume's so-called ‘bundle theory’. Reid asserts the relation between\nmemory and personal identity in the second of his first principles\ndealing with these issues: “Another first principle is our own\npersonal identity and continued existence, as far back as we remember\nanything distinctly. This we know immediately, and not by\nreasoning. It seems, indeed, to be a part of the testimony of\nmemory” (EIP 6.5, 476). (See 1.1\nCommon Sense and First Principles above for discussion of Reid's\nfirst principles.) \n\nDespite Reid's certainty on this point, he gives few further details\nabout the nature of personal identity and the self. Personal identity\nimplies the “continued existence of that indivisible thing which\nI call myself. Whatever this self may be, it is something which\nthinks, and deliberates, and resolves, and acts, and suffers. I am not\nthought, I am not action, I am not feeling; I am something that\nthinks, and acts, and suffers. ...that self or I, to which they\nbelong, is permanent... Such are the notions that I have of my\npersonal identity” (EIP 3.4, 264). Here Reid echoes Descartes'\noperational definition of the self in Meditation 2. Reid also\nargues that persons are not identical to their bodies (EIP 3.4,\n264). (For more on Reid's theories of memory and personal identity,\nsee Reid on Memory and Personal Identity.) \n\nReid refuses to speculate on the substance of the enduring self,\nhowever. Despite the fact that Reid is a substance dualist who\nbelieves that selves are eternal souls, he does not defend that view\nin the work that he published. In manuscript lectures he describes\nsouls as “beings of a quite different Nature” than\nmaterial bodies and says that the death of the body does not imply the\ndeath of the soul (Animate Creation 617–618). As Reid spells\nout his metaphysics of the self and soul here, his arguments become\ntheological and appeal to God's existence, love and justice. He offers\na moral argument about the necessity of reward and punishment for the\nthesis that the self survives bodily death (Animate Creation\n623). Though survival of the self after bodily death is “of the\nhighest Importance to Mankind yet it must be acknowledged that [all]\nthe Arguments that Philosophy suggests upon this head are not of such\nStrength but that they may leave some doubt even in the Minds of wise\nand thinking Men” (Animate Creation 629). \n\nWhereas Reid wrote an entire book about perception, Inquiry into\nthe Human Mind, his moral theory arrives to us piecemeal in\nthe Active Powers, the Intellectual Powers and\npapers collected as Reid's Practical Ethics, alongside a\nnumber of other concerns about free will, agency, causation, etc. As a\nresult, Reid's readers must do more work to structure his moral\nphilosophy than other components of his system. \n\nReid's moral philosophy is composed of several core theses. These\ninclude: (i) that human beings have an active power that is not\ncausally determined by prior causes, laws of nature, or the\nconjunction of the two, making Reid a libertarian about free will;\n(ii) that moral statements are to be interpreted as propositions with\nsubject/object content, making Reid a cognitivist; (iii) that\ntruth-makers for moral statements are non-natural and independent of\nthe mental states of human beings, meaning that truths in ethics do\nnot generally depend upon the beliefs of humans; and (iv) that moral\nknowledge is produced in a way structurally similar to knowledge of\nthe external world through perception, making Reid a moral sense\ntheorist. Reid's moral philosophy is influenced by his belief in a\nbenevolent, just, Christian God, but Reid doesn't endorse divine\ncommand theory. Reid summarizes his ethics in the familiar terms of\nhis philosophical method by saying that \n\nReid's theory faces common criticisms about the plausibility of moral\nsense theory. The internal structure of Reid's moral philosophy has\nled to criticisms about, for example, the relation between the moral\nsense and moral first principles. It is unclear how the moral faculty\njudges either the truth of universalized moral first principles or the\ntruth of contingent and fallible statements about particular action\ntokens. Reid appears to use the term ‘axiom’ equivocally by referring\nboth to general and particular moral principles (Haakonssen\n1990). However, promising steps to a full understanding of the\ninterpretive problems posed by the logical scope and status of\nparticular and general forms of Reid's first principles have been\nmade, even though they await application to Reid's moral theory. \n\nSeveral issues in the historical and religious context of Reid's\nwriting influence his moral philosophy. First, Reid adopts what, for\nhis time, was a non-traditional approach to moral philosophy insofar\nas he is neither a rationalist, like Samuel Clarke or Richard Price,\nnor a sentimentalist like Hutcheson, Hume or Smith. Reid understood\nwhy it was that the unified front of cognitivists against Hobbesian\negoism had deteriorated into inter-nicene disputes between\nsentimentalism and rationalism. Reid's position inhabits a middle\nground because he rejected assumptions dividing these camps (Davis\n2006, ch. 2). Reid denies that a single faculty generates moral\nmotivation and moral judgment, and denies Locke's division of labor\nbetween sense and reason. Instead Reid argues on behalf of a moral\nsense capable of both motivation and judgment. He rejects rationalist\ngoals to identify and systematize necessarily true and general moral\nprinciples. He repudiates the sentimentalist's wayward account of\nmoral judgment, and its lapse into observer-dependent moral\nproperties. Seen in its context in the history of Early Modern moral\nthought, Reid attempts to draw the best from both groups in order to\navoid the errors of each. \n\nThe second relevant feature of Reid's context concerns the Scottish\nlegal tradition. Reid routinely discusses the competence of witnesses;\nthe ‘final court of appeal’ and first principles; inadmissible\nevidence for moral judgments; burdens of proof; etc. The Scottish\nlegal tradition places an abiding presumption of charity in witnesses\nand places faith in an independent judiciary. This is balanced by a\nnetwork of checks warranting credulity and securing\nimpartiality. These factors, and the competency of judges, provide the\ncontext for Reid's moral first principles, for their use and for their\nepistemological status. For example, criticisms that the moral first\nprinciples do not seem to be universally believed or self-evident must\nbe put in context of the fact that Reid's moral system presupposes, as\ndid the Scottish legal system, that it administers subjects of sound\nminds and common sense (Davis 2006, ch. 3). \n\nReid uses a method in his development of a deontic normative ethics\nsimilar to the method he uses in his development of an epistemology\nand metaphysics. Reid states first principles that serve as\nfoundational commitments. His ethics contain several types of first\nprinciples, and the principles do not take any single form. Amongst\nthem are factual claims about moral reality, moral judgments about\naction types, claims about obligations, etc. Reid says that there are\nthree types of moral principles, but the distinction between these\ntypes is not always clear. \nThe first type is about “virtue in general.” This set\nincludes statements such as: \n\nReid says that these and the other principles “must appear\nself-evident to every man who hath a conscience.” \nThe next set of Reid's moral first principles is about “more\nparticular” aspects of virtue: \n\nCritics have found many of these principles questionable and their\nstatus as self-evident more questionable. Some critics have argued\nthat they are poorly articulated since Reid does not state definitions\nof key terms like “intention of nature.” Others argue that\nthey depend upon the truth of Christianity. For example, Reid's\ndefense of his second Principle 2 includes discussion of the way in\nwhich God has “excellently fitted” our conscience, reason,\nnatural instincts and bodily appetites to the benefit of the\nspecies. \n\nMoral first principles, like other first principles God has placed in\nour natures, require experience in order to appreciate. In this very\nnarrow way Reid compares moral first principles to mathematical axioms\nsince those axioms are “not discerned till men come to a certain\ndegree of maturity of understanding. ... In like manner, our Moral\nJudgment or Conscience, grows to maturity from an imperceptible seed,\nplanted by our Creator” (EAP 5.1, 276–7). So, though moral\nprinciples are self-evident, they are only known to be true by those\nwho have reached an age of maturity. This resonates with the lessons\nReid derives from the requirements upon witnesses and judges in Scots\nlaw. \n\nDespite the fact that he offers a rich set of moral first principles,\nas a moral sense theorist Reid does not intend to systematize a\nnetwork of moral obligations through his first principles. He writes,\n“A system of morals is not like a system of geometry, where the\nsubsequent parts derive their evidence from the preceding, and one\nchain of reasoning is carried on from the beginning;... [instead it]\nresembles more a system of botany, or mineralogy, where the subsequent\nparts depend not for their evidence upon the preceding, and the\narrangement is made to facilitate apprehension and memory, and not\ngive evidence” (EAP 5.2, 281). First principles are given\nin an attempt to classify and systematize our obligations, and are not\ngiven in an attempt to justify and defend them. The actions we are\nobligated to perform are, according to Reid, obvious and, perhaps,\nself-evident. \n\nAs with many of Reid's mature doctrines, his ethics is formed through\ncareful reflection on the theories of his predecessors, which leads\nReid to cognitivism: moral statements express propositions instead of\nexpressing feelings. When I say ‘murder is wrong’ this statement\npredicates a moral property, wrongness, of an action type, murder. In\ncontrast, sentimentalists say that when I say ‘murder is wrong’ I mean\n‘murder makes me feel bad’ or something like that. The historical\nprovenance of cognitivism in Western philosophy, a commonsense\ninterpretation of moral language, and the existence of a God who has\ninfallible knowledge of normative truths are some of the factors that\nlead Reid to cognitivism. Because Reid takes cognitivism as supported\nby these and other factors, he does not explicitly argue for\ncognitivism. \n\nReid takes pains to refute arguments from Hume (and to a lesser\nextent, Smith) for non-cognitivist forms of sentimentalism. The last\nchapter of Active Powers contains Reid's clearest statements\nof his arguments against Hume's sentimentalism. Reid glosses Hume and\nSmith's theory as being that “Moral Approbation or\nDisapprobation is not an Act of the Judgement, which, like all acts of\njudgment, must be true or false, it is only a certain Feeling, which,\nfrom the constitution of human nature, arises upon contemplating\ncertain characters of qualities of mind cooly and impartially”\n(EAP 5.5, 301–2). According to Reid, moral statements are\njudgments, which are affirmations of the truth or falsity of a\nproposition. The target of Reid's attack denies that moral statements\nare judgments in this sense. \n\nReid's best argument against Humean non-cognitivism appears in this\npassage: \n \nSo when one says that “such a man did well and worthily, his\nconduct is highly approvable” (EAP 5.7, 673), one\npredicates of this man's action a virtuous quality. At the heart of\nthis argument is a two-fold commitment to a commonsense understanding\nof thought and language, which we have foreshadowed in earlier remarks\nabout Reid's philosophical method: sentences mean what they purport to\nmean, and persons possess self-knowledge about the meanings of the\nsentences they utter. Notice too that the evidence to which Reid\nappeals here is construed as data in support of an inductive\nconclusion about the meaning of language. When a sentence appears to\nrender a moral judgment, as does “murder is wrong,”\ncommonsense implies that, ceteris paribus, it does render a moral\njudgment. Language is used to express judgments about all manners of\ntopics—about velocities of objects, about historical facts,\nabout mathematical statements—and in these contexts statements\nthat purport to express judgments are interpreted as statements that\nin fact express judgments. Hume's denial that statements purporting to\nexpress ethical judgments in fact express ethical judgments\ncontradicts our assertoric use of statements that purport to express\njudgments. \n \nHaving argued that Reid's theory resembles that of cognitivists,\nunlike other cognitivists Reid crafts extensive and important roles\nfor moral sentiments in his moral philosophy. Reid is not content with\na moral theory that has room only for reasoning and judgment, as in\nSamuel Clarke's theory. Showing his sympathies for the\nsentimentalists, he introduces the concept of moral approbation (and\ndisapprobation), which includes “not only a moral judgment of\nthe action, but some affection, favourable or unfavorable, towards the\nagent, and some feeling in ourselves” (EAP 3.3.7, 180). For\nexample, when I witness someone coming to the aid of a stranger who\nhas fallen down, my moral approbation includes a praiseworthy judgment\nof the actor's character and action and is conjoined with feelings of\napproval and esteem for the actor. He says, “Our moral judgments\nare not like those we form in speculative matters, dry and\nunaffecting, but, from their nature, are necessarily accompanied with\naffections and feelings” (EAP 3.3.7, 180). This\ncrystallizes Reid's disagreement with Hume in the previous\nparagraph. Though moral judgments cannot be analyzed merely as the\nexpression of a sentiment, moral judgments take affective experiences\nas an ingredient. \n\nThe structure of a Reidian moral judgment resembles the structure of a\nReidian perceptual judgment, which is one of several important points\nof contact between his moral philosophy and his theory of\nperception. Reid attests to the depth and importance of these\nconnections (EAP 3.3.6). One fundamental implication of this\nstructural similarity reconfirms the point of the section about moral\njudgment above, namely, moral judgment is assertoric and not merely\naffective. Consider one's judgment about the person who assists the\nstranger who has fallen down. I do not directly perceive the agent's\ncharacter, though I do make a judgment about it. I directly perceive\nthe agent's action, and this functions as a sign that informs me about\nthe agent's character. Reid's theory of moral judgment shares so much\nstructure with his theory of perception\n(see 3. Perception and Knowledge of the World)\nthat many have written of Reid's ‘theory of moral perception’. \n \nThe moral sense operates in a fashion structurally similar to\nperception, but with an important difference. Moral feelings do not\noccupy a role parallel with sensations. Though sensations ‘suggest’\nperceptual judgments, moral feelings do not suggest moral\njudgments. Moral judgments are the basis of moral\nfeelings (Lehrer 1989, 225). Our moral conceptions,\nthough, are based upon moral feelings. Reid says, “Our first\nmoral conceptions are probably got by attending cooly to the conduct\nof others, and observing what moves our approbation, what our\nindignation. These sentiments spring from our moral faculty as\nnaturally as the sensations of sweet and bitter from the faculty of\ntaste” (EAP 5.2, 279). \n\nSince moral perceptions operate in the way our visual perceptions\noperate, Reid is able to claim that we can morally perceive things\nlike duty, even though duty, like visible figure, is a relational\nproperty. He says that “Duty, or Moral Obligation” is\nstrictly speaking neither a quality of an action nor a quality of an\nagent “but a certain relation between the one and the\nother. ... So that, if we seek the place of a moral obligation among\nthe categories, it belongs to the category of relation”\n(EAP 3.3.5, 173). Though the object of my tactile perceptions is\na primary quality in a mind independent object, the object of my\nperception of a visible figure is a relation between the\nmind-independent object and my eyes. In this limited way, the\nperception of duty resembles the perception of visible\nfigures. Importantly, though, visible figures are themselves\nmind-independent, in just the way that duty is also\nmind-independent. Were someone else's eyes placed in the same location\nas mine are, she too would visually perceive just the visible figure I\nperceived. This intersubjectivity is important for grounding Reid's\nclaims about the perception of duty. \n\nIn his moral theory Reid attempts to draw from the rationalist\ntradition of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price and from the\nsentimentalist tradition of David Hume and Adam Smith. As a result,\nhis conception of the relationship between moral motivation and moral\naction is complex and difficult to unify. Motives appear to Reid to be\nboth the ends for which we act, and the mental states that prompt our\nactive behavior (Cuneo 2011). \n\nIn the first of the two passages below, both drawn from Active\nPowers, Reid implies that moral judgments about an action are not\nnecessarily connected to any moral motivation while in the second he\nasserts that moral judgments about an action are necessarily connected\nto moral motivation: A judge, from a regard to justice, and to the duty of his\noffice, dooms a criminal to die, while, from humanity or particular\naffection, he desires that he should live... The determination of the\nmind may be, not to do what we desire to do. (EAP\n2.1, 49) I am very apt to think, with Dr Price, that, in intelligent beings,\nthe desire of what is good, and aversion to what is ill, is\nnecessarily connected with the intelligent nature; and that it is a\ncontradiction to suppose such a being to have the notion of good\nwithout the desire of it, or the notion of ill without aversion to\nit. (EAP 3.3.2, 156) \n\nOne means by which to interpret these passages is through the lens of\na teleological and theistic account of moral perception (Cuneo\n2002). On this model, when we are functioning properly in the\nenvironments for which God designed us, then moral judgments are\naccompanied by moral motivations to act. However, this connection will\nfail in those who are damaged or poorly designed. For example,\npsychopaths suffer impairment in emotional response. Psychopaths can\nknow certain of their behaviors are outside standard morality and yet\nnot be motivated to alter their behavior. This, and the ‘proper\nfunction’ interpretation of the relation between moral judgment and\nmoral motivation, is suggested in Reid's remark about the\ndepraved: \n\nReid's account of moral motivation exemplifies his philosophical style\nin general, which eschews a priori speculation, the crafting of\nuniversal generalizations, and necessary and sufficient conditions in\nfavor of keeping close to his observations of others and his\nintrospection about himself. In the present context, Reid's account of\nmoral motivation does not endorse any universal generalizations about\nwhat does and does not motivate us to moral action. What this\nsacrifices in philosophical clarity it, perhaps, gains in its ability\nto respond to real life cases. (For more on Reid's moral philosophy,\nsee\n Reid's Ethics.) \n\nReid's aesthetics is composed of two core theses: that a work, to be\nan artwork, must express the artist's sentiments, and that aesthetic\nproperties, like beauty and sublimity, are strictly speaking\nproperties of the mind of the artist and not properties of material\nobjects. Reid's mature aesthetics exemplifies a remarkable degree of\nsophistication for its time period. First, he possesses a clear\nconcept of the fine arts and offers his readers a taxonomy of them\n(Kivy 2004). Second, Reid discusses the formal or structural\nproperties of artworks in virtue of which they can be appraised in\naesthetic terms. Third, Reid has a theoretical framework that unifies\nhis concept of the fine arts and his account of how formal properties\nof objects make those objects works of art: Reid advocates an\nexpression theory of art, arguably the first Western philosopher to do\nso. \n \nBefore explaining Reid's two primary aesthetic theses, first a word\nabout the sources of Reid's aesthetics. The principal sources of our\nknowledge of Reid's aesthetics are manuscripts that Reid used to teach\nhis advanced course on ‘The culture of the mind’ at Glasgow. These\nmanuscripts are narrow in scope and deal mostly with rhetoric. They\nhave been subsequently collected, edited and published in the\nEdinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid as Thomas Reid on Logic, Rhetoric\nand The Fine Arts (Reid 2004). (Though precise dating of these\nmanuscripts is impossible, we know they predate Intellectual\nPowers (1785) and Active Powers (1788).) In addition to\nthis source, Reid's Glasgow lectures on fine arts were transcribed by\na student, and were subsequently edited and published as Lectures\non the Fine Arts (Reid 1973). These two sources overlap\nconsiderably, and we draw from both, with the caveat that Thomas\nReid on Logic, Rhetoric and The Fine Arts is composed of\nmanuscripts not in Reid's own hand. Lastly, Reid discusses art at\nvarious points in his major works. \n\nIn both Logic, Rhetoric and the Fine Arts and Fine\nArts, Reid shows a commitment to the importance of emotion and of\nexpression in understanding art and artworks. He writes,\n“Expression is the capital thing in all Compositions of\nMusic” (Logic, Rhetoric and the Fine Arts 288) but\ntextual evidence for an expression theory in those works is\nequivocal compared with Reid's remarks in EIP and in his\ncorrespondence. In lecture notes Reid appears partially to endorse\nexpression theory and partially to endorse emotional arousal\ntheory. Emotional arousal theories of art are closely related to\nexpression theories since both appeal to emotion as an essential\nfeature of an artwork's aesthetic quality, but they differ on a\ncrucial point. Emotional arousal theories explain the aesthetic\nquality of an artwork in terms of the way an artwork causes the\nexpression or experience of emotion in the viewer or listener, and not\n(as on expression theory) in terms of the way in which an artwork's\naesthetic qualities are caused by the artist's representation of his\nor her emotion in qualities of the artwork. In Reid's discussion\nin Lectures on the Fine Arts he appears to combine both\ntheories to suggest that the emotion expressed by the artist must also\nbe the same emotion aroused in the viewer or listener. The playwright\nintroduces “a sign or expression of the passions, & when\nthis is accomplished, it affects us and causes the same passion in\nus...” (Lectures on the Fine Arts 51). In his mature,\npublished work, advocacy of the emotional arousal theory\ndiminishes. \n\nIn his taxonomy of the fine arts, Reid includes: literature, drama,\npainting, sculpture, architecture and wordless music. The inclusion of\nwordless music was a novelty for the time (EIP 7.4, 605). Beauty\nrepresented through the harmony and melody of music arises because of\nthe emotion expressed by the harmony and melody. Often harmony and\nmelody represent emotions by representing the nature of a\nconversation. Though obvious in some music with words and in vocal\nmusic, even the beauty of wordless music can be explained in part in\nthis way: \n\nReid describes the way melody represents the human voice's expression\nof sentiment as a form of ‘imitation.’ \n\nPainting and sculpture follow the same pattern of analysis. In\nthe Inquiry Reid says that painting is a representational art\nand that when a painting “happily expresses a passion by its\nproper signs, every one understands the meaning of these signs,\nwithout art, and without reflection” (IHM 6.8, 102). Dominant\nspecies of painting include portraiture and landscape both of which\nare well suited to express emotion through visual\nrepresentations. Naturally Reid places importance on the depiction of\nthe “passion & dispositions of men in the attitudes and\ncountenances” (Lectures on the Fine Arts 50) in\npainting and sculpture. Reid holds that the “chief part”\nof the beauty of paintings is their representation of the expression\nof emotions. Reid's aesthetics of poetry closely resembles his\naesthetics of music and painting (Lectures on the Fine Arts\n51). \n\nSeveral philosophical issues arise from the discussion thus\nfar. First, if we interpret Reid's discussion of aesthetics\ndevelopmentally and we therefore discount certain commitments\nin Lectures that are not repeated in Intellectual\nPowers, then Reid skirts some traditionally troublesome problems\nfor expression theories of art. On this interpretation, Reid's mature\ntheory does not include a commitment to the claim that it is essential\nfor something to be a work of art that the artwork must be imbued with\nan emotion by the artist that the artwork also arouses in the viewer\nor listener. Second, oddly for an expressivist, Reid rarely describes\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive process whereby an artist creates an\nartwork (Gallie 1998, 178). But if an artwork's aesthetic properties\nare those properties that have been imbued in it in part through the\nartist's experience of emotion, presumably the nature of the creative\nprocess bears heavily on expression theories of art. \n\nReid's account of what makes a work of art beautiful or sublime is\nwidely regarded as the most distinctive feature of Reid's\naesthetics. In his correspondence, he writes, “I am proud to\nthink that I first, in clear and explicit terms, and in the cool blood\nof a philosopher, maintained that all the beauty and sublimity of\nobjects of sense is derived from the expression they exhibit of things\nintellectual, which alone have original beauty” (Letter to\nArchibald Alison, in Correspondence 209). (In characteristic\nfashion, the next sentence reads: “But in this I may deceive\nmyself, & cannot claim to be held an impartial judge”\n(Correspondence 209).) Material objects are not by nature\nbeautiful or sublime, but are only made so by the infusion of mental\nstates. The beauty in material objects derives from mental and\nintellectual qualities that “excite our esteem”\n(Lectures on the Fine Arts 41–2; see EIP 8.3, 590). To be\nclear, brushstrokes and melodies, clay forms and the use of poetic\nmeter, and the (broadly) physical works of which they are a part are\nnot beautiful. Rather, these are signs, to the admirer, of the beauty,\ndepth, or grandeur of the mental states in the artist that they\nsuggest. In the case of Homer's Illiad, Reid says, “its\nsublimity was really in the mind of HOMER. He conceived great\ncharacters, great actions, and great events, in a manner suitable to\ntheir nature, and with those emotions which they are naturally fitted\nto produce... The grandeur of his thoughts is reflected to our eye by\nhis work, and therefore it is justly called a grand work” (EIP\n8.3, 587). \n\nThis idea has been met with criticism by Reid's commentators. This\nseems absurd since it follows that Homer's Illiad is not\nitself beautiful or sublime (Gallie 1998). But there are resources\nwithin the expressive theory to address this criticism with some\nsuccess. The best way to understand Reid's theory is that the beauty\nof the artwork rests in the manner of its expression and not in what\nit expresses (Kivy 2004, 284–5). Perhaps, though an expressivist\ntheory can be absolved of the problem, Reid's own version of it cannot\nbe. The Illiad remains distinct from its manner of\nexpression, and it is counterintuitive to say that the Illiad\nitself is not beautiful. \n\nReid does not distinguish between the Illiad qua written text\nand qua oral poetry; doing so informs debate both about the manner of\nexpression of the work and about the sublimity of the mental states\nthat gave it rise. By switching from Reid's example of literature to\nmusic we can take account of something like this distinction and\ntherefore better respond to the objection under discussion. In the\ncase of musical performance, the manner of expression and the content\nof what is expressed are distinct: the manner of a performance of a\nsymphony may differ substantially when led by two different\nconductors. In each case it is distinct from the symphony itself (so\nas long as the symphony is not identical to the set of its\nperformances). We are inclined to say that the performance of a\nsymphony is beautiful, and we are not inclined to say that ‘the\nsymphony itself’ is beautiful. This comports well with Reid's\ntheory. This suggestion requires assumptions about the ontology of\nartworks; Reid does not discuss these matters at any length. \n\nThis discussion leads to a final consideration of Reid's\naesthetics—the ontology of aesthetic qualities. Reid says that\nbeauty “is derived” from the expression of mental events,\nbut Reid says little about the ontology of beauty. Commentators have\ngravitated to this particular issue, but the results of this research\nare mixed. Four views predominate, and each can be characterized in\nterms of the relations espoused between aesthetic qualities and Reid's\nfinely grained distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities. (i) Aesthetic qualities are secondary qualities, and that\nReid mistakenly compares aesthetic qualities to primary qualities\n(Kivy 1970). Beauty, on this interpretation, is in the mind. But it is\nnot in the mind—or eye—of the beholder. Rather, beauty is\nin the mind of the artist, and the artwork provides a sign of the\nmental states of the artist. (ii) Aesthetic qualities are primary\nqualities and secondary qualities, which suggests that this feature of\nReid's aesthetics is incoherent (Gracyk 1987). (iii) Aesthetic\nqualities are neither primary nor secondary qualities, which also\nposes serious problems for Reid's aesthetics (Nauckhoff 1994). (iv)\nAesthetic qualities bear features of both secondary and primary\nqualities (Benbaji 2000). Aesthetic qualities are like secondary\nqualities because both are dispositional, while they are like primary\nqualities because our judgments about them are incorrigible. \n\nThough (i)-(iv) are framed in terms of Reid's distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities, none of these four major positions\nbegins from a considered account of Reid's views on the perceptual and\nepistemological status of qualities. Consider (ii). This\ncharacterization of aesthetic qualities is not itself reason to\ndismiss Reid's ontology of aesthetic qualities as incoherent. This is\nbecause one interesting feature of Reid's distinctions between primary\nand secondary qualities is that what is a primary quality for one\nperson may be a secondary quality for another. Reid's aesthetics is an\nunder-explored area ripe for further research. \n\nReid formed his philosophy of religion under the influence of his\ndivinity degree received from Marischal College. Following this he was\nlicensed to preach by the presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil in 1731, and\nbecame an ordained minister to New Machar, Aberdeenshire, in 1737. His\nintellectual influences included Samuel Clark, Joseph Butler, and his\nteachers and colleagues in Aberdeen, including George Turnbull. Reid,\nlike Butler, crafted analogical arguments on behalf of the faith, and\nhe states, without much novelty, a design argument and a cosmological\nargument for God's existence. Reid's arguments for God's existence are\nNewtonian in the sense that limitations of physics and Newtonian\nstrictures about attributions of causes prevent Reid from advocating\narguments for God's existence from physics (Callergård\n2010). Reid's prescient, long-lasting contribution to the history of\nphilosophy of religion concerns the way he shifts his emphasis as\napologist from proving God's existence onto the task of showing that\nit is rational for one to believe in God's existence. On this point\nReid is an innovator and has many contemporary followers. As a\ntestament to this, leading defenders of Christian belief within the\nAnglo-American philosophical tradition do not merely pay homage to\nReid's trailblazing effort to focus upon and articulate the conditions\nunder which religious belief is made rational. They also make\nextensive use of and further develop a number of his arguments and\nmaneuvers in the epistemology of religious belief. \n\nReid's abiding confidence in his religious belief meant that\nhis published work on traditional issues in the philosophy of\nreligion, such as God's nature and arguments for God's\nexistence, is minimal. In his lectures and unpublished work,\nhowever, he vigorously attacks Hume, atheists and their\narguments with surprising vitriol. The fact that Reid does not\nthoroughly address canonical issues in philosophy of religion\nin the context of his published work, despite the personal and\nprofessional importance of his religious commitments, is a\nconundrum. The principal source for Reid's philosophy of\nreligion outside his published works are sets of student\nnotes—now, a total of four transcripts—from Reid's\nlectures on natural theology at Glasgow in the years\n1763–1780. One set has been published as Thomas Reid's\n‘Lectures on Natural Theology’ (Reid 1981,\nabbreviated 'Natural Theology' below). This is not a\ndefinitive source of Reid's own views, but given pedagogical\nconventions of the time, and cross-references of materials in\nthe Natural Theology with materials elsewhere in\nReid's corpus, we can draw reliable inferences about Reid's\nphilosophy of religion from them. In this subsection we first\ndiscuss the conundrum just mentioned, then treat Reid's novel\nepistemology of religious belief, and then briefly discuss\ntraditional issues in philosophy of religion. \n\nReid confesses that his philosophy of mind and theory of\nperception are but a response to the theories of David Hume\n(Correspondence 210–1). Hume offers one of the most\nthorough and compelling philosophical indictments of religion\npenned in English. Yet Reid rarely isolates and discusses\nHume's anti-religious arguments. Furthermore,\nHume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion was\npublished in 1779 while Reid was lecturing on natural theology\nand long before Reid would publish his two sets\nof Essays. (Note that the Baird notes—the set\nused to prepare Natural Theology—were taken\nfrom lectures dating between February 11, 1780 to March 3rd,\n1780.) But this book had little discernible influence upon\nReid's thinking. Why did Reid mostly ignore Hume's great\nchallenges to rational belief in God? \n\nThere is no persuasive answer to this question, though several\nconverging considerations present themselves. One response is\nthat Hume's work in the philosophy of religion was not, in\nReid's opinion, deserving of a response. A second is that Reid\nwas aware that he lacked compelling arguments with which to\nrebut Hume's criticisms, whether because he modestly appraised\nhis counter-arguments, or because counter-arguments\ncirculating in the milieu were satisfactory. A third is that\nthe severe social climate in the Scotland of Reid's day\nobviated the need for Reid's response to Hume. Fourth, since\nReid's principal aims in philosophy of religion were to move\nthe debate from metaphysics to epistemology, perhaps Reid's\nsilence on many of Hume's criticisms is pointed. \n\nAbove we explained several features of Reid's epistemology and his\nfoundationalism relevant for understanding his analysis of the\nrationality of belief in God. Reid's case on behalf of the rationality\nof belief in God follows from his critique of Cartesian and Humean\nfoundationalism, which required foundational beliefs to be justified\nby reasoning. According to Reid, foundational beliefs do not require\nproof of their own through argumentation. He writes, “Their\nevidence is not demonstrative, but intuitive. They require not proof,\nbut to be placed in the proper point of view” (EIP 1.2,\n42). Reason is not the “only judge of truth” (IHM 6.20,\n169). Besides, human reason itself is fallible (EIP 2.22,\n244–5). Reason is not necessary for epistemic justification, a fact\nthat situates Reid's theory of empirical knowledge in the externalist\ncamp.  \n\nWhile this opens the way to a form of non-inferential,\nrational belief in God, no such claim appears among Reid's\nFirst Principles of contingent or necessary truths. Indeed,\nbelief in God possesses few of the features associated with\nReidian First Principles. Denying God's existence is not\nabsurd, belief in God does not have “consent of ages and\nnations”, and it is not held independently of education\nand acculturation (see EIP 6.4, 463–467). Yet clearly Reid\nholds that belief in God appears to be rational (not a word\nthat Reid deploys as a term of art) without inference. He\nbases his claim that belief in God is rational (again, not a\nterm Reid uses) upon a model familiar from his theory of the\nformation of perceptual beliefs (see Nichols &\nCallergård 2011). \n\nReid's treatment of arguments for God's existence is for the most part\nunoriginal, and freely makes use of ideas of many previous Christian\nthinkers along this well-worn trail. Reid's cosmological argument\nstems from Samuel Clarke's and features a priori justification of the\nprinciple, “That whatever begins to exist, must have a cause\nwhich produced it” (EIP 6.6, 497). Reid defends this against a\nfew attacks associated with Hume. For example, if Hume's skepticism\nabout causation undermines this principle, Reid says that many\neveryday inferences would become unjustified (EIP 6.6, 497–8). Reid\nuses this principle in a cosmological argument, but only as recorded\nin his lecture notes (Natural Theology 66–7), which leaves\nmuch to be desired. Every being must be either contingent or\nnecessary. “We call that contingent which either might\nor might not be and that necessary which must be. Whatever\neither might or might not be depends on the will of some agent with\npower to bring it to pass or not...” (Natural Theology\n66). Reid is then recorded to argue that to suggest that the\n“Supreme Being” exists contingently “evidently would\nbe absurd” (Natural Theology 66). He does not here\ndiscuss the unintelligibility of a one-directional infinite series of\ncontingent causes or of a circular series of contingent causes. \n \nReid gives the design argument more discussion (EIP 6.6,\n508–9). One first principle of necessary truth is “that\ndesign, and intelligence in the cause, may be inferred, with\ncertainty, from marks or signs of it in the effect” (EIP\n6.6, 503). This is an unusual principle to denominate as a\nnecessary “metaphysical” truth because it is an\nepistemic thesis about what it is permissible for one to\ninfer. He labors to show that this is a necessary first\nprinciple by saying, for example, that it is “too\nuniversal to be the effect of reasoning” (EIP 6.6,\n504). The first necessary principle serves as an opening\npremise in the argument, to which Reid adds some empirical\ndata. The second premise says, “That there are in fact\nthe clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of\nNature” (EIP 6.6, 509). From these two premises Reid\nconcludes “that the works of Nature are the effects of a\nwise and intelligent cause” (EIP 6.6, 510).  \n\nTo the ‘single-case’ objection often credited to Hume, that\nthe design argument is not cogent since this is the only\nuniverse of which we are aware, Reid replies that the\nobjection “is build on the supposition, that our\ninferring design from the strongest marks of it, is entirely\nowing to our past experience of having always found these two\nthings conjoined” (EIP 6.6, 511). But if Hume's\ncriticism does pose a problem for the design inference, it\nalso undermines our belief in other minds. This is because\nReid also does not witness the intelligence of another person\nbringing about some effect (EIP 6.6, 511). \n\nThe first principle of necessary truth licensing inferences\nfrom signs of intelligence to intelligence pairs with another\nthat states that the belief in other minds is also a first\nprinciple (EIP 6.5, 484). Reid knows well how these two work\ntogether (EIP 6.5, 511–12) and as a result he unambiguously\nforeshadows the epistemological parity argument to be found in\nPlantinga's God and Other Minds (1990). \n\nAs a parish minister, a philosopher, and someone with extensive\ntheological training—as well as a father who had only one of six\nchildren survive him—Reid no doubt reflected long and hard about\npain and suffering, and their relationship to God. But Reid writes\nlittle about the problem of evil. In Natural Theology, in\nwhat is labeled “Lect. 84th”, he treats the subject\ndirectly and in less than two thousand words. \n\nNotes to Reid's lectures distinguish between three forms of evil:\n“1. the evils of imperfection, 2. Evil which they call natural\nEvil, 3. Moral evil” (Natural Theology\n101). The first refers to the fact that creatures could have been\ngiven greater degrees of perfection. The second form is\n“suffering & pain which we see endured by beings in the\nUniverse.” The third refers to the “violation of the laws\nof Virtue by moral & reasonable agents” (Natural\nTheology 101). \n \nThe traditional problem of evil focuses on the second definition of\n‘evil’. To this Reid offers a soul-making theodicy, and couples it\nwith an emphasis on human epistemic limits. First, “it is by\nnatural evil that men are trained unto wisdom & prudence in their\nconduct.” Then he adds that “we are not competent judges\n& cannot possibly determine” whether these virtues could\nhave been achieved in humankind without the natural evil (and the\ndegree of natural evil) we witness in our world (Natural\nTheology 101). The addition of this second epistemic component\ngives rise to an internal tension. Reid juxtaposes this affirmation of\nignorance with substantive epistemic claims, for example, that\n“from the present constitution of things we see they [natural\nevils] are necessary to our acquiring any prudence or wisdom...”\n(Natural Theology 101–102). Reid presents these comments as\nanswering the problem, but the Baird notes do not Reid's caveats or\nReid's attempt to justify the necessities to which he refers. \n \nThe cornerstone of Reid's reply to the third form of evil—moral\nevil—is human freedom. Lectures on Natural Theology\ndoes not revisit his theory of human freedom and agency, but these\nissues are discussed thoroughly in Active Powers. He applies\nthis theory of freedom to moral evil in order to conclude that\n“all moral evil then is not properly the doing of God but of\nmen, who by abusing their power are liable to misery & are then\njustly punished for their misconduct” (Natural Theology\n103). \n \nTo conclude, Reid's two substantive contributions to the subsequent\ndevelopment of philosophy of religion are indirect. First, regarding\nGod's existence, Reid changes the field of play from metaphysics and\nproofs to epistemology and rationality. Second, Reid's development of\nan agent-causal account of freedom offered a foundation for responding\nto the problem of moral evil."}]
