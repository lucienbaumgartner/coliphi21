The very strongly hedged claim,\nthat pleasure is not an episode since it cannot be independently\nclocked and one cannot be pleased quickly (pp. 58–60), seems to\ndraw a conclusion that pleasure is not an occurrent state in part from\nAristotelian premises that do not, at least obviously, support it. The\nrelevant Aristotelian view is that pleasure is not a process but an\nactivity that, like seeing, is complete in each of its (experiential?)\nmoments. E.g., at any moment of seeing or enjoying one can truly say\nthat one has already seen or enjoyed oneself, while it is not\ngenerally true that when one is building a house that one has already\nbuilt it (e.g., NE 1174a13–b14). It has not, apparently, been\nsimilarly argued on such grounds that there are no experiential\nepisodes of seeing (an example of Aristotle’s which he sees as\nparallel to pleasure) or of tasting, or that a dispositionalist rather\nthan an occurent state account of these is therefore true, although\nthese would seem equally to follow.

Cf. Zajonc 2000, pp.\n47–48; Berridge and Winkielman 2003, pp. 185–86; Berridge\n2002. Some phenomena Zajonc is concerned with seem to be only\nnonconscious causation, or conditioning, of future emotional memory or\nreactions.

Beyond this, it may be necessary to distinguish\ndifferent uses of “nonconscious emotion”, corresponding to\ndistinctions between phenomenal and cognitive concepts of\nconsciousness made, for example, in Block 1995 and 2002.
